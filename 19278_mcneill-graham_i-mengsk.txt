i mengsk graham mcneill beginnings valerian heard the knock at the door but ignored it concentrating instead on the tawny port that swirled in the expensive cutcrystal glass held in one manicured hand the knock came again more insistent this time and the tone and impatience of the sound told valerian mengsk who was on the other side of the door without his having to answer it he smiled as he sipped his drink the gesture out of place on his handsome features this day or any other day recently for that matter valerian settled into the deep leather upholstery of the chair enjoying the heat of the rooms coal fire and the warmth of the drink in his belly precious little else had given him enjoyment these last months for they had been thankless and painfilled the pain had not been his at least not physically but it had been hard watching his mother suffer as the wasting sickness melted the flesh from her bones and unraveled her mind valerian stared into his glass of port a fine blend with a rich fulsome flavor that lingered long on the palate and was the perfect accompaniment to the wildfowl being served to the guests awaiting him in the main chamber of his home his home the words still felt unusual the fit not yet settled upon him valerian looked up from his drink and cast his eyes around the room taking in every exquisite detail the fine mahogany paneling that concealed sophisticated communications arrays and elaborate countermeasures against electronic eavesdropping the silken wall hangings the goldframed portraits and the tasteful uplighters that bathed the highceilinged room in a warm restful illumination but pride of place on the walls was reserved for the many weapons of valerians collection that hung between the more archaic decorations a longbladed falx rested on silver hooks curved swords hung by their quillons and a multitude of punch daggers and bizarre circular weapons with blades protruding from leather handgrips were set on concealed hooks glass cases against the walls contained antique pistols of wood with gold inlay and longbarreled muskets with battery packs fitted to their skeleton stocks a marble surround contained the crackling fire and a grainy holo plate sat upon the mantel it shimmered with the ghostly image of a woman with wistful eyes from which valerian studiously kept his gaze averted he stared into the fire and sipped his port as the door opened behind him only one person would dare enter the chambers of valerian mengsk without invitation hello father said valerian a shadow fell across him and valerian looked up and saw his fathers stern patrician features staring down at him though he had seen the face of arcturus mengsk a thousand times in holographic form his fathers sheer physical presence had a powerful charisma that no mere technology could capture arcturus was a big man broad of shoulder and thick of waist with hair that had once been dark and lustrous but was now streaked with silver his beard contained more white than black and where age might weary other men it had only enhanced the natural gravitas and dignity with which arcturus had already been generously endowed his fathers black frock coat similar to the one worn by his son did nothing to disguise his bulk and only emphasized his power gold fragging edged the coat and wide bronze epaulettes framed his shoulders a baskethilted sword and magnificently tooled pistol hung from his belt but valerian knew it had been many years since his father had had cause to draw either of these weapons in anger i knocked said arcturus didnt you hear me i heard you said valerian nodding then why didnt you answer the door i didnt think youd need an invitation father replied valerian you are the emperor arent you since when does an emperor wait on the pleasure of others i may be the emperor valerian but you are my son i am that agreed valerian now that it suits you you are angry said arcturus thats understandable i suppose its only natural for people to behave irrationally over these kinds of things these kinds of things snapped valerian rising from his chair and hurling his glass of port into the fire show a bit of damned respect the glass shattered and the fire roared as the alcohol burned ruby red in the flames have you no feelings for others cried valerian no sooner had the words left his mouth than he realized what hed said and to whom hed said it valerian laughed what am i saying of course you dont arcturus remained unmoved by valerians outburst and simply laced his hands behind his back that was a waste of good port he said and a nice glass if im any judge i thought i had taught you better than to show anger especially when it serves no purpose valerian took a deep breath and turned away from his father making his way to a drinks cabinet set into the wall his precious malts and ports were protected from the attentions of poisoners by reflective glass sheathed in an impenetrable energy field the installation of which had been at the behest of his father since anyone who knew anything of the mengsk dynasty would know of their love for quality liquors valerian paused for a moment and studied his reflection as he reached for the recessed brass button that would disengage the security field valerians blond hair spilled around a face that was handsome to the point of beautiful his features were unmistakably his fathers but where arcturus wore his hard edges plainly valerians were softened by the influence of his mothers genes full lips and wide stormcloud eyes that could charm the birds from the trees sat within a face of porcelainsmooth skin and noble features at twentyone he was a beautiful young man and he knew it though he was careful to keep that knowledge hidden beneath a veneer of modesty which of course only served to heighten his appeal to the opposite sex he pressed his thumb against the button the genereader on its surface comparing his dna with the hourly updated records held within the buildings mainframe though the technologies of the modern world were commonplace to him valerian detested the idea of function overwhelming form a slight ripple in the air was the only sign of the protective fields disengaging valerian opened the glass door to pour two fresh drinks selecting another tawny port for himself and an expensive ruby vintage for his father valerian returned to the fire where his father had taken one of the two chairs his baskethilted sword sat propped up against the armrest arcturus nodded appreciatively as valerian handed him the glass calmer now asked his father yes said valerian good it does not become a mengsk to openly display his thoughts no no said arcturus when men think they know you they cease to fear you what if i do not want to be feared asked valerian sweeping his coattails beneath his rump and sitting opposite his father you would rather be loved countered arcturus sipping his port cant one be both no said arcturus and before you ask it is always better to be feared than loved well youd know replied valerian arcturus laughed but there was no warmth to the sound i am your father valerian and cheap gibes will not change that i know you do not love me as a father ought to be loved but i care little for that however if you are to succeed me you will need to be tougher and if i do not want to succeed you irrelevant snapped arcturus you are a mengsk who else is there anger touched valerian even a mengsk you called a bookish effeminale weakling arcturus waved a dismissive hand words spoken in haste many years ago he said you have proved me wrong so move on scoring points over me does you no credit valerian covered his irritation at his fathers stoicism by drinking some port letting the aromatic liquid sit in his gullet a while before swallowing he watched as arcturus used the pause to look around the room at the weapons hanging from the walls the one point of common ground upon which they could converse without the threat of argument or resentment rearing its ugly head you have made a fine home here son said arcturus apropos of nothing home said valerian i dont know what that word means seeing the puzzlement in his fathers eyes valerian continued until a few months ago home was simply where we settled until we had to move on from one crumbling umojan moon to another or one of the few orbitals the ued or the zerg hadnt destroyed you must know the feeling surely i do conceded arcturus though id forgotten it for a long time home was the hyperion but then with all that happened with jim what about korhal iv said valerian not wishing to endure another tirade regarding the treachery of jim raynor over the last few years valerian had thrilled to the adventures of jim raynor and had secretly admired the man as the thorn in his fathers side the former marshal had proved to be arcturus shook his head quickly masking his irritation at the interruption vast areas of the planet are habitable again and we have rebuilt much of what was destroyed but even i dont have the power to undo in so short a time the damage done by the confederacy korhal will be great again i have no doubt but it will never be what it once was i suppose not agreed valerian i should have liked to see korhal before the attack ah yes you would have liked it i think said arcturus the palatine forum the golden library the martial field the summer villa yes you would have liked it valerian leaned forward i would like to learn of korhal he said from someone who was there i mean not dry facts from a digitome or holocine but the real thing from someone who walked its surface and breathed its air arcturus smiled and nodded as though he had expected such a request very well valerian i will tell you of korhal what i know of it and what i have pieced together over the years but ill tell you more than that if youve the wit to hear it said arcturus standing and draining the last of his port what do you mean asked valerian the story of korhal is the story of your grandfather and what it means to be a mengsk korhal was the forge in which our dynasty was hammered into shape raw and bloody upon the anvil of history valerian fell his heart quicken yes thats what i want arcturus nodded toward the woman in the holographic plate upon the mantelpiece and ill tell you of your mother my mother said valerian instantly defensive yes said arcturus making his way toward the door but first we have to bury her book angus years earlier chapter the villa was dark its occupants asleep from the outside it looked peaceful and quiet vulnerable he knew of course that it was not laser trips surrounded the villa in an interconnected web motion sensors swept the high marble wall that surrounded it and tremor alarms were set into the floors and walls around every opening it wasnt the most expensive security system money could buy but it wasnt far off to penetrate the mengsk summer villa a whitewalled compound perched on a headland of white cliffs overlooking the dark waters of the ocean would be no easy feat and the silent figure took his time as he approached the farthest edge of the systems detection envelope the scanner attached to his belt used by prospectors of the confederate exploration corps was a modified geosurvey unit a harmonic detector set to read the electromagnetic returns of vespene gas it had been a simple matter to adjust the sensors to pick up the security lasers and link its display to the goggles he wore over his young handsome face for such a device to work you had to know the frequency of the lasers and the exact mineral composition of the crystals that produced them all of which had been simplicity itself to obtain from one of the techs who had installed the system only the previous summer the goggles bleached everything of color the midnight blue of the sky was rendered a flat rust color the mountains to the north a deep bronze and the sea a shimmering crimson like an ocean of blood the walls of the villa were dark to him the lasers and sensor returns gleaming like cords of silver strung like a hunters trip wires too easy he whispered then inwardly chided himself for the unnecessary words the figure dropped to his belly and slithered around the northern side of the villa avoiding the road that ran all the way to styrling and keeping to the tall grass that waved in the brisk winds blown in off the sea the net of lasers moved regularly but preprogrammed algorithms in the survey unit meant that by the time they shifted he was already in a patch of dead ground of course no algorithm was completely perfect and there was always a chance that he would be detected but he was confident in his abilities and wasnt worried about failure in truth the prospect of failing was something that hadnt occurred to him failure was something that happened to other people not to him he was good at what he did and knew it it gave him a confidence that reached out to others and made it all the easier to ensure he always got what he wanted well almost always he eased ever closer to the villa keeping his movements slow and unhurried he knew that to rush things would be to invite disaster and it took him nearly two hours to come within six meters of the wall passive infrared motion sensors were built into the eaves of the wall but these were old systems installed nearly a decade ago and were about as sophisticated as those youd find protecting some fringe world magistrate it was most assuredly not what youd expect to find protecting the summer villa of one of korhals most renowned senators and his family the figure was rendered invisible to these sensors by the coolant systems of the black formfitting bodysuit he wore he had fashioned it in secret from the inner lining of a hostileenvironment suit used by miners when prospecting hightemperature sites and he smiled as he rose to his feet and the beams swept over him without detecting him once again the laser net shifted and he froze as the new pattern was established he let out a breath as he saw a glimmering hairthin beam of light at his calf and carefully eased away from it it would be another seventeen point three seconds before they changed again and he shimmied up to the wall careful not to touch it for fear of setting off the tremors he was within the laser net and so long as he kept close to the wallbut didnt touch ithe would be invisible to the villas security taking a moment to compose himself the figure eased around the compound heading for the delivery entrances he froze as a patch of light was thrown out onto the ground a door opening a man came out followed by another and he felt a flutter of fear then they sparked up cigarettes and began to smoke and gossip he let out a breath his heart hammering against his ribs kitchen porters nothing more they moved away from the door taking refuge from the cold wind behind a leanto and he took this golden opportunity to sneak forward and slip through the door flipping up the lenses of his goggles as he entered the kitchen warmth assailed him from the large stonebuilt ovens and the air was redolent of the lingering aroma of the mengsk familys last meal this time of night the kitchen was empty the cooks and skivvies retired for the night before rising early to prepare breakfast and he briefly wondered what the two smokers were doing up this late he dismissed the matter as irrelevant and continued onward moving from the kitchen to the door that led toward the main entrance hall easing it open and looking out into the shadowed chamber portraits of angus mengsks illustrious ancestors lined the walls and a number of tasteful statuettes vases and weapons chosen by his wife katherine were displayed on fluted columns in contrast to the dignity of these objets dart a number of toys belonging to anguss youngest child dorothy were scattered at the bottom of a flight of carpeted stairs that led up to the family bedrooms the tiled floor was a blackandwhite checkerboard pattern and he waited as a guard entered from across the hall and checked in with his compatriots in the security room on a throat mike angus mengsk kept only a handful of armed guards within the summer villa claiming that he came here to get away from the trouble korhal was having with the confederacy not to be reminded of it the guard turned from the front door and started toward the dining room shutting the door behind him with the guard gone the figure swiftly entered the hall and made his way up the stairs pausing at the top to glance along the wide corridor the bedroom shared by angus and katherine was to his left but the figure set off in the opposite direction toward the bedrooms of the mengsk family children the floor was wooden covered with thick rugs and he walked carefully on it avoiding the places in the floor where he knew the wood creaked he slopped before a thick door with a bronze a fixed to the wood and smiled to himself he gripped the handle softly opened the door and ghosted inside the room the room was dark with long benches strewn with dismantled equipment and rock samples lining the walls framed images of geological strata and rock compositions hung from the walls and a lumpen sheetcovered form rested in the large ironframed bed he took a step into the room and a voice said i suppose you think that was clever turning around he saw achton feld head of security for the mengsk family seated on a plush leather chair in the far corner of the room dressed in a dark uniform jacket and loosefitting trousers felds hand rested on the butt of a heavy pistol he was tall and powerfulbuilt exactly as one would imagine a head of security would be proportioned the figure in black relaxed and removed the goggles revealing patrician features a strong jawline and the wide eager gray eyes of a seventeenyearold boy i thought it was very clever of me as a matter of fact said arcturus mengsk achton feld examined the geosurvey unit with a critical and not unimpressed gaze the boy had managed to put together quite an infiltration package and feld was going to have to thoroughly review the security procedures in place at the summer villa he put the geosurvey unit down if arcturus could get this far there was no telling how far someone with more malicious intent might reach feld didnt want to the think about the consequences of that korhal was in a volatile enough state as it was without something happening to angus mengsk to have so outspoken an opponent of the confederacy murdered in his bed would be a blow from which the fledgling independence movement on korhal might never recover shouldnt you be at the academy in styrling i got bored said arcturus sitting on the edge of the bed and pulling the covers back to reveal a series of pillows arranged to give the semblance of a human being they werent teaching me anything i didnt already know that was probably true reflected feld arcturus mengsk was many things including a truculent teenager and a selfish rogue who possessed a confidence some called arrogance but he was also fiercely clever and excelled at everything to which he turned his hand your father wont be happy about this when is he ever happy with what i do countered arcturus once a rebel always a rebel eh said feld whats that supposed to mean nothing forget it replied feld so why break into your own house arcturus shrugged to see if it could be done i suppose and thats all well maybe to annoy my father arcturus smiled that never gets old oh i have no doubt itll annoy him said feld especially now and after hes gotten through chewing me out im sure hell have some choice words for you too so how did you do it asked arcturus find me i mean the bodysuit kept me off the infrared and i know the laser net didnt get me so how did you know and why should i tell you if anything i should be hauling you over the coals to find how you got this far you had help didnt you no said the boy but feld knew he was lying having a senator for a father had schooled the boy in many of the political arts and he was almost as skilled a dissembler of the truth as a seasoned veteran of the palatine forum almost but not quite theres no way you could have known how to avoid the laser net without help all right admitted angus i had help i persuaded lon hellan to give me the specs for the lasers so i could modify that geosurvey unit to make them visible i told him it was for a school project then lon hellan will be looking for a new job in the morning yes i suppose he will anger touched feld at arcturuss lack of concern for the man whose life he had just ruined for the sake of a prank and at the boys need to challenge the limits of his abilities come on said arcturus tell me how did you find me some new system i didnt know about a biometrlc reader a dna scanner feld looked at the young eager face and felt his anger melt away angus mengsks son had a quality that caused those around him to forget their ire and want to please him only his father and mother seemed immune to his charms it wasnt a new system it was an old system you forgot about an old system what eb mark i said feld picking up the geosurvey unit eb mark i repeated arcturus ive never heard of that one is it larscorp no wait it has to be gemini yes neither said feld pointing to his eye eyeball mark i i saw you on the spycams as you came in through the kitchen spycams what spycams the new terra model spycams your father had installed last week in time for that umojan ambassadors visit who do you listen to anything that goes on in this house that doesnt involve you not if its anything to do with my father its all politics and business far too boring to pay attention to said arcturus so whos here a man named ailin pasteur and his daughter said feld apparently hes some sort of bigwig on umoja and he wants to talk trade with your father that wasnt entirely true but arcturus had displayed little enough interest in the senators dealings before now for feld to bother with explaining further worldchanging events were in motion and all arcturus wanted to do was piss his father off and spend his time with his coterie of sycophants at the academy or his collection of rocks and gems with the geosurvey unit confiscated achton feld turned and made his way to the door oh and youd best tell your friends the games up my friends said arcturus what do you mean dont warned feld just tell them to go home its late and im too tired to deal with any more nonsense honestly feld i have no idea what you are talking about achton feld stared hard at the boy looking past his glib exterior and power to make the unbelievable believable arcturus mengsk could with a few words get techs with ten years experience to give up the specs for a laser net but feld knew that what he was hearing now was the unvarnished truth which meant crap said feld activating the comm unit on his wist all units condition black i repeat condition black feld turned back to arcturus stay here he said and hide what is it cried arcturus as feld ran for the door feld drew his pistol and said intruders arcturus watched feld disappear through the door and it took a moment for the implication of the head of securitys words to penetrate intruders here arcturus now wished he had not thought to try and test himself against the defenses of his fathers home it seemed suddenly foolish and childishly impulsive close on the heels of that thought was the idea that his family might actually be in danger and he felt a knot of warm fear settle in his belly the emotion was quickly suppressed and contrary to felds instructions arcturus bolted from his room into the corridor lights were coming on throughout the house and shouted voices were rousing guards from their posts as doors slammed arcturus was suddenly rooted to the spot with indecision the hard bang of a pistol shot echoed in the hallway and a mans scream galvanized him into motion he set off farther down the corridor and skidded to a halt beside a door hung with paper flowers and a childs drawing of a pony tacked to it colorful paper letters declared that this was dorothys room and arcturus pushed it open the lights were on and he pulled up short as he saw his fouryearold sister sitting in bed her long dark curls spilling messily around her shoulders as she sleepily rubbed her eyes sitting next to her in the bed was a young girl roughly arctumss age whose blonde hair shone like honey and whose face was as beautiful as it was unexpected who are you demanded the girl putting protective arms around dorothy i could ask you the same damn thing said arcturus what are you doing in my sisters room im juliana pasteur said the girl dorothy asked me to stay and read her a story i guess we must have both fallen asleep you must be arcturus but whats going on was that a gunshot yes and im not sure exactly whats going on said arcturus rushing over to the bed i think we might be under attack attack from whom arcturus ignored the question and knelt beside the bed little dot he said keeping his voice even and using his sisters pet name you have to get up at the sound of arcturuss voice dorothy looked at him and his anger rose as he saw the tears in her eyes arcturus did not care much for his father or his dealings but he doted on his sister her smile was able to melt the hardest of hearts and not even angus could resist giving in to her every whim where are we going said doroihy her voice drowsy before arcturus could answer more gunshots boomed dorothy squealed in terror arcturus looked up at juliana pasteur and said look after her ill see whats happening juliana nodded and clutched the little girl tightly as the door to the room opened and two people burst in arcturus leapt to his feet but let out a relieved breath as he saw that one of the figures was his mother katherine mengsk was tall beautiful and slender but she was no shrinking violet who spent all her time at needlepoint or recitals a core of neosteel ran through her and with her children threatened that quality was in the ascendancy she blinked in surprise to see arcturus but overcame that surprise in a heartbeat and quickly gathered her children as the man next to her ran over to juliana are you all right asked katherine arcturus dorothy were fine mother said arcturus prizing himself free of her embrace wheres father katherine lifted dorothy to her breast hes with achton some men are trying to get inside and theyve gone to stop them more shots sounded from beyond the door and dorothy burst into tears his mother turned to the man who had entered the room with her and nodded to juliana is she okay shes fin said the man his voice strong and lyrical arcturus thought the man looked around the same age as his father which put him in his midforties his concern over juliana identified him as ailin pasteur and arcturus thought him an unimpressive man for an ambassador from so important a world as umoja receding gray hair and a weak chin conspired to make ailin pasteur look timid but from an early age arcturuss father had warned him that where politicians and men of words were concerned it was almost always the ones you underestimated who would bring you down whats going on mother asked arcturus are we really under attack yes said katherine nodding his mother was never one to sugar the pillit was one of the things arcturus loved about her ailin pasteur took his daughter by the hand as katherine mengsk said now we need to get to the refuge everyone follow me and no dawdling the bark of automatic weapon fire roared from somewhere nearby the noise was so loud it was impossible to pinpoint the source of it but arcturus thought it was coming from this floor he heard booted footsteps and more shouts arcturus hauled on his mothers hand as more shooting exploded nearby the wooden frame around the bedroom door splintered as gunfire tore through it everyone screamed and dropped to the floor arcturus covered his ears as a clatter of metal and wood rained down from the shattered door a twisted spike of silver rolled across the carpet a thin cone of metal as thick as the tip of his pinkie arcturus recognized it immediately ammunition fired from a militarygrade assault rifle a c gauss rifle to be precise an impaler he heard thumps from outside and two men spun around the doorway one was achton feld his slugthrower smoking and blood pouring from wounds in his arm and chest the other was armed with the impaler rifle and arcturus recognized him as one of his fathers security guards a man named jaq dolor as felds gaze swept the room he spoke hurriedly into his shoulder mike angus its feld ive got them were in dots room arcturus missed the reply as another roar of gunfire sounded delor quickly leaned around the door and fired off a couple of shots the noise of the gun was deafening especially mixed together with dorothys sobbing cries achton said katherine where is my husband downstairs organizing the defense but hes on his way said feld slamming a fresh magazine into the butt of his pistol and awkwardly racking the slide and we have to get out of here were too exposed the refuge is just along the hall we cant go out there said ailin pasteur well be killed well be killed if we stay here ailin replied katherine no time to argue said feld his face pale with blood loss they have men coming in from both sides jaq hows it looking jaq delor raised his rifle and leaned around the door checking left and right he fired a burst of impaler rounds along the length of the corridor and arcturus heard a scream of pain clear now said delor as the sound of gunfire intensified arcturus could make no sense of this all he could hear was a meaningless cacophony of cries for cover medical attention or mothers who was winning this fight did anyone know now shouted feld lets go feld was first out of the room his pistol extended as delor hustled katherinestill with dorothy clutched to her chestailin pasteur and juliana through the door lastly came arcturus and delor remained with him as they sped along the corridor toward the refuge smoke from the gunfire filled the hallway and arcturus could see little beyond the floor in the dim glow of sputtering lights that had been shot out he passed a bulky shape lying on the ground a body with a bullet wound in the neck blood squirted onto the floor from the ragged crater in the mans throat and arcturus gagged at the horrid burnedmetallic smell of the mans death another mans body lay farther along the corridor this one with his chest torn apart by impaler spikes it looked like hed been sawn in two delor kept watch on their rear as feld haltingly led the way to the refuge a fortified bolt hole constructed in the heart of the house with comm systems capable of reaching korhals orbitals and enough supplies lo last four days arcturuss mother had objected to the idea of installing such an ugly thing in her summerhouse but had reluctantly consented to its construction after a crazed psychopath had murdered senator nikkos and his family in their beds a few years ago a crazed psychopath who was probably now a neurally resoclallzed confederate marine arcturus stumbled but delor held him upright the refuge was up ahead its neosteel door open and a cold fluorescent light spilling from inside the wounded achton feld lay slumped in the doorway his face ashen as he tried to hold his slugthrower level shouts sounded behind arcturus urgent and demanding jaq delor released him and spun around dropping lo one knee and bringing his rifle up the barrel exploded with noise and light and arcturus cried out at the unimaginable volume of the weapon gauss spikes roared from the barrel and more screams of pain followed go shouted delor no sooner had he given this last instruction than jaq delor was struck by a burst of impaler fire it was as if a giant fist had hammered into his side and hurled him against the wall blood spattered arcturus and he watched in horror as delors head lolled down over his chest almost severed by the impact of the impaler spikes arcturus screamed his mother from the refuge but her voice seemed tinny and indistinct all he could hear was the last rasp of delors breath and the sound of his blood as it sprayed from his ruined neck without conscious thought arcturus knelt down and lifted delors fallen rifle hed never fired such a weapon before but figured all you needed to do was point it at what you wanted to kill and pull the trigger how hard could it be a shape resolved itself from the smoke of the corridor a gunman dressed in dark fatigues body armor and a strange helmet it had a number of projecting attachments jutting from the side and a matte black visor upon which arcturus could see his own face reflected the rifle was a dead weight in his hands but he raised it without conscious thought the gunman already had his rifle aimed and arcturus knew he would not be able to pull the trigger before he was torn apart the thought made him more angry than fearful before the gunman could fire arcturuss reflection in the helmets visor exploded in a mist of plexiglas fragments bone and brain matter another shot struck the gunmans helmet then another and another the man dropped to his knees as highvelocity slugs tore into his chest and legs arcturus turned and saw his mother marching toward him achton felds slugthrower held out before her in both hands with her long black hair unbound and her nightdress flaring behind her like a cloak she looked like some warrior woman from the old myth stories the gun boomed in her grip and she never once broke step as she fired arcturus watched the gunman die and dropped the gauss rifle as his mothers hand clamped on his shoulder he looked up and saw that her face was thunderous with anger not at arcturus but at the man who had dared threaten one of her children katherine pulled arcturus to his feet and all but dragged him into the refuge with help from ailin pasteur she hauled the heavy door of the refuge shut then punched in the locking code to a keypad set into the wall arcturus took heaving gulps of clean recycled air feeling his hands shaking at how close hed come to death he clenched his fists angry at such a display of weakness and fought down his fear through sheer force of will in control of himself once more he look stock of his surroundings achton feld lay slumped against one wall his chest and shoulder a mass of sticky red fluid but arcturus couldnt tell whether he was alive or dead juliana pasteur sat against the opposite wall of the refuge holding dorothy tight and arcturus went to them he stroked his sisters hair and smiled reassuringly at juliana little dot said arcturus its me were safe now dorothy looked up and arcturus smiled putting every ounce of sincerity into his words you were very brave little one no one is going to hurt us now were safe said dorothy between snotty exhalations you promise i promise said arcyurus nodding i wont let anything happen to you ever never ever never ever promised arcturus with the door to the refuge sealed there was nothing to do but wait and waiting was something arcturus mengsk wasnt particularly good at he sat on a folddown cot bed with his legs crossed and dorothys head resting on his thigh her thumb jammed in her mouth and a stuffed pony named pontius clutched tightly beneath one arm despite all that had happened she had fallen into a deep sleep and arcturus smiled as he ran a hand through her dark hair as it turned out achton feld was still alive and arcturuss mother was doing her best to treat the impaler wounds in his shoulder with the practical mindset that had made her such a formidable matriarch of the mengsk family katherine set about assigning them all tasks as much to keep their minds busy as to actually achieve anything useful arcturus was told to look after juliana and dorothy while ailin pasteur was ordered to keep watch on the vidcams to get a better idea of what was happening beyond the refuge the umojan ambassador nodded taking a seal by the wall of monitors that displayed a multitude of images of both the exterior and interior of the mengsk summer villa arcturus wasnt surprised that his mother had taken charge or that pasteur had so readily acquiesced to her for katherine mengsk had an aura that conveyed absolute authority confidence and credibility even at seventeen arcturus was old enough to appreciate his mothers strength of character and knew that his father had learned over the years not to underestimate her without looking up from achton felds wound katherine said ailin whats going on out there can you see angus arcturus watched as pasteur scanned the images before himempty corridors dead bodies and blackclad figures dashing furtively from cover to cover but the ambassador couldnt tell whether the figures were the attackers or anguss security forces some of the cameras had been disabled the screens displaying a hash of static so that it was impossible to tell exactly what was happening theres still men with guns on the ground floor but i cant see angus no well keep looking said katherine pasteur nodded and returned his attention to the screens as katherine stood and wiped her bloody hands on the front of her nightdress his mothers face was strained yet beautiful and arcturus smiled as he remembered the sight of her standing over him with felds pistol blazing as she killed the man who was about to shoot him your mother seems very calm said juliana pasteur beside him does she know something we dont arcturus turned his head to face juliana with time to think he made a fuller inspection of her hed thought she was beautiful when hed first seen her but now looking more closely he saw that he had done her a disservice juliana pasteur was more than beautiful she was absolutely stunning and made all the more so because she plainly had no idea of how attractive she was the girls at the academy were either driven politicos who bored him or academic types who were no challenge to seduce he sensed juliana would fit into neither of these camps the nightdress clung to the curves of her body and his seventeenyearold mind pictured what she looked like underneath it he shook off that image knowing that this was neither the time nor the place for such thoughts my mother is a strong woman he said at last my mother got sick and died when i was very young said juliana i barely remember her arcturus heard the weary sorrow in her voice but did not know what to say he did not deal well with grief for he could never empathize with those who had suffered loss and found them unpleasant to be around im sorry he said at last juliana nodded seemingly oblivious to his discomfort are we safe in here she asked arcturus nodded pleased the conversation had shifted to a subject he could speak on with some authority yes were perfectly safe he said the walls of this refuge are three feet of plascrete with neosteel reinforcement bars it would take the mining guilds biggest drills at least a bdeto get through maybe even the you know a lot about drills a little he said with just the right hint of modesty for her to infer that he knew a lot about drills i plan on becoming a prospector someday arent you going to go into one of your fathers businesses arcturuss face darkened at the mention of his father no not if i can help it i wouldnt be surprised if its his speaking out against the confederacy and meddling in things that dont concern him thats gotten us into this mess what the confederacy is doing should concern everybody said juliana maybe said arcturus with a shrug looking over to ailin pasteur to find some clue as to the state of affairs beyond the refuge i dont really know and i dont really care i just want to be left alone to make my own way in the galaxy but if the confederacy goes on the way it is no one will be able to do that arcturus glanced over at ailin pasteur did your father tell you that as a matter of fact it was your father said juliana archly then i have even less interest in it you arent very polite are you i dont know you pointed out arcturus why do i need to be polite to you because even fringe worlders know it is good manners to be polite to a guest he saw the color in her cheeks and realized she was righthe was being rude and being rude to such a pretty girl seemed like the behavior of a savage not that of a senators son arcturus took a deep breath and flashed his most dazzling smile the one that melted the hearts of the girls at the academy who briefly piqued his interest youre right i am being rude and im sorry this has been an unusual evening im not normally like this normally i am actually quite pleasant to be around she stared at him trying to crack the mask of his handsome sincerity but even the most desirable of styrling socialites had tried and failed to do that juliana pasteur would have no chance beneath the glare of his charm apology accepted she said with a smile but arcturus knew she wasnt yet hooked youre a sharp one arent you i like that he said more interested in ailin pasteurs daughter now that she had displayed a measure of resistance to his wiles korhal may be one of the jewels in the confederate crown but umoja isnt without culture and breeding ive never traveled there said arcturus maybe i will soon if all its maidens are like you theyre not but i think you would like it there im sure i would would you be my guide perhaps said juliana i could show you sarengo canyon where the supercarrier crashedm said arcturus its said to be breathtaking you have no ideam promised juliana well if we live through the night ill be sure to take you up on that said arcturus his light tone robbing the commenl of any danger juliana smiled but before arcturus could say any more ailin pasleur said katherine the door arcturus looked over to the bank of monitors but the vidcamera showing the corridor had been shot out in the fighting a series of clicking beeps came from the keypad next to the door and katherine bent to examine the sequence before typing in her own code this was in turn answered by another series of key punches from the other side which was again answered by katherine his mother nodded to ailin pasteur and then typed in a last key sequence that disengaged the locks arcturus fell a mixture of relief and disappointment that their time here was to be cut short but smiled as he fell julianas hand lake his and squeeze it in nervous anticipation the thick neosteel door of the refuge swung open and angus mengsk senator of korhal father to arcturus and dorothy and husband to katherine entered with an impaler rifle cradled in his arms angus was a broad powerfully built man his dark hair pulled into a long ponytail that like his beard was lined with silver streaks his features were strong gnarled with age and a pair of cold gray eyes stared out from beneath a bushy set of eyebrows he swung the rifle over his shoulder and took his wife into a crushing bear hug thank god youre safem he said i knew youd look after them were all finem said katherine achtons been hitm but hell live is it over angus released his wife from his embrace and nodded theyre all dead yes arcturus swallowed nervously as he saw his father finally notice him sitting on the bed angus prized his gaze from arcturus and shook hands with ailin pasteur his scowl replaced with the practiced smile of a politician good to see youre still alive my friend and you angus said pasteur a bad business this and no mistake confederates maybe said angus well talk later eh pasteur nodded and angus moved past him to stand before arcturus the politicians smile falling from his face like a discarded mask what in the name of the fathers are you doing here boy demanded angus have you been thrown out of the academy again nice to see you too father said arcturus chapter angus mengsk poured himself a generous measure of brandy from an expensive crystal decanter and downed the amber liquid in one swallow he closed his eyes and allowed the molten taste to line his throat and settle in his stomach before pouring another glass he lifted up the bottle inquiringly toward ailin pasteur but the umojan ambassador shook his head no thank you angus i know you dont drink ailin said angus but under the circumstances angus i cant come on man cajoled angus surely one wont hurt he said he didnt want one said katherine replacing the stopper in the decanter and glaring sternly at her husband theres no such thing as just one for me not anymore said pasteur fine said angus shrugging and taking his own drink back to the table in the aftermath of the attack angus had gathered the occupants of the summer villa in the main dining room a long oakpaneled room dominated by an exquisite rosewood table carved with pastoral scenes of a rustic korhal that had probably never existed an exquisite chess set with pieces carved from jet and ivory sat next to the drinks cabinet the pieces apparently arranged in midgame though the white king was in checkmate anguss wife took a seat at the end of the table next to dorothy and ailin pasteurs daughter and he allowed himself a moment of quiet relief that his girls had been spared the worst of this nights bloodshed his mood darkened as he shot a glance over to arcturus the boy sitting with his arms folded across his chest and his eyes steadfastly refusing to meet those of his father achton feld had managed to haul himself from his sickbed to join them the man looked terrible his skin gray and greasy with sweat everyone knew he should have been resting but to his credit he had found the strength to be part of their debate as to what was to be done about this terrible night and how best to repay those responsible angus paced the length of the table his expression murderous his eyes smoldering with anger angus said katherine sit down before you wear a hole in the carpet and calm down calm down exploded angus they tried to kill us in our own house armed men came into our house and tried to kill us all i swear ill lead the army to the palatine forum and strangle lennox craven with my bare hands if he had something to do with this for gods sake kat how can i be calm at a time like this because you need to be said katherine firmly you are a senator of korhal and you dont have the luxury of anger it achieves nothing and only clouds your judgment besides you dont know yet who was behind this it might not be craven and his confederate goons lennox craven was the senior consul of the korhal senate the man tasked with ensuring that the will of the confederacy was carried out upholding its laws and providing a controlling influence on the unruly senators below him angus loathed the man believing him to be little more than a stooge for the corrupt old families that governed the confederacy from the shadows but for all that craven was a formidable senator and canny businessman and angus had exchanged many an incendiary barb with him across the marble floor of the palatine forum the mengsk family was one of the old families too one of the oldest in fact and craven never tired of reminding angus that he was spitting in the eye of the establishment that had given him such power and wealth angus took a deep breath and nodded smiling al katherine as he took a drink youre right my dear he said o need to think this through clearly achton do you have any thoughts on what happened here tonight who were these men professionals said achton feld they were good but we got the drop on them thanks to arcturuss stunt a few minutes more and well i dont like to think what might have happened and you and i are going to talk about the security here later promised angus staring at his son but who were they achton feld chewed his bottom lip for a moment then said everything about them leads me to think theyre a corporate death squad a blackops unit used to kill off business rivals and engage in corporate espionage kidnapping and that kind of thing why would anyone want to target angus asked katherine and why now perhaps someone got wind of the things angus is going to address in his close of session speech to the senate suggested pasteur its sure to ruffle some feathers to say the least agreed angus but thats not for months protested katherine and your business interests only benefit korhal a lot of people on korhal have become very wealthy thanks to their dealings with the confederacy said pasteur plenty of organizations have ties to both korhal and the confederacy and angus is stirring up trouble for them if the confederacy were to be kicked off korhal they would stand to lose millions i know its a long shot achton but is there anything on the bodies that might tell us who sent them asked angus feld shook his head the kit they used is all exmilitary stuff the kind you can pick up easily enough if you know where to look it looks like something local but i dont buy it my guts telling me something different and what is your gut telling you asked katherine that this is bigger than some corporation trying to hold on to its savings why do you think that said angus because all those dead men are marines or at least they were marines how do you know feld reached up and tapped the back of his neck theyve all been brainpanned all six of them have got neural resocialization scars ailin pasteur cleared his throat well naturally that leads us to the confederacy youre probably right ailin said angus but it seems heavyhanded even for them really you heard about the rebellion on antiga prime no what rebellion i didnt see anything about that on the unn well you wouldnt would you pointed out katherine arent you always saying that the old families control the corporations that run the news channels they broadcast what they want you to see their version of the truth in twentysecond sound bites thats true enough replied angus but what of antiga prime yes well apparently the people of andasar city kicked out the confederate militia and held the local magistrate hostage they demanded an end to confederate corruption and whole districts rallied to their call to arms the city was as good as in open revolt but two days later a troop of marines under a lieutenant nadaner went in and took the place back and they didnt leave any survivors good god said angus how many dead no one knows for sure but my sources say the figure is in the thousands and thats exactly why we need to be careful here pointed out katherine if the confederacy isnt shy about perpetrating a massacre like that then clearly they dont have any compunction against killing a senator and his family do they but why send resocialized marines asked arcturus lifting his head up from staring at the table surely any dead bodies would be easy to trace back to the confederacy because they didnt expect to fall said angus returning to the crystal decanter on the drinks cabinet and pouring himself another glass of brandy their paymasters expected them to kill us all and not leave any of their own dead behind the damned arrogance of it then why bother making them look like corporate killers said arcturus plausible deniability said achton feld in case the assassins were caught on any kind of surveillance corporatesponsored murders are terrible if not exactly uncommon but if it was discovered that the confederacy was complicit in the murder of a prominent senator the planet would erupt in revolt finished katherine angus laughed without humor almost makes me wish theyd got me after all dont say that snapped katherine not ever sorry dear said angus standing behind his wife and kissing her cheek i didnt mean that but i feel its going to take something truly dreadful to bring the confederacy to its knees we wont beat them overnight but will beat them and ill tell you how once again angus paced the length of the table as he spoke allowing his voice to became the rich baritone he used when speaking in the forum its their arrogance that will be their undoing they cant see how they can possibly do anything wrong and when you cant see that you make mistakes my father once said that when all you have is a hammer everything starts to look like a nail angus paused and turned to address his audience well show them what happens when the nail hits back the dining room was empty save for angus and arcturus the two sharing an uncomfortable silence as the elder mengsk poured out two snifters of brandy angus took one for himself and walked over to where his son sat to offer him the other arcturus looked askance at the glass clearly wishing to reach for it but unsure as to whether or not he should go on take it said angus i know youre too young but on a night like this it hardly matters does it theres a lesson for you right there sort out what matters from what doesnt act on the things that mean something and discard the rest arcturus took the glass and tentatively sniffed the expensive drink his nose wrinkled at its potency and he took an experimental sip his eyes widened but he kept it down without coughing and angus felt his anger loosen its hold on him as he sat across from his son achton feld had explained what arcturus had done and as much as he wanted to rage biliously at his son angus couldnt help but be proud of the lads inventiveness and sheer brio in pulling off a stunt like that but despite his grudging admiration angus couldnt allow arcturus off the hook too easily do your tutors at the academy know you are gone he asked arcturus looked at the timepiece on his wrist and smiled they will in a few hours he said i sent a message with an attached commvirus to principal steegmans console hell open it with his morning java and itll really spoil his day angus shook his head theyll expel you for this probably agreed arcturus and angus fought the urge to slap him have you any idea of how much your place al styrling academy cost arcturus shrugged no a great deal and there are plenty of prospective students just waiting to take your place so let them have it said arcturus im not learning anything there anyway angus bristled at his sons belligerence forcing himself to remember what he had been like on the verge of manhood his entire life ahead of him and the sense that he knew all there was to know about the world arcturus was no different and he began to appreciate the patience his own father had displayed he took a deep breath before speaking again listen to me son you live a privileged life here but its time you learned that it is a harsh world out there beyond these walls and that you are not prepared for it ill survive no said angus bluntly you wont i cant pretend im not impressed by what you did tonight but stunts like that will see you dead sooner or later arcturus laughed and said now youre being melodramatic no said angus im not its the truth and now i have to discipline you why said arcturus if it werent for me those men would have killed us all i think youll find it was feld catching you that alerted us it was just a joke said arcturus and anyway isnt that something that doesnt matter after what happened tonight or dont your own lessons apply to you angus put down his glass and leaned over the table lacing his hands before him youve the seeds of a debater in you son but you have to be punished to allow youth to run unchecked is to invite a recklessness of spirit and disregard for the proper order of things that is anathema to any ordered society youre one to talk said arcturus you disregard the proper order of things all the time all i ever hear the other students at the academy say is how youre stirring up trouble for korhal with all your speeches about the corruption of the confederacy and how wed be better off without it why do you have to be such an embarrassment angus sat back in his chair surprised at arcturuss outburst and angry at how little his son understood of the world beyond his own little bubble of reality you have no clue what youre talking about son said angus what the confederacy is doing on korhal is criminal corruption backhanders and bribery are everywhere and if you have money the law is a joke virtually every penny earned by the citizens of korhal swells the coffers of some confederate puppet corporation while our own independent industries wither on the vine tell me how that is the proper order of things i dont know said arcturus all i want to do is become a prospector a prospector grubbing in dirt and rocks like some kelmorian pirate hardly you are the son of a senator arcturus and you are destined for greater things than prospecting i dont want greater things i just want to do what i want not what you think i should do youre too young to really know what you want said angus i know that i dont want to follow in your footsteps snapped arcturus hell i might even join the military you dont mean that youre just angry said angus you dont know the reality of life what the confederacy has done and what theyre going to do if someone doesnt stand up to them in the centuries since the supercarriers crashed the old families have been taking over everything by force guile and corruption soon there wont be anything left they dont control so what who says thats a bad thing angus fought down his anger but he could feel his temper fraying in the face of his sons obstinacy didnt the boy understand the scale of the confederacys corruption couldnt he see the terrible fate that awaited all rightthinking people if they didnt take a stand against the allcontrolling allpervading influence of a remote unthinking unfeeling government looking into arcturuss face angus could see he did not and his heart sank speaking in the palatine forum angus mengsk had swayed recalcitrant senators to his side won hopeless causes through the power of his oratory but he couldnt convince his own son that the confederacy was a great and terrible evil that threatened everything the free people of korhal prized angus mengsk firebrand senator and son of korhal might yet save his planetbut might lose his son in the process the irony of it all was not lost on him the following morning with the sun rising over the mountains arcturus yawned as he heard the door to his room open he rolled over and smiled as he saw dorothy standing in the doorway the bright blue form of pontius the pony clutched in her arms what is it little dot he said propping himself up in bed why do you fight with daddy asked dorothy arcturus laughed thats a big question for such a little girl but why arcturus swung his legs out of bed and opened his arms whereupon dorothy ran to him and jumped up onto his lap ow youre getting bigger every day said arcturus youre getting fat no im not squealed dorothy jabbing her fingertips into his ribs all right all right youre not fat told you said dorothy satisfied she had won the argument she looked up at him and he knew she hadnt forgotten that he hadnt answered her question i wish you didnt always fight with daddy said dorothy i wish we didnt either so why do you its hard to explain dot he said falher and iwell we dont agree about a lot of things and hes too stubborn to admit that hes not always right are you always right no not always but so how do you know daddys not right then arcturus opened his mouth to answer her childs logic but floundered when he couldnt think of an answer that would satisfy them both i suppose i dont but he wants me to do things i dont want to do like what like not be who i want to be said arcturus who do you want to be dont you want to be like daddy arcturus shook his head no why not arcturus was spared from answering by a gentle knock and he looked up to see his mother standing in the doorway katherine mengsk was dressed in a long cream dress with a midnight blue bodice and looked as fresh as if she had had a full nights rest and not been hunted by armed soldiers dorothy its time for breakfast said katherine but im not hungry said dorothy dont argue with me young lady warned her mother go down to the kitchen and have seona fix you a bowl of porridge and dont turn your nose up at me go dorothy leaned up and planted a small kiss on arcturuss cheek before dropping from his lap and running off pontius dragging on the floor behind her with dorothy gone arcturus stood and pulled on his shirt and a pair of dark britches hiking the braces up over his shoulders you didnt answer her question said his mother what question why you dont want to be like your father arcturus ran his hands through his dark hair and poured himself a glass of water from a silver ewer beside the bed he took a drink and swilled the water around his mouth before answering because i want do something with my life thats mine not his his mother swept inlo the room graceful and strong and placed a hand on arcturuss shoulder the touch was maternal and comforting and arcturus wished he could be as close to his father as he was to his mother your father just wants whats best for you arcturus she said does he sometimes i think he just wants a carbon copy of himself katherine smiled i see a lot of him in you its true but then theres too much of me in you to ever be that much like your father thats a relief said arcturus but the smile fell from his face as he saw the hurt in his mothers face im sorry he said i know hes a good man but he doesnt understand me you think youre the first seventeenyearold whos said that about his father no i suppose not you are a brilliant boy arcturus you could achieve great things if you allow yourself to everything you turn your hand to you master within days and your father just wants to make sure you make the most of your talents i remember you telling me i was going to be a great leader when i was dots age said arcturus but i grew out of that a long time ago his mother took his hands in hers and looked straight at him no it was true then and its still true uncomfortable with his mothers grandiose dreams for his future arcturus changed the subject do i really have to go back to the academy yes you do i know you dont like it there but it means the world to me that you finish your education you did recall that message with the commvirus you sent to principal steegmans console didnt you i didarcturus grinnedthough it would have been worth gelling expelled just to have seen the look on his face as the virus sent his private files to the parents of every student at the academy his mother shook her head in exasperation but he could see that she too was amused at the thought of steegmans humiliation i dont even want to think what might be contained in that odious little mans private files are ailin pasteur and his daughter going to be staying with us for a while yet asked arcturus hearing movement from another part of the house katherines eyes narrowed as she sensed his interest yes they will be our guests for a spell your father thinks it wise for them to remain with us until he can recall some more guards to escort us all back to styrling that sounds sensible arcturus nodded trying not to sound too interested though of course his mother saw through his nonchalance in a heartbeat and smiled shes very pretty said his mother juliana yes she is agreed arcturus and i think she likes me his mother leaned down and kissed his cheek who could not love you my handsome boy now go and get some breakfast with your sister ive no doubt shell be trying to talk seona into giving her something so laden with sugar itll keep her awake for days arcturus made his way downstairs along the corridor that had only the previous night been filled with gunsmoke and the sound of battle the bodies that had lain here pumping their lifeblood over the carpet had been removed and the domestics were cleaning the stains they had left behind it still seemed unreal to him that people had tried to kill them last night the idea that people would kill helpless civilians for the sake of something as prosaic as money seemed ludicrous but if his reading of history had taught him anything it was that entire cultures had been wiped out for far less killing for honor glory land or freedom seemed more noble ideals to kill or die for but arcturus mengsk planned on doing none anytime soon he set foot on the stairs the wood creaking and the banister splintered by impaler spikes entire sections had been blasted away and the marble and plaster walls were stitched with impact craters when he reached the bottom arcturus heard voices coming from the dining room the door was ajar and he paused as he recognized his fathers stentorian tones and the more mellifluous sound of ailin pasteurs voice curious as to what they were talking about arcturus edged closer to the door exactly why we need your help more than ever ailin said his father korhal cant do this alone were gathering strength but without the support of umoja the confederacy will crush us i understand that replied pasteur but you have to understand the precariousness of our position umoja cant be seen to be openly supporting you angus we have a hard enough time fending off the confederate influence as it is and to be publicly linked with a rabblerouser like your good self would give them an excuse to increase their pressure the ruling council is willing to supply your men with what they need but our involvement cant be made public thats a given ailin but matters are coming to a head the attack last night only goes to show how desperate theyre becoming i have supporters within the senate and all over korhal to make this work and you know well enough that brushfire rebellions are erupting throughout the sector all it needs is one shining example that the confederacy can be beaten and the old order will be swept away korhal can be that example but only if you support us and we will but what you are talking about youll be called a terrorist i prefer the term freedom fighter said angus that depends on whether or not you win then ill need to make sure i win arcturus knew he was hearing words of great import but the sense of them washed over him what was his father planning that might have him labeled a terrorist the word itself was a powerful one conjuring up images of secretive men who met in shadows to plot the death of innocents to achieve their diabolical ends the idea that his father might be such a man repelled arcturus and his previously solid notion of angus mengsk as a powerful and controlling yet mostly benign presence in his life now seemed as fragile as glass as these thoughts surged through arcturuss head he heard footsteps realizing too late that they were approaching the door at which he listened he turned away but was too slow and a heavy fist took hold of his shirt and dragged him into the dining room where they had met last night spying on me are you roared angus what did you hear arcturus struggled in his fathers grip that youre a terrorist he shouted angus spun him around and pushed him down into one of the chairs you heard nothing son said angus those words were not meant for the likes of you arcturus looked over to ailin pasteur the man clearly surprised and worried that arcturus had overheard their discussions what are you going to do asked arcturus are you going to kill people his father stared hard at arcturus and the fathers cold gray eyes saw deep into the heart of his son arcturus saw his father come to a decision within himself pasteur saw it too and said angus are you sure aye hell be eighteen soon its time he started acting like a man so im going to treat him like one arcturus felt a nervous thrill at his fathers words wondering if all those years of wanting to be treated as an adult were about to blow up in his face well boy are you ready to become a man arcturus hesitated for the briefest second before answering i am good said angus ill respect that but you have to understand that what im going to tell you cant leave this room angus held out his hand to arcturus swear that to me and ill tell you everything i swear it said arcturus shaking his fathers hand very well said angus taking a seat next to arcturus and sitting with his legs crossed you know of course that i detest the corruption of the confederacy with every fiber of my being but it runs deeper than that the old families control everything from their capital world of tarsonis and the entire apparatus of the confederacy is geared to keep them in power exploiting the planets under their control and stealing their wealth well no more youre going to fight the confederacy asked arcturus why because someone has to said angus theyve overstretched their empire and like a house of cards all it needs is one push in the right place to make it fall people are tired of the yoke of the confederacy around their necks and rebellions in the airyou can feel it youre going to declare war on the confederacy said arcturus incredulously well not war exactly replied angus not yet at least terrorism said arcturus is that it i have no doubt some will call it that yes but if you think about it what the confederacy is doing can easily be construed as terrorism surely thats not the same thing isnt it asked angus isnt the purpose of terrorism to kill and maim people so that whoever its directed against will bend to your will and doesnt the confederacy engage in military operations designed to coerce people into bending to their will through fear but thats different said arcturus thats war angus shook his head no its not afler all the purpose of war isnt or at least shouldnt be about killing every last man in the enemy army its about killing enough of them that their leaders are more afraid of continuing the war rather than of surrendering then by your definition every act of war could be called an act of terrorism since its coercion through fear by the use of violence exactly said angus pleased he had made his point but youre still going to kill people pointed out arcturus in war people die its unfortunate but inevitable replied angus i wish it were different but the confederacy has brought this on itself unlike them however we wont hurt innocent civilians well only be targeting military installations its still wrong said arcturus people will still die and youll have killed them angus leaned back in his seat his face lined with disappointment i thought you would be man enough to understand what needs to be done arcturus but i can see i was wrong youre still a child and you still think like a child unable to see the truth of the world beyond your own selfish little bubble his fathers words stung like redhot whips and arcturus felt his resentment flare he stood up and turned on his heel marching toward the dining room door angus hissed ailin pasteur son barked angus you are never to speak of this you understand me never i understand snapped arcturus chapter sunlight rippled through the canopy of treetops and made the landscape glow as the convoy of silver groundcars sped along the road to styrling altogether there were six cars one conveying the mengsk family another ailin pasteur and his daughter and the other four bearing armed men the cars were terra cougars an older model of groundcar yet a mode of transport favored by many of korhals senators thanks to the heavy steel undercarriage and thick side panels that had foiled more than one assassination attempt two of the cars were equipped with turretmounted impalers and the convoy moved at speed along the wide strip of road half a kilometer ahead three vulture hovercycles ran point herding what little traffic there was on the road out of the convoys path this time of the morning traffic was light but achton feld was taking no chances and had ordered his men to shoot first and ask questions secondassuming anything survived grenade barrage from the vultures the confederacy had already tried to kill angus mengsk once and feld wasnt taking any chances that they might try again arcturus watched the countryside flashing past lush greens and sumptuous golds as the autumn tones blended together in a swirl of color like a painting left out in the rain the mengsk summer villa was built sixty kilometers to the south of styrling and the countryside separating the two was amongst the most verdant and lush of korhal yet it was shrinking every year as the industrial complex of the city spread farther and farther his father had chosen the site precisely because it was far enough from styrling to feel like he could escape the daytoday running of his many businesses and the politics of the senate but close enough that he was never too far out of the loop arcturus felt his mood sour with every kilometer that passed beneath the groundcar and brought him closer to the academy his father sat opposite him his face unreadable though he smiled whenever arcturuss mother looked at him dorothy was on her knees on the backseat next to him pontius clutched tightly as she peered out the polarized armored glass of the window he smiled at the simple joy on her face wishing he could go back to a time when life had been simpler all dorothy cared about was pontius sugary sweets and being close to her father she didnt yet have to worry about disappointing anyone or being farced into role she didnt want little dot would be the apple of anguss eye no matter what she did and arcturus felt a twinge of irritation but quickly shook it off recognizing that it was foolish to be jealous of a fouryearold despite his mothers pleasant ramblings on the colors of the leaves and the beauty of the scenery and dorothys enthusiasm for the journey the interior of the groundcar was tense arcturus and his father had not spoken since their harsh words in the dining room the previous morning and no amount of calming words from his mother could bridge the gulf which grew wider with every minute of silence arcturus kept his gaze fixed on the landscape unfolding around them as the groundcar wove its way though the low hills to the south of the city despite the inevitable growth of business korhal remained a defiantly green world the planetary authorities long ago having had the foresight to invest in renewable energy sources and enforce stringent clean air laws as a result korhal was one of the few planets in the confederacy to be a thriving hub of trade and industry that was also actually a pleasant place to live and visit arcturus had not yet ventured off world but he had ambitions beyond korhals skies he longed to travel between the stars and explore new worlds and earn his fortune with his skills instead of simply inheriting it as his father had done that his father had also worked tirelessly since he had achieved adulthood never occurred lo arcturus not that arcturus disapproved of inheriting wealth title and position the dynastic traditions of korhal were well establishedbut he wanted to be known as a man who had gotten to the top by virtue of his own abilities he wanted people to look at him and know that he had achieved what he had through blood sweat and sacrifice his thoughts of the future were interrupted when he caught sight of a shimmering lattice of silver through the branches of the trees the first signs of civilization despite his foul mood he smiled as he caught tantalizing glimpses of styrling through the wide canyons of the hills it was a huge city a mecca of commercial interests and a glittering symbol of all that had been achieved in the two centuries since the planets settlement arcturus loved the opportunities the city offered the wealth the entertainment the bustle and the sheer vibrant humanity of it all everything a person desired and more besides could be found in styrling if you knew where to look the groundcar swept over a ridge that curved along the road and then the city was laid out before him no matter how many times he saw it it never failed to impress styrling was like the frozen aftermath of a droplet that had fallen into a petri dish of mercury a silver crown of soaring structures that stood tall and majestic in the center and which gradually diminished in size toward the edges a dizzying web of flyovers surrounded and penetrated the bright metropolis like a hundred threads of dark wool woven through it and the city shone with dazzling reflections from the mass of neosteel and glass that made up the bulk of the buildings the architecture of styrling was not subtle most of the towers and spires belonged to one of the megacorporations or to representatives of one of the old families and each of the owners sought to outdo the others with the height and magnificence of a given structure graceful curving walls had once bounded the extreme edge of the city but the pressure of commerce had driven a great deal of the citys infrastructure beyond them the wealthiest families of korhal kept their headquarters within the walls of styrling and the mengsks were no exception the mengsk skyspire was a mighty fortresslike edifice that towered over its nearest rivals the continental building the larscorp tower and the korhal headquarters of the universal news network arcturus hated the skyspire its angular lines and neogothic stylings appearing at odds with the sleek graceful designs of its neighbors as far as arcturus was concerned it was the architectural embodiment of his father cold stern and uncompromising the city drew closer and the traffic grew heavier the vultures drawing back to surround the groundcars like mother hens protecting their chicks arcturus watched the traffic flow like a living thing around them moving to its own internal rhythms and as he looked at the faces within each car he wondered at the lives he saw passing him each one represented a selfcontained world around which the universe revolved and arcturus idly tried to fit histories to each facetrying to imagine what lives these people lived what were their dreams and ambitions what made them rise from their beds each day to toll in the factories and offices of styrling love ambition desire greed watching the people as they made their way to work arcturus saw all human life before himlaughter quarrels stolid silences and a thousand other things he saw conversations between men and women fathers and children lovers and colleagues each small world with its own hopes and dreams for the future a young girl with a yellow ribbon in her hair sat in the passenger seat of a car two lanes over she noticed arcturus looking at her and waved to him he smiled and waved back feeling an unaccountable closeness to these people of korhal feeling that in some small way they were his people he sensed a kinship with the faces he saw around him a bond with the people with whom he shared his homeworld that he had never felt before the girls car drifted away vanishing down an offramp and arcturus returned his attention to the city around him as they were swallowed up by its glass and steel canyons the tense silence in the groundcar was broken only when their journey took them around the chaotic site of the new korhal assembly forum or what was supposed to be the new korhal assembly forum towering cranes and enormous earthmoving machines stood idle around a monstrous halffinished building of concrete and exposed steel that looked as though it had been stripped by an army of looters a number of prefabricated cabins were arranged around the perimeter of the site but there appeared to be no men or robots working there arcturus was no judge of aesthetic but even to his untrained eye the building looked as though it had been spawned in the worst nightmares of a demented architect look at that said angus mengsk jabbing a finger at the unfinished building if theres a more visible symbol of the moral decay and corruption at the heart of the confederacy i dont know what it is oh please not this again dear said katherine but angus was not to be denied venting his outrage i ask you why do we need a new building for the senate anyway whats wrong with the palatine forum granted its old but its got character and tradition behind it this new fiasco of a building sums up everything thats wrong with the confederacy money siphoned off into the pockets of corrupt officials perverse priorities and an arrogant indifference to public opinion did you know that the costs have soared to over five hundred million and counting oh yes and thats from an initial estimate of sixtythree million and wheres that money gone on insane expenses like a chau saran sunwood reception desk or bribes to confederate city officials theyve been working on it for the last six years and it never seems to get finished oh they say itll be finished later this year but look at it does it look like thats realistic no dear it doesnt said katherine dutifully the truth is that the one thing people know about the confederacy is that everything costs quadruple what it ought to thanks to the bribes you need to pay to get anything done and the dozens of new taxes that suddenly seem to apply to any project that isnt intended to line the pockets of the old families then you should be thanking the confederacy for the ammunition said arcturus oh i am son said angus forgetting the tension between them in the fiery heat of his ire this whole project has been a public relations disaster that thank god even the unn isnt afraid to report on and one upon which i fully intend to capitalize his father continued to list the many faults of the building and the process by which it was being built or rather not being built arcturus tuned the words out as the unfinished building passed from sight this deep in the city the colossal scale of the towers was much more apparent shadows enveloped the convoy and arcturus felt a chill travel down his spine as the driver expertly wound the groundcar through the streams of traffic people thronged the streets well dressed and healthy but only a few turned to watch as the convoy sped by to see such things on the streets of styrling was not unusual for many captains of industry or senators traveled in this manner his father reached over and activated the comm unit on the armrest beside him ailin said angus were coming up to the academy to drop arcturus off so we wont be far behind you lets just hope he stays here this time this last comment was directed squarely at arcturus who ignored his fathers barb though his mother placed her hand on her husbands forearm and frowned sternly at him very well angus replied ailin pasteur i shall await you at the skyspire the comm unit was shut off and arcturus sighed as they passed alongside the lush parkland and playing fields of styrling academy here the buildings thinned out and became less vulgar in scale for this was a district of culture and breeding where the young minds of the future were molded into compliant citizens of the confederacy arcturus knew the area well despite the fact that students were forbidden to venture from the walled securitypatrolled campus of the academy by principal steegman that such petty regulations neednt apply to him was a decision arcturus had long since come to and heand a select band of adventurershad often visited the exotic neonlit depths of the citys night of course his mother and father knew nothing of this but the less they knew of what he got up to the better in arcturuss opinion it was best that parents know as little as possible about their offsprings doings since theyd only try and put a stop to them if they had any idea the great clock spire of the academy loomed large over an immaculately manicured line of trees in the distance and arcturus sighed as he contemplated another six months sitting in sterile classrooms being laught by morons who knew less than he about politics and history while blathering about the great destiny that awaited the schools alumni he shook himself from that bitter reverie as the groundcar slowed and turned down a graveled driveway that led to the academys security checkpoint that checkpoint consisted of an old brickbuilt gatehouse and a couple of wooden sawhorses that blocked the road to the campus proper with a handful of plastic orange cones scattered in front of them the car slowed as it reached the gatehouse and old rummy emerged from within leaning down to examine the occupants of the vehicle old rummy was the name the students gave to the venerable gatekeeper and arcturus had never bothered to find out his real name he reeked of liquor from the middle of the morning onward and his swollen nose and puffy cheeks were rife with the ruptured capillaries of a professional alcoholic arcturus could smell the drink on his breath and wrinkled his nose hed started early arcturus reasoned morning mr mengsk sir said old rummy doffing his peaked cap as he saw angus there were few people on korhal who didnt know arcturuss father thanks to reports on the unn of his political grandstanding and nearconstant berating of the confederacy angus was popular in most quarters of korhal but where his money was spent freely and the academy was such a placehe was feted and fawned over like royalty old rummy shuffled over to the sawhorses clearing them from the road with grunting heaves before picking up the cones and waving the groundcar through the driver gunned the engine and the car passed onward ten million for enhanced security measures to protect the sons and daughters of korhal from rebel attacks said angus shaking his head as they swept past the grinning idiot face of old rummy and onto the grounds of the academy you remember the fundraising ball the academy held to raise money to implement these security measures dear i do indeed said arcturuss mother with a shiver of distaste that frightful principal steegman preened like some oily salesman begging his betters for money a most distasteful evening angus nodded i pledged over half a million to that fund and look at the security its bought a few planks of wood and some cones shifted by a fat man in an illfitting uniform id wager the same again that the best part of that fundraiser went into steegmans pockets arcturus stored that nugget away and watched as the great mass of styrling academy hove into view around the perfectly maintained woodland and expanse of lush green grass the finest examples of the topiarists art decorated the lawn and a number of youngsters were already practicing with foils and rapiers under the watchful supervision of master miyamoto if it werent for the quality of the tutors id school the boy myself continued angus and arcturus stifled a horrified laugh at that idea the building nearly a hundred years old had been built from polished gray granite and positively reeked of money a grand columned portico sheltered the entrance and the triangular pediment was decorated with heroic individuals and symbols of academic and martial excellence carved statues sat in niches along the buildings length and elaborate carved panels filled the spaces between each of the tall narrow windows though the building was old amongst the oldest on korhal its eaves and roof were fitted with recessed surveillance equipment and sophisticated eavesdropping equipment though why the faculty should feel the need to spy on the students was a mystery to arcturus the groundcar crunched to a halt on the gravel at the bottom of the wide stone steps that led up to the main doors of the academy a liveried porter descended and opened the back door of the groundcar on you go dear said his mother arcturus nodded and turned to dorothy see you soon little one he said ill write you lots of letters and mummy can read them to you i can read silly pouted dorothy ill read them myself well arent you the smart one he said laughing dorothy threw her arms around him and hugged him tightly ill miss you arcturus he blinked in surprise normally dorolhy had difficulty in pronouncing his name mangling the syllables and calling him actress or arctroos but this time she said it without fault arcturus untangled dorothys arms from around his neck and handed her off to his mother who smiled warmly at him its only one more term dear said katherine mengsk and then the world will open up for you i promise if not for yourself do it for me please arcturus took a deep breath and nodded he could disappoint his father without fear of guilt but every time he felt hed let his mother down it cut him to the quick very well said arcturus ill finish the term youd damn well better snapped angus because i dont want to see you again until im watching you graduate understand me arcturus didnt deign to furnish him with an answer as he stepped from the groundcar taking a small measure of satisfaction from the withering glare his mother shot his father as satisfying as that was it was small recompense for the bitter seed planted in his heart still once he had graduated he could go anywhere somewhere that was as far away from angus mengsk as he could get three months later his promise to see out the term was being tested to the limit principal steegman had made it clear that arcturus remained a student of styrling academy thanks only to his fathers generous patronage of many of the schools facilities and repeatedly informed him that he was skating on thin ice walking a tightrope balancing on a knifes edge and performing numerous other wellworn cliches lessons had continued much as they had before and with all the extra attention being lavished upon him no doubt at his fathers insistence arcturus could not even find a way to relieve the crushing boredom of the academy by escaping into the city for an evening arcturus mengsk was it seemed a marked man at styrling academy and even his former cohorts appeared to have been warned of the dangers of associating with him as a result arcturus spent the majority of his time during his last term at styrling academy in the schools library reading and rereading every digitome he could find on geology politics psychology and warfare many of these books he had already memorized but each rereading brought fresh insight and understanding arcturus wrote to dorothy as promised and her return letters were among the few sources of comfort and amusement left to him in these letters his mother informed him of the workings of the world beyond the walls of the academy and he was surprised at the frankness of them talking as they did of revolts in the outer colonies and fringe worlds of which there was a growing number as well as relating the latest society gossip her letters skirted carefully around the subject of his father but arcturus needed no letters from home to know all about anguss dealings the unn broadcasts were replete with stories of his fiery speeches denouncing the corruption of the old families and the council though angus publicly condemned the rising tide of violence engulfing korhal which had seen hundreds of confederate marines dead in rebel bombings and ambushes arcturus knew his father had to be pan of it the objective part of arcturus actually admired the skill with which angus was able to distance himself from the violence while subtly implying that it was the inevitable result of the confederacys oppression and engendering sympathy for the rebel cause as much as he was now regarded as something of a pariah at the academy this did not stop his fellow students from making their feelings about his father plain to him many of them came from wealthy families with close ties to the confederacy and were suffering dally embarrassment thanks to the withering scorn of angus mengsks rhetoric though arcturus wanted nothing to do with his fathers politics he was savvy enough to recognize that what he said made a great deal of sense still the retaliatory humiliations heaped upon him by his fellow students only served to further his resentment toward the mengsk paterfamilias but arcturuss resentment was made bearable by the stimulating diversions offered in the letters he was now exchanging with juliana pasteur within a day of his arrival back at the academy arcturus had received a letter from juliana politely inquiring after his health and the possibility of setting up a meeting during one of the periods he was allowed off the campus with the precision of a razor arcturus had dissected the true meaning within her letter and seen the naked interest beneath the platitudes clearly the rapport established in the short time they had spent in the refuge of his fathers summer villa had blossomed despite his absence or perhaps because of it in return arcturus replied with a missive brimming with the foibles of his fellow students the foolishness of the masters and his trials within the prisonlike walls of the academy his words were well chosen witty erudite and filled with enough selfdeprecation to puncture any sense of selfimportance his letters might convey that might make him seem arrogant that such selfdeprecation was entirely contrived did not strike arcturus as false in any way and the effusive letters he received in return were proof positive of the success of his writings as they corresponded over the course of the term it became increasingly clear that juliana pasteur was smitten with him in marked contrast to their initially frosty meeting in the refuge it appeared that juliana now appreciated his brilliance and was assessing his suitability as a consort though he remembered her intoxicating beauty it had become a detached memory to arcturus and he indulged her letters as an outlet for his polemics and occasionally grandiose predictions of his future power truth be told his desire to maintain the friendship had begun to wane yet arcturus continued to write to juliana in the interest of eventually bedding her it would be the final act in the completion of a challenge that had once seemed difficult but which he now knew had been simplicity itself the weeks and months passed in a gray blur lectures boring him and insultingly easy assignments completed with barely a hint of effort the end was in sight and with only two weeks to graduation principal steegman summoned the entire senior year to the grand assembly hall in the main block of the academy the assembly hall was a grand vaulted chamber of cedarpaneled walls goldframed portraits of illustrious former students high ceilings and soaring oak beams every morning steegman would mount the stage to stand behind his lectern and address the entire upper school announcing the results of the academys sporting endeavors and notices of supposed importance occasionally the assembly hall was also used for scrupulously chaperoned balls or played host to visiting dignitaries who would speak to the student body on the virtues of civic service or some other similarly dull subject the identically uniformed students filed drearily into the hall and arcturus briefly wandered what manner of speaker they were to be subjected to today as he drew closer to the assembly halls doorway the excited hubbub of voices from within told him that whatever awaited them was something beyond the run of the mill he passed beneath the arched entrance to the assembly hall and the academys motto of alen apisteyein which meant ever to be the best in one of the dead languages of old earth the vast floor space in front of the stage was filled with uncomfortable chairs each one occupied by an excited student principal steegman was at his lectern looking very pleased with himself but it was the three hulking figures standing at attention behind him that captured arcturuss attention they stood several feet taller than steegman their backs ramrod straight and their bulk enormous thanks to the heavy plates of neosteel armor they wore arcturus recognized the armor from the technical manuals hed read in the library they were cmc powered combat suits a brandnew design that was replacing the dated cmc series powered combat suits as worn by soldiers of the confederate marine corps chapter principal steegman wasted no time in getting the proceedings started once every boy in the upper year was seated he clasped the lectern with both hands and leaned forward in what arcturus knew he hoped was an authoritative stance in reality it just emphasized how short he was but either no one else had noticed or no one had thought to tell him we are fortunate indeed began steegman his nasal tones grating on arcturuss nerves to have representatives from the brave confederate marine corps here to talk to you today it is a great honor for us to have them here and i know you will give them a rousing styrling academy welcome this last comment was clearly an order and the assembled boys gave an enthusiastic round of applause as steegman retreated from the lectern and one of the marines stepped forward his heavy steps booming on the wooden floor of the stage he reached the lectern and removed his helmet revealing that he was in fact a she and a strikingly pretty she the marine placed her helmet on the lectern and smiled at the assembled boys who now appeared even more interested in this mornings talk behind her the curtain parted to reveal a large projection screen upon which the red and blue confederate flag was displayed billowing dramatically in the wind against a golden sunset stirring music played in the background piped over the assembly rooms pa system good morning my name is angelina emillian began the marine im a captain with the rd ground assault division of the confederate marine corps and im here today at your principals request to talk to you about a career in the marine corps captain emillian marched to the front of the stage and planted her hands on her hips i know what youre thinking a nervous titter ghosted around the assembly hall suggesting that emillian might not want to know what many of the boys were thinking right at that moment and its why in the name of all holy hell would i want to join the marine corps right after all as graduates of this school youll no doubt be expecting to go into some cushy wellpaid job and its dangerous isnt it you might get killed the corps is for losers who dont have any other options open to them isnt it arcturus saw principal steegmans eyes widen in surprise captain emillians presentation obviously wasnt starting in the way he had imagined and for that reason alone arcturus found himself warming to this pretty marine captain well if youre thinking that ive got some news for you boys youre dead wrong captain emillian swept her gaze around the room her confidence and steely demeanor capturing everyones attention the confederate marine corps embodies three principals said emillian slapping her fist into her palm to emphasize each one strength pride discipline those ideals have enabled the confederate marine corps and the colonial fleet to defend confederate interests along the galactic rim for more than a century and a half and right now youre thinking that marines are just resocialized panbrains but im here to tell you thats just not true marines come from all walks of life from every level of society but they are united by one thingtheir devotion to the preservation of the confederate way of life as emillian spoke the projection screen behind her displayed images of laughing marines as they abseiled down cliffs played padball or skied down snowy mountainsides to arcturuss eye they appeared to be having so fantastic a time it was a wonder they managed to do any soldiering at all the corps offers countless opportunities for young men and women to see the sector and gain valuable realworld experience we will train you we will teach you we will shape you into an efficient warrior garnering respect and admiration from your peers during your service you can choose where and what you learn and when you come out after your short service period youll have a strength of character that youll find nowhere else the projection screen now showed marines working through an assault course men and women with rippling muscles and moviestar good looks once again they appeared to be having the time of their lives despite the rigors of the physical exertion and arcturus wandered who had shot this promotional filmclearly someone not averse to incredible visual hyperbole the corps has an honorable tradition of service and there are a great many benefits to joining up pay and conditions in the marine corps have steadily improved over the years and barely fifty percent of recruits ever see active combat but armed with the latest weaponry and armor technology a marine has little to fear from the kinds of folk that need fighting and dont forget that your service becomes pan of your permanent record combine that with the reputation of this fine institution and you have the key to open any door you want once you muster out a life in the marine corps is one lived without limits a life lived for the greater good of the confederacy and everyone in it you can be part of that boys you can make a difference you can be all you can be despite himself arcturus found himself swept up in the general enthusiasm that filled the assembly hall the endlessly repeating images of handsome fulfilled soldiers and emillians charismatic delivery combined to make him feel that a life in the military might not be such a bad option captain emillian stood back and saluted the assembled boys and the two marines standing behind her repeated the gesture thunderous applause erupted and arcturus found himself standing with the other boys as they rose to their feet to give captain emillian a standing ovation she smiled and gave a shod bow turning to shake principal steegmans hand arcturus wanted to laugh at how ridiculously insignificant the man looked next to the armored marine steegman returned to his lectern and raised his hands for silence which was forthcoming only after a few minutes of clapping and wolf whistles when the boys sat down steegman said thank you captain emillian for those stirring words im sure you have given our senior year a lot to think about again scattered sniggers broke out amongst the assembled boys and now continued steegman oblivious to the effect his illchosen words were having i want you to take some time to collect some of the literature kindly provided by the confederate marine corps classes will resume in one hour so youll have plenty of time to gather anything you wish and talk with the marine recruiting sergeants arcturus followed steegmans gaze and saw a number of tables stacked high with pamphlets and books set out along the side of the assembly hall hed not noticed them before his attention captured by captain emillian and her dogandpony show tall attractive marines of both sexes in immaculately pressed dress uniforms of navy blue and gleaming brass stood behind each table hands clasped tightly behind their backs dismissed said principal steegman and there was a rush of bodies as the boys of the academy stood and made their way eagerly over to the tables arcturus followed the herd curious to see what might be on offer hold still will you said katherine mengsk fastening the red toga around her husbands shoulder with a bronze clasp this is hard enough as it is without you fidgeting all the time pain in the damn neck is what it is said angus remind me why i need to wear this tradition replied his wife tradition spat angus as though it were the filthiest swear word he knew you cant very well give the close of session speech to the senate in that old suit of yours now can you dear fine said angus but why are you making me wear it now the speech isnt for another two months achton feld concealed a smile at anguss pouting and complaining as his wife turned him this way and that to alter the cut and hang of the ceremonial robes of a senator of korhal the robes were heavy and uncomfortablelooking but the governmental apparatus of korhal had a long tradition of pomp and ceremony where its procedures were concerned because dear said katherine patiently it needs a few adjustments its been a few years since you wore it and you are not as sylphlike as once you were so youre saying im fat said angus not at all replied katherine lightly merely more statesmanlike angus looked unconvinced and feld rose from his chair and made his way to the skyspires balcony window as he felt his employers gaze linger on him daring him to laugh at his discomfort feld shifted the holster beneath his jacket wincing as his shoulder pulled stiffly from where the doctors had removed six impaler spikes from him hed been told he was lucky to be alive four inches to the side and his lungs would have been perforated months of agonizing skin grafts and bone reconstruction surgery had given him plenty of opportunities to curse that luck when tin pain meds wore off and left him with bonedeep ache that not even scotch could obliterate katherine continued to fuss over angus and feld left them to it activating the force field that protected the balcony and heading outside the energy shield had cost a small fortune and not only protected the balcony from ballistic projectiles energy weapons and electronic surveillance but also kept out the winds that howled around so high a structure feld made his way over to the handcrafted ironwork barrier at the edge of the balcony and gently rested his elbows on it as he leaned out and admired the view as far as views went it was up there with the best of them the upper balcony of the mengsks tower was on the one hundred and sixtieth floor of the building some eight hundred meters above street level the mountains to the north reared up like the ramparts of a giants castle and to the south the landscape became progressively greener until it reached the azure line of the ocean on a clear day such as this the distant coastline was visible and you could see the summer villa as an oblong of white through the optical viewer that sat on its tripod on the edge of the balcony the city of styrling was laid out before feld in a grid of silver with soaring lowers rising to either side of the skyspire like stalagmites of steel and glass from here the sheer scale and life of the city was apparent and that such a vast conurbation had been built in so short a time was testament to the ingenuity and dedication of the people of korhal that it had been achieved in the face of rampant confederate corruption made it all the more impressive feld loved styrling from here he could see the green of the martial field the site of korhals establishment as a member planet of the confederacy that day had been filled with so much promise so many years ago but now as a parade ground for confederate marines the martial field served only as a bitter reminder of how bad things had become across from the martial field was the palatine forum home of the korhal senate its bronze roof shone like a beacon shimmering like molten gold in the sunlight inspiring isnt it said angus appearing at felds side on the balcony reminds you what were trying to achieve for a big man angus mengsk could move silently when he wanted to feld hadnt heard him approach yeah its some view agreed feld the jewel in the crown of the confederacy they call it ive heard and now you want to pluck that jewel right from under them said angus with a smile its not their jewel to keep not anymore and what will we do if we win asked feld if we win said angus dont you think we can defeat the confederacy i dont care anymore said feld standing up straight and stretching his shoulder i just want to hurt them oh well do that my friend have no fear of that promised angus you really think we can bring them down i do angus said nodding i wouldnt be doing this if i didnt believe that it may not happen in our lifetimes but what we start here will be the beginning of something truly exceptional even a landslide has to start with a single pebble eh thats true conceded feld the influence of the confederacy is spreading continued angus warming to his theme as he always did when talking of his hatred of corruption but the people with the power to lake action are the very ones who wont recognize that theres a terrible malignancy at the head of that power why do you think that is it must be obvious surely of course it is but recognizing the problem creates a moral obligation to then do something about it said angus and too many people have too vested an interest to take action but not you the old families and the council can make things difficult for me yes but all the mengsk businesses are largely selfsufficient we own every part of the process involved in my factories from the hovercar plants to the aai production lines theres nowhere for them to squeeze us not legally ive no doubt that the confeds will throw money at any number of pirate bands or mercenary troops to cause us trouble off world but weve come too far to give up now pretty soon well be able to do more than plant bombs or ambush lone squads of marines soon well be able to declare war feld heard the unmistakable relish in anguss tone and wondered if the senator truly appreciated what was at stake in taking on the awesome power of the confederacy lives had already been lost and confederate troops were cracking down hard all across korhal early morning raids on those they suspected of terrorist activities were commonplace and only felds rigorous insistence on watertight security and isolation among the various active cells had kept the integrity of the fledgling resistance movement intact though korhal wasnt yet under anything that resembled martial law it wouldnt take much to force the confederates hand lets walk before we run cautioned feld if we rush things we risk losing everything youre right of course said angus but the moment is coming where the scales will start to tip and if we dont act when it comes well miss it and its coming soon achton the guns and tech being brought in from umoja makes us stranger every day our men are now almost as well equipped as the marines that was true reflected feld every day shipments of industrial parts for the mengsk factories came from umoja via a number of dummy corporations and along circuitous freighter routes innocuously labeled and accompanied by all the correct documentation these freighters cargo containers were laden with the guns ammunition explosives armor and technology that allowed the korhal freedom fighters to wreak havoc on the confeds at the behest of angus mengsk i never thought ailin pasteur would come through like he has hes a good man ailin and not to be underestimated said angus ive no doubt hes helping us more for the umojan cause than our own but ill take whatever i can get hes still coming back for your close of session speech angus nodded indeed he and juliana are returning to korhal at the end of the week his daughters coming said feld making no effort to hide his irritation that wasnt in the security briefs itll complicate things why wasnt i told i just heard this morning said angus his tone neutral apparently my son has asked ailins daughter to accompany him to his graduation ball and irritatingly she has accepted feld looked away cursing arcturus for adding this unnecessary burden to his already overworked security staff in addition to the extra security measures he had instituted since the attack on the summer villa feld had assigned men to keep watch on each member of the mengsk family katherine was relatively easy to protect as she kept close to angus and dorothy was escorted to and from her preschool playgroup but arcturus seemed to delight in making felds life difficult and this was surely another of his schemes lo test felds patience great said feld another problem i could do without as if you werent making things difficult enough i know what youre going to say achton and the answers still no feld knew he was fighting a losing battle with angus but that didnt stop him from trying look said feld you need more guards when you make your walk to the forum youre too exposed and if you dont let me put more men on the ground beside you i cant guarantee your safely i told you said angus his tone suggesting he was growing weary of having this argument i wont walk to the senate surrounded by armed soldiers i cant look as though im traveling as a war leader for now i need to be seen as the voice of peace but but nothing said angus thats the end of it ive already consented to the ruinous cost of a personal force field which im not happy about but i will not be surrounded by soldiers the forum is a place of democracy and debate and lennox craven will call me a tyrant or a usurper if i walk in with armed men at my back its your funeral said feld im just telling you what i think hey i could have taken a cushy job on brontes getting paid a fortune to babysit rich kids you know so why didnt you feld sighed hell id have died of boredom you know that youre a man of action agreed angus and you are my friend so it means a lot to me to know how worked up youre getting over my safety just remember that force fields going to give you only a few minutes protection just enough to get you to the forum yes so youve told me a dozen times already feld shook his head with a rueful smile i still get paid if you die right honestly feld i swear youre worse than my mother ever was she was a sensible woman your mother said feld pah theres nothing to worry about feld said angus youre jumping at ghosts nothing more the press of bodies around the tables had eased now and arcturus lifted one of the pamphlets an animated graphic of the confederate flag billowed beneath the words the confederate marine corpsa place for heroes the two marines who had stood immobile behind captain emillian circulated throughout the assembly hall demonstrating aspects of their armor and allowing students to handle their agr gauss rifles arcturus replaced the pamphlet as the marine recruiting sergeant loomed over the table he could smell the polish of the brass on the mans uniform and the sweet slightly sickly aroma of gun oil the marines face was open and earnest but devoid of any real personality thinking of joining up son asked the man maybe said arcturus i havent decided its an honorable profession son said the marine and arcturus noticed the telltale bump of resocialization scars just above the neckline of his uniforms collar as he bent down when did you enlist asked arcturus six years ago and never looked back said the marine automatically and arcturus caught the whiff of words said by rote best decision i ever made son let me tell you ive traveled all over the koprulu sector seen all kinds of worlds and met me plenty of interesting folks and killed them finished arcturus mischievously well lets put that to one side just now suggested the marine whats your name son arcturus mengsk pleasure to make your acquaintance arcturus now what you need to think of are all the opportunities the corps can offer you travel selfrespect honor discipline well have you interrupted arcturus killed anyone i mean see here arcturus said the marine sergeant being a marine means you got to kill people sometimes but only those as deserve it when bad folks are trying to kill me or my buddies it aint no choice when someones got a gun pointed at you well theres only thing you can do right i suppose it depends on why theyre pointing the gun al you said arcturus making trouble are you mengsk said a voice behind him and arcturus recognized the supercilious tones of principal steegman not at all sir said arcturus turning on his heel just finding out what id be getting into a stint in the military would do you a power of good mengsk said steegman knock some of the smartass out of you bit of military discipline would soon sort you out i wasnt aware i needed sorting out sir steegman leaned in close and arcturus had to resist the urge to cough at the overpowering reek of the mans aftershave i know your type mengsk hissed steegman if i had my way id have you all drafted a dose of military training is just what a boy needs to turn him into a man before steegman could press his point a shadow fell over him and arcturus looked up into the face of angelina emillian up close she was even more impressive the bulk of her combat armor giving her an extra foot of height over arcturus who wasnt exactly small she absolutely towered over principal steegman and what unit did you serve with principal steegman excuse me captain emillian smiled sweetly displaying perfect teeth in a perfect smile i merely asked what unit you served with in your time with the military i uhhavent said steegman i mean that is to say i couldnt arcturus bit his lip to hide his amusement at steegmans discomfort and kept his eyes downcast when he looked up he saw steegman staring at him his face florid with embarrassment i wonder if i might have a word with mr mengsk asked emillian steegman nodded curtly and all but fled from the marine captain i think i love you said arcturus with a broad grin you wouldnt be the first returned captain emillian arcturus watched principal sleegmans departing back and said hes always made out he served in the military but id always suspected he was lying to be fair he did apply to join the colonial fleet but he failed the entrance exams and couldnt pass the physical and between you and me the physicals for the fleet are a cakewalk well thank you for sparing me from him captain said arcturus mr mengsk said emillian as he turned away yes i didnt save you from your principals attentions out of the goodness of my heart i do actually want to speak with you oh well of course said arcturus pleased the captain had singled him out he could see his fellow students looking over with envious eyes and relished the attention being lavished upon him thank you sergeant devlin said emillian addressing yhe marine still standing to attention behind arcturus that will be all the marine sergeant snapped a smart salute yes maam with that captain emillian strode off her hands clasped behind her back and arcturus was forced to step lively to catch up with her do you always bring resocialized marines to recruitment drives asked arcturus most of the time said emillian they dont make great speakers but they do a good job in giving the right answers to students questions so what did he do asked arcturus sergeanl devlin what did he do i dont know replied emillian those files are sealed once youre a marine resoclalized or otherwise your past life is irrelevant youre a marine plain and simple how very egalitarian but i dont think thats entirely true is it no its not but would you rather bear how he murdered his entire family with a butcher knife or maybe that he enjoyed molesting small boys in the park i see your point said arcturus looking over his shoulder at the bland face of sergeant devlin and imagining it contorted with rage a bloody knife in his hand the few the proud the psychotic said arcturus youre trying to make fun of us but it wont work arcturus said emillian with a smile no why not because i already know youre thinking of joining up i am said arcturus and how would you know such a thing i know more about you than you think ive seen your test scores and read your psych profile i know you have fine leadership skills and a confidence that makes people want to follow you i know that you have a problem with authority figures you consider your inferiors and that your iq is at the upper end of genius level those files are classified said arcturus more irritated at her spoton assessment of his personality than at the violation of his privacy he didnt like to be so easily read by others yes they are but principal steegman allowed us to read up on his finalyear students before we came here today makes selecting likely candidates for recruitment much easier isnt that against the law almost certainly arcturus was surprised at emillians easy admission and smiled as he realized why shed allowed it youre trying to put me at ease by sharing a secret he said if youve read my psych profile then you think ill trust you more if i think youre being honest with me and appeal to my sense of rebelliousness captain emillian nodded very good is it working a little admitted arcturus enjoying the backandforth he was sharing with this attractive warrior woman so tell me arcturus said emillian slopping at one of the sergeants booths and lifting a handful of different flyers what do you want to do with yourself once you leave the academy i was thinking of becoming a prospector traveling to the fringe worlds and exploring the edge of space theres planets there that even the confederacy hasnt set foot on i want to leave my mark on historyname a planet discover something no ones ever seen before you know the usual a prospector said emillian thais an honorable profession did you know the corps can help you with that really how most of our tours take place out on the fringe worlds we deal with miners all the time youd be able to pick up some real firsthand experience dealing with mines miners and the like not to mention the training youd get on your downtime the further education facilities on our fleet ships are second to none equipped with the very best in neural interface mnemotutors you could learn entire new skill sets while you slept sounds interesting said arcturus surprised to find he was actually intrigued you could do a lot worse than the corps said emillian handing him the flyers shed picked up with your test scores you easily qualify for officer training and once youve completed your basic service youre free to leave if you want and use the skills youve learned in the military and apply them in civilian life ahmy basic service said arcturus how long would that be the corps offers a range of flexible terms said emillian smoothly it all depends on your circumstances and the current threat level as defined by high command and whats the current threat level emillian smiled low she said chapter graduation day arcturus felt a nervous thrill of excitement coursing though him at the thought of finally escaping the confines of styrling academy after the marine corps recruitment morning arcturus had found his thoughts returning more and more to the idea of joining up he had even filled in the electronic application form though he had not yet submitted it the idea of learning the skills of a prospector while being paid by the confederacy appealed to him as did the idea that it would drive his father up the wall and given the current low level of threat in the koprulu sector it seemed likely that he would need to serve only a minimum of three years before he was eligible to resign his commission and begin his life as a prospector yes the idea had its merits but in the back of his mind he couldnt shut out the idea that his life would be at risk and arcturus hated the idea of placing himself in physical danger wasnt that what the marines were for to keep danger away he put the military from his mind and concentrated on the day at hand he had enough to concentrate on without creating distractions styrling academy was bathed in sunlight the gray granite shining like marble and imparting a sense of modernity to the building a wide stage had been set up on the lawn before the main portico with row upon row of seats facing it the hundred and fiftysix students of the senior year who were graduating and that was all of them for an institution of the stature of styrling academy did not allow its students to do anything so prosaic as fall sat in these seats dressed in long black capes edged with pale blue silk and wearing mortarboard hats bleachers had been set up on either side of the seats in the center of the lawn and proud parents sat watching their offspring finally graduate from school behind the lectern at which principal steegman handed out goldedged scrolls containing diplomas sat the tutors and masters of the academy accompanying them were distinguished alumni of the academy ceos of major corporations noted academics patrons of the arts senior marine commanders and even the chief of the styrling police force the principal of slyrling academy was dressed in his full ceremonial robes of black and gold complete with scarlet chasuble and tall conical hatwhich made him look like a cockaded martinetand arcturus was sure he was concealing height augmenters beneath his robes the school band played rousing tunes as the students walked toward the stage one by one and accepted their diploma from steegman to the hearty applause of their parents and the curl applause of those whose sons or daughters had already accepted their diplomas or had yet to receive them by virtue of his surname arcturus was in the middle of the list of names being called out by a lower school prefect and he eagerly awaited his turn to take the walk to the stage he glanced over at the bleachers smiling as he saw his family watching with pride dorothy saw him looking and waved enthusiastically his mother gave a more restrained wave and even his father gave him a proud nod of acknowledgment sitting next to his father was ailin pasteur and beside him was juliana it was the first time arcturus had seen juliana since the attack on the summer villa and he was struck again by her stunning beauty aside from her being someone to write to arcturus hadnt thought of her much but seeing her here in the flesh reminded him of the desire she had stirred in him upon their first meeting the student next to him a panbrained moron by the name of toby mercurio fallowed his gaze and said whos the curve mengsk sweet looker mercurio was from one of styrlings nouveau riche families and had little in the way of breeding still using slang imported from the gutter of tarsonis despite that arctunis couldnt fault his conclusion yes agreed arcturus looking forward to the graduation ball that evening sweet is exactly what she is you taking her to the ball tonight i am indeed toby arcturus tuned out mercurios nonsensical banter and concentrated on the names being called out he smiled as he heard names beginning with к being called out not long now the ks didnt last too long and arcturus felt his heart rate flutter as his own name was called he rose from his seat glancing over his shoulder to where his family watched and strode out into the aisle between the two rows of seats the clapping of the students was somewhat muted but arcturus knew they would soon be changing their tune he walked with his head held high reaching the front of the stage and making his way to the steps at the side the school photographer took a vidsnap and arcturus lifted his gaze toward where he knew his mother and father would be recording the event on holocam arcturus smiled for the photographer then ascended the steps and walked casually across the stage to where principal steegman walled with a goldrimmed diploma arcturus fixed his most ingratiating smile across his face and extended his hand to receive the scroll it was traditional for the principal to congratulate a graduating student and wish him well in his future endeavors but arcturus had no illusions that steegman would make any such gesture he was not to be disappointed youll come to a rotten end mengsk said steegman handing him the diploma i can always tell the bad ones and youre the worst of the lot arcturus took the proffered scroll in his left hand and offered his right to steegman which his being unwilling to appear ungracious before the parents and alumni the principal shook thank you said arcturus i hope you enjoy your new residence steegmans face registered confusion but he quickly recovered and waved arcturus off the stage arcturus swiftly made his way around the back of the seated students holding his diploma up with a smile for his mother and father to see juliana was on her feet clapping and staring at him with rapt adoration and arcturus smiled he walked back to his seat and quickly fished his remote terminal console from within his coat pocket little more than a simple communications device with an optical reader the console nevertheless had the capability to tap into computer networks remotely so long as you had the connection key and authorization codes you could get into pretty much any network without too much trouble arcturus quickly tapped in the codes for steegmans console long since having memorized the details from the many times he had been summoned to the principals office and seen them entered in the mirror behind the idiots desk numbers and letters flashed across the screen for several seconds until a small square appeared on the screen with a line of text beneath it dna verification required arcturus pressed a fingertip onto the optical reader and a green light flashed on the screen identity confirmed isaac steegman he laid the console down on his knee and peeled off the thin transparent coating hed coated his right hand with before walking out onto the graduation field the oneway biomimetic gel had been simplicity itself to create in the academys chemlabs and would disintegrate in the sunlight within a few moments now that hed removed it arcturus picked up the console once more and opened steegmans private directories using a linguistic algorithm based on a few wellchosen keywords he quickly discovered the files hed known hed find my god he didnt even try and hide them arcturus laughed whats that asked toby mercurio sitting back down next to him with his diploma youll see arcturus said with a smile just wait quickly and methodically he highlighted every file his algorithm had turned up then set his console to scan the surrounding area for fones and other personal consoles hundreds of personal designations scrolled past on the screen his fathers and the spf chiefs amongst them and arcturus set the console lo send the selected files to every one of them arcturuss finger hovered over the send icon and he hesitated for the briefest second savoring the moment to the victor go the spoils he whispered and pressed send angus rested his arms on the balcony of the skyspire as he stared out over the nighttime cityscape of styrling during the day the view was impressive but at night it was something truly spectacular an ocean of light spread across the hinterlands that sprawled from the mountains a web of interconnected light that reflected on the underside of the clouds with a warm golden glow despite the turmoil engulfing korhal the bombings the unrest and the confederate crackdowns being up here at night always brought angus peace looking over the city from the balcony gave him a sense of perspective he often lacked when dealing with the minutiae of the life he had chosen sometimes it was good to step back from what you were doing and look at the larger picture yes things were hard just now but with every blow struck against the tyranny of the confederacy their hold on korhal slipped a little further angus scratched a longagohealed scar on his forearm earned on a hunting trip with his father in the forests of keresh province to the east which had taught him that there was no more dangerous a beast than a cornered one achton feld had called korhal the jewel in the confederates crown which was an apt description and the council and the old families werent going to give it up without a fight well they were going to find out just how much the people of korhal wanted them gone angus could feel his anger growing as he turned the many injustices inflicted upon the people of the koprulu sector over in his mind on tyrador x confederate meddling and illegal financial dealings had caused the planetary economy to collapse resulting in mass unemployment on a global scale only extensive loans complete with ruinous rates of interest and economic restructuring that placed the entire system in the hands of the old families had prevented entire comments of people from starving to death another favorite tactic was to set up lossleading businesses on the fringe worlds where the old families monopolies were not ironcladto run local competitors out of business once any competition was eliminated those same businesses would begin charging extortionate prices for basic necessities while the use of corrupt business stratagems was the confederacys preferred modus operandi the old families were not above using force to take what they wanted a prospecting team from the kelmorian combine exploiting the paladino belt an asteroid field containing huge mineral reserves within the larger rocks had been eliminated when cmc forces launched an assault to capture its leader a man apparently wanted for murder on tarsonis the deaths were described as a tragedy but within days a confederate mining team was working the field complete with marine garrison and battlecruiser support hundreds of similar stories were the common currency of the confederacy tales of greed bribery corruption and nepotism told over a drink with a resigned shrug and a shake of the head the injustice of it all screamed out for someone to fix the problem but the scale of the confederacy was such that no one could do anything it was the way of things said people angus mengsk was going to prove that belief wrong he did not relish the thought that he had brought violence to the streets and cities of korhal but he knew that it was the only way to wake people up to what was going on around them already things were beginning to change here angus was bringing the flagrant abuses of power perpetuated by the confederacy to light and the people were finally opening their eyes and they did not like what they were seeing when you watched a tale of misuse of power on the unn it was far away and thus easily forgotten but when trouble hit close to home it was harder to ignore and when those misuses of power began to threaten your livelihood and the future of your family even the most torpid of viewers would be forced to take a stand angus did not want power for himself and he had no desire to replace the faceless conscienceless council with a tyrant of his own making no when the confederacy fell he would become part of the process of creating a democratic government that sought to benefit all mankind not one that served the will of one man he sensed a presence behind him and smiled as he caught the fragrance of epiphany his wifes perfume angus turned to see katherine standing in the green dress of shimmering taffeta with navy bodice she had worn to arcturuss graduation ceremony earlier that day you look beautiful kat said angus accepting one of the thinstemmed wineglasses his wife carried youve told me that already today but dont let that stop you katherine smiled never said angus how did i ever convince you to marry me you didnt i asked you remember angus sipped his wine i maneuvered you into a position where you had no choice you keep on thinking that it was a familiar pantomime one he and his wife often played out in the few moments they had together in private away from prying eyes and the needs of business and revolution theirs had been a tempestuous courtship for both were passionate independent individuals who did not like to be overshadowed by another but through it all they had felt a shared need for companionship recognizing that being one half of a couple could be as liberating as freedom their wedding had been the most glorious day of his life and throughout their entire married life they had been pillars of strength for one another supporting each other through times of bliss and despair and never wavering in their love katherine leaned her head on his shoulder and angus kissed the top of her head dorothy asleep he asked out like a light said katherine today really took it out of her bless her im not surprised yes it was quite a day wasnt it said katherine and angus laughed so hard tears rolled down his cheeks when he had composed himself he said you always did have a knack for understatement dear it had indeed been quite a day a day that had seen his son finally graduate and the principal of styrling academy hauled off to jail by a former student when anguss fone had trilled in his pocket he had been irritated at the interruption of his sons graduation day for he had left strict instructions with all his subordinates that he was not to be disturbed then he had heard a multitude of clicks bleeps and whistles of hundreds of fones and personal consoles receiving incoming data streams a ripple of consternation spread throughout the crowd and angus felt his stomach lurch as he saw that the originating signal belonged to arcturuss console oh cod whats he done now angus whispered as his fones screen lit up and a number of files opened his practiced eye quickly scanned the contents and his anger built as he flipped though the various statements and account records the thieving little bastard hissed angus looking up and seeing that same anger on scores of other faces now staring in fury at the principal of styrling academy i told you he was nothing more than a damn crook who asked katherine puzzled at the suddenly tense atmosphere steegman barked angus making dorothy flinch these are his private accounts the little toads siphoned millions from the school treasury and fundraisers over the years people were getting to their feet now an angry hubbub of voices cutting through the sound of the band and the shouted names of graduating students onstage steegman looked puzzled and angry at the disruption calling for quiet and order but as an irate school governor marched over and thrust a portable console in front of him his face blanched in horror as he realized what the entire audience had just read looking back over the day angus chuckled as he remembered steegmans halfhearted attempts to calm the situation violence had been averted only by the chief of the spfs hauling the principal away and bundling him into his groundcar to the uproarious cheers and applause of the entire student body the news had traveled fast for arcturus had been thorough in his dissemination of steegmans files and within the hour the scandal was being reported on the unn steegman was not connected to anyone of influence and a great deal of the money he had stolen had come from some very wealthy very powerful families they would throw steegman to the wolves and the courts were sure to show him no mercy in the aftermath of steegmans arrest the vice principal had tried to calm the situation but gave up in the face of a horde of angry parents and jubilant students who cheered and hurled their mortarboards into the air a near riot had only been avoided by the contagious glee of the students who danced and laughed and sang as steegman was driven away in disgrace recriminations and a thorough investigation of the depths of the principals corruption were sure to follow with steegmans departure the staff and parents milled around in confusion until the vice principal led them off into the main administration block like a marching mob leaving the jubilant students to continue the party on the main lawn some of the academys masters had wanted to cancel the graduation ball planned for the evening but after the days amusements it was clear the students werent going to allow this day of festivities lo end so quickly now with the day behind them angus and katherine stood and drank wine as the architect of the days mischief enjoyed his graduation ball i should be angry at him said angus who asked katherine arcturus who else katherine chuckled i know but its hard to be angry with him for today after all hes graduated now and you cant say steegman didnt deserve what happened oh he deserved it all right agreed angus with a smile and to get his just desserts so publicly i almost dont mind losing the money to have been there to see it katherine leaned up and kissed him on the cheek what was that for do i need a reason to kiss my husband no never good im proud of you said katherine you know that dont you angus nodded i know that im proud of you both you and arcturus youre very alike you know angus furrowed his brow and turned to face his wife the boy is willful hes his fathers son katherine pointed out laughing angus grunted unwilling to concede the point he has a fine mind and the capacity to achieve anything and he wants to waste that talent on prospecting flying around the fringe worlds and associating with backwater hicks and kelmorian pirates its no life for a mengsk were made for bigger and better things than that if i didnt know you better id say that was arrogance speaking said katherine you know its not though countered angus i know you see it tooyouve told the boy often enough that he can be great if he wants to be thats just it isnt it it has to be if he wants it you should know by now you cant make arcturus do anything he doesnt want to the more you try and force him down a path the more hell resist you willful said angus again though his tone was mellow this time just as you were pointed out katherine until you met me angus took a drink of wine and leaned down lo kiss her then lets just hope that the women in his life are as wise and calming as you katherine smiled at him and angus mengsk knew he was the luckiest man alive the assembly hall had been transformed on every other day it was an austere cold place of announcements the news of sports results and dull speeches but now it was a place of festivities hundreds of students filled the hall drinking dancing and reveling in the sheer fun of the day of course the only topic of conversation was steegmans arrest and arcturuss part in his downfall music pounded from the stage colorful lights flashed from the ceiling streamers trailed from every wall and even the portraits had been hung with fake beards and noses the balls theme was aliens from another world and a floating banner of light shone with the words class of they came from the stars papiermache creatures of all descriptions hung from the roof beams on wires reared from punch bowls or emerged from lovingly detailed lairs set against the walls the students imaginations had run riot and the past week had seen a frenzy of creation in the art classes a carnival of grotesque creatures filled the assembly hall giant lizards bulbous floating jellyfish with multiple eyes snakelike creatures with whipping tails and tentacles for mouths at the edge of the stage sharklike creatures mingled with hairy multilegged spiders with long necks and terrifying mandibles arcturus knew the subject of alien life had been an obsession with mankind ever since it had first looked up into the night sky in fear and wonder thus the abject failure of the confederacys science and exploration vessels to find any sign of surviving intelligent alien life was a source of constant frustration to those who believed that the human race was not alone in the galaxy of course a few explorers were said to have unearthed ancient ruins they claimed were the remnants of alien civilizations but most people believed these to be elaborate hoaxes then there were the big insect creatures on umoja which had been domesticated by the people of that world but they hardly counted as intelligent life even the band was dressed in alien costumes made up with latex prosthetics to look like fearsome creatures with gnarled foreheads long hair and jagged spiky armor the effect was more comic than frighteningsomething arcturus suspected was half the point he normally detested such events but had to admit he was enjoying himself immensely perhaps he was still on a high from this afternoons unmasking of steegmans crimes after all it had been deeply satisfying to see the odious little man led away and he had made sure the principal knew exactly whod uncovered his crimes and destroyed his life it might also have been due to the attractive girl on his arm for juliana pasteur was without fear of contradiction the most beautiful creature in the room but if he was honest arcturus knew it was none of these thingsit was the acclaim accorded him by his fellow students and the near worship in which he was now held his former status of pariah had been forgotten now that steegman was gone and arcturus suddenly occupied a position more akin to a war hero it was quite intoxicating arcturus said juliana as the volume of the music dropped hmmm he said you looked miles away she said offering him a glass of punch sorry he said with a winning smile accepting the glass as he returned his attention to the beautiful girl standing next to him juliana pasteur wore an anklelength gown of ivory silk with a velveteen bodice that hugged her budding figure and which accentuated her delicate features blonde hair spilled around her bare shoulders in golden ringlets and a fine silver necklace set with an umojan sapphire hung down her neck he took a sip of the punch and raised an eyebrow theres alcohol in this juliana nodded i saw some students emptying some bottles in earlier but i dont think anyones going to mind not after today no arcturus grinned i suppose not juliana took his hand and smiled at him over the months they had corresponded he had reveled in the power he seemed to have over her but with her here next to him he now fully appreciated the reality of what he had done everything in julianas body language told arcturus that she had fallen for him which was ridiculous given the few times they had actually met truth be told he didnt know quite what to do with that for while he liked her and found her engaging company he certainly didnt reciprocate the strength of her feelings dance with me said juliana as the band struck up the opening bars of a song with a more relaxed tempo that saw couples all over the room make their way to the dance floor with no chaperones present the students of styrling academy werent about to waste this opportunity for some dancing that involved full body contact dance said arcturus i dont think that juliana took his drink from him before he could protest then put her own down as well that wasnt a request she said leading him onto the dance floor arcturus followed her nervous at the prospect of making a fool of himself but pleased at the attention he and juliana were garnering arcturus had to admit they made an attractive couple juliana in her ivory gown and he in his exquisitely cut tuxedo and golden cummerbund the idea of kissing her leapt to the forefront of his mind and suddenly the idea of dancing close to juliana didnt seem nearly so bad she turned to face him holding up her arms you do dance dont you not for a long time he admitted taking her left hand and placing his right hand on her hip my mother made me take lessons when i was young in preparation for my entrance into soclely i always haled them dont worry promised juliana moving his hand lo her backside youll be fine i fear i may not be the dancer you hope for trust me arcturus itll all come back well dont say i didnt warn you if i trample those expensive shoes juliana smiled and they began to move in time with the music arcturus thought hed forgotten the steps of those longago lessons but sure enough after his first faltering steps he began to move with the music instead of against it he and juliana flowed naturally into the rhythm of their shared movement and he felt like hed just stepped out of dance class a series of dancers spun past them the girls offering compliments to juliana on her outfit and the boys hearty congratulations to arcturus for having steegman sent down they really like you here said juliana looking up at him you must be sad to leave arcturus laughed and shook his head not even a little bit he said really i think im going to be sad when i leave the umoja institute next year thats because you are well liked and dont have a troublesome embarrassing father well since youre so glad to get out of school what are you going to do with yourself arcturus didnt answer at first wondering how much he should tell her of his plans for the future for she clearly wanted to be part of them i still want to be a prospector he said but i dont think thats what ill do first no then what said juliana pressing herself closer to him i think i might join the marine corps juliana looked up sharply at him the marine corps yes i think it would be good to have some military service on my record said arcturus arcturus could see she was uncomfortable about his joining the marines but whether it was from any concern for his safety or through moral objections he couldnt yet tell what do you think he asked iim not sure said juliana it sounds dangerous but if its what you want to do its a steppingstone nothing more said arcturus its not like i plan to stay in the military once im done ill muster out and be a prospector just like i always planned your father wont like it i dont give a damn if he likes it or not snapped arcturus its my life and ill do what i want not what he thinks i ought to do ill be eighteen next week and theres nothing he can do to stop me juliana looked into his eyes seeing the steely determination there and nodded then i think its wonderful i just know youll be the best soldier theyve ever had arcturus wanted to laugh at how easily juliana had come around to his way of thinking despite the anticonfederate propaganda her father was no doubt feeding her youll be a general within six months she said my hero sensing a moment of opportunity arcturus let go of julianas hand and tilted her chin upward with a light touch of his fingertips she guessed what he was doing and closed her eyes her lips parting slightly as he leaned in their lips met and they kissed julianas skin was warm to the touch and her lips were soft she held him lightly as though afraid to let him go and the students closest to them cheered at the sight arcturus felt a surge of vindication at the sound understanding exactly what it meant it meant he could have anything he wanted chapter thousands of people lined senators parade the marblepaved street that led from the martial field to the palatine forum their cheers were deafening and achlon feld had to concentrate to hear the updates from his men over the mike nestled in his ear he had been awake since dawn overseeing the lastminute preparations for angus mengsks walk through the heart of the city after the attack on the summer villa feld had increased security around the senator but this had been the moment he had been dreading for weeks anguss natural disregard for any threats to his person had given feld dozens of sleepless nights as he worried about confederate assassins lone nutcases or simply a zealous supporter of lennox craven to watch for such a threat feld had men spread throughout the crowd equipped with detectors attuned to the spectral frequency of the alloys used in the ammo of slugthrowers and spike pistols thai would detect the most common firearms but he knew that if anyone in the crowd carried a more sophisticated weapon it would need to be visually recognized the atmosphere was electric and the mood of the crowd was jubilant which was something to be thankful for as they awaited anguss arrival today was the final day of the korhal senates sitting for the year and it was traditional for a senator chosen by popular acclaim to deliver the close of session speech ever since he had taken a stand against the tyranny of confederate rule it had been clear that it would be angus mengsk the people of korhal would choose to deliver the speech feld looked along the length of senators parade steel barriers keeping the crowd from the road banners with anguss name on them were held high alongside flags with the wolfhead emblem of the mengsk family crest the route itself was clear and the gleaming white structure of the forum shone like a beacon of light at its end the roof blazed in the summer sunlight as though afire and even feld had to admit that it was an impressive sight all being well angus would walk through the great oaken doors of the forum and stand before the assembled senators and visiting planetary dignitaries to deliver his speech and after thatwell after that the dynamic between korhal and the confederacy would be changed forever feld heard a double click in his earpiece and felt a jolt of adrenaline hit his system angus was on his way sure enough feld saw the silver terra cougar as it pulled slowly around the curve of the road that led to where he awaited his employer and friend the groundcar moved slowly and feld silently willed it to hurry up as the noise of the crowd grew louder with word of anguss arrival at last the groundcar pulled up and feld moved quickly to open the door the door slid upward and angus mengsk emerged from within resplendent in his bright red toga angus stood tall waving to the crowd with his head held high his smile warm and genuine katherine mengsk followed him from the car and feld did a slow double take at the sight of her she was dressed in a simple yet elegant dress of cornflower blue her long dark hair bound up in a flattering style that brought out the classical lines of her cheekbones angus turned back and took katherines hand but before he could walk to the end of senators parade feld stepped close and said what the hell are you doing angus im walking toward the forum achton said angus through his smile what does it look like im doing it looks like youre blatantly disregarding the security plan we discussed what is katherine doing here she was supposed to meet you at the forum i didnt like that plan said angus now get out of my way im going to walk to the forum with my wife and i dont want you next to me like a guard dog at my heel do you want to get killed asked feld is that it dont be ridiculouseven the confederacy wouldnt try anything today scoffed angus and were both shielded by that force field of yours nothings going to happen feld stepped back and allowed angus to walk past him angry beyond words that the senator had so casually thrown out the security plan designed to keep him safe angus was probably right that nothing would happen today but in felds experience it was usually just at that momentwhen you lowered your guardthat your enemies struck cursing anguss need for dramatic gestures feld quickly broadcast an update on the security situation to his men in the crowd and closed the groundcars door thankful that angus hadnt gone the whole hog and decided to bring dorothy along the vehicle would follow a discreet distance behind angus in case a speedy exit was called for and feld just hoped it would not be needed setting off alongside the groundcar feld scanned the crowd as angus began his walk to the sounds of ecstatic cheers and howls of support every face was fixed on angus and his glamorous wife any one of them could be a potential threatm feld knew i should have taken that job on brontes he thought angus felt the mood of the people surging through him and knew hed made the right decision to bring katherine along with him he was just sorry he hadnt decided to ask his wife to bring dorothy and arcturus but quickly discarded that thought bringing a child as young as little dot to an event like this would be foolish and arcturus well his son would never have agreed anyway they had spoken little since the events of graduation day his dealings with ailin pasteur and preparations for todays events taking up the bulk of his time in any case arcturus had been spending most of his time since leaving the academy with pasteurs daughter the only real time angus and his son had spoken had been yesterday at breakfast where despite his wifes warning glance angus had broached the subject of what arcturus was planning on doing with his life i havent decided yet said arcturus and anguss political instincts sensed evasion i could set up an interview with nestor jurgens said angus nonchalantly he runs one of my machine tooling factories in fairstens hes a good manyou could learn a lot from him what would i want to learn from a factory manager said arcturus nestors more than just a factory manager replied angus irritated at his sons ingratitude all my managers effectively run their businesses autonomously theyre ceos and financial managers all in one though of course they answer to me youre eighteen now and youd learn the ropes of what it takes to succeed in the industrial marketplace and acquire the skills youll need if youre going to succeed me succeed you spat arcturus i have plans of my own i thought you said you hadnt decided on what you wanted to do well i have when arcturus didnt continue angus sat back are you going to keep us all in suspense youll find out said arcturus and angus hadnt liked the sound of that one bit after arcturuss stunt at graduation day angus knew his sons mind could work in the most devious ways arcturus had excused himself from breakfast at that point and only dorothys spilling her cereal over the table had prevented angus from going after him and demanding to know what was going on angus pushed thoughts of arcturus from his mind as katherine gave his hand a squeeze he turned to her and kissed her cheek and the crowd went wild they walked along senators parade the shimmering whiteness of the forum drawing them ever onward a tall figure in a red toga stood at the top of the steps and angus smiled as he recognized lennox craven the senior consul of the senate and the man who would formally welcome him this must be killing him said angus having to welcome me in personally katherine didnt need to ask who he meant and smiled back im sure it is but i cant say i have any sympathy for him angus heard the steel in her voice knowing that katherine believed with utter certainty that craven had dispatched the men who had come to kill them in the summer villa she was probably right but without concrete proof there could be no public accusations im going to enjoy watching that bastard squirm said angus careful dear cautioned katherine waving to the crowd there are a dozen holocams on you and it would be bad form if someone lipread that from you very true said angus as always you are the soothing wind to my raging storm such is my role she smiled but just make sure you do make the bastard squirm lennox craven was not a man given to public displays of emotion but as he watched angus mengsk march toward him with barely disguised relish it was all he could do to keep the anger from his face dressed in a red toga identical to mengsks craven knew he was nowhere near as imposing or impressive a figure as his nemesis but then he had never set out to make himself a selfstyled man of the people he knew for a fact that mengsks public face was as manufactured as that of any of the dozens of vacuous actors and actresses that unns celebrity channel broadcast day and night mengsk might pretend to be the champion of the common man speaking out against the perceived injustices of the confederacy but hadnt he in fact benefited massively from all the council of tarsonis had done wasnt mengsk a wealthy man thanks to the very apparatus he so gleefully attacked with his speeches in the forum and his incessant interviews on unn no lennox craven knew the true face of angus mengsk which made it all the more galling that he had to stand here as though they were the greatest of friends it made him want to throw up even with bribes and calling in the many favors he was owed he had not been able to prevent angus from winning the hearts and minds of the people and the right to speak at the close of session the council had been most insistent angus mengsk must be silenced if one of the confederates most treasured and pampered worlds was seen to turn against them then it would only be a matter of time before others attempted to follow its example and that could not be allowed to happen his paymasters were demanding results and lennox craven had singularly failed to deliver them thousands upon thousands of people lined the streets and craven could not remember a time when such numbers had come out to watch a senator march to the forum he remembered the year he had been chosen to make the close of session speech and his bitterness at the apathy the people had displayed threatened to choke him in the face of anguss popularity he drew himself up to his full height as angus and his wife reached the bottom of the wide steps that climbed to the columned portico and the great black doors beyond which lay the grand debating chamber angus turned to give another wave to the cheering crowds raising both arms above his head and accepting their adulation he then turned and taking his wife by the hand began his ascent of the steps craven could see the relish in mengsks eyes and prayed the man would stumble and fall flat on his faceanything to puncture the pompous arrogance that surrounded him but angus reached the top of the steps without mishap and craven fixed a practiced smile across his features and assumed the dignified mien of a seasoned senator who was about to welcome one of his dearest friends angus mengsk youve brought quite a crowd with you he said by way of greeting and katherine you look radiant a pleasure to see you as always mengsks wife curtsied graciously and said thank you lennox angus mengsk came forward with his arms open and cravens smile faltered dear god was the man expecting an embrace the crowds roared and craven knew he would have to play along with this charade of friendship he opened his arms as mengsk swept him up in a crushing bear hug then awkwardly patted mengsks back in a suitably brotherly fashion hoping that this would suffice i know it was you who sent those men to kill me whispered mengsk i just wanted you to know that before i destroy you in there craven stiffened but before he could reply mengsk released him and made his way to the great doors of the forum katherine mengsk swept past craven locking her eyes with his as she went to join her husband though she said nothing her cold gaze pinned him like a butterfly on a collectors wall taking a deep breath to compose himself lennox craven turned and followed angus mengsk into the forum already dreading what the damnable man was going to say in his speech the inferior of the palatine forum was no less magnificent than the exterior the floor of the vestibule fashioned from great slabs of black marble veined with gold and its columns fluted and rising to dizzying heights the alabaster walls were painted with great murals depicting the pioneers of korhals heroic past revered senators intrepid spacefarers great architects military commanders and farseeing philosophers angus and katherine crossed the vestibule and approached the bronze doors of the great chamber of the forum behind which could be heard the animated buzz of voices lennox craven caught up to them but angus did not deign to glance in his direction katherine squeezed his hand once again angus was thankful for her steadying presence she turned to him and said i love you i love you too said angus without hesitation katherine smiled and made her way to a door at the side of the vestibule which angus knew led up to the viewing gallery tradition demanded that only senators enter the main chamber through this door so katherine would need to view proceedings from above with the rest of the families and invited guests he waited for a few minutespointedly ignoring lennox cravenuntil he was sure katherine would have reached her allocated seat then he approached the door it swung open smoothly and angus felt his heart race as he saw the assembled senators and dignitaries awaiting his arrival yes he thought this is my moment theres your mother now said ailin pasteur and arcturus turned to see katherine mengsk threading her way through the assorted family members gathered in the viewing gallery she saw him silting there her eyes bright at this unexpected pleasure and arcturus felt a genuine moment of regret at what he was about to do to her juliana sat behind her father full of nervous excitement at the thought of seeing angus mengsk give the close of session speech in the korhal forum in the time since graduation she had spent a great deal of time with arcturus though thanks to the constant presence of a chaperone he had not had a chance to take her to his bed instead they had spent most of their time in closely supervised walks through styrling and though he never tired of filling her head with his grandiose dreams of the future he had begun to tire of her company not that that would be a problem soon he thought picturing the sheaf of papers nestling in his coal pocket only juliana knew what he planned but he knew she would say nothing his mother smiled as she negotiated her way toward their little group obviously pleased to see him there she smiled at people she passed and arcturus could see the genuine affection in which his mother was held in addition to being the glamorous wife of a senator katherine mengsk was a patron of numerous charities and spoke out on many issues that affected people from every strata of society she had been the first to address the subject of child trafficking between worlds had opened peoples eyes to the plight of the homeless in styrling and had set up numerous health organizations to aid the many victims of war his mother offered kind words to everyone she passed and watching her easy smile and natural grace made arcturus realize why she was so beloved by the people of korhal at last his mother reached them and arcturus shifted up on the wooden bench to allow her to sit next to him she leaned over and kissed his cheek im so glad you came arcturus she said her smile warm and genuine so am i said arcturus she directed her attention to the pasteurs and said ailin its wonderful to see you here and juliana angus will be so pleased you came to see him deliver his speech juliana smiled shyly at katherine and arcturus could see she was a little in awe of his mother thank you mrs mengsk call me katherine dear please she smiled patting arcturuss knee youre practically family now ailin pasteur returned arcturuss mothers smile and said i wouldnt have missed this for the world katherine people are going to remember this day for a long time to come i have no doubt of that said katherine beaming as the master of ceremonies rapped his bronzetipped staff on the tiled floor of the senate floor the senators below stood a little taller and everyone in the gallery leaned forward as the bronze doors opened and angus mengsk made his entrance angus raised his arms in triumph as he stepped into the vast domed chamber of the senate recognizing that this was a symbolic as well as a literal crossing of a threshold like the most alluring woman the palatine forum saved its most majestic treasures for last and as always angus felt a deep sense of pride awe and reverence for what this chamber represented democracy free will and freedom from oppression the central floor was paved with panels of opus sectil in which porphyry and serpentine figured prominently to either side were three broad low marblefaced steps and on the level nearest the floor sat the more notable senators upon their curule chairs the two top steps were broader than the others and upon them stood hundreds of richly dressed men and women the entire body of the korhal senate and assorted dignitaries granted special leave to attend the close of session gray marble wainscoting ran along each wall finished with a molding above which marble panels were rhythmically placed with only the interruption of three statuefilled niches to break the pattern as the wall rose toward the dome it was faced with tall gray rectangular panels with golden lettering the constitutional tenets set down by korhals earliest settlers and the principles by which its people were to be governed the dome itself was made up of heavily gilded lacunaria consisting of square coffers set with golden discs at their centers just below the dome was the viewing gallery where those important enough to be allowed into the palatine forum yet not of sufficient stature to set foot in the main chamber could be seated ailin pasteur watched from here as did katherine proudly awaiting anguss arrival he resisted the urge to wave to her looking farther along he was surprised and pleased to see arcturus next to her katherine had probably emotionally blackmailed their son to get him here he figured briefly he wondered why katherine hadnt told him that arcturus was going to be here but put the thought from his mind where arcturus was concerned angus would take what he could get he looked up into the dome as thunderous applause swelled from the assembled senators and let the moment stretch as he reveled in the acclaim of his peers when he judged the moment right he slowly lowered his eyes to the confederate flag hung opposite the entrance below which sat the senior consuls plinth it was from this plinth that angus would deliver his speech and he marched across the floor of the senate chamber toward it with applause still ringing in his ears he stepped up onto the plinth and stared up at the red and blue of the flag his scathing look made no secret of his loathing for all it represented creed corruption and moral stagnation with one swift movement he reached up and ripped it down the cheers of the assembled senators doubled in volume arcturus watched the faces of the people below in the senate hall and gathered around him in the gallery as they clapped and cheered he was amazed they could be so enamored of his father could they not see him for what he wasan ordinary stubborn man who didnt know how to listen in that moment a realization crystallized in arcturus it didnt matter what the reality of a person was it was what he showed the world that mattered the people of korhal didnt know the real angus mengsk they knew the reality he gave them the manufactured persona calculated to win them over to his cause it didnt matter that his father was as human and as fallible as them all that mattered was what he meant to them and what he promised them arcturus had always known that ordinary people were easy to manipulate but to see supposedly educated men and women so easily swayed was a revelation he sat back as his father strode across the senate floor toward the senior consuls plinth basking in the applause of his fellow senators this was a salutary lesson in the power of perception versus reality but arcturus had no wish to sit through another of his fathers impassioned rants about the iniquities of the confederacy hed heard enough of those over the course of his young life to last him a lifetime it was time arcturus took a deep breath and reached inside his coat packet removed the sheaf of crisp papers hed signed earlier this morning and laid them on his lap he looked over at his mother again feeling slightly guilty about what he was about to do but knowing that this was the right thing for him to do simply because it was what he wanted to do sensing his scrutiny his mother glanced over at him and her clapping faltered as she saw the papers laid out before him and the insignia emblazoned at the top arcturus she said hesitantly whats that enlistment papers mother he said for the confederate marine corps i went to the recruitment offices this morning katherine looked down at the papers her confusion turning to cold dread in the space of a heartbeat oh arcturus noplease no what have you done she went to lift the papers from him but he was quicker and snatched them up before she could take them as the cheers of the crowd suddenly swelled in volume arcturus what did you do cried his mother tell me i joined up he said no no you didnt said katherine you didnt arcturus if this is a joke its in very poor taste im not joking mother said arcturus as of this morning im part of the officer corps of the rd ground assault division under commander brantigan fole no no youre not this is some kind of prank isnt it said his mother and arcturus saw real panic in her eyes isnt it tell me its one of your stupid pranks people were turning from watching his father below on the senate floor to the growing commotion in the gallery as katherines voice rose in pitch and volume the applause was still loud and cheering echoed around the chamber drowning out their words to all but the nearest spectators its not a prank mother said arcturus cold fury entering his heart at the idea that something this important to him would be dismissed as a prank this was his life and she thought he was joking im leaving this afternoon he said his mother slapped him across the cheek gasps of surprise spread like ripples in a pond at the sound of her palm connecting with his cheek you stupid stupid boy stormed katherine you stupid selfish boy is this your way of hurling your falher of hurting me do you have any idea what youve done i know exactly what ive done said arcturus his resolve now hardened in the face of his mothers insulting slap and youve just made it easier for me katherine reached for him but he batted her hands away and rose to his feet his mother looked up at him tears spilling down her cheeks but arcturus didnt care anymore he slid his enlistment papers back into his coat pocket and said goodbye mother tell dorothy im sorry i didnt have a chance to say goodbye to her tell her ill write no wept katherine her heartbroken cry swallowed up by the clapping that still filled the senate chamber oh god please dont do this arcturus please pleasewait arcturus ignored his mothers terrible aching grief and strode through the astonished crowd silting in the viewing gallery he could feel their eyes upon him but kept his head held high determined to leave this place with dignity a strong hand gripped his arm and he turned to berate the person for this impudence ailin pasteur stood behind himm his face a mask of anger your father will never forgive you to this arcturus im not asking him to snapped arcturus shrugging off the umojan ambassadors hand of all the days you could have done this why today demanded pasteur arcturus returned pasteurs stare with a steel gaze of his own the man recoiled from the determination in arcturuss eyes as though struck sometimes you have to do something dramatic to make your point said arcturus pasteur shook his head sadly turning to look at his weeping mother well boy he said sadly youve certainly done that i just hope you dont live to regret what youve done today i wont promised arcturus turning and walking away book arcturus chapter the dropship screamed through the upper atmosphere of sonyan trailing fire from its wings like a swooping phoenix the armored plates of its heatshielding rippled with blazing orange fire and left a streaking contrail of vapor in the crafts wake as it dropped rapidly toward the planets surface as flying machines went it was proof that with a big enough pair of engines you could get anything to stay in the air its front wings were stubby swept forward and down behind which enormous jet engines coughed to life as the craft hit the atmosphere dropships were designed to carry confederate military forces unto battle in safety and at speedthough they achieved neither objective particularly welland as arcturus gripped the metal stanchion next to his head he knew that regardless of any other considerations comfort had certainly not been uppermost in the designers minds dropships could carry anything from troops to siege tanks in their transport compartments and thus the cavernous bay housing arcturuss armored marinesdesignated dominion sectionwas an oily dustfilled metallic cavern the dropship shuddered as it leveled out wind roar and engine noise making conversation impossible unless carried out over the helmet comms as well as the six armored soldiers the dropship carried a huge siege tank its colossal groaning mass held fast with clanking chains and filling much of the dropships internal space it was breaking regs putting this many soldiers in with a siege tank but the orders had come from on high to get them there like this and arcturus wasnt about to question orders this early in his career his five soldiers sat toward the rear of the redlit compartment on uncomfortable metal benches that looked as though a blind welder had attached them to the fuselages interior so whats the situation lt asked yancy gray for the hundredth time what are we flying into arcturus sighed the irrepressible kid from tarsonis never let up until he got an answer and he had a strange naive belief that the chain of command would keep him informed al every stage of what was going on he hadnt been with the military long enough to know that the grunts on the front line were like mushrooms kept in the dark and fed shit aw man how many times you gonna keep asking that yancy said de santo her face belligerent lts gonna tell us whats up when he knows right lt diamond de santo or dia as her sectionmates knew her was a darkskinned girl who had grown up on tyrador ix the daughter of indentured workers who toiled in one of the many spas and resort cities that made the planet such a refuge for the scions of the old families armies of men and women who owed money to one of the many confederate financial institutions were forced to work there to repay their debts and ensure that guests didnt need to lift so much as a finger needless to say diamond de santo hadnt enjoyed that life much and shed signed up at the first recruiting office she could find on her eighteenth birthday in the six months arcturus had known her he had seen the core of a good soldier but one who had such a chip on her shoulder that it kept her mouth truculent and her manner rebellious arcturus liked her immensely and by some strange inverted magnetism de santo recognized a kindred soul and displayed a loyalty to arcturus that reminded him of the bond between his father and achton feld hey im just asking said yancy nothing wrong with wanting to know whats going on is there i was supposed to be on leave until this new assignment came down the pipe we were all supposed to be on leave said de santo pointedly making no secret of her irritation at that particular stroke of genius from the brass she wasnt the only one annoyed that their leave had been postponed arcturus had planned to return to korhal to see his mother and little dot he hadnt been back to see them since hed joined up though he had written to them plenty of times over the confednetwork his mother had eventually answered though her words didnt have the same openness and warmth as did the letters she had sent him at the academy her correspondence was filled with news of his sister and of korhal and its troubles but made little mention of his father beyond his continued good health dorothy hadnt replied to him at all and he knew she was probably still smarting with annoyance at his sudden departure hopefully once this mission was over hed have a chance to patch things up with his family as the last year and a half had made him realize how much he missed them even his falher which surprised arcturus immensely of course here had been a greal deal of correspondence between arcturus and juliana and it seemed she remained interested in him though lightyears separated them they had arranged to meet on tyrador ix before he headed onward to korhal when his next period of leave eventually came through and he was forced to admit he was looking forward to seeing her again arcturuss reverie ended when yancy nodded his helmeted head toward him and said ill bet you anything lt already knows where were headed yeah a hundred credits says he already knows hell id take that bet if i thought you had the damn cash said chuck horner his broad fringe world grin robbing the comment of malice horner was what arcturuss father would have disparagingly called a good ol boy a thickshouldered broadfeatured hayseed from one of the outlying worlds in the confederacy where they counted themselves lucky if they had electricity throughout the day on the surface thats exactly what charles chuck horner was and arcturus had been surprised to find a sharp mind and quick wit behind his aw shucks exterior but you aint got two cents to rub together continued chuck leastways not after me and chun leung won everything but your panties the other night at poker you got lucky said yancy lucky drawled chuck my daddy and his daddy before him was playing army poker before you was a glint in your mamas eye taught me everything i know son oh yeah countered yancy wanna try your luck again tonight what you got to bet with put in the aforementioned chun leung i already got your money and your chocolate rations for the next week you dont got anything else the big dog wants to take off you ill clean mayumi for a month offered yancy boy wants to gamble de santo said with a laugh no way said chun leung hefting his impaler rifle across his lap to stroke the gleaming oiled barrel mayumi was the name chun leung had given to his rifle his pride and joy he kept the rifle obsessively oiled and cleaned and where everyone elses gun was battered and scratched leungs weapon looked as though it had come straight from the factory im the only one who handles my weapon said leung yeah thats what the girls on pridewater said too quipped de santo leung flipped her off you want a piece of me he said ill show you why they call me the big dog little girl arcturus listened to the banter sensing the undercurrent of fear behind their easy backandforth thus far the commanders of the rd hadnt seen fit to post them anywhere too dangerous but even though his soldiers had only mess tent scuttlebutt to go on they could sense this assignment would be different only one member of the section didnt join in on the banter and arcturus knew that if there was a god somewhere in the heavens he had a strange sense of humor toby mercurio another graduate of styrling academy sat across from arcturus his face downcast and his shoulders slumped having spent the last six months trying to brine mercurio up to the standard of the rest of the section arcturus knew that the life of a soldier was not for his fellow alumnus though mercurios parents had been wealthy enough to send him to an expensive school the boy wasnt really styrling academy material hed scraped by academically but it had been his aboveaverage performance on the padball courts that had allowed him to graduate but above average didnt cut it in the professional circuit and without the safety net of any real qualifications toby had floundered in the real world a series of meaningless papershuffling jobs at one of his fathers plants had ensuedall of which hed spectacularly failed atfollowed by a drunken afternoon that had seen him wake with a crushing hangover and a sheaf of signed enlistment papers in the eighteen months since arcturus had joined up hed found that a soldiers life consisted of long stretches of boredom followed by frantic periods of deployment and shouting which in dominion sections case had been followed by yet more periods of boredom this assignment looked as though it might involve some action and as surprising as it was to him arcturus realized he was looking forward to the prospect of combat hed trained to fight in combat armor and could fire a gauss rifle with a reasonable degree of accuracy but it was his understanding of battlefield tactics combined with his talent for inspiring those around him and making the impossible sound plausible that had seen him rise to the level of lieutenant senior officers had their eye on him to ascend the promotions ladder but before he could really embark on that climb he needed some real combat under his belt hence dominion sections deployment to sonyan so come on lt said chuck horner is the kid right you know why were out here arcturus felt the eyes of his section turn on him their faces blurred slightly through the lowgrade plasteel of their helmet visors yes charles said arcturus knowing the others got a kick out of his using chucks full name i do know why were out here im an officerits my job to know so whats the skinny asked yancy leaning forward pirates rogue merc bands terrorizing helpless colonists and their pretty daughters something like that agreed arcturus whoops and hollers echoed over the comms at the prospect of actually putting their training into practice arcturus held a hand up to quiet his section and said were dropping on a planet called sonyan specifically camp juno where were to rendezvous with other elements of the rd and facilitate the evacuation of personnel involved in illegal deepcore mining operations we gonna get to kill anyone asked chun leung patting mayumis muzzle i hope not said arcturus but its likely many of the people on sonyan arent going to want to leave their holdings well damn we got to show them the error of their ways said chuck horner highflying with chun leung yancy and dia looked excited at the prospect but as usual toby mercurio didnt join in i bet i kill more than you dia said yancy sure you will sneered de santo boy you barely know which end of that gun to point at the enemy we get into a fireflght you make sure you stay in front of me you hear lines of scrolling text flickered onto the hud of arcturuss armor and the red light of the compartment began flashing quiet down he said his voice easily cutting through the goodnatured sparring were coming in to land so look sharp before sonyan arcturus had seen precisely three other planets growing up on korhal a lush temperate world of balmy summers and mild winters he had assumed that most other habitable worlds in the confederacy would be much the same his training on the colossal orbital shipyards of dylar iv and his first tour on pridewater had quickly disabused him of that notion emphasizing the point that humans could live pretty much anywhere with enough perseverance but sonyan was a world youd have to have a serious reason just to visit let alone live on as the assault ramp clanged onto the sandy hardpan of the planet hot biting winds howled inside the dropship instantly blinding arcturus and his soldiers as they disembarked a group of engineers barged past them to get to the siege tank and arcturus fought the urge to shout at them instead he marched down the ramp and onto the gritty surface of another world the visor of arcturuss helmet darkened in response to the sudden brightness as he took his first look at their new posting camp juno nestled in the rocky foothills of a broken series of valleys in the middle of a soaring range of reddish brown mountains dust devils blew down from the high peaks and the sky was the color of flaking rust a jaundiced orb of a sun hung low above the tops of the mountains casting long thin shadows down the mountains and over the camp in the middle of the camp sat a modular command center its pressed metal plates scoured and distressed by the constant assault of wind borne grit the rotating dish of a comsat swept the terrain and a number of depressingly identical buildings surrounded the command center the standard pieces of kit youd expect to find around any confederate military establishmentbarracks mess halls infirmary and landing platform as well as portalframed hangars supply depots and training facilities coils of wire looped between six missile turrets spaced at regular intervals around the camps perimeter their own dishes sweeping the skies for aerial threats squads of marines jogged through the camp and industrious scvs effected repairs to damaged buildings despite the number of people he saw arcturus sensed a relaxed unhurried air to the camp there was no urgency to the training nor any sense of wariness in the posture of those marines that stood sentry over the camp a few heads turned as he led his men from the belly of the dropship but any interest in their arrival quickly passed so what now lt asked yancy slinging his rifle over his shoulder wheres our reception соmmittее arcturus was wondering the same thing but didnt reply it didnt become an officer to admit that he didnt know what was going on they were supposed to have been met by the camps head of security but they were completely alone on the landing platform watch out on the ramp shouted one of the engineers inside the dropship sparing arcturus from thinking of an answer for yancy no sooner was the warning given than the throaty rumble of the siege tanks engine bellowed jelling filthy plumes of blue oilsmoke the tank lurched from the darkness and jerkily drove out onto the sand arcturus watched as the tank rumbled away from the dropship with the engineers in tow damn that things probably older than you chuck said dia de santo dia honey drawled chuck you call it old i call it experienced well that is one experienced tank said yancy screw you son said chuck with a knowing wink to de santo gimme the choice between a filly and a mare ill take the mare every time she knows what shes doing and shell make sure you do it right we still talkin about tanks asked yancy tenhut shouted chun leung and the marines of dominion section snapped to attention arcturus turned to see a fully armored marine marching toward them from the command center he saw the insignia of a captain on the marines shoulder and a security detail of two soldiers marched at the officers back arcturus pulled himself lo attention squinting through the glare and dust haze as he saw a familiarity to the marines posture and walk the captain halted in front of arcturus and gave him a quick onceover lieutenant arcturus mengsk reporting for duty sir he said saluting smartly dominion section is ready for action sir al ease mengsk said the captain and arcturus smiled as he realized why his superior had seemed so familiar the glare visor on the captains helmet snapped up and arcturus found himself staring into the face of captain angelina emillian the very woman whod planted the seed of his enlistment so long ago it seemed at styrling academy arcturus relaxed but only a fraction emillian might have been a familiar face but she was still a captain and he a lieutenant even he had to respect the chain of command good to see you again mengsk said emillian so they made you lieutenant yes sir said arcturus all the generals jobs were taken emillian smiled i see youve not lost that smart mouth of yours maybe your principal was right about you they still letting him teach there no sir said arcturus last i heard he was doing sixty years in bharel penal colony for embezzlement and fraud i gather he wasnt a suitable candidate for resocialization emillian caught the pride in his tone and said and i suppose you wouldve had nothing to do with that i couldnt possibly say he replied leaving emillian in no doubt as to his complicity in steegmans fall from grace i thought so said emillian jerking a thumb in the direction of his marines so whats their story dominion section said arcturus ready for action sir just give us the word dominion section repeated emillian nice name you choose it i did said arcturus with a nod i thought it sounded appropriately grand emillian shook her head with a grin and walked along the line of marines her stern gaze boring into each soldier and leaving no doubt that they were less than nothing to her okay listen up marines she shouted welcome to sonyan the most miserable craphole this side of the core worlds this aint boot camp and it sure aint paradise so wherever youve been stationed before and thought was bad forget it this is worse the chow sucks the barracks have got more holes that an impaler target and you wont be leaving without at least one trip to the infirmary any questions most of the marines of dominion section met her stare stoically understanding that the best response to this kind of rhetorical question was silence yancy gray was however apparently oblivious to this piece of soldiers wisdom why will we be visiting the infirmary sir he asked captain emillian rounded on him the visor of her helmet barely an inch from her questioner arcturus winced irritated that one of his marines had embarrassed him did you say something soldier she said uh you asked if anyone had questions replied yancy i do have a question i mean thats enough gray said arcturus the captain will brief me and then ill tell you what you need to know for your sake youd better hope your trip to the infirmary is because youve been killed so you wont go asking any more stupid questions emillian continued to stare hard at yancy who kept his gaze fixed on a point somewhere over her right shoulder eventually the captain turned away and stood before the section with her hands laced behind her back in answer to private grays question you will most likely visit the infirmary because you will be getting shot at by disgruntled miners who have illegally begun deepcore operations on this rock which just so happens to be a confederateowned piece of real estate arcturus hadnt known that sonyan was a confederate world that nugget of information not having been part of his briefing prior to their departure from pridewater not that his briefing had said much more than go to sonyan and await orders in any case this far out on the rim who claimed a world was largely a factor of who had the most men and the biggest guns with the arrival of dominion section and the siege tank it appeared that honor now belonged to the confederacy most of these miners have already been relocated continued emillian beginning to pace as she spoke but there are a few stubborn holdouts and its going to be your job to flush them out its going to be bloody work because these miners are dug in deeper than a tyrador bloodshrike but youll have help there are thirty marines and a handful of firebats here thatll be going in with you and now we have a siege tank but make no mistake marines you will be shot at and we will take casualties that last part i can guarantee finished emillian since you lucky bastards are going to hit turanga canyon at tomorrow the sun was already bright and hot when arcturus rose from his bunk at and made his way to the mess hall to grab some breakfast and gulp down some agrade military caffeine breakfast consisted of highcalorie gunk that tasted foul but provided the energy a marine would need for combat operations as he sat contemplating the brownish sludge spooned onto his tray captain emillian took the seat opposite him morning lieutenant she said nodding toward the food not what youre used to i bet not exactly he agreed though the refectory at styrling academy could give this place a run for its money i can see why the marine corps would be appealing to you then they ate their breakfast in silence and arcturus took the opportunity to study angelina emillian in more detail she was still pretty but he noticed a scar that hadnt been there before which traced a pale line above her ear before disappearing beneath her hair got it on chau sara she said without looking up there was a prison riot in one of the penal colonies where they keep the worst of the worstthe mass murderers rapists and serial killers we were on rotation there to pick up a batch for resocialization when it happened i was in solitary evaluating an inmate by the name of wyan schaen when he got one of the guards weapons and shot me in the face nasty said arcturus appreciating the ridiculous understatement of his remark as he said it but emillian appeared not to notice yeah it was but i was lucky the bullet ricocheted from the interior of my helmet and grazed me before exploding on the back so what did you do there was so much blood around me the dumbass thought i was dead said emillian i guess i was out for a few seconds but once i came to i saw he was standing at the bars with his back to me so i got up and broke his neck and then got the hell out of there im impressed said arcturus genuinely meaning it its nothing she said anyway we got our recruits and i got a new scar i could use to impress greenhorn lieutenants so tell me about your section mengsk are they any good arcturus looked down the length of the table where the marines of dominion section sat chatting with the marines who were going to be flying up to turanga canyon with them yes he said until this mission came up they were looking forward to going on leave we all were but theyre good soldiers some are better than others but theyll follow orders and theyll fight hard good enough said emillian arcturus had seen the telltale scars of neural resocialization on the marines his men were talking to and said tell me something captain you have thirty marines here already all resoced to follow orders without question yeah so so why do you need us emillian answered between mouthfuls of scrambled egg you ever fought alongside a resoced marine no you wouldnt ask that question if you had said emillian dont get me wrong theyre perfectly good soldiers and theyll do anything you order them to but they dont have initiative and dont react too well to changing battlefield situations give em an order thats easy to follow and theres no problem but the minute things start to get a bit screwy well they get a bit lost i keep asking for marines that arent brainpanned but they keep sending me more of em and you think six of us can make a difference six of you and a siege tank lets not forget of course said arcturus these miners they must be a tough bunch what makes you say that you clearly dont think theyll surrender as soon as they see us am i wrong no youre not wrong i didnt think so said arcturus why wont they surrender because they didnt the last time we came for them they fought back with goliath walkers antiaircraft missiles and a whole lot of guns then again we didnt have a siege lank last time or dominion section she added with a smile the siege tank had left the previous evening and was to rendezvous with them at the mouth of turanga canyon where it would provide artillery support as the marines moved up toward the miners base do you remember when we spoke back at styrling academy asked arcturus sure said emillian why do you ask you said barely fifty percent of marines ever actually see combat seems like that might have been a slightexaggeration not at all replied emillian about fifty percent of recruits to the marines either wash out of boot camp are killed in training accidents get their brains fried by the resoc or otherwise end up invalided to desk jobs so basically if you survive boot camp youre almost guaranteed to see combat pretty much agreed emillian with a wry twitch of her eyebrows doesnt sound quite as appealing when you put it like that hence the shift of emphasis said emillian standing and carrying her breakfast tray to the racks arcturus followed her and slid his tray in below emillians i can see that now emillian turned and from the steel in her eyes arcturus could see that the informality of breakfast was over right time to get busy lieutenant get your men together and be on the launchpad in ten minutes we dust off at so dont be late or ill courtmartial your ass now move it arcturus moved it arcturus sat with his gauss rifle against his shoulder and his body braced against the craggy rock protecting him from the stream of bullets that sawed down from above the sun blazed high above them a sour lemon yellow orb that looked close enough to reach up and touch his breath came in ragged spurts and he could taste blood in his mouth from where hed bitten his tongue in the crash the members of dominion section huddled in the rocks with him each one looking the worse for wear but still alive which arcturus realized was a bloody miracle remembering the gutwrenching terror hed felt as the explosion had torn a monstrous hole in the side of the dropship he could recall almost nothing of what followed save hurricaneforce winds roaring through the troop compartment billowing flames and the awful sound of battlehardened marines screaming in agony next thing he remembered he was lying in a tangle of twisted metal surrounded by flames and looking up at a pillar of oily black smoke etched on the sky hands had grabbed him under his arms and dragged him from the wreckage and as hed been propped up against a rock he saw it had been chuck horner whod rescued him what happened he managed missile said horner they got a turret set up at the mouth of the valley pilot didnt see it and we got a heatseeker right up our tailpipe now at least half the marines are dead and the damn siege tank aint here yet neither emillian asked arcturus wheres the captain captains out of the fight sir said yancy gray across the gully from arcturus i think her backs broken private grays words had focused arcturuss thoughts and he pulled himself to his feet using a nearby rock for support he had to get everyone together and figure out what to do next looking over at emillians supine form arcturus saw that yancy was dead right emillian wasnt going to be joining this fight her armor would keep her alive for a while but her legs and spine were bent into shapes they werent designed to make and arcturus knew she wouldnt last long if they didnt get her to a medical station twenty meters back down the valley the gutted hulk of the dropship lay scattered in a mangled pile of fireblackened steel the pilot had tried his best to soften their landing but there was only so much you could do with your engines taken out by an explosion and the nearest piece of flat ground a hundred kilometers away thick billowing clouds of smoke belched from the wrecked craft and the fire crackled and popped as it devoured ammo packs and stim dispensers arcturus had done a quick head count and found that eleven of the marines whod accompanied them on the dropship were dead and another eight were too badly injured to fight three of the firebats were also dead immolated by their own weapons when theyd cooked off in the fire of the crash that left eleven of emillians resoced marines and two firebats to fight alongside dominion section no sooner had arcturus got everyone together than a burst of gunfire ripped down from the rocks above cover he shouted though the order was unnecessary highpitched pings of metal on rock echoed deafeningly like an endless box of nails being emptied onto hard stone from a great height breathing heavily arcturus risked a glance mil of cover when the fire slackened fractionally and saw a whole lot of shooters on the rocks above he guessed about twenty men in body armor helmets and toughwearing outdoor gear certainly not soldiers but more likely mercenaries or a pirate band hired by the miners arcturus stuck his rifle around the rock and pulled the trigger not really aiming but just wanting to return fire the armor easily absorbed the recoil and though his shots went well wide he fell better for shooting back dominion section hugged the rocks looking up with expressions ranging from the beginnings of panic to relish more spikes sprayed down at them and arcturus watched as a concentrated volley tore up one of the injured marines the man appeared to jerk as though being electrocuted his armor was proof against most smallarms fire but a whole lot of impaler rifles firing in sync had torn through the weakened portions of his plate whomever these miners had hired to defend them knew their trade more shots ricocheted down from above pinning them in the rocks below their objective and arcturus saw they had only two options they could either retreat skulking back to the valley mouth or continue with their mission into the teeth of the gunfire retreat was not an option that appealed to arcturus not when so many men were dead but neither did he want to rush to a glorious death in the face of an unknown number of gunmen from his earlier glance hed seen that the bulk of the men ahead were lurking behind jagged outcrops of rock in a narrow defile amid a tangle of wiry brush above them the rocks were a vivid white as though bleached by the sun as one group fired another reloaded between them they kept a nearconstant stream of impaler spikes rattling and chiming from the rocks around dominion section in the quick glance hed had arcturus saw that the valley narrowed as it neared the gunmen the ground before their attackers was a sharply inclined open killing ground that would be close to suicide to charge up but the rocky walls to either side of where the marines were pinned could be climbed with only a little effort about four meters above the ground appeared to become flatter rocky and strewn with stunted trees and scattered piles of boulders ideal cover from which to flank their attackers arcturus turned and opened a link to the firebats the two surviving firebats were hunched in cover their hulking suits of crimson armor heavily dented and scarred from the crash but their perdition flamethrowers appeared to be in full working order this is lieutenant mengsk he said identify yourselves private eugene malik came the first reply private harper utley said the second firebat malik utley im going to need you two to go straight up the middle and give me a screen of fire when i give the word head toward the rocks the shooters are using as cover and put a wall of fire between them and us you understand sir yes sir they replied in unison and hissing blue cones of heal ignited from the weapon systems fixed to their gauntlets satisfied the firebats understood their task arcturus then spoke to the resoced marines who had survived the crash and were still fit to fight he pointed to the nearest marines and said you two stay with the wounded the rest of you i want you supporting malik and utley i want a stream of impalers keeping those bastards heads down got that nodding heads and snapped salutes assured him they understood and arcturus returned his attention to his own soldiers as a ricocheting impaler spike thudded into his shoulder guard whats the plan lt shouted dia de santo as arcturus brushed the spike from his armor as though it were a piece of lint on his best suit were going to take out those gunmen and push on said arcturus sir thats crazy cried chuck horner we aint got a damn clue how many more of them are walling for us up there arcturus shook his head jabbing his fist at the marines of dominion section were going and thats an order when the firebats and whats left of emillians marines make their move i want horner mercurio and yancy up and over the rocks on the right the rest of you with me on the left he could see the fear and doubt on their faces and said listen soldiers theres probably more of them moving around our flank already to cut us off given the terrain and the fact that they were pinned down quite neatly here that probably wasnt true but it didnt hurt to put the fear of it into thorn either we go forward and take this fight to them or we get cut to pieces like rookie shouted arcturus were dominion section and we kill anyone who gets in our way chun leung hefted mayumi and slammed in a fresh clip now you re talkin my language he said chapter blazing plumes of liquid fire roared up the valley as privates malik and utley broke from cover the two redarmored warriors crunched forward flaming sheets spraying the rocks and brush of the valley ahead arcturus could feel the backwash of heat from their flamethrowers through his armor impaler spikes hammered the two firebats but their armor was thicker and heavier than that of an ordinary marine and the two privates pushed on in the face of the gunfire the brush around the enemy gunmen went up instantly crackling and burning with furious glee go shouted arcturus scrambling up the rocky slope beside him chun leung and dia de santo followed him their rifles tucked in close to their chests more rattling gunfire blazed from below as emillians marines followed the firebats shooting from the hip as they advanced one marine was cut down the instant he left covert a hall of razortipped spikes splintering his visor and blowing out the back of his helmet the others didnt falter and advanced into the teeth of the fusillade arcturus clawed at the rocks pulling himself up with powerful surges his armor enhanced his strength and he was able to haul himself over the lip of the canyon walls wilhout difficulty he rolled onto his side and brought his gauss rifle up glancing across to see yancy chuck and toby pulling themselves over the rocks and into cover below him the firebats continued to pour flaming gouts of superheated liquid at their foes one of themarcturus didnt know whichwas limping badly his leg armor mangled by gunfire above the knee and blood sheeting down his thigh several other marines were down but the mercenaries attention was fixated on the advancing warriors and they hadnt noticed the other inbound enemies arcturus opened a link to dominion section and said get moving everyone fast and low you got it lt said chuck horner leading yancy and mercurio off arcturus nodded to himself horner had real potential naturally assuming command of his small section and arcturus made a mental note to see about developing his skills if they survived this encounter chun dia he said lets go arcturus led them off scuttling forward hunched over as much as his armor would allow and keeping to the cover of the rocks his heart was hammering in his chest as he ran fully expecting a burst of impaler spikes to rake him and his soldiers at any moment arcturus could hear a nearcontinual roar of gunfire screams and explosions from the canyon and knew the men hed sent forward were still fighting an angry orange fireball mushroomed from below signaling the death of one of the firebats followed moments later by a second explosion the reek of flamethrower fuel filled the air and arcturus heard more screams of dying soldiers just ahead he could see a splash of white and recognized the rocks above where their ambushers were fighting he grinned with feral anticipation terrified yet exhilarated at the same time arcturus dropped to one knee and jabbed a fist at the while rocks take up position either side of me he said we get to those rocks and unleash everything weve got de santo and leung nodded and arcturus could see the same relish on their faces he figured they could see on his lets do this hissed chun leung palling mayumis gleaming barrel you got it big dog replied de santo punching knuckles with leung lets go said arcturus he ran over to the rocks bracing his foot against a low boulder and looked down into the canyon as de santo and leung took up position below them was a scene straight from hell the valley floor aflame and littered with blackened bodies a few fallen mercenaries screamed and clutched bloody wounds but arcturus didnt care about their pain these men had tried to kill him and his marines and that made them less than nothing in his eyes as hed suspected both firebats were dead as were about half of emillians resoced marines but they had done their job keeping the mercenaries attention firmly fixed on them while dominion section moved around the flank across the canyon arcturus saw horner yancy and mercurio rise from the rocks and aim their weapons at the enemy below a few of the mercenaries looked up as dominion section appeared above them and arcturus relished their look of panic fire shouted arcturus withering sprays of impaler spikes ripped through the mercenaries their lighter body armor no match for closerange gauss fire arcturus worked his rifle over the men below him bloody eruptions fountaining where his spikes blew open skulls or tore limbs from bodies caught in the crossfire the mercenaries had no chance they danced in the vicious bursts of gunfire trapped in the open and unable to fight back the echoes of rifles were deafening as they filled the narrow defile in the canyon with screaming hot spikes a few of the mercenaries managed to bring their weapons to bear but it was too little too late and they were cut down without mercy realizing that to fight on was hopeless one man threw down his rifle and held up his hands in surrender arcturus cut him in two with a sustained burst of fire it was over in a few seconds and the canyon was suddenly quiet as the marines of dominion section ceased firing acrid smoke drifted from the heated barrels of their guns as they looked at each other in disbeliefshocked at the carnage theyd caused but elated to have survived and won their first firefight good job everyone said arcturus his heart rate only now beginning to return to normal after the thrill of killing these men the canyon floor resembled an abattoir shredded flesh and blood mingling in thick viscous puddles that were already congealing into sticky pools in the heat man we killed those sobs good shouted yancy his rifle held triumphantly above his head chuck horner sketched arcturus a salute and even toby mercurio looked pleased for once beside him dia de santo and chun leung butted helmets and he felt them slap the shoulder guards of his armor in triumph you did it lt cried de santo we killed the whole damn lot of them that we did agreed arcturus only now beginning to appreciate the slaughter he had orchestrated he knew that some men experienced a great and terrible guilt over killing other human beings but as he looked at the rippedopen sacks of meal and bone that had only minutes before been living breathing human beings he felt nothing for them nothing at all arcturus looked up at the miners encampment through the optical viewfinders seeking any sign of weapons technology like the missile turret that had downed their dropship sure enough another pair of turrets with sweeping dishes not dissimilar to those theyd left behind at camp juno were placed at the forefront of the encampment the mining complex was a wellorganized collection of modular constructions built on an artificially created plateau at the mouth of a great scar in the mountainside that resembled the lair of some prehistoric monster the edge of the plateau had been built up into a defended ridge with sandbagged foxholes and concrete bunkers a pair of goliath combat walkers plodded back and forth behind the barricades on their reversejointed legs the rotary cannons on their weapon arms spooling up and the missile systems above the pilots canopy trained on the sky arcturus wasnt too concerned with the goliathsthey were primarily used to engage airborne targets though the power of their guns wasnt to be sniffed at if you were a grunt on the ground in any case he had just the thing to fight goliaths he smiled as he saw the panicked miners and their mercenaries running back and forth terrified at the sight that had just come into view on the rutted road that led to the main gate of the mine complex the siege tank had finally rumbled into the bloody canyon thirty minutes after the conclusion of the fighting since the battles end dominion section had been securing the weapons and ammo of the fallen marines and gathering up the dead of the marines who had charged in the wake of the firebats only five were left alive the rest arranged in neat rows alongside the eight wounded and those who had perished in the crash the bodies of the mercenaries were dragged to the side of the canyon and their weapons taken but were otherwise ignored an evac bird was called in to take captain emillian and the wounded back to camp juno once arcturus received confirmation that it had been dispatched he and dominion section together with the five resoced marines rode the tank farther up the valley after all they had a job to finish oh yeah shouted yancy gray standing on the tanks frontal glacis and balancing himself by holding on to its enormous cannon not so cocky now are ya not so tough when you see we got ourselves a tank yeah the siege tank had the range to engage the miners camp from where they sat now its main gun more than capable of pounding the camp to smoldering ruin without fear of reprisal but arcturus didnt want to destroy the mining facility if he could avoid it not if there was a chance it could be taken and put to use shut up yancy said arcturus handing the optical viewers to toby mercurio and removing his helmet he deposited the helmet on the tanks track guard and dropped down to the ground chuckdla youre with me shoulder those weapons and make sure theyre safed horner and de santo dropped to the hardpacked ground as arcturus marched uphill along the road toward the mining complex his rifle hanging by its sling from his shoulder after the frenetic carnage of the battle this was almost peaceful the road to the mine was relatively shielded from the fierce winds that swept the lowest reaches of the mountains arcturus watched as a group of five men emerged from the complex above three were armedmore mercenaries presumablywhile the two others had the weathered permanently dirty texture of dyedinthewool prospectors lt what you got in mind asked chuck horner yeah i was kinda wandering that too said de santo were going to talk to them said arcturus and ask them to surrender surrender said horner i gotta say lt they dont look like the surrendering kind you leave that to me charles the two groups met at a bend in the road some two hundred meters from the camps gate and arcturus felt the hostility of the miners like a blow one man was short and thickset his flesh leathery and pitted from a life n hostile environments the other was similarly squat but his eyes had a wary quality to them that told arcturus he wasnt going to be the one doing the talking the mercenaries kept back though they made a point of showing that they were more than ready to use their weapons before arcturus could even open his mouth the first man thrust out a sheaf of grubby oilstained papers and said this aint your property confed we own this claim fair and square go tell your bosses that we got the paperwork and everything yunnerstand me arcturus nodded politely and said my name is lieutenant arcturus mengsk of the confederate marine corps am i speaking with the head of this facility the man with the papers looked at him suspiciously and said yeah i guess you are and you are lemuel badennot that it makes a damn bit of difference we aint got nothin to say to each other i beg to differ said arcturus thats not entirely correct i have a siege tank that says we have one very important matter to discuss yeah whats that then your immediate surrender and relocation to another planet baden snorted with what arcturus assumed was laughter surrender hell you got some nerve boy what are you anyway twenty twentyone nineteen actually this time both prospectors laughed go home boy snapped baden i aint gonna surrender leastways not to a kid that dont even need to shave oh i think youll surrender said arcturus in fact im sure of it and whys that because i have a siege tank and if you dont surrender ill blow this place to hell dont make me laugh sneered baden you wouldnt dare try me said arcturus meeting badens hostile stare with one of his own arcturus saw beads of sweat gathering at the miners temples he could see courage in badens eyes but also the wariness of not being able to read the young soldier standing before him right now youre trying to work out if im bluffing said arcturus i can assure you that i am not i never bluff if i walk away from this parley without your surrender you everyone within your compound will be dead inside of ten minutes i guaranlee it then maybe we oughta just kill you now snapped baden you could but then my men would kill you and everyone would die regardless replied arcturus so you see you really have only one option badens eyes flicked to his companion who said you goddamn confeds cant keep doing this to us this here mines ours and we aint gonna let you take it from us arcturus ignored the mans outburst knowing that baden was the only man worth talking to in this exchange easy bill leave this to me said baden the miner looked back lo arcturus gimme twenty minutes to talk to my people of course said arcturus but if i do not have your surrender after that youre going to see exactly how powerful that tank is and trust me you dont want that baden nodded then stomped back to the mine complex with his companions without another word arcturus watched them go and turned on his heel marching back down the road to where his marines and the siege tank awaited arcturus banged on the tanks side when he finally reached it stand down the gun you were bluffing asked dia de santo no said arcturus as i told baden i never bluff i already know hes going to surrender you sure asked chuck horner he looked like a stubborn mule that one arcturus nodded indeed but he isnt stupid sir said de santo he knows ill destroy the mine and kill everyone there if he doesnt surrender explained arcturus chuck horner looked askance at arcturus you aint kidding are you no said arcturus im not and lemuel baden knows that the infirmary building of camp juno was a sterile antiseptic place in every sense of the word its prefabricated walls were gleaming while and faced with ceramic tiles that reflected the unflattering lights strung from the greenpainted girders that farmed the roof vault its structure resembled a fat tube split down its length and dropped onto the ground pods of beds were spread throughout the open space with ceilingmounted extractors tryingand fallingto circulate the stagnant air and diminish the tang of disinfectant medics made their rounds of the injured checking machine readings and administering pain meds while marines stripped out of their armor and wearing fatigues visited those comrades who werent too sedated arcturus had expected the infirmary to be noisy but it was instead subdued filled with the quiet noise of professionals working hard and a background machine hum the atmosphere was calm by virtue of the fact that the majority of the wounded marines hen were kept heavily sedated since many of them were resoced numerous studies had shown that extreme trauma could have a negative impact on the strength of the neural reprogramming implanted over a subjects original memories and no one was taking any chances that these marines might relapse to their previous murderous personalities having heard the lurid details of some of the more outrageous crimes committed by these marines prior to having acceptable behavioral patterns stamped on their brains arcturus was pleased to see such precautions in place he spoiled captain emillian lying in a bed pod she shared with three other wounded soldierstwo men and another womanand made his way over to her emillian smiled as she saw arcturus approaching then grimaced as she tried to sit up the framework of silver steel encasing her pelvis and legs making even that simple act awkwardly painful the swelling around her eyes and jaw had begun to come down and her bruises had turned an attractive shade of puce opposite the scar emillian had received on chau sara was another angry red line of sutures each of the patterns in the pod was hooked up to drips and monitored by complicated banks of boxy machinery and arcturus carefully negotiated his way through a tangle of wires to get to emillians bed good morning captain said arcturus morning lieutenant replied emillian as arcturus took a seat next to her bed placing a portable console at her feet youre looking well sure said emillian i look like crap nobody will give me a mirror what does that tell you that even when you are nearly killed youre still incredibly vain watch it buster said emillian i may be off my feet but im still your superior officer arcturus raised his hands in mock surrender point taken he said i hear the rest of the op went well yes agreed arcturus we got to the turanga facility and took it without a shot being fired apart from the ones in the canyon after we were blown out of the sky emillians face darkened at the mention of the crash i dont remember anything of that she said they tell me i smashed my head on a stanchion and broke my helmet open damn near crushed my skull you were lucky said arcturus yeah so everyone keeps telling me at least now you have a matching scar pointed out arcturus gee thats a comfort sorry so tell me about the rest of the mission said emillian i got the gist of it from one of the few of my marines you deigned to bring back alive but they arent great with the storytelling you know to be honest there isnt much else to tell when someone says to be honest that usually means theyre lying ill keep that in mind said arcturus but you probably already know the rest lemuel baden came out after his twenty minutes were up and said his people would be leaving they deactivated their reactor and powered down the turrets and i arranged for a pair of dropships to escort them back here for a debriefing before theyre shipped off world we secured the complex and theres a kusinis mining team swarming over it already which id like permission to supervise captain still dreaming of being a prospector eh absolutely said arcturus so howd you convince baden to bring his people out simple i told him id level the place with the siege tank thats it yes said arcturus i was very convincing would you have opened fire if they hadnt come out of course said arcturus without hesitation whats the point of making a threat if youre not willing to back it up that would have been a very expensive decision lieutenant said emillian a lot of people with higher pay grades than us were very clear that they wanted that place intact and they have it baden knew i was serious and he didnt want to die its that simple emillian shook her head no mengsk its not that simple its not no remember ive read your file and i know all about you said emillian i know that you mean what you say but you dont always say what you think you keep almost everything of what goes on inside you close to your chest and you dont let anyone see what youre thinking unless you want them to and right then you wanted baden to know what you were thinking i suppose so agreed arcturus it worked didnt it that it did said emillian and just for that i might forgive you for getting most of my soldiers killed or maimed in that canyon it was a textbook maneuver said arcturus one element kept the enemys attention fixed while others flanked them almost textbook because the guys providing the distraction for the flankers arent supposed to get killed suppression fire you ever hear of it i have but there wasnt any other way to be sure the mercenaries attention would be firmly fixed to their front well you sure as hell managed that said emillian flicking her hair back from her face and reaching for a cup of water beside her bed she grunted painfully and arcturus swiftly moved to lift the cup into her hand thanks said emillian now tell me why youre really here excuse me come on you didnt come here just to inspect my latest scar did you arcturus shrugged then realized there was no point in beating about the bush emillian had read the truth off him either in his body language or simply via the instincts of a senior officer there was one thing i wanted to discuss with you yes began arcturus come on spit it out said emillian you think ive got nothing better to do than sit here listening to you theres hot confederate doctors working these wards and a girls got to think of when she musters out arcturus smiled and now youre using humor to try and put me at my ease jeez way to overanalyze muttered emillian pain meds must be kicking in im normally more subtle than that okay so what is it arcturus lifted the portable console from the foot of her bed and activated it with a touch a green glow spread over the screen followed by the insignia of the marine corps i observed lemuel badens debriefing said arcturus who was doing the debrief captain graves flew in from camp larson to conduct it hes a good man said emillian gets the job done quickly and he gets results well badens debrief was certainly over very quickly however whether it could be said that the job was done satisfactorily is another matter what do you mean lemuel said the mine legally belonged to him and the other miners that their claim predated any confederate interest in sonyan he had papers but it seems theyve been confiscated and wouldnt you know it no one can find them now emillian shrugged marine corps admin snafu happens all the time im sure said arcturus dryly turning the console around for emillian to see the point is i checked with the kelmorian registration database and i found claim dockets for turanga canyon registered to one lemuel baden of tarsonis from six years ago whats your point the first confederacy ship to make planetfall on sonyan was the jonestown in emillian crossed her arms i see and you think it matters that they were here first doesnt it if his claim to the mine is legal then havent we just stolen it from him you secure that crap soldier snapped emillian and dont let me hear you repeat it lemuel baden is part of the kelmorian combine a bunch of goodfornothing crooks and pirates hell most of their prospectors are wanted criminals anyway thats a bit of a generalization surely is it listen mengsk the core worlds depend on the minerals and fuels extracted from mines like this so do you really want us to be beholden to kelmorian criminals sonyan is part of the confederacy now and anything on it belongs to the confederacy and the marine corps will fight to protect our way of life you got that yes but how but nothing lieutenant said emillian leaning forward and keeping her voice level if you want to survive in the military youre going to have to stop acting like some damn boy scout in the marines you follow the orders youre given and thats it period you go slicking your nose in places it dont belong and youre liable to get it bitten off thats what being in the marines is all about mengsk orders we start deciding the orders we want to obey and the ones we dont and you know what you get anarchy and im not going to allow that in the rd anger touched arcturus and he said sounds like you want everyone to be like one of your resoced marines wasnt that exactly why you brought dominion section in because we werent mindless automatons because we could think for ourselves i brought you in because i need good officers i can trust to follow orders said emillian i thought you would understand that mengsk but maybe i was wrong so you think youre some kind of rebel like your father is that it what does my father have to do with anything ive watched the unn said emillian ive seen your father speaking out against the confederacy and stirring up trouble on korhal are you like him looking for trouble when theres no need to im nothing like my father said arcturus yeah sure could have fooled me said emillian pointing toward arcturuss console im nothing like my father repeated arcturus more forcefully this time hes an embarrassment stirring up trouble when theres no need for it just like youre doing here said emillian her tone softened and she sat back look im not trying to rain on your parade mengsk but trust me this isnt an avenue you want to go down the marine corps is a machine and were all just cogs in that machine you start messing with that and either the machine chews you up and spits you out or it breaks down you can get yourself spat out if you want but im not going to allow our pan of the machine to break down itll be my ass in a sling with commander fole if you start pissing off the brass with damn fool questions you get me i get you said arcturus and youre right ill stop asking questions good said emillian searching his face for any sign he was softsoaping her arcturus knew his captain was good at reading people but she was dead right when she said that he didnt let anyone see what was going on below the surface he kept his face utterly blank now and she relaxed satisfied shed quashed his nascent doubts okay she said now go enjoy your leave mengsk go home relax with the family eat good food get drunk or get laid i dont care just come back with your head in the game are we clear yes arcturus nodded were clear good now get out of here soldier i need to get some sleep arcturus nodded and pushed back the chair as he stood he saluted emillian and picked his way through the tangle of cables and wires from the bedside monitors as he turned away from emillian she asked you got any kids mengsk arcturus shook his head you know i dont just as well eh whats that supposed to mean with your family just imagine what theyd turn out like chapter arcturus stepped from the groundcar a gleaming cobalt blue terra zephyr adjusting the collar of his dress uniform as he did so he wasnt particularly interested in motor vehicles beyond their ability to get him from point a to point b but even he had to admit that the zephyr was a fine piece of machinery with smooth graceful lines a plush leather interior and an engine that purred like a contented feline he turned and offered his hand to juliana pasteur who accepted his gracious gesture and emerged from the groundcar with effortless elegance the two years since arcturus had seen juliana had been good to her and she had blossomed from a pretty young girl into a beautiful woman now eighteen she had filled out in all the right places and carried herself with a confidence and poise that most other women could only dream of dressed in a simple backless black dress and tasteful jewelry that matched her eyes juliana turned heads as she took arcturuss arm the night was balmy and warm with a salttinged breeze blowing in off the ocean and juliana wrapped a sheer pashmina around her shoulders as they set off along the treelined cepheid boulevard toward the restaurant behind them following al a discreet distance were two slabshouldered men in gray suits umojan security personnel who accompanied juliana whenever she traveled off world arcturus could sense their dislike of him or at least what his uniform represented but wasnt surprised by it the confederacy had forever been trying to coerce umoja into its embrace but the umojans were a fiercely independent people and had steadfastly refused to join with the government of tarsonis cepheid boulevard was a pedestrianized walkway in the heart of the recreational district of elsecaro one of tyrador ixs most exclusive resort cities and thus they had to make the rest of the journey on foot arcturus didnt mind for it gave him a chance to bask in the cinnamonscented air and enjoy the fact that he wasnt being shot at tyrador ix was one of the later colony worlds a planet that coorbited its sister world of tyrador viii ever since its colonization it had been a popular tourist destination thanks to its distance from the bustle of tarsonis and its unique ecology the orbital dance performed by the two outermost planets in the tyrador system had blessed tyrador ix with an incredible variety of ecosystems and climates a journey of only a few kilometers could result in a huge change in temperature humidity or terrain which allowed the enterprising colonists to create a wonderland where almost any form of paradise could be replicated ski resorts sat cheek by jowl with jungles and rugged coastal towns where intrepid holidaymakers could dive in the emerald waters to see the playful tyradorian narwhal achingly beautiful deserts sprawled in the lee of soaring snowcapped peaks where the rich and famous lived in mountaintop villas accessible only by orbital flyers many of the old families kept private enclaves on tyrador ix estates where they could enjoy whatever holiday they desired rumor had it that it was often a hideaway for family shames and salacious gossip had many an errant scion sent here far from tarsonis and investigative reporters arcturus cared nothing for such things content just to relax and enjoy his leave far from thoughts of killing hed arrived on tyrador ix that morning and would be heading onward to korhal in the next day or so a week later and hed have to return to his unit so he wasnt going to waste time thinking about combat suits c gauss rifles or blood and death until he had to its beautiful isnt it said juliana threading her arm through his and looking up at the fabulous buildings on either side of them arcturus smiled yes certainly an improvement on what im used to scvs might be an efficient way to build things but they do tend toward a uniformity of architecture i love it said juliana theres no two alike that was certainly true the boulevard was paved with irregularly patterned bricks and the structures around them had a rustic charm and individuality that was sadly lacking on the core worlds they passed woodenfronted shops selling tourist junk alongside ad hoc art galleries of local painters and delicatessens serving food from all across the sector eateries and bars of all descriptions vied for their attention and the wafting aroma of a dozen different cuisines blended together in a mouthwatering smorgasbord of sensation having lived on mess hall slop for so long arcturus suddenly realized how much he missed proper food silken lamps hung from ironwork posts and fiberoptic lines of multicolored lights were looped through the branches of trees giving the boulevard a pleasingly festive air people thronged the streets men and women of obvious breeding and wealth arcturus saw that many of these faces had a strange and slightly unsettling uniformity to them and guessed that most had been sculpted with augmetic surgery or gene therapy street entertainers amused passersby with musk puppet shows and conjuring tricks and the sound of laughter drifted on the breeze farther along the street arcturus saw a group of soldiers drinking outside a roughand ready bar their cries for drinks and wolf whistles at passing women out of character with the rest of the boulevard they spotted arcturus and almost immediately the volume of their shouts diminished arcturus nodded respectfully to the soldiers their uniform insignias marking them as privates and lowranked ncos one of the soldiers a young boy who looked barely old enough to be in uniform stood and saluted arcturus as he passed evening lieutenant evening miss said the boy and arcturus could smell the alcohol on his breath from several feet away evening soldier replied arcturus returning the salute and stopping beside the bar none of these men would be resoced and thus iy would be bad form not to pass a few words with them though it wouldnt do to be overly familiar with them whats your name son he asked private shaw sir th marine combat engineers sir are you men behaving yourselves asked arcturus with a broad smile upholding the fine tradition of the corps sir yes sir cried the soldiers raising their drinks good work men said arcturus carry on and behave yourselves absolutely sir said private shaw dont you worry about us sir it isnt you im worried about said arcturus its the local women im thinking of the soldiers laughed and arcturus saluted once more before turning away and continuing onward with juliana the noise of the soldiers swelled as juliana squeezed his arm you look very smart in your uniform said juliana it suits you arcturus smiled he did look good in uniform two years of military service had put meat on his bones and muscle on his limbs his features had hardened and he carried himself with a confidence hed certainly possessed as a young man but which he now wore like a second skin thank you juliana ive already told you that you look beautiful tonight but you can never compliment a lady too much can you certainly not agreed juliana its been two years since ive seen you arcturus and i wanted to make an impression you certainly succeeded said arcturus looking around him certainly every man with a pulse seems to think so she smiled and said well if im turning heads im not the only one youre getting your fair share of attention too you know arcturus had noticed that he was attracting smiles from some of the womenand even a few menpromenading the boulevard but had modestly chosen not to mention it some were plainly lustful but most were simply nods of respect for his service in the military well they do say that women love a man in uniform its true said juliana in a playfully meeksounding voice we are a weak species and are easily undone by the subtle wiles of men if only you knew thought arcturus the restaurant itself was a curious mix of fringe world kitsch and core world chic and arcturus couldnt make up his mind whether he loathed it or thought it charming juliana made the decision for him when she laughed at the sight of it and clapped her hands declaring it wonderfully authentic the floor was wooden scuffed and discolored from the tread of thousands of diners and the air was smoky with rich homely smells perhaps a hundred people filled the restaurant and the animated buzz of conversation provided a pleasing backdrop they were seated without fuss in a cozy booth screened from the tables on either side by wooden dividers pierced by stained glass panels the seats were comfortable and they ordered their food from a pretty waitress who seemed genuinely pleased to serve them they made small talk for a while juliana regaling him with tales of her final year at the umoja institute and her new life as a budding lawyer she had begun working as a paralegal with a firm that specialized in stellar shipping laws and she hoped to gain her full qualifications within a couple of years at most both juliana and her father were still making regular trips to korhal to see arcturuss father but sensing that such a topic would not be conducive to an enjoyable evening she wisely kept her talk of korhal light in turn arcturus spoke to her of his life in the marines telling her of his tour on pridewater and the battle of turanga canyon though he spared her the goriest details and omitted his lack of empathy at the deaths hed caused some things werent meant for the dinner table the food arrived promptly and arcturus was mildly surprised to find that it was excellent he had ordered a dish of andouille sausage and shrimp with spicy mustard sauce while juliana had decided upon a creamy polenta with a mushroom and sausage ragout they shared mouthfuls of each others dinner and drank wine poured from a carafe of translucent blue glass as they ate they flirted outrageously arcturus blending just the right amount of compliments and selfdeprecating humor to keep juliana smiling and she frequently reaching over the table to take his hand or brush his arm the conversation flowed naturally and effortlessly and without even realizing it arcturus found that he was genuinely enjoying himself juliana took a drink of wine and said so do you like being a soldier the question surprised arcturus for it was apropos of nothing and he had been careful to keep his depiction of daytoday life in the military as neutral as possible i suppose so he said i think i enjoy more aspects of it than i dont as long as you do what youre told its not so bad i cant picture you liking that remarked juliana i dont have a problem with authority per se explained arcturus i have a problem when i think the person giving me an order is an idiot i suppose the marine corps is like any other organization with good people and bad people in its hierarchy the trouble is that in the marine corps the bad ones might get me killed dont say that warned juliana its not good to tempt fate arcturus chuckled dismissively fate i dont believe in fate a person makes his own decisions and has to live with the consequences logic and order are what determine the shape of our lives not fate anyway now that ive seen some real combat it wont be long before i get a promotion and move farther away from the front line i told you so didnt i juliana said laughing i told you that youd be a general soon well you said six months but i think it might take a little longer than that pedant pouted juliana sorry and are you learning about mineworkings prospecting and stuff like that arcturus shrugged so far only by taking them by force from other mining outfits which seems to be the way of things on the rim territories the intelligence divisionan oxymoron if ever there was onesends in a scout recon force on a given planet to find out whats being mined whos mining it and who theyre affiliated with then the datahounds scour the networks to try and find a legal loophole or a criminal record that they can use to justify sending in a force of guntoting marines to bully the miners away thats terrible said juliana shaking her head and the tarsonis council wonders why umoja wont make an alliance with them its not so bad though ive supervised a number of confederateaffiliated mining outfits when they go in to take over and ive learned a lot from that or at least ive learned a lot of how not to run a working mine but the confederacy is stealing those claims pointed out juliana my father says that the council is gelling greedier every year that pretty soon they wont even bother coming up with spurious justifications for their thefts he says eventually theyll just take what they want by force and soon there wont be anyone to stop them that sounds like my father talking yes well he might be right you know said juliana hesitantly knowing that she was risking an angry exchange by bringing up angus mengsk but thoughts of angus didnt anger arcturus so much now irritatingly the more years that passed the more he found himself thinking back to his father with the uncomfortable realization that a great deal of what hed said now made sense growing up arcturus had always thought of his father as the stern authoritarian patriarch of the mengsk family a man utterly unsympathetic to the concerns and ambitions of his young son in arcturuss adolescent world angus mengsk had never been young never run wild or known what it was like to be a teenager a creature possessed of a deluded belief in its own infinite wisdom and a conceited sense of entitlement and immortality maybe conceded arcturus and he smiled at the look of astonishment on julianas face im not saying he was right about everything but the more i see the more i think that perhaps he knew what he was talking about after all so what does that mean for you now i dont know said arcturus and that admission was more painful than he had imagined it would be his selfbelief had seen him through his tempestuous relationship with his father but to know that he hadnt steered his destiny as cleverly as hed thought was a galling realization i have to finish out my term in the marines said arcturus but once thats done im heading out into space and away from all this somewhere the confederacy doesnt care about and where i can live my life away from politicking and corruption that might be a hard place to find it might be admitted arcturus but when i get back to korhal im going to think long and hard as to where it might be are you going to see your father when you go back home yes said arcturus its the first time ive gone back to korhal on leave so mother has arranged a grand family dinner my attendance is apparently mandatory im dreading it nonsense said juliana reaching over the table to take his hands it will be wonderful i hope so arcturus said with a smile the idea of rapprochement between himself and his family giving him an alien but not unwelcome sensation in the pit of his stomach though to tell you the truth he said im more worried about seeing dorothy i think shes still mad at me for leaving and that little girl can hold a mean grudge shes not so little anymore said juliana shes a precocious sixyearold now the grand matriarch of her junior school arcturus smiled with real pleasure at the thought of dorothy ruling the roost at school shes a mengsk he said its what we do with the meal finished arcturus paid the bill and they left the restaurant and emerged into the fragrant oceanscented evening of tyrador ix the lights garlanding the trees shone like miniature stars their brightness waxing and waning and the silk lanterns bobbed in the freshening wind from the coast the air had cooled and juliana pulled her pashmina lightly around her shoulders cepheid boulevard was busier than it had been earlier the crowds drawn by the glittering lights festive feel and many attractions designed to part them from their cash arcturus watched the smiling faces walking past him attractive men and women and fell a wave of annoyance that he would have to leave so soon tyrador ix was a place of comfort and respite and it would be nice to return here sometime soon juliana slipped her hand into his and they walked hand in hand back along the street with the two umojan security personnel following al a discreet distance thank you said juliana for what for tonight i had a wonderful lime arcturus i like being around you arcturus smiled pleased at the compliment and said yes i enjoyed myself as well you sound surprised said juliana i dont mean to said arcturus suddenly finding that he was genuinely sad to be leaving her tomorrow its just that its been a while since ive been in genteel company you spend enough time with soldiers its easy to forget the simple pleasure of spending an evening with a beautiful woman well as long as you think im beautiful thats all that matters you are beautiful said arcturus i dont think you know it and thats what makes it so incredible juliana squeezed his hand tightly and stopped leaning up lo kiss him you realize she said that flattery will get you everywhere then you had better get used to it he said kissing her back a raucous cheer sounded from nearby and arcturus looked up to see the soldiers they had passed earlier waving at them from the bar their glasses raised in salute just like graduation said juliana with a smile arcturus smiled and sketched a roguish salute to his fellow marines almost he said i think these men are a little tougher than the students of styrling even as arcturus formed the thought the hairs on the back of his neck bristled and he turned to see a group of five men lounging by one of the handcrafted iron benches at the side of the boulevard they looked out of place their features rugged and pinchedthe faces of men who had grown to adulthood without a properly balanced nutritious diet it was a peculiar facet of human development arcturus had noticedthat you could tell the quality of a persons upbringing from the briefest glance at their facial bone structure even down to their skin there was a definite difference in the development of the face that distinguished rich from poor these men fell into the latter category without a doubt and he wondered why they had not moved on perhaps they were indentured workers on a break remembering how diamond de santos family had labored behind the scenes to make the resorts of tyrador ix such paradises then why were they here mingling with resort guests and their betters one of the men looked straight at him a man with a bulky trench coat that reached to his shins and whose head was shaven clean with a tattoo of a snake coiled around his ear is something wrong asked juliana sensing the sudden tension in his posture hmmm no its nothing he said not wishing to alarm her as she followed his gaze arcturus looked behind juliana to where her security loitered both men watching a pair of silverskinned fliers pass overhead he looked at the shavenheaded man with the snake tattoo and their eyes met through the laughing crowds juliana get inside he said recognizing the hard stare of a professional killer what she said but arcturus was already moving dragging her back toward her guards while keeping his eyes fixed on the occupants of the bench the man with the tattoo saw arcturus move and knew that his cover was blown he said something to the men next to him and reached inside his long trench coat arcturus instinctively reached for his slugthrower but his hand grasped empty air the pistol resting in its locked foamlined case in his hotel room safe snake tattoo raised a longbarreled weapon an oldmodel agr assault rifle and arcturuss heart hammered against his ribs as he saw it he had gone through boot camp with such a rifle a nononsense gun capable of firing supersonic jacket less slugs that could tear through a human body and leave nothing behind but shredded meat and bone the four men with the tattooed assassin unveiled a varied mix of pistols and rifles gun shouted arcturus heads turned too slowly and arcturus bore juliana down with him as he heard the screams of the crowd upon their seeing the guns juliana cried out as she hit the ground but the deafening roar of gunfire swallowed the sound the agr was a powerful weapon one designed as much to intimidate as to wound and arcturus scrambled on all fours juliana beside him he looked over at the gunmen watching as they played their fire over the front of the bar beside them the wooden frontage of the bar exploded into splinters the glass shattering like a million diamonds marines danced in the gunfire blood sprayed and the sound of bullets striking flesh was like a hammer repeatedly smacking raw steak arcturus saw private shaw hurled backward by the terrible impacts his chest blown out by a sawing blast of rounds other men were hit as well and arcturus saw a soldier torn almost in two by a torrent of fire shots sounded from behind arcturus and he saw one of julianas security guards crouched on his knee his pistol held out in front of him in two hands one of the gunmen dropped the back of his head missing and the guard calmly drew a bead on another before he could shoot again a burst of rifle fire took him in the chest and he lurched backward a bloody line of bullet holes tearing him up as though a grenade had gone off inside his rib cage julianas other guard scooted over to them give me her he shouled arcturus nodded and hauled juliana over to the man arcturus she cried but he forced himself to ignore her plea as he spotted the fallen guards pistol on the ground he scrambled over to the gun and swept it up twisting onto his back and aiming it toward the bench hordes of people ran in panicked confusion along the boulevard screaming over the terror that had landed in their midst the bar was a ruin of shattered timber and glass tables had been overturned chairs scattered and bloody bodies littered the area in front like multiple victims of a firing squad snake tattoo and his three comrades continued to rake bullets over the bars fronta httpfrontasege making the corpses jerk with the impacts fury touched arcturus at the slaughter of his fellow marines the pistol bucked in his hand and another of the gunmen dropped arcturus rolled to his knees and shifted his aim putting another enemy on his back a bloody hole blasted in his chest his accomplices turned toward the source of this new threat another pistol shot boomed and arcturus knew that julianas other guard was returning fire the mans bullet missed and snake tattoos companion swung his rifle to bear a look of hatred in his eyes arcturus fired first but his shot went wide a bar light that had miraculously survived the initial hall of bullets blew out in a rain of glass supersonic slugs ripped toward julianas protector and he was punched off his feet in a thudding series of bloody eruptions snake tattoo opened fire at arcturus but a fleeing tourist in a floralprint shirt took the valley the unfortunate holidaymaker fell as stray slugs tore up the ground next to arcturuswho didnt give his attacker a second chance he sighted along the barrel of his pistol and squeezed the trigger snake tattoo was spun around his shoulder a pulped mass of shattered bone and geysering blood he dropped his rifle and toppled backward screaming in agony arcturus rose to his feel moving sideways as the last surviving gunman swung his rifle around before he could fire arcturus put two bullets into his chest the man toppled dead before he hit the ground arcturus let out a long shuddering breath suddenly realizing how exposed hed been wearing the heavy plates of combat armor granted a marine almost complete immunity to smallarms fire but when bullets started flying it was easy to take that immunity for granted and forget that without armoras arcturus certainly had been just noweven the lightest handgun was deadly he tracked the pistol left and right keeping on the move though he doubted there were other shooters on the boulevard it didnt pay to be reckless he ghosted over to the shattered remnants of the bar crunching on broken glass and through pulverized limber dozens or maybe even scores of bodies filled the bar torn and mangled by the indiscriminate barrage of gunfire soldiers and wellheeled civilians lay together equal in death if not in life arcturus moved through the wreckage until he stood over the architect and sole survivor of this massacre snake tattoo wept in pain a gaping raw crater where his shoulder should have been he pawed the wound with a glistening red hand his breath coming in sharp hikes and tortured exhalations he looked up as arcturus approached his flesh waxy and streaked with sweat confed bastard he wheezed between groans of pain what the hell was this demanded arcturus what did you think you were going to achieve i aintafraidto die spat snake tattoo and i aint gonna talkyou might as wellkill me now fine by me said arcturus and then shot him in the face arcturus held juliana close as she was wracked with sobs her shoulders heaving with the force of her distress her hand gripped his back and her tears seemed neverending arcturus had been through the aftermath of combat and knew how to deal with the stress and fear of close brushes with death but this was new to juliana and he knew he had to let her vent her fear anger and grief in the wake of the shooting arcturus had dropped his weapon and rushed to her side holding her close until the tyrador armed forces arrived in screeching armored vehicles howling orbital flyersbrilliant white and emblazoned with the winged caduceus the universal symbol of healerslanded in billowing clouds of propwash greenclad paramedics spread efficiently through the crowd treating the wounded and calming the living as enforcement officers secured the dead attackers and gathered up fallen weaponry sirens and screams and shouts blended together rising into the night sky forever shattering the aura of invincibility the inhabitants of and visitors to tyrador ix thought they had until now this had been a planet everyone believed was far from the concerns of politics and warfare but the fallacy and naivete of that illusion had been cruelly stripped away by this atrocity nowhere was safe now the long reach of violence could extend even here the playground of the rich and powerful arcturus and juliana answered a barrage of questions from a variety of officials but after what seemed like a lifetime they were allowed to leave the scene though arcturus agreed to report to the local confederate militia station in the morning to give a fuller account of his role in the nights bloodshed words like hero commendation and medal were already being bandied around a police flyer had taken them to arcturuss hotel and no sooner had they crossed the threshold of his room than juliana broke down in tears arcturus guided her to the bed and sat next to her allowing her to cry and knowing that anything he might say right now would be trite and meaningless they sat like that for almost an hour before julianas sobs became less frequent and she prised herself from his shoulder her eyes were puffy and her makeup ran in black streaks down her face her golden hair hung limp her skin was ashen she looked achingly beautiful in her vulnerability im sorry she said i look a mess i arcturus ran a hand through her hair and kissed her forehead you look far better than anyone would expect after what youve been through tonight oh godall those people she said they killed so many people arcturus nodded yes they did but they wont hurt anyone else theyre dead now i killed them yes she said you did you were so brave you saved my life no said arcturus trying to sound modest but pleased at the thought of being seen as a hero i just did what i had to do remember im trained for this kind of thing i just acted without thinking if id thought about it id have stayed on the ground going up against five men armed with assault rifles with only a pistol captain emillian will have my guts for garters when she hears that she wont said juliana pulling him close shell think youre the bravest man shes ever met just as i do arcturus saw that juliana had control of her emotions now having come through the horror of the shooting with more aplomb and determination than most soldiers ever did he saw the core of iron in her and was reminded of the strength he saw in his mother as her sapphire eyes met his he saw a fierce passion there that reflected his own the full force of what had happened tonight rushed to the fore in both of them and reason was cast aside as they seized one another in a desperate embrace arcturus pressed his lips against julianas and she returned his kiss with hot urgency they tore at each other disrobing one another with no regard for propriety the nearness of death and the arousal of killing swept through their mingled flesh in an uncontrollable surge and they fell together with only one thing in mind drowning in desire arcturus had wanted this since he had first laid eyes on juliana and he gave in to the moment without thought for the consequencesconsequences that could bind two lives together forever soon they would be forced to part once more but for tonight arcturus and juliana sought to purge thoughts of their own mortality by affirming their life and humanity in the most primal way possible chapter korhal the planet of his birth until he set fool on it once again arcturus hadnt realized how much hed missed the place stepping from the orbital flyer that had brought him from the john lomas arcturus followed the crowds making their way to the starports exit given the anticonfederate unrest the unn was reporting on korhal arcturus had packed his uniform into his suitbag but his cmc identitags were hung around his neck to ease his passage through the security checkpoints under normal circumstances his tags should have allowed him to pass through with the bare minimum of effort but it took a frustrating two hours to travel from the flyer to the arrivals lounge the culmination of a severalday journey from tyrador ix and juliana their parting had been emotional and heartbreaking for her at least when dawns light had shone through the polarized glass of his hotel window arcturus woke with the bitter taste of regret in his mouth looking at the sleeping form of juliana perfectly outlined by the tousled sheets he had felt nothing but a profound sense of irritation at his giving in to passion and letting emotion cloud his judgment yes he had wanted to take juliana to his bed and had gone to some effort to do so but now that the deed was done he felt a curious regret perhaps the previous nights atrocity had touched him more deeply than he had thought but lying in the halflight of morning he felt a sense of closure and yet an awareness of new beginnings it was a curious sensation he had slipped silently from the bed and dressed then gathered his belongings before he could leave juliana had woken and smiled he had stayed long enough to share some breakfast before making his escape promising that they would see each other soon she had cried at the thought of his leaving and he had held her for an appropriate length of time before prising himself from her clinging embrace and with that he had left her arcturus wasnt sure exactly what he now thought of juliana pasteur on the one hand she was a beautiful woman but on the otherif he was honestshe had been nothing more than an exercise in satisfying his own vanity though it had taken him longer than he would have expected he had gotten everything he wanted from her and she was therefore of little further interest to him of course her interest in him was undimmed but that was a problem for another day putting juliana pasteur from his mind arcturus had boarded the john lomas and made his way to korhal as he strode toward the arrivals lounge he saw armed patrols of confederate militia at every step groups of hardeyed men and women scanning the crowds for any potential threat have things really gotten that bad there had been a few reports on the unn of the troubles on korhalriots ambushes and the occasional bombing but the media had played these down as isolated incidents perpetrated by lone madmen now here on the ground of korhal arcturus wasnt so sure my fathers been busy he whispered to himself the doors to the arrivals lounge opened and he emerged into a crowded concourse of eager faces men and women and children awaiting reunions with loved ones arcturus hefted his suitbag onto his shoulder and scanned the gathered people looking for a familiar face when he finally saw one it certainly wasnt one hed expected welcome back said achton feld taking arcturuss bag feld said arcturus by way of a greeting where are my mother and father and dorothy theyre down the coast said feld at the summer villa and they couldnt come themselves not safely arcturus sighed he shouldnt have been surprised but he had held to a faint hope that his parents might have bothered to come and greet the prodigal son back to the family heartland he saw feld sizing him up with a critical eye what youve changed noted feld something about you is different what do you mean i dont know exactly but you look better for it thats for sure im so glad you think so feld nodded wearily at arcturuss sarcasm okay thenlets get to the groundcar from the bedroom he shared with his wife angus watched the silver groundcar as it made its way along the road toward the summer villa a heavy feeling lurking in the pit of his stomach it had been two years since he had seen his son and the emotions of the day when katherine had tearfully told him that arcturus had joined the marines were as strong as ever angus struggled to hold his temper as he thought back to dorothys tears that same evening knowing that katherine had pinned her hopes on a family reconciliation tonight katherines happiness was the most important thing in the world to angus mengsk and he just hoped he could get through this evening without barking at his errant son are you ready said katherine from the bedroom door hes almost here angus turned and gave his wife a smile i dont know if im ready but lets go anyway please angus said katherine you promised i know he said reaching out to her she came into the room and took his hands but i cant forget how he hurt you how he hurt all of us you have to arcturus is our son but joining the military said angus shaking his head of all the ways he could have chosen to disappoint me stop it said katherine in a lone that warned angus he was on thin ice he is our son and he will be welcome here no matter what do you understand me of course dear but the boy infuriates me katherine smiled no one gets under our skin quite like the people we love especially family said angus especially family agreed katherine they wouldnt get to us so much if we didnt love them i suppose said angus wheres dorothy shes in her room is she coming down not yet said katherine sadly shes just curled up with pontius and says she doesnt want to see arcturus i dont see why she gets out of this and i cant grumbled angus are you seriously pouting because youre having to do something a sixyearold wont no shame on you angus mengsk said katherine now come on lets go downstairs fine said angus taking a deep breath and straightening his jacket how do i look like a father said katherine the groundcar drew to a halt within the villas courtyard and arcturus got out in time to see his mother and father emerge onto the steps before the front door his father was dressed in an immaculate severely cut suit of ash gray with the wolfhead emblem on the breast packet while his mother wore an elegant dress of cornflower blue the air was fresh with the tang of saltwater and a pleasing chill blew in off the ocean as five armed guards stood in the shadows of the courtyard arcturus stood straight and with his shoulders back trying to read the expressions on his parents faces his mother smiled warmly and arcturus thought he detected a faint hint of welcome even in his fathers stern features achton feld moved past him with his suitbag and arcturus followed him as he reached the bottom of the steps his mother came down and embraced him all her thoughts of reserve forgotten as tears spilled down her cheeks oh arcturus she wept its so good to have you home weve missed you so much he returned his mothers embrace feeling a powerful forgiving sense of return he surrendered to it and felt years of bitterness begin to wash away at the simple sincerity of his mothers welcoming love eventually his mother released him and he found himself facetoface with his father the moment stretched and the warmth of the previous welcome faded like a distant memory at last his father extended his hand good to see you son said angus arcturus smiled though it was an effort and you father they shook hands stiffly but arcturus could discern that despite himself his father was actually pleased to see him youve changed said angus so feld tells me replied arcturus though he seems unable to say how its your eyes youve gotten older youve done things that have aged you is that a good thing i dont know yet said his father releasing his hand arcturus saw his mother narrow her eyes and turned to her wheres dorothy shes upstairs said his mother asleep it seemed a shame to wake her arcturus caught the hesitation in her reply and said come on mother where is she really shes upstairs repeated katherine shes just well shes still angry with you after two years people can hold grudges for longer than that said his father arcturus nodded so i gather shes in her room yes said katherine but maybe you should let her come down in her own time dear i dont think so said arcturus if theres one thing ive learned its that its almost always best to tackle a problem headon the marines teach you that said angus no i learned that from you said arcturus sweeping past his parents and into the villa the entrance hall was exactly as he remembered it with its checkerboardpatterned floor dark paneling and goldframed portraits his mothers objets dart still stood on their while marble columns and no sooner was he across the threshold than a hundred memories from his childhood returned he stood in the warm hallway letting the smells of the house wash over him in a sustained assault on his senses the wax rubbed into the wooden floors the aroma of slowly cooking dinner the polish used on the silverware arcturus could hear the bustle of staff in the kitchens the creak and groan of an aged house warmed by the sun and the hum of the generator room deep in the basement the house spoke to him in a language of the senses a combination of a thousand different sights sounds and smells but they all blended into one simple feeling he was home how many soldiers fantasized about home all of them even the ones with nothing much to look forward to at the end of their term of service home was an idealized notion to most military men but here standing in the house in which hed spent every summer growing up arcturus knew that this was no fantasy arcturus climbed the stairs avoiding the creaking onesas he had always done as a childand made his way toward dorothys room he smiled as he saw that her door was still covered with colorful letters he knocked lightly on the door three slow knocks followed by three quick ones the secret code theyd used when she was little more than a toddler go away came a voice from beyond the door llltle dot its me he said arcturus i know realizing he would get nowhere like this arcturus pushed open the door and went in inside he saw that dorothys room had changed since the last time hed seen it it was still strewn with toys but there was an order to them now a hierarchy that had dorothy clearly at the top his sister lay on her back in the center of her bed pontius the pony held tightly across her chest the old pony was looking a little threadbare but dorothy plainly wasnt about to let that stop her from hanging on to him hello little dot he said im back home no one calls me that anymore said dorothy im not a baby anymore arcturus crossed the room to stand at the side of her bed observing that dorothy had indeed grown since he had seen her last she had blossomed into a pretty little girl with the distinctive high cheekbones of her mother and the thunderous brow of her father she wore a smart dress and her hair was pleated in two pigtails even lying down she looked every inch the mengsk she was he smiled okay so what do they call you now then dorothy silly she said as if it was the most obvious thing in the world which he had to admit it probably was what else would they call me sorry yes should have thought about that he said sitting on the edge of her bed i dont want to talk to you said dorothy rolling away from him and onto her side well thats too bad said arcturus i suppose ill have to keep the present i was going to give you maybe ill give it some poor children i dont care she said i dont want it anyway thats a shame it was a really nice present i told you i dont care said dorothy and arcturus saw he wasnt going to win her over with simple appeals to a childs greed as always hed have to go for the emotlonal blackmail i wrote to you every day but you didnt write back he said i missed you i really missed you little sister then why did you leave me she cried rolling over to face him and hurling pontius at him the stuffed pony bounced to the floor and arcturus leaned back as dorothy rose to her knees and hit him over and over on the chest with tiny fists you went away and left me without saying goodbye she sobbed he let her vent her frustrations on him without protest and when she was done he put his arms around her and held her tightly i know i did and im sorry i never meant to leave you like that then why did you go i never saw you to say goodbye ii had to go he said i couldnt stay here why because of daddy no it was because of me i had to go and do something for me something that wasnt some idea or plan of his joining up was my way of doing that you could have died cried dorothy soldiers get shot at and blown up all the time i see it on the news every day even though mummy and daddy dont like me watching it i kept looking for you i kept watching the news and wondering if youd been killed arcturus held his sister close as she cried not having thought about what she must have gone through wondering if he was alive or dead his mother and father would no doubt have assured her that he was alive and well but what force could compete with the imagination of a sixyearold im sorry dorothy i really am i never meant for you to worry about me im your big brotheri can look after myself and whos going to look after me youre my big brother and you promised you wouldnt let anything happen to me but then you went away and anything could have happened to me those bad men could have come back and shot mummy and daddy and me or a bomb could have blown us all up or those rebels with guns could have shot us because daddy has so much money the words poured from dorothy in a rush and arcturus felt his heart go out to her dorothy was a confident articulate little girland a mengsk to bootbut she was still only six he realized he had forgotten that nothing like that could happen he said as forcefully as he could daddy pays achton feld too much money for anything to happen to you and now that im a soldier i have a big gun and a whole platoon of marines who will protect you i promise she squeezed him lightly and he smiled knowing he had won her around i missed you she said i cried for a week when you left im sorry he said once more but im back for a while and i promise i wont go away this lime without telling you first mummy really missed you i heard her crying too daddy missed you as well he never said it but i could tell that he did arcturus lifted her face from his shoulder i love you dorothy and i always will i love you too she sniffed and its okayyou can call me little dot if you want thanks youre welcome said dorothy now wheres my present dining room and comprising several courses a wide selection of wines and a grand fire burning in the iron grate angus mengsk sat at one end of the long rosewood dining room table with katherine at the other end and arcturus in the middle to his fathers right dorothy sat opposite arcturus and sipped from a cup of fresh apple juice as was customary pontius sat at the table next to her with his own place selling arcturus and his father had shared a glass of port before dinner a breach of etiquette under normal circumstances but angus had never liked doing things by the booka trait he seemed not to know that he had passed on to his son angus had drunk a while port but arcturus found he preferred a darker ruby port and they had sat on either side of the chessboard as his mother cleaned dorothy up for dinner the carved pieces were arrayed for battle but neither man was in the mood for a game arcturus had defeated his father when he was eleven and they had never played since they spoke guardedly with arcturus unsurprised lo discover that his father was just as vocal as ever in his condemnation of the confederacy the special target of anguss ire these days was the fact that the construction of the new korhal assembly forum had been abandoned and the site bulldozed for some overpriced housing development of course the demolition contract had been awarded to a company owned by one of the old families the tygores and the new building contract awarded to a firm owned by a distant nephew of andrea tygore times changed but corruption it seemed stayed the same arcturus drained the last of his port as his mother and dorothy entered the dining room his father smiled at the sight of his daughter and arcturus was reminded that above all the politicking the railing against the confederacy and his complicity in terrorist activities angus mengsk was still a loving father the family seated themselves at the table and dinner began with the slightly strained atmosphere broken by the excited chatter of dorothy as she spun tales of her preschool class and the many children she played with as he watched the faces of his mother and father come to life arcturus realized that it must have been some time since dorothy had opened up like this conversation flawed around the table though arcturus saw how his mother skillfully steered them all away from any contentious topics the first course arrived a truffle custard garnished with small slivers of pate and arcturus made appreciative noises as he lasted the food like many wives of wealthy men katherine mengsk look a keen interest in the running of the household and the majority of the dishes served were ones of her own creation using local ingredients and incorporating her familys favorite flavors small glasses of a light sparkling wine were served with the first course which was swiftly followed by a mushroom risotto with baby arugula manchego cheese and a lemonparsley sauce used to living on a diet of ration packs and mess hall dishes arcturus found himself struggling with the sheer volume of food but a lavender sorbet cleared his palate in lime for a roasted rosemary pork loin brochette with tomatoport sauce and gruyere cheese grits finally a shallow bowl of sweet potato pound cake with a bloodorangeandbourbon glaze and nutmeg whipped cream was served and after one portion arcturus knew he could not eat another mouthful coffees were served and a small bowl of mints placed in the center of the table mother that was a triumph said arcturus as the last of the plates were cleared absolutely agreed angus and katherine smiled to see her son and husband in agreement for once im glad you approve said katherine i planned the menu especially for tonight i wanted us to have a proper family dinner together its been too long since we all sat around a table and just enjoyed each others company dont you agree arcturus hid a smile at his mothers seemingly innocent question recognizing an iron fist in a velvet glove when he saw one of course said angus hearing the same thing and arcturus looked over at his father to share a knowing look the ease of the glance and the natural way he had looked over surprised him as much as it appeared to surprise his father ive missed this said arcturus its good to be back home im glad youre back said dorothy and the matter was settled with the dinner cleared away katherine hustled dorothy off to bed though not before she had secured hugs and kisses for both herself and pontius from her father and brother with the women of the household away the friction that had fled upon their arrival snuck back into the room like a malignant shadow a glass of port asked angus and arcturus nodded ruby for me he said angus poured two glasses of port and handed one to arcturus they stood in silence for a moment and arcturus saw his father struggling to find the right words with katherine present conversation had been light and inconsequential but without her calming influence the tension between these two alpha males was resurgent im glad you came son said angus at last your mother went to a lot of trouble tonight and dorothy well you can see how pleased she is to see you and you asked arcturus are you pleased to see me of course you know i am you are my son i know but the last time we spoke wasnt exactly friendly you had just gone and joined the marines said angus my son the confederate marine what did you expect i expected you to respect my damn decision snapped arcturus angus sighed and took a sip of his port are you trying to pick a fight arcturus no said arcturus im really not its just well weve never seen eye to eye on lots of things have we not that i can recall no exactly and back when i was living on korhal every time you looked at me it was like you were trying to find faults with whatever i did nothing i did was ever good enough for you thats ridiculous said angus i just wanted the best for you you see that surely the best for me are you sure or did you want the best for you what i wanted didnt seem important all you cared about was whether i was a fit successor to you angus poured himself another glass of port using the time to curb an angry outburst arcturus knew that goading his father could only end one way but couldnt stop the words from flowing two years of pentup feelings were now coming out and he couldnt stop them arcturus you are my son and i have only ever wanted the best for you you are intelligent and can be the best at whatever you want to be but to waste your life fighting for a tyrannical corrupt regime that seeks to take control of everything in the galaxy is just stupid so now im stupid thats not what i said youre not even listening to me youre hearing what you want to hear so you can prolong this argument arcturus knew his father was speaking the truth but the memory of private shaw leapt to the forefront of his mind the image of the boys tornup body lying in a pool of blood on the floor of a bar on tyrador ix fogging his usual clearheadedness no thats not it at all said arcturus then what is it demanded angus because id really like to know its what youre doing on korhal said arcturus the bombings and the riots you and feld and your band of revolutionaries are still fanning the flames of hatred here arent you keep your damn voice down hissed angus why afraid this confederate marine might report you to the authorities you wouldnt said angus genuinely horrified at the notion of his son turning on him no of course not but ive seen the reality of what people like you are doing said arcturus i saw the bodies and the blood on tyrador ix and i heard the screaming you can justify what youre doing with talk of corruption and with clever wordplay but ive seen whats left behind i saw men shot down without mercy and god knows how many innocent bystanders were caught in the crossfire if thats what youre doing then i want no part of it the attack on tyrador ix was nothing to do with me arcturus said angus taking a step toward him i swear it we only attack military targets combatants because were in a war make no mistake about that military targets said angus pulling his marine identtags from beneath his shirt what do you think these make me tell me would you bomb me or authorize some other attack that might get me killed if it was part of your grand plan of course not arcturus why are you doing this your mother wanted for us to became a family again tonight dont ruin it for her it was a mistake coming here said arcturus putting down his glass and turning toward the door i should go no arcturus please stay said angus following him and taking his arm for your mother and dorothy if not for me arcturus turned to face his father ill be gone in the morning far from the glowing jewel that was styrling the darkness of the sky was absolute arcturus sat on the walnut bench his father had built at the end of the path from the villa watching the sea explode against the cliffs below in silver cascades a bronze plaque in the middle of the bench was carved with a memorial inscription to arcturuss grandfather augustus but the words had been obscured by a green skim of corrosion and could no longer be read hle sat and looked up at the stars wondering which ones he would travel to next the possibilities were endless and certainly he was likely to see a great many different worlds with the marines and once he was tired of military life a point he knew was fast approaching he would muster out and head to the rim just far enough out to be free arcturus felt a vibration in his pocket and took out his fone he waited until the tone had stopped and then flipped it open another message from juliana that made fifteen since he had arrived on korhal he sighed and replaced the fone in his pocket as he heard footsteps behind him mind if i join you said achlon feld if youre here to convince me to stay then youre wasting your breath im not i know its a lost cause trying to convince you of anything arcturus nodded and gestured toward the bench then sit down the two men sat in silence for a while content to simply enjoy the majesty of the view farther out to sea the ocean was like a black mirror vast and reflecting the stars above in wavering pinpoints occasional sliver streaks flashed across the sky arcturus liked to believe they were shooting stars though he knew they were simply starships hilling the atmosphere youll regret this you know said feld eventually what leaving like this you dont know whats going to happen in the future so do you really want this to be the last memory you have of your folks youre being melodramatic feld said arcturus it doesnt suit you im not arcturus trust me whats happening on korhal is more dangerous than you know the confederacy is running scared here and anyone whos seen combat knows thats when the enemy is at its most dangerous theyll try anything and as good as i am i cant guarantee anyones safety in the face of that kind of desperation are things really that bad feld simply nodded and said you can never go home isnt that what they say who they them whoever it doesnt matter what does it mean when you live here on korhal you think its the center of the world and you believe nothing will ever change then you leave and dont come back for a few years and when you come back everythings changed the connections broken what you came to find isnt there and what was yours is gone youll have to go away for a long time before you can come back and find your people the world where you were born but now for you its not possible youre not ready to come back to korhal or maybe shes not ready for you i dont know since when did you become a philosopher feld ive been around said feld and i picked up a few things along the way just dont do anything rash okay if youre going to leave fine leave but say goodbye first dont leave like last time dont burn any bridges is that what youre saying yeah i guess it is agreed feld say your goodbyes and then go and dont come back until youre ready to come back make a clean break until then arcturuss fone trilled again and he knew who it was without even looking juliana a clean break you say yeah i think you might be right feld chapter arcturus leaned his head back against the plyboard wall of the office and closed his eyes letting the hum of the airheaters and the clicking sound of lieutenant cestodas typing lull him into a semidoze it would be at least another half hour before he was admitted into commander foles office anyway appointments with brantigan fole were always late the bullish commanding officer of the rd ground assault division of the confederate marine corps kept very much to his own schedule and no one elses lieutenant lars cestoda the adjutant tasked with keeping track of the commanders appointments was a waspish and punctilious man who at first glance seemed an unlikely soldier but who positively thrived on the minutiae of army regulations desplle the convection heaters warming the office arcturus still fell the chill in the air and pulled his uniform jacket tighter hed need to request a new one soon this one barely fit his broad shoulders and wide chest the summons to commander foles office in camp hastings had come out of the blue as most orders did in the marine corps but this one had the reek of importance to it and thus arcturus had arrived early even though he knew it would be a while before the commander deigned to see him the outer office was plain and stark the only items of furniture an uncomfortable couch on which arcturus sat a pair of iron filing cabinets that looked old and battered enough to have come from the sarengo and the desk and chair used by lieutenant cestoda a few marine recruitment posters were stuck to the wall with thumbtacks which seemed a little redundant to arcturus since anyone likely to see these posters would already be in the marine corps arcturus stood and stretched hed been waiting for an hour and had already thumbed through a copy of battle flag the magazine of the cmc the paper version of the magazine had long since been replaced by digitome editionsand this copy had seen better days cestoda looked up in irritation as arcturus rose to his feet something i can do for you captain asked cestoda as though arcturus had violated some unwritten rule of the office no said arcturus just stretching my legs do you have any idea when the commander will be available presently thats what you said thirty minutes ago then you shouldnt have needed to ask again arcturus approached cestodas desk and perched on the edge knowing it would annoy the man sure enough cestoda glared at him but arcturus met his stare with one of his own you are aware of the etymology of your name i presume asked arcturus picking up a stylus from the desk cestoda snatched it back the what etymology repeated arcturus slowly it means the origins of words and how they arrived at their current meaning i was asking if you knew what your name means it doesnt mean anything said cestoda its just a name on the contrary my dear fellow in times past a mans name was what defined him many names came from a mans profession such as smith or cooper while others made reference to his disposition or appearance what does that have to do with me ah well you see cestoda is a class of parasitic flatworms that live in the digestive tracts of vertebrates and absorb food predigested by their host theyre ugly creatures little more than a body with only a rudimentary head for attachment to their host and one most common complaints regarding them is the nausea they cause just thought you ought to know arcturus got up from cestodas desk before he could reply and moved toward the insulated window that looked out over the barren bluelit hinterlands of onuru sigma the outlying buildings of camp hastings huddled beneath the cobalt sky and beyond the defensive turrets icy tundra spread out for hundreds of miles toward escarpments of glaciers that towered kilometers into the sky the sealant around the glass was degrading and the sulfurous chill of the planets arctic temperatures stole what little heat the convectors were generating arcturus studied his reflection his features rugged and handsome in the tinted glass his cheeks were well defined and he now sported a neatly trimmed goatee around his full mouth his eyes were as piercing as ever they were though far older than any twentyfouryearold mans eyes should be and his dark hair was thick and black he smiled as he saw he was the image of his father a younger handsomer version of his father of course though virtually every unn broadcast was filled with images of angus mengskthe madman of korhal they called himit had been a long time since arcturus had consciously thought of his father almost five years had passed since he had seen his family and though he had not passed a single word with his father he kept in regular with his mother and dorothy his sister had just turned eleven an age that made arcturus feel very old indeed it seemed like only yesterday little dot had been born but now her conversations over the vidfone were filled with talk of boys and parties and how she hated not being able to leave the house without an escort of soldiers the trouble on korhal was on the verge of getting completely out of hand and the pundits agreed it was only a matter of time until martial law was declared arcturus wasnt worried for his father who had chosen to live such a dangerous life but he fretted constantly for his mother and sister he had once promised dorothy he wouldnt let anything happen to her and felds warning that their safety couldnt be guaranteed still echoed in his imagination he turned as he heard a chime from cestodas desk and smiled at the irritated glance that ghosted across the mans features as he listened to foles voice through his earpiece cestoda looked up and said commander fole will see you now the commanding officer of the rd ground assault division was a short fireplug of a man with a short temper and a quick manner that left many of his fellow soldiers floundering in his wake his saltandpepper hair was kept cropped close to his skull and his skin was tanned the color and texture of worn leather from the rays of a hundred different suns an unlit cigar was clamped between his teeth and he chewed a wad of tobacco a habit hed picked up while stationed along the outer rim and never saw fit to discard when hed returned to more civilized space his uniform was immaculately pressed and decorated with enough stars to fill a decentsized planetarium arcturus snapped to attention and saluted the commander who returned the salute without looking up from the papers arranged haphazardly on his desk another officer one with the rank badge of a captain pinned to his white uniform stood at attention beside the commander this captain was broadshouldered and wore the power of his rank like a threat his features were arrogant rugged and pugnacious arcturus disliked him instantly he guessed the man was around forty which made him old for a captain and his physique was impressive for a man his age sit down captain said fole i have a job for you yes sir said arcturus taking the seat in front of foles desk this heres edmund duke said fole jerking a thumb in the direction of the man standing beside him a captain in alpha squadron his outfit is heading out to the noranda glacier vespene mine and i want dominion section to go with them arcturus nodded hed heard of alpha squadron who were supposedly the most efficient fighters in the confederacywhich meant the most brutaland whose motto was first group in first group out they were nicknamed the blood hawks which spoke volumes for arcturuss assessment yes sir whats the mission convince the miners itll be in their best interests to move on and leave the place to us the kelmorians have been busy around this system and the brass thinks something bigs in the wind which they aint too happy about were to keep a lid on things and make sure those damn pirates dont get too uppity you know the usual the usual said arcturus wearily if fole heard his tone he didnt comment on it but arcturus could see duke bristling if you have alpha squadron why do you need dominion section orders from on high are to combine some of our active squads im thinking of attaching your men to alpha so i want duke to carry out an evaluation in the field make sure everyones up to scratch arcturus was horrified al the idea of dominion sections coming under the command of edmund duke though he had never met the man before he instinctively knew he was an arrogant blowhard as he looked at dukes smirking face he realized he recognized him hed seen the same arrogant face on the unn when its reporters covered the activities of the old families edmund duke he said as in the tarsonis dukes the one and only drawled duke i hear most of your boys are rim world yokels that the case only two things come from the rim worlds boy yes yes i know interrupted arcturus returning his attention to his commander sir you cant be seriously considering this you cant put dominion section under this mans command you telling me what to do with my own division mengsk asked fole no sir said arcturus hurriedly but just as well carried on fole as though arcturus hadnt spoken youre a good officer mengsk and the men respect you but ill have you scrubbing latrines in a heartbeat if you try and tell me my business again are we clear crystal sir said mengsk anyway what do you care youre due to muster out soon so it doesnt matter who commands them i just want to make sure my men are in good hands said arcturus glaring at duke well that aint your concern no more mengsk replied fole now get out of here and make sure your men are ready for action mission briefing is at and dropships are skids up at a spiteful wind scoured the glaciaal slopes below the noranda glacier vespene mine arcturus kept his helmeled head down against the force of it his gaze firmly fixed on the blue ridge of snow ahead of him beyond which lay the mine itself the streaked sky above the ridge was squalid with scads of vapor and the emphysemic discoloration of poor emission control he marched alongside edmund duke the mans while armor decorated with dozens of rank badges and combat citations it seemed that for all his bluster duke had seen his fair share of battle it didnt make arcturus like him any better but at least he wasnt going into action alongside a rookie a hundred marines spread out in combat formation trudged up the rugged slopes toward the ridge seven goliath walkers marched in support of them but even thiese hardy machines found the terrain challenging their gyros fighting to keep them stable on the treacherous ice and snow vulture hovercycles zipped around the flanks and arcturus could just about hear the engine roar of the two supporting wraith fighters over the howling winds as they circled above the dropships that had ferried them from camp hastings had been forced to debus them a kilometer back the crafts poor aerodynamics unable to cope with me high winds and low visibility hell of a force eh mengsk said duke over the comms between their helmets you ever seen such righteous display of confederate might its impressive agreed arcturus its been some lime since ive seen this amount firepower gathered in one place yeah just wish i had me one of them siege tanks the ice here is too unstable said arcturus in all likelihood we would have lost it down a crevasse before we traveled half a kilometer i know that but with one of those babies we coulda just scared thiese damn miners out like the yellowbellies you ran into at turanga canyon you heard about that sure did you handled it pretty well but you were damned lucky those miners didnt have a pair of balls between the whole lot of them arcturus shook his head al dukes simplistic reading of the engagement but didnt reply as his fellow captain continued if i had my way wed just be chasing these dirtgrubbers away at the end of a volley of impaler fire and thatd be the end of it if a trifle heavyhanded said arcturus heavyhanded who do you mink you work for the boy scouts this heres me confederate marine corps and if youre ever gonna make something of yourself mengsk youre gonna need to get some ruthlessness in you is that a fact damn straight said duke slapping a heavy gauntlet on the side of his gauss rifle aint no messing with one of these babies tell me something edmundyou dont mind if i call you edmund do you how is it that a scion of one of the old families ends up out here pushing miners around as a captain with your familys influence and the amount of combat it looks like youve seen id have thought theyd have made you a general by now duke stopped and turned to face him and arcturus could see the cold anger in his eyes yeah i do mind you calling me edmund and why im here is none of your goddamn business we got our orders and im a man who obeys orders so why dont you shut the hell up and follow yours arcturus smiled as duke stomped off toward the ridge letting the man get a goodly distance ahead before embarking himself gee captain i reckon you done annoyed the big fella said chuck horner coming alongside him what you say to him nothing much said arcturus hows the section lieutenant theyre okay answered horner de santos grumbling about the mission yancy wont shut up chun leungs bitching about what this weathers doing to mayumi and toby aint said squat since we touched down so business as usual i guess chuck horner had served as arcturuss unofficial second in command since me fighting on sonyan a position he had fulfilled admirably eventually earning himself a commission to lieutenant arcturus turned and looked behind him the blue armored shapes of dominion section marching a discreet distance away from the marines of alpha squadron their walks and posture were as familiar to him as his own and he nodded to each of them as they caught up whats the story captain said yancy we there yet nearly said arcturus pointing to the ridge a hundred meters or so above them just beyond there this is some weather huh said chun leung holding his rifle protectively across his chest to protect it from the worst of the wind the mans visor was fogged and the plates of his armor were stained with pollutants yet somehow his weapon was still pristine we saw worse than this on parragos remember said yancy im trying to forget that one grumbled chun leung took months to get all that grit out of mayumis breech this gonna be more of the same asked dia de santo arcturus didnt have to ask what she meant most of their ops in me last few years had involved securing mines or frontier exploration sites from kelmorian prospectors either that or providing heavily armed backup to local enforcers riots and thousandsstrong protests were flaring up throughout the confederacy with ever more regularity and you couldnt watch the unn without some report coming on about a disaffected populace attacking police or marching beneath waving banners of course these were downplayed as a few malcontents but dominion sections experiences and arcturuss last visit to korhal told him that things were far worse than anyone suspected the confederacy was rotting from the inside out and the powers that be were holding on by their fingertips more of the same said arcturus as a sudden shiver ran along the length of his spine you know i rather think it wont be what do you mean captain asked yancy i have a reeling that duke isnt playing with a full deck said arcturus disregarding the military protocol of not criticizing fellow officers to lowerranked soldiers you think hes dangerous asked chuck horner very much so charles said arcturus im just not sure whom hes dangerous to noranda glacier itself towered over them a solid escarpment of blue ice on the opposite edge of a shallowbowled meteor crater gouged into the ice thousands of years ago the craters ridge curved away to either side and its far edge was over three kilometers away the cliff of the glacier reached thousands of meters into the air like the dwelling place of gods from ancient legend in the center of the shallow bowl a dark fault line spill the ice and the tendrils of a yellowish green vapor issued from all along its length a giant metallic refinery structure of huge pipes towering collection vats and flaring exhausts squatted at the center of the crater like a giant oilstained spider surrounded by a host of prefabricated storage sheds and roughlooking living compounds men in hostileenvironment suits went about their business below oblivious to the marines poised to march in and take their livelihood and huge trucks with spiked wheels crunched over the ice as they loaded up with containers of the precious gas it looked as though the place had been built in the midst of what had once been a ruined city with jagged spires of dark crystalveined stone clustered around the more recently built constructions the architecture of these ruins was a mystery but there was something about them that looked oddly out of scale with the humans tolling in their shadow brantigan foles marines lay in the lee of the craters edge looking down into the enormous crater the goliaths were hunkered down behind them and the vultures did looping circuits of the snow farther back high overhead the wraiths flew figureeight patterns lost in the clouds their engines inaudible a thrumming vibration was carried through the ice toward the waiting marines and arcturus couldnt help but admire the skill with which the builders of this complex had managed to anchor the refinery over the vespene geyser how had they overcome the problem of the shifting ice and the need to keep the collection heads stable arcturus couldnt wait to get in and examine the complex hell they must have to drill down a ways to get any vespene outta there said chuck horner indeed they do said arcturus according to the briefing the vespene is nearly thirty kilometers beneath the ice man thats deep said de santo surely there must be easier places to mine undoubtedly but this is an uncommonly large underground geyser said arcturus and even though its contaminated with some very noxious chemicals from beneath the ice its so vast that its still worth all the extra effort and danger to get it out danger asked yancy what danger aside from drilling over a dirty great crevasse i mean look at the color of the gas coming from the extractors said arcturus you see how it has a yellowish tinge yeah thais hydrogen sulfide a very toxic and flammable gas mix it with vespene and you have a highly unstable compound indeed so this place is like one big damn bomb asked dia de santo potentially agreed arcturus great said de santo this just gets better and better leaving his marines to gripe about the danger of this current mission arcturus returned his attention to the target below the ground was open and inviting easy to walk over but with precious little cover and to reach the central refinery itself the marines would have to negotiate the tangle of abandoned maintenance sheds and sagging storage hangars from the flaring exhaust gases it was clear the facility was in use but there seemed precious little activity for so large a refinery it was almost as though the few workers in view were going through the motions something about this whole setup rang false to arcturus but before he could give the matter any further thought edmund duke ran over at a crouch and dropped to his knees beside arcturus your men ready mengsk demanded duke we are confirmed arcturus how do you want to do this it galled him to defer to dukes authority but commander fole had been quite clear as to who held the reins of command in this operation duke looked at him as though hed just asked something stupid how the hell do you think i want to do it we go straight toward them and shoot anyone who gets in our way ill take most the men out front with the vultures and five of the goliaths you and your men fallow with whats left captain duke said arcturus giving duke his full title as a salve to the mans ego that seems a little heavyhanded we dont know whats down there and i have just finished telling my soldiers that the gases collecting there are extremely dangerous we have to be careful here careful my ass said duke waving a dismissive gauntlet aint nothing down there but a bunch of ditchdigging yokels mengsk nothing we cant handle of are you telling me your boys aint up to the job arcturus could feel his hackles rise at the insult to his section but kept his temper in check knowing that to let duke see his anger would give him the advantage in this exchange not at all dominion section is ready for action but we need to think this through we cant just go in guns blazing why the hell not arcturus bellied up lo the ridge and gestured to the refinery complex look at the number of maintenance sheds and derelict structures down there for all we know there could be a hundred or more men waiting for us its a readymade killing ground i dont like the look of this duke it smells of a trap mengsk the only thing im smelling here is cowardice snarled duke now get your goddamn men ready to move out or ill haul your ass in front of commander fole on a a courtmartial alpha squadron formed up and moved out on dukes order climbing to their feet and marching over the ridge toward the refinery almost immediately the workers in the mine ceased their labors and withdrew to the central complex the marines set a punishing stride across the ice their powered suits allowing them to close the distance to their target at a run five of the goliaths loped across the ice with dukes men their heavy autocannons spooled up and ready to fire dartlike vultures skimmed over the ice at speed easily outpacing the marines and moving in to circle the refinery with their grenade launchers locked and loaded arcturus let duke draw close to the refinery before passing the order to move on to his own men and the twenty his fellow captain had deigned to leave with him the two remaining goliaths lumbered alongside them one on either side of their dispersed formation though arcturus didnt think theyd be much use back here where their guns couldnt engage anything for fear theyd hit their own men man this stinks worse than that dead guy we found on phorekh said chuck horner stay watchful ordered arcturus and chuck keep in contact with the dropships sure but if the winds dont ease back they aint gonna do us a whole lotta good im aware of that just do it sir yes sir said chuck recognizing the authoritative tone of his superior officer arcturus watched as dukes men reached the outermost building in the refinery complex passing it at a run and spreading out to secure the target nothing happened and arcturus let out the breath hed been holding vultures scooted in behind the men and the goliaths picked a path over the frozen gravel that served as a level surface a wraith screamed overhead its spiraling white contrails painting the sky and throwing up billowing ice chips as it roared over the refinery at low altitude as the wraith pulled out of its run arcturus heard the metallic cough of a missile launch from within the compound how he could have heard it so clearly over the boom of the wraiths engines and the thunder of blood in his ears he didnt know but he would swear on his sisters life that hed heard it as clearly as if the missile had launched right next to him climbing on a glowing firetopped column of white smoke the missile corkscrewed into the air from one of the dilapidated supply sheds shreds of camonetting trailing behind it oh no whispered arcturus at first it seemed as though the missile could not hope to catch the wraith but its rocket motor flared and it surged upward at a tremendous velocity the pilot of the aircraft saw the threat and pushed out the throttle twisting his vehicle and heading for the open skies the missile exploded less than two meters from the pilots canopy and blew the front of the aircraft off in a bright orange fireball spinning wreckage tumbled down on trails of black smoke and slammed into the ice as though the downing of the wraith was a signal the rattle and pop of distant smallarms fire erupted from the compound ahead arcturus saw flashes of gunfire and heard shouted cries of alarm over the comm net in his helmet these miners werent going without a fight a column of flame whooshed skyward followed by a rattling staccato burst of secondary explosions armed men in green powered combat suits poured from the supply sheds previously thought abandoned and opened fire on dukes men goliaths in the same livery stomped into view and streams of fire erupted from the weapon mounts on their arms everyone forward shouted arcturus breaking into a run move it while the enemy troops were still tangled up with dukes marines they werent pouring any fire toward arcturus and his section but that would soon change if they didnt close the gap they were headed toward an olivedrab hangarlike structure with a curved roof if they could get around it then perhaps they could fall on the soldiers attacking dukes men from behind a vulture screamed around the building chased by a rippling stream of impaler spikes fired from loopholes cut in the building arcturuss men were heading for the pilot jinked his machine like a snake weaving in and out of the streams of fire but he wouldnt last long without help golialhs cried arcturus engage those shooters now the two armored walkers braced themselves and their arms spun up and around the already rotating barrels suddenly roared and meterlong tongues of flame blasted from the ends of their weapons flickering sparks and torn metal exploded from the buildings flanks thousands of rounds caning the sheet metal like a whipping plasma torch entire strips of metal fell from the hangar closely followed by tornup bodies for good measure a salvo of missiles rippled from the shoulder mounts of the two goliaths streaking inside the holes their guns had torn one after another they exploded inside the building and the roof boomed upward with each detonation flames billowed and smoke boiled from the shattered walls and roof the vulture pilot sketched them a quick salute before pulling his hovercycle in a screaming turn and heading back to the battle mengsk shouted duke over the comm net where the hell are you we need help now goddammit now on our way duke said arcturus hold on the fighting al the edge of the complex was fierce groups of armored soldiers dashing from splintered wreckage to piles of stacked steel as they fired quick bursts at one another arcturus chopped his hand rightthe direction the vulture pilot had flownand led his men into the complex impaler spikes chimed on steel and armor plates explosions flared and shrapnel spanged from the walls of buildings thankfully no one had been foolish enough to show anywhere near the refinery but that was surely a miracle that couldnt last forever closer to the complex the air was greasy and yellow and a thick fog coiled around their ankles arcturus heard shouts over the comm and skidded into cover at the corner of the building closer in he could see the trap that had been laid for them the supposedly dilapidated buildings were in fact cunningly constructed strongpoints disguised to look unfinished or abandoned an enemy goliath strode around the comer and swiveled its gun mounts toward him down he yelled and dropped into the fog a roaring sawing line of shells sliced the air like a fiery blade tearing up the icy ground and sending pulverized chips of gravel flying in all directions even through the dampening systems in his helmet the noise was deafening arcturus heard screams and the ringing hammer blows of shells tearing through armor and flesh a body fell on top of him most of its side chewed away blood squirted from the tornup flesh spraying arcturuss breastplate in arcing lines arcturus gagged back a surge of vomit as he saw toby mercurios lifeless features staring up at him through the smashed ruin of his helmet the goliath smashed through a pile of fallen sheet metal another roaring torrent of shells ripping through the fog toward them scattered marines were firing at the armored walker but their shots were having little effect arcturus pushed mercurios body away and rolled to his knees as another hail of explosive mm shells reduced what little cover there was to mangled splinters of plascrete and metal shavings a series of explosions burst against the goliaths legs and it stumbled its cannons swiveling to face this new threat arcturus saw the vulture theyd saved earlier streak toward the walker streams of grenades launched from the hovercycles frontal section and a series of explosions burst around the goliath it wasnt enough and arcturus saw that the pilot had doomed himself in his noble attempt to save them then a missile streaked past him and slammed into the pilots compartment of the enemy walker as the missile exploded fire blossomed from the machine and it toppled to the ground in a blazing mass of buckled metal arcturus twisted and saw one of his own goliaths the blue and red of the confederate flag a welcome sight on its front glacis smoke trailed from its hellfire missile launchers and arcturus let out a shuddering breath at how close theyd come to death the vulture pilot looped his vehicle around and sped off into the thick of the fighting without waiting for any thanks sir shouted a voice through the smoke and confusion sir are you all right he looked up and saw dia de santo the faceplate of her helmet cracked and scorched blood streamed down her arm where her armor had been penetrated and he saw that her eyes had the glassy look of stim use yes yes dia im fine he said pushing himself to his feet chuck horner ran up to him his armor similarly dented and battered holy crap he said when he saw mercurios dead body chun leung and yancy gray covered their blind spots as arcturus shook his head and regained his equilibrium whats the plan captain shouted horner this heres a real mess now that idiot duke really screwed the pooch on this one arcturus nodded and glanced around the ruined corner of the building once again the interior of the mining complex was a hellish war zone marines lay dead and dying as impaler spikes streamed back and forth like horizontal rain explosions mushroomed skyward and fires licked at the edges of the habitation compound the operation which had started so simply had turned into a disaster of epic proportions duke and his men had fought their way into and captured one of the strongpoints a brutal and heroic action that had probably saved their lives gunfire blasted from loopholes cutting down the armored soldiers who were attempting to rush them smoke and flames obscured much of the battlefield but arcturus could already see that it was only a matter of time before duke and his men were overrun he dropped to one knee and turned back to his own men sound off he ordered how many have we got altogether he had sixteen marines left alive and one goliath the other lying in a smoldering heap of flames and popping ammunition arcturus hadnt noticed its destruction charles do you still have a line open to the dropships yeah but fat lot of good its gonna do us under fire like this shouted horner aint no way those pilots are dumb enough to bring them flying coffins into this shitstorm tell them if they dont want to be shot by courtmartial theyll come ill pass that onm but im telling you those flyboys aint that dumb just do it arcturus opened a link to the surviving wraith pilot and issued her fresh orders thus far she had kept her altitude high to avoid any more missiles but that was going to have to change if they were going to get out of this mess next he cycled through the comm channels until he hit upon dukes edmund he said this is mengsk where the hell are you demanded duke were getting slaughtered here quickly arcturus outlined his plan to the besieged captain who didnt like it but was at least savvy enough to realize that it was the only way he was going to see another dawn okay mengsk well do it your way duke out with his orders issued arcturus turned back to his marines and said when i give the word were going to move forward and form a corridor between us and captain duke well babysit him back out of the complex so the dropships can pick us up got it they got it and he could see a fire ignite in their eyes at the thought of hitting back at these kelmorians his earpiece chimed with a shrill buzz and he turned away from the battle everyone incoming a sudden sonic boom announced the arrival of the wraith as it roared overhead on a strafing run a streaming cascade of laser fire tore through the middle of the camp n a storm of highenergy bolts ripping through dozens of the greenarmored soldiers and exploding amongst the trucks carrying the barrels of vespene gas one of the trucks detonated in a storm of razorsharp fragments and spraying gas fires ripped through the enemy ranks and the shooting ceased as men burned and died a thunderous salvo of air bursting missiles hammered the enemy ranks and bodies flew through the air as billowing pillars of smoke and flame erupted skyward now shouted arcturus and his marines broke from cover to rush toward dukes stronghold with arcturus leading the way they formed a cordon of soldiers with gauss rifles blazing to keep the survivors heads down arcturus saw an enemy soldier pick himself up from the ground and shot him through the head with a burst of impaler spikes more soldiers were climbing to their feet wraiths lacked a real punch when engaging ground targets but the shock and noise of the attack had given them some breathing room duke and his men were pouring from the wrecked stronghold to join them and under the covering fire of the few surviving goliaths the confederate force began to retreat from the ambush something exploded next to arcturus and he was slammed into the ground his rifle spun away and warning lights flashed on the hud of his visor a long crack appeared in the plasteel and the acrid rottenegg smell of sulfur clogged his nostrils he pushed himself to his knees and felt a series of ringing hammer blows on his side he fell back seeing a pair of greenarmored soldiers advancing toward him they were good disciplined soldiers and walked their spikes into him keeping him pinned with the weight of fire more red icons flashed up on his visor warning of imminent armor penetration then one of the enemy soldiers fell his faceplate a mask of red where a stream of impaler rounds had punched through in one sustained burst arcturus looked up to see chun leung standing over him mayumi pressed light into his shoulder as he calmly aimed at the second soldier and put him down with another fiendishly aimed stream of spikes with the immediate threat neutralized leung slung his beloved rifle over his shoulder and offered arcturus his hand with respect sir this probably isnt a good time to be having a liedown arcturus wanted to laugh at the absurdity of this remark but accepted leungs hand and hauled himself to his feet an explosion burst nearby and no sooner had arcturus gained his feet than he saw a strange look enter chun leungs eyes a froth of blood sprayed the inside of the mans visor leung cried arcturusm now seeing the platesized piece of shrapnel embedded in the back of leungs helmet as chun leung dropped to his knees he held his rifle out to arcturus look after her said leung and pitched over dead arcturus walched leungs helmet fill with blood obscuring the mans features horrified at the sudden random nature of his death he clutched mayumi tightly to his chest and with a final glance at chun leungs body turned and ran after his retreating men captain mengsk shouted a voice in his ear this is lieutenant wang in wraith one fox three over what is it lieutenant replied arcturus running backward and firing leungs gauss rifle into the regrouping enemy your dropships are inbound but you better get your asses moving im picking up a hell of a lot of incoming contacts on your location ground and aerial units big stuff too battlecruisersized looks like these guys are playing for keeps understood said arcturus can you give us any more cover ive got fuel and ammo for one more pass said lieutenant wang then that will have to do mengsk out arcturus found himself next to edmund duke the man looking more angry than exhausted by the days events duke looked over at him glaring in unreasoning bitterness you took your damn time was all he said arcturus bit back an angry retort as the last of the goliaths finally toppled its missiles cooking off in the heat of the explosion and skittering across the ice as they were released from exploding launchers a vulture smashed into the ice after raking fire from a valley of impalers blew out its engine the hovercycle exploded into a thousand pieces as it hit the ice and its pilot bounced across the rocks every limb in his body broken arcturus hoped it wasnt the same pilot whod helped them earlier the mining complex was ablaze from end to end and arcturus was amazed the whole place hadnt gone up in one enormous explosion looking at the towering glacier above complex he saw dark shapes against the midnight blue of the sky starships impossibly huge behemoths of neosteel descending from the skies on fiery jets like avenging angels a fleet of ships was coming in over the glacier and arcturus knew that the conflict between the confederacy and the kelmorlans had moved on from skirmishes and raids this was something much much bigger he caught up to the survivors of the attack as the howling lurching forms of their dropships swooped down into the crater their pilots braving the storm of enemy fire and the elements to rescue their men angels on our shoulders said arcturus running toward yhe ramps of the dropships arcturus stepped from the reeking redlit dropship almost as soon as it touched down on the gridded landing platform of camp hastings marines staggered from the bloody smoky interiors to be met by medics and triage attendants one dropship had crashed during the extraction but as arcturus looked along the line of survivors he was disappointed to see that duke hadnt been aboard it the camp was in an uproar as though someone had run an electric current through the entire staff arcturus ripped off his helmet and took a deep breath even the foul smell of the air here wasnt as bad as that of the blood and sweat inside his helmet chuck horner yancy gray and dia de santo marched down the ramp to stand next to him horner looked at the rifle arcturus carried chun leung arcturus shook his head damn was all chuck had to say about that arcturus ran a hand through his hair watching as scvs went about the task of dismantling the base ground crews were already dragging refueling lines out to the dropships and armored marines were hauling silver steel trunks from the buildings to the largescale flyers what the hells going on here asked yancy looks like were bugging out said de santo and in a hurry too arcturus had to agree with that assessment everywhere he looked he saw military personnel breaking down the base packing up what could be recovered and destroying what couldnt at the center of this controlled chaos arcturus saw commander fole clad in a suit of powered combat armor and directing operations with his customary brusqueness arcturus slung mayumi over his shoulder and marched up to him fole saw him coming and nodded curtly glad you made it out mengsk thank you sir replied arcturus whats going on what does it look like were pulling out of onuru sigma what why because this conflict just got hottern hell said fole general mah sakals kelmorians are bringing in battlecruisers and brigadestrength farces to push us off this rock battlecruisers where did they get ships that large from dont matter how they got them they got them snapped fole as edmund duke trudged over to join them fole planted his hands on his hips and said now youre both here i can tell you the bad news word from on high is that everyones term of service just got extended so i sure hope neither of you was planning on seeing home soon extended said arcturus why because gentlemen we are now officially at war with the kelmorian combine said fole chapter arcturus adjusted the dials at the side of the resonator wiping a film of moisture from its screen as the green lines of the display shifted and danced the gravimetric readings were fluctuating and though he was sure there was a sizable deposit beneath his feel the machines just werent confirming what his instincts were telling him looking up from the magnetic resonator arcturus cast his eyes over the dig site situated in one of the deep mistshrouded valleys of pikes peak the cleared terrain was dominated by six tall drilling rigs that cored the dense rock at the base of the river canyon battered habunits and storage bins were scattered across the drier pans of the valley floor while men in scvs worked the coring drills and chugging sifters worked night and day to separate what came up which so far was absolutely nothing of worth arcturus knew he was risking a lot with this venture having sunk most of the money hed made in the last two mines into this hunk of rock out in the far reaches of the rim but so far his intuitionwhich had served him so well in the pasthadnt uncovered the vast seam of valuable minerals he felt sure was burled far below the regolith the shallower valleys were paying out for other prospectors but so far this deep one had failed to yield any treasures he swore and slammed his palm against the side of the machine as a voice behind him said i keep telling you arcturus theres nothing in this valley worth a damn its here dia said arcturus looking up to see diamond de santo watching him her hands planted squarely on her hips i can feel it like arcturus de santo wore the heavyduty work clothes common to most outer rim prospectors heavyweave trousers a quilted jackel with numerous pockets and a battered hardhat she wore her dark hair in dreadlocks now and had them pulled in a tight ponytail at the base of her skull de santo bent down to examine the resonator as a jerking sine wave wobbled across its display at last arcturus gave up on the magnetic resonator and stood up straight wincing as sharp pain flared in his lower back too much bending over said de santo youre probably right agreed arcturus rubbing his hand over his grimy face and then through his hair there were strands of gray in it now and he knew there was only going to be more of them in the future hed seen angus on the unn yesterday and his fathers hair had gone almost completely silver so he at least knew hed likely not be bald when he got older you aint a young man no more said de santo with a smile nearly thirty im only twentyeight said arcturus im not over the hill quite yet yeah but you can see it from here soon itll be all downhill for you youre in a cheery mood today dia whats the matter de santo shrugged waving a hand at the work going on around them you need to ask of course whats the matter look around you arcturus said de santo weve been here two months and we aint found a damn thing worth sticking around for i know you think theres a big score in this valley but theres nothing here there is dia im sure of it said arcturus i can feel it oh you can feel it can you then how come the geological mapping the gravimetric analysis and the rock assay reports all say the same thing there aint nothing here and youre going to lose everything if we dont cut our losses and move on soon arcturus rounded on de santo our losses i seem to remember it being mostly my money that started this venturebought all these machines on credit and hired the workers to use them we made a little on that first venture enough to pay back our creditors and a lot on the following one youve done well for an exmarine dia but dont think for a minute that you are taking the same risks as me damn but you are one selfish son of a bitch arcturus mengsk snapped de santo i put all my share of those two mines into this one and i stand to lose as much as you man i figured once we got out of the marine corps youd become less of an arrogant asshole but youre getting worse you know that thank you for your candor said arcturus now was there anything specific you wanted or did you just come out here to berate me a little of both said de santo wearily fine so you have expressed your opinion said arcturus what else was there theres a message arrived for you on the vidsys console figured youd want to know arcturus took a deep breath fighting down his annoyance at de santos interruption but knowing deep down that she might be right fine he said at last keep working the resonator ill go see what it is de santo sat behind the surveying equipments display as he set off toward the central habunit where the crew gathered for meals and relaxation after the days labors he turned back as he walked any idea whom the message is from he asked expecting it to be from either his mother or dorothy signal origin code is umoja said de santo umoja yeah some guy called pasteur arcturus shucked off his boots and jacket as he stepped into the entry hall of the habunit letting the flow of dry air cool him down after the humidity of the dig site as he hung up his hardhat he saw that his palms were sweating and realized he was apprehensive whal could ailin pasteur want with him after all these years it had been nearly a decade since he had seen the man and their last words were not ones of abiding friendship was it perhaps juliana using her fathers console he hoped not hed taken achton felds advice literally and made a clean break with his previous life when hed left korhal all those years ago through the hellish years of the guild wars hed not thought of juliana or returned home on any of his infrequent periods of leave instead he had entered the marine corps study program earning himself innumerable qualifications in prospecting and mineral exploration in preparation for the day he could stand before brantigan fole and resign his commission damn but i hate to lose you mengsk fole had said when arcturus slid his discharge papers across the commanders desk the kelmorians are on the run and its only a matter of time until they got no choice but to surrender you sure you dont want to wait a while son youre a colonel now but theyre gonna be handing out promotions like party favors when this is all over you could be a general if you wanted no sir said arcturus as appealing as that is ive done my time and just want out what you gonna do with yourself mengsk youre a soldier you were born to be a soldier i dont think youve got it in you to be a civilian come on son the things weve done the things weve seen how can you go back to being an ordinary joe after that with respect sir said arcturus its because of the things weve done that im leaving whats that supposed to mean said fole all civility gone arcturus sighed i suppose i just dont believe in what were fighting for anymore fole had glared up at him and without another word signed his discharge papers arcturus shook off the memory and pushed open the door to the rec room inside conditions were spartan the meager furniture battered from the many times it had been shipped around the rim from potential claim to potential claim in one corner sat an old cineviewer where everyone caught up on the latest broadcasts from the unn or their favorite holodrama a number of mismatching chairs were gathered around a chipped formica table and a pool tableits felt faded and ducttapedsat in the corner beyond a bead curtain was a small kitchen unit and a communal ablutions block lay at the far end of the quarters where arcturus and a number of others slept and kept their few personal belongings against the far wall was the vidsys console a battered unit theyd bought secondhand and that had never quite functioned as the seller had promised but it was serviceable enough and arcturus had enough technical savvy to keep it running and allow his prospecting crews some fleeting contact with their homes a blinking red light flashed on the grimy oilstained panel of the console and arcturus set himself on the stool before it taking a moment to compose himself he ran his hands through his hair once more and wiped the worst of the grime from his face as he always did before opening any communication an unnecessary ritual since the message would have been prerecorded but arcturus never liked to begin anything without looking presentable satisfied he punched the red button and the screen fuzzed with static before a grainy image of a pair of threepointed stars locked together within a circle flashed on the screen for all his skill with electronics arcturus had never been able to get the color to work properly but he knew that one of the stars was jet black the other pure white this was the planetary icon of umoja and arcturus look a deep breath as the image faded and was replaced with the face of ailin pasteur the man had aged his face deeply lined and his hairline having receded alarmingly arcturus saw the years had been a burden to ailin pasteur and that he carried their weight in his eyes hello arcturus said pasteur ailin replied arcturus falling into the habit of most people when viewing such messages and thinking that the other person was actually on the other end of the link its been some time since we spoke so ill keep this brief the man might be looking aged but his voice had lost none of its strength and arcturus was quietly impressed as pasteur continued your mother told me youd left the marine corps and that youre working your way along the outer rim territories as a prospector well you always said thats what you wanted to do so i suppose that counts for something but a lot of things have changed since you left your old life behind arcturus things you need to face up to i havent contacted you before now because juliana asked me not to but like i said things have changed arcturuss brow furrowed at pasteurs words what had changed i need you to come to umoja said pasteur i know you probably wont want to bul im appealing yo any shred of humanity you might have left in you come to umoja arcturus as soon as you can the image of pasteur faded from the screen and arcturus chewed his bottom lip as he considered what hed just heard he replayed the message twice more searching for the meaning lurking behind pasteurs words but he could detect nothing beyond their face value he shook his head and went into the kitchen to fix a hot drink and armed with a tin mug of steaming militarygrade coffee he made his way to his quarters something had changed and it was something he was going to have to face up to what in the world could it be the room arcturus had taken within the habunit gave a narrow window into his personality he kept it as clean as was possible in a prospecting camp which wasnt very clean at the best of times a narrow cot bed sat against one wall with a gunmetal gray footlocker at its end bundles of clothes in need of washing were piled at the foot of the bed and a number of disassembled pieces of electronic kit lay strewn on a collapsible table in the corner the walls were largely bare steel though one wall had a gleaming gauss rifle hung on clothwrapped bolts and another boasted a collection of curling holographic images lacked to it in one of these images dorothy waved to him and blew him a kiss the image had been captured on her thirteenth birthday and a cake bedecked with candles flickered in the foreground dorothy was fast becoming the apple of every styrling lads eye with boys from all the moneyed families queuing up to court her only to be sent packing by her father and told to come back when she turned twentyone he reached out and touched the image as he always did and scanned the other images one of him at the graduation ball with juliana another of being presented his colonels stripes by brantigan fole and one of him standing heroically atop the glittering seam of minerals at his first strike a final image displayed the entire mengsk family standing on the balcony of the mengsk skyspire in this picture arcturus had just turned thirteen and his parents stood proudly behind him his mother holding baby dorothy in her arms styrlings silver towers spread out in back of them it was the last time arcturus could remember being truly happy he cleared a space on the bed and sat on the lumpy mattress with his back resting on the wall upon which hung the rifle arcturus sipped his coffee and winced as it burned his tongue he put the cup down to let it cool and reached up to lift the gauss rifle from the wall mayumi chun leungs weapon hed been reluctant to part with it after hed left the marines feeling that it would be somehow wrong to simply get rid of it or pass it on to someone else hed kept the weapon clean and maintained it as best he could but he knew it was a far cry from the immaculate condition it had formerly known arcturus worked the action and began to disassemble the weapon for cleaning as he thought back to the soldiers who had served under him in the cmc despite the constant reminder of de santos presence he hadnt consciously thought of dominion section for some time their faces growing hazy in the labyrinth of his memory chun leung and toby mercurio had fallen on onuru sigma killed as much by dukes headstrong foolishness as the kelmorian trap and yancy gray died on artesia prime when their convoy had been attacked by a chittering wave of spider mines erupting from the ground the lads legs had been vaporized in the blast and not even the skill of the combat medics could save him hed died screaming in the back of a truck sloshing with blood only chuck horner and dia de santo had survived to reach the end of their extended service along with arcturus as arcturus had expected dia mustered out and chose to accompany him to the outer rim territories and help him pursue his dreams of becoming a prospector she had invested what little money shed saved while still in the service and had become a pretty damn good prospector with a nose for when a find was going to pay out and when it wasnt what else am i gonna do co back to tyrador ix and work for rich folks not this lifetime shed said when hed once asked her why shed followed him out of the marine corps he suspected that wasnt the full story but hadnt pressed her for details chuck horner had chosen a civilian life and arcturus was glad his second in commandwhod reached a captains salary by the time he lefthad come through the wars unscathed horner had married a woman hed met on leave and they planned to start a new life together arcturus had shaken chucks hand and wished him luck thanks sir said chuck as they parted on the docks above the gas giant dylar iv i reckon we could all do with a little extra luck now my own self i done believe i used a whole lot moren i could expect to see during this war so any extra you gots gratefully received men carlaare gonna head out to mar sara see if we cant make a life for ourselves shes a bit young and idealistic but i guess we all were once arcturus never saw chuck horner again captain emillian hadof course remained with the marine corps but arcturus had no idea what had become of her since his departure despite her talk of hunting handsome doctors arcturus knew emillian was a career soldier and would no doubt see out her days in the military either dying on some nameless battlefield or mustering out on retirement the odds were vastly in favor of the former but if anyone could buck those odds it was angelina emillian arcturus and dia de santo had taken a ship out to the outer rim territories and set up their prospecting and mining enterprise taking jobs the bigger outfits didnt like the look for one reason or another and had quickly made a name for themselves as skillful and dedicated players their first strike had enabled them to clear their debts and acquire bigger more powerful drilling machines as well as more advanced survey equipment their second strike had been considerably larger and netted them a hell of a payday but interference from both the kelmorian combine and the confederate exploration corps had become too onerous and arcturus had sold the claim for a small fortune and headed farther out into space the worlds al the very edge of the outer rim were less frequented and offered the potential for even bigger unclaimed strikes but by the same token they were more isolated and vulnerable to piratical bands or heavily armed competition with the money theyd made in their second strike arcturus and de santo had bought an old starship named the kitty jay and filled her with fresh equipment skilled workers scvs and even a handful of exmarines for protection they had come to pikes peak on the strength of prospectors tales and an old assayers report arcturus had found buried within the data architecture of a forgotten confederate database de santo had balked at risking everything on such scant information but arcturus had been insistent and his instincts had never been proved wrongyet for as had been pointed out so bluntly to him not twenty minutes ago they had found nothing of worth here and unless they hit paydirt soon their dwindling capital would soon be exhausted it was a depressing thought and arcturus pushed it aside as he worked an oiled rag along the length of the gauss rifle the weapon was as clean as it was going to get and he began reassembling it wondering if hed be called to use it to defend this claim the guild warsas the unn snappily called itwas entering its fourth year and from what arcturus had seen of the fighting he knew that brantigan fole was right the kelmorians were going to lose it remained to be seen what that meant for smaller outfits like his but arcturus suspected that it wouldnt take long for the confederacy to turn its attention to the unclaimed resources of the outer rim arcturus snapped the last piece of the weapon into place and clicked the magazine home he laid the rifle across his knees and leaned his head back against the wall looking over at the holographs opposite him he looked at the image of juliana and himself smiling for the holocam and smiled at the memory wondering what ailin pasteur could want with him it likely wouldnt be anything to do with his family or hed have heard from his mother or dorothy perhaps something had happened to juliana but then why would pasteur turn to arcturus he didnt yet know whether hed even heed the request to travel to umoja he owed ailin and his daughter nothing and had no obligation to make such a journey but a nagging curiosity gnawed at the back of his mind his train of thought was interrupted as he heard running footsteps along the corridor outside and the sound of diamond de santo calling his name he lifted the rifle and placed it beside him on the bed as de santo burst into his room her eyes alight with excitement and the breath heaving in her lungs holy hell arcturus you need to get your ass outside now what is it whats going on you were right gasped de santo goddammit it but you were right its unbelievable slow down dia said arcturus swinging his legs off the bed and standing up de santo threw herself at him embracing him in a crushing bear hug arcturus prized her grip from around his neck and held her at arms length listen to me dia slow down what are you talking about whats unbelievable she took several calming breaths before speaking but arcturus saw the thrill in her eyes and felt an electric sense of excitement pass between them the claim said de santo you were righttheres minerals right below us but we couldnt see them turns out the resonators were getting some backscatter from a higher stratum of banded ironstone are you sure demanded arcturus have you checked yeah one of the drills brought up a core sample that showed a layer of magnetite and shale once i adjusted the resonator to filter that out oh man you gotta see it its the biggest deposit ive ever seen were rich arcturus okay you need to calm down dia no way man this is big arcturus i never even heard of a seam this huge its still gonna be paying out when our grandkids are drawing their pensions four days later and the party still hadnt stopped if anything de santo had underplayed the scale of the find and with the resonator properly calibrated to reach beyond the banded ironstone layer there seemed no end to the length breadth and depth of the mineral seam with arcturuss confirmation of the veracity of the find and the first samples brought to the surface the assembled workers and marines had broken out the alcohol and the party had begun in earnest heavier drilling rigs were even now being built to more quickly exploit the enormous find and arcturus knew that this strike was going to make him a very rich man indeed richer than any prospector in the history of the confederacy had ever managed after a lifetime of exploration and digging the rec room was filled with people miners assayers and soldiers the heavier drilling rigs were due to go online tomorrow and the scvs had made a good start on the construction of an extraction refinery but tonight everyone was relaxing this was likely to be the only time off anyone was going to get in the next few months as they established a more permanent facility on the claim and everyone was making the most of it arcturus sat on one of the chairs around the table listening to the excited banter of his staff and letting them congratulate him on the intuitive instinct that had led them to this windfall everyone expected to get rich from this find and for once it looked as though that might actually be the case bottles of alcohol were passed around and toasts raised to future fortunes arcturus listened to his mens grand plans about how they were going to spend their money and took a proffered mug of lethally strong hooch dia de santo sat next to him smiling broadly and flicking through the few channels they received on the cineviewer various images flickered in the corner of the room adverts mainly but arcturus sat up as a familiar face ghosted into focus onto the projection he read the caption that scrolled along the bottom of the image and said wait as he saw de santo reaching to change the channel turn it up the speakers crackled and spat but eventually arcturus heard his fathers voice though the sound of revelry in the rec room all but drowned him out quiet barked arcturus and the room was instantly silenced he stood and walked over to stand right in front of the viewer as the caption repeated across the bottom of the screen martial law on korhal as senator angus mengsk declares war on the confederacy tarsonis promises stern measures of retaliation on the viewer angus stood addressing a thousandsstrong crowd from a podium erected on what arcturus recognized as the martial field a sea of adoring faces stared up at his father as he held forth on his favorite subject the rampant corruption of the confederacy though the unn had muted his words anguss fist hammered the air as he spoke his call to arms answered by deafening cheers from the crowd arcturus saw his mother and dorothy standing proudly behind his father as the announcer spoke disgustedly of planetwide riots the capture of the unn tower and attacks on confederate outposts that had seen thousands dead the view rotated between confederate barracks on fire vast crowds of people on the streets with brightly painted banners and angus shouting to the gathered followers like the fiery demagogue of some ancient fireandbrimstone faith was this the reason ailin pasteur had wanted him to travel to umoja what did pasteur know that the unn wasnt reporting stern measures of retaliation he said what did that mean arcturus turned from the cineviewer and marched down the corridor to his room he pushed open the door and began packing a bag stuffing in the few clean clothes he had left dia de santo pushed into his room seconds later her face betraying her worry what are you doing arcturus im leaving said arcturus isnt it obvious tell me youre joking you cant leave now just watch me were on the verge of digging out the biggest mineral strike this side of the long sleep and you wanna leave damn it arcturus we need you here i need you here dont worry dia said arcturus reaching out and putting a hand on her shoulder ill be back soon im going to take the kitty jay to umoja but i will be back i promise umoja why the hell do you need to go there i need to see ailin pasteur said arcturus then i need to make sure my family is safe arcturus stepped through a haze of steam and oilsmoke onto the surface of umoja or at least onto the heatresistant ceramic landing platform that had just descended a few hundred meters into the surface of umoja a drizzle of moisture clung to his skin like humidity and the heat bleeding from the kitty jays engines warmed the air traveling between worlds always made arcturus uneasy the unknown dimensions of deep space and all that might lurk in its vast emptiness fired his imagination with images of asyet unknown aliens and piratical corsairs as master of his own destiny the placing of his fate in the hands of another even one as qualified as morley sanjayathe pilot hed hired when hed bought the kitty jay unsettled him greatly though he could not fly a starship arcturus felt sure that if he were to try he would master it quickly enough and make better time than the two weeks it had taken them to get here ailin pasteurs private landing platform was empty and its underground walls were a mixture of rock and metal scorched black by the comings and goings of orbital craft a flashing amber light rotated above a shuttered blast door and a low buzz of static poured from a speaker recessed in the wall the light flicked off and the blast door began to rumble upward a squad of men clad in combat suits of pale blue plate and carrying gauss rifles marched out onto the platform followed by a man wearing a dark suit and a foulweather cloak ailin pasteur the last time arcturus had seen pasteur had been at the close of session of the коrhal senate where the man had berated him for how he had just treated his mother with the benefit of hindsight arcturus now accepted that his actions might have been a little rash that day which bought pasteur some goodwill pasteur slopped al the base of the steps that led up to the landing platform hello ailin said arcturus slinging his suitbag over his shoulder id say good morning or good evening but i dont know which it is its evening arcturus said pasteur welcome to umoja though the words were said with formal politeness arcturus sensed the rancor behind them was this some charade for the soldiers standing at pasteurs back thank you said arcturus stepping down from the platform and waving a hand in the direction of the opened blast door shall we pasteur nodded and turned on his heel clicking his fingers al the soldiers who quickly followed marching in lockstep behind them pasteur led him into a series of rock corridors that looked as though they had been bored through with fusion cutters arcturus noted the quality and type of the rock smiling as he found himself calculating the density of the rock and rate per hour that it could be excavated walking alongside him pasteur saw the smile and said something funny not really said arcturus i still have my prospecting head on look tell me what this is all about ailin my outfits just struck a huge mineral deposit and we need to get our operation up and running before the confederate exploration corps gets wind of it so come on whats going on its better if you see for yourself said pasteur arcturus sighed if this has something to do with my family then i want to know now oh it has something to do with your family all right snapped pasteur but i promised i wouldnt say anything and i am a man of my word this last comment appeared to be particularly barbed and arcturus wondered what he had done to deserve such animosity but pasteur would not be drawn on the subject and arcturus left him to his silence as they made their way deeper into the complex they arrived at an elevator and traveled to the surface within its gleaming silversteel interior the elevator emerged into the wide hallway of a sizable dwelling not unlike that of the mengsk summer villa the walls were white marble and the floor was a mixture of gleaming hardwood and expensivelooking rugs an iron screw stair led back down into the rock and a wide set of carpeted stairs led up toward a second story a shining dome pierced with panels of stained glass surmounted the hallway and a chandelier of flickering candles floated beneath its curve very nice said arcturus as ailin pasteur led him toward a thick wooden door pasteur opened the door and indicated that arcturus should step through arcturus swept past and entered a long room set with expensive furniture and a crackling fire that burned beneath a wide mantel the smell of hot coffee and sweet fruits hung in the air and arcturus saw juliana sitting in a large chair beside the fireplace she looked up as he entered and her face transformed surprisingly with genuine pleasure at the sight of him in the intervening years juliana had grown up features that were girlish and coqueitish when hed last seen her were now womanly and strong juliana had lost nothing of her figure and when she stood and straightened her dress arcturus was again reminded of the poise and grace of his mother arcturus stepped farther into the room then pulled up short as he saw a young boy sitting on the floor in front of the fire dressed in dark trousers and a matching shirt his shoulderlength golden hair was pulled back in a small ponytail arcturus was no expert in such matters but he guessed the boys age at around six or seven the boy sat in the midst of a pile of colored plastic bricks built as though he had decided to construct a ruined city tiny toy soldiers were scattered through these ruins and arcturus watched the child move them while making shooting noises with his mouth we have company said juliana and the child looked up arcturus received a dazzling smile from the boyand felt like hed been kicked in the stomach startlingly handsome the child was blessed with high cheekbones wide gray eyes creamy skin and just the hint of a hawkish curve to his nose whats going on here hissed arcturus as ailin pasteur shut the door behind him valerian said juliana say hello to your father book valerian chapter valerians eyes flickered and ailin pasteur smiled as he watched the lad fight the tiredness that threatened to overcome him it had been a long day and emotions had been running high as they awaited the arrival of arcturuss ship his grandson had been excited enough for all of them which wasnt surprising given the inflated stories juliana had filled his head with over the last seven years ailin sat on the side of valerians bed smiling as his grandson blinked furiously at the onset of sleep but im not tired grandpa said valerian why cant i speak to my dad ive waited all day for him then one more nights sleep wont hurt will it hell still be here in the morning ailin dearly hoped that was true for if hed learned anything about arcturus from speaking with angus and katherineit was that their son was inclined to be capricious when it came to remaining in one place for any length of time hes just like i imagined him said valerian and ailin pasteur fought to keep the worry from his face juliana had built up the boys expectations of his father since his birth despite ailins warnings to her not to do so it was a source of constant bafflement to ailin how juliana could still hold a torch for arcturus given how terribly he had treated her albeit part of that mistreatment was through ignorance of valerians existence he still remembered the day juliana had told him she was pregnant pride and joy were mixed with anger and fear as he realized that juliana wasnt going to tell arcturus that he was to be a father to this day he couldnt understand or dent her reasoning founded as it was on years of adoration from afar they had argued furiously about her refusal to tell arcturus of her pregnancy those arguments only ending when juliana had threatened to leave and never allow him to see her child should he so much as breathe a word to any of the mengsks faced with such an ultimatum what could any father do but accede in julianas worldview arcturus had things he had to do on his quest for greatness and she couldnt distract him until the time was right now that arcturus had left the military that time had apparently arrived though it had been galling to see his daughter give up on her nascent legal career in favor of impending motherhood juliana was happy and he couldnt deny the pleasure he took from seeing that happiness when valerian had been born it seemed her joy was complete ailin adored the boy but then valerian was easy to love blessed as he was with his mothers grace and his fathers strong features as valerian had grown he began to display a quick wit and a devilish streak that ailin knew only too well from his trips to korhal and previous encounters with the mengsk family only once or twice had ailin sensed his daughters regret at her abandonment of her career but all she had to do was look into valerians beautiful face and it was swept away in a rush of adoration afler the sudden and shocking introduction to his son arcturus had gone quite pale and for once been lost for a scathing retort a master of reading peoples emotions ailin had seen the anger building in arcturus and whisked valerian away from the ugly drama that was no doubt unfolding below valerian had protested but ailin had learned to be the firm hand in valerians life that his mother most certainly was not is dad going to live with us now asked valerian breaking into ailins thoughts i dont know val said ailin unwilling to sugar his response valerians mother did enough of that hes just arrived and i dont know what hes going to do mum wants him to stay i expect youre right but try not to worry about it get some sleep eh wheres my dad been asked valerian with the relentless curiosity of a child hes been in the army valerian fighting bad men or aliens aliens it always came back to aliens with valerian ever since ailin hadunder protestread him a bedtime story about invading creatures from another world the boy had been fascinated by the idea that other lifeforms might once have existed or might still exist somewhere in the galaxy ailin and juliana had taken valerian as a young childunder armed escort of courseto the far canyons and riverbeds of umoja in search of relics of those lost civilizations undaunted by his singular lack of success valerian had nevertheless excavated a host of ancient artifactsoddly contoured rocks petrified bark and the shells of dead creatures he proudly claimed to be the remains of aliens no valerian i dont think your father was fighting aliens so who was he fighting thais kind of hard to answer said ailin trying to think of a way to explain where valerians father had been and what he had been doing without upsetting the youngster as much as ailin hated the institution of the confederate marine corps he did not want to rob valerian of his idealized image of his father before hed even met the man properly and formed his own opinion arcturus would disabuse the boy of any heroic notions soon enough anyway he thought i bet my dads a war hero said valerian i bet he killed hundreds of men im sure he did said ailin but hes not a soldier anymore is he no not anymore so what does he do now asked valerian mum just tells me hes doing great work but i dont really know what that means im told hes been a prospector out on the fringe worlds since he left the army said ailin quite a good one too by all accounts is he rich im not sure but from the sound of it i think he might be soon good declared valerian i want to be rich too ailin smiled you know were not exactly poor here valerian i know but i want to find aliens when i grow up and im going to need a lot of money to do that arent i i suspect you might ailin said laughing youll need a fleet of spaceships the best archaeologists money can buy and all sorts of tools oh i wont need archaeologists i want to do the digging myself really of course said valerian if anyones going to find aliens i dont want it to be anyone except me where would the fun be in that i suppose youre right i hadnt thought of that said ailin pride and love filling his heart at the excitement in valerians face now go to sleep val youve got a big day tomorrow yes said valerian pulling the covers tightly around him with a contented smile as his eyes drifted shut im going to meet my dad tomorrow ailin pasteur rose from the bed and turned off the light beside valerians bed he made his way to the door and slipped from his grandsons room yes he said youre going to meet your father i just hope hes all you hope for arcturus still couldnt quite believe it he was a father he was a father how was the first question that leapt to mind swiftly followed by a mental kick to the backside how do you think it happened idiot he wanted to say something but the words wouldnt come he wanted to deny it but the cast of the boys countenance was unmistakable every curve of feature was that of a mengsk and the analytical part of arcturuss brain had seen that the boy was a handsome lad indeed obscenely gifted with the best genes his parents had to offer no sooner had ailin led the boy away than juliana said something arcturus didnt hear it his head was filled with the white noise of a million questions and the rush of blood around his body the crackling of the fire was like the roar of a great inferno and he fell the air in his lungs rasping along his throat and from his mouth juliana rose from her chair with a pained expression and crossed the room toward him with her arms outstretched without thinking he took her in his arms and held her as she rested her head on his shoulder and whispered things he couldnt understand he stood like that for several moments before the reality of the situation washed over him in a tsunami of anger and betrayal arcturus took hold of julianas arms and pushed her away as though she were contaminated with some vile plague i have a son he said striding away from her yes said juliana smiling broadly you have a wonderful son his name is valerian a good name said arcturus strong juliana nodded i knew youd be pleased with that it suits him too arcturus was pleased with the name but more pressing concerns needed to be addressed why the hell didnt you tell me he said you kept this from me for all these years why would you do that juliana why she recoiled from his anger and he saw the fear in her eyes normally such behavior would have repulsed him but now he relished it wanting to hurt her for the insult of keeping a secret from him and what a secret answer me damn you snapped arcturus when she turned away from him and stepped close to the fireplace she held on to the mantelpiece and coughed into a handkerchief before turning to face him i thought youd be pleased she said pleased that youve lied to me and kept the fact that ithat we have a child together what the hell did you expect that id be pleased with this that id be happy to know i was a father just when my life is taking off the way ive always dreamed thats why i couldnt tell you before now cried juliana all those great plans and dreams you told mei knew i couldnt get in the way until you were ready to realize them i know you just joined the marine corps to punish your father and i couldnt tell you about valerian while you were fighting in the guild wars why not said arcturus spying a drinks tray on the sideboard and pouring himself a hefty measure of something amber and pungent knowing you had a son would have made your life so much harder arcturus took a belt of strong liquor what are you talking about i didnt want you thinking of anything except staying alive arcturus i didnt want to do anything that might distract you and get you killed but now youre out of the military and i asked my father to keep tabs on how you were doing arcturus poured himself another glass of liquor deciding that it was some kind of brandy he hoped it was expensive and old if youve been keeping tabs on me then youll know we just hit the biggest mineral find ive ever heard of my mining crew are working it as we speak and i should be with them im on the brink of achieving everything i wanted and you drop this in my lap well thank you very much for that juliana your timing is exquisite a fire flashed to life in her eyes you dont think i had dreams too arcturus remember i had just started with that law firm as a paralegal i was doing well therem and i had a promising career there until i fell pregnant not a very progressive firm if they fired you for something like that said arcturus you should have sued they didnt fire me thank you very much snapped juliana they wanted me to come back after valerian was born but i wanted to devote myself to our child very commendable said arcturus pouring a third drink he could already feel the spikes of his anger being worn smooth by its patency valerian is very like you arcturus hes brilliant charming and utterly determined in everything he does youll like him i know you will arcturus brushed that thought aside still reeling from the idea of having a young son and the fact that he didnt know him at all seven years of the boys life had passed and until now neither he nor valerian had ever laid eyes on the other does my father know my mother dorothy juliana shook her head no i wanted to tell you first it wasnt my place to tell your family about valerian true said arcturus lapsing into silence for a moment as a thought occurred to him what is it asked juliana seeing a dawning realization in his face it was on tyrador ix wasnt it he said can you remember any other time you slept with me of course not dont be so melodramatic i was thinking aloud said arcturus give me a damn moment to get my thoughts straight you cant spring something like this on me and expect me to be rational just yet he reached for another drink then thought the better of it he replaced the glass and began to pace the length of the room running a hand through his hair as he did so rational said juliana what is there to be rational about you have a son and you have a chance to get to know him to get to know me again we can be a family now a family said arcturus halting before her i is that what you want of me to leave everything behind and come and live on umoja with you and the boy his name is valerian i know what his name is juliana then why are you afraid to say it she countered are you afraid that if you say his name youll have to acknowledge him that hell become real to you no of course not dont be absurd then why wont you say his name valerian said arcturus valerian valerian valerian there are you happy now juliana slapped him across the cheek and he had to restrain the urge to slap her back he remembered a similarly stinging blow delivered by his mother in hindsight hed realized hed deserved that one and he was forced to admit he probably deserved this one too im sorry juliana he said at last but i cant leave everything im building to come and play happy family with you i just cant then what youre just going to leave like you always do run away instead of face up to things i dont run from things warned arcturus of course you do said juliana you joined the marine corps to run away from your father and you ran away from me just when we were getting close and now youre going to run away from your son your heir julianas words hit home like hammer blows as he saw the truth of them rather than facing up to the events that stood at the crossroads of his life he had turned from them and chosen the path of least resistance would this be another such moment arcturus stood on the brink of everything he had ever wanted but what good was any of it if it was built on foundations of shifting sand perhaps now was the time to take stock of his life and look to his legacy after all his father had been only a couple of years older than arcturus was now when he had been handed his son very well juliana he said at last ill stay i will talk to theto valerian ill get to know him and he will be my heir as you say she threw herself at him and wrapped her arms around him once more im so happy i knew that once you saw valerian youd want to be part of his life again arcturus prized juliana from him though with less force than the last time dont lets get ahead of ourselves now he said i said ill get to know him but i still dont know if im ready to just give up on everything ive built im not asking you to said juliana cupping his chin in her hands and pressing her face close to his cant you see that you dont have to give anything up we can all be together all of us we can have everything we ever dreamed of all those grand plans you told me over the years they re coming to fruition now right now you just have to want to see it arcturus smiled perhaps julianas words had merit or perhaps it was the alcohol flowing around his system but whatever it was arcturus was surprised to find the idea didnt horrify him perhaps they could be a normal family after all arcturus awoke with a thick head and a brief dislocation as he wandered where he was he was refreshed and his limbs felt gloriously rested the prefabricated crew quarters of a mining claim or the cramped confines of a starship werent exactly conducive to uninterrupted sleep and hed forgotten just how nice it was to spend a night in a soft bed he stretched and rolled his neck on the pillow enjoying the warmth and letting the aches of the last six months ease from his bones he smiled and then the blissful forgetfulness of waking was replaced with the cold hard remembrances of the previous nights events as everything came rushing back juliana valerian his son the gentle ease of morning fled from his body and he pushed himself upright looking around the woodpaneled room with its tasteful furniture heavy curtains and discreetly situated technology the functionality of the room was pure umoja and the sliver of dusty orange sky he could see through the window only confirmed it arcturus swung his legs from the bed his earlier desire to wallow in the thickness and warmth of the covers having evaporated once he remembered the purpose of ailin pasteurs summons at least now he understood the source of the mans lessthanfriendly welcome quickly and without fuss arcturus cleaned himself in the sonic shower a fine elegantly designed machine the brand wasnt one owned by the old families such independence was typical of most homes on umoja suspected arcturus it was little to his surprise efficient and thorough vibrating the particles of sweat and dead skin from him without peeling off another few layers of skin for good measure he shaved with a similarly efficient sonic razor and combed his hair then dressed in a dark gray suit with kneeheight boots the suit had been cleaned and pressed the boots polished to a mirror sheen ailin pasteurs servants were thorough that was for sure time to face the music he said and left the room making his way along a marblefaced corridor that opened out into the entrance hall hed arrived in last night the door to the sitting room was open and arcturus could hear voices coming from within he recognized one as belonging to ailin pasteur and entered the room sure enough the umojan ambassador was sitting in the same chair his daughter had occupied the night before he was talking to one of his functionaries who look notes on a personal console with a wand stylus pasteur his face an unreadable mask looked up as arcturus entered good morning ailin said arcturus indeed replied pasteur you slept well you have no idea said arcturus after nearly a year of sleeping on top of rocks or camp beds i could have slept anywhere but yes i was most comfortable thank you hungry ravenous said arcturus pasteur nodded to his servant and the man bowed before withdrawing from the room and shutting the door behind him wheres juliana asked arcturus outside with valerian digging up the bottom of the garden no doubt you dont have groundskeepers ailin smiled though there was no warmth to it i do but thats not what i meant valerians quite the budding archaeologist he loves digging in the earth almost as much as another young man i remember maybe he takes after me said arcturus i rather think he does you sound disappointed no just sad for you that youve missed so much of valerians life the years when juliana was growing up were some of the happiest ive ever had but youll never know that simple joy hardly my fault ailin pointed out arcturus i didnt know he even existed would it have made any difference if you had honestly i dont know i am not blind to my own faults such as they are but i said i would stay for a time and get to know the boy and ill make sure he has the best of everything we can provide for him said pasteur i am a wealthy man arcturus i know that but valerian is my son and i will provide for him ill not be beholden to any man ailin and ill not be accepting charity even if this claim ive found is worth only a fraction of what i think its worth ill never need to worry about money again therefore neither will valerian very well said ailin thats good to hear arcturus heard the simmering resentment in pasteurs voice and said you cant hold me responsible for not being here juliana never told me of valerian i know that but whether she never told you or not the simple fact remains that you werent you didnt see her raise valerian on her own you dldnt hear her cry in the night and you missed everything a father is supposed to be part of its hard for me to look at you and not pity you for all youve missed dont pity me ailin said arcturus ill not have your pity very well not pity but regret juliana should have had you next to her through all this but she didnt and it wasnt because she never told you about valerian it was because you shut her out to pursue your own dreams well never know but i suspect if juliana had told you before now you would have turned your back on her and the baby am i wrong probably not admitted arcturus but im here now arent i yes and thats the only reason im maintaining a degree of civility to you i know you arcturus mengsk you are a selfish man who i believe cares nothing for anyone else i think you could be a very dangerous man but you are the father of my grandson and im willing to give you another chance not to disappoint me youre too kind im serious snapped pasteur and arcturus was struck by the vehemence in the mans voice you have responsibilities now and if you fall to live up to them ill make sure you never see valerian again that sounds like a threat it is well at least we understand each other further discussion was halted as pasleurs servant reentered the room bearing a silver platter laden with a steaming pot of sweet tea and a plate of pastries cheese and cold meat the man held the platter next to arcturuss chair and slender metallic legs descended from the platters base pasteur thanked the man as he left the room these are dangerous times arcturus said pasteur once the servant was gone battle lines are changingold wars are drawing to a close and new ones are beckoning are you talking about the guild wars the guild wars are over said pasteur the confederacy knows it and the kelmorians know it they just havent accepted it yet the confederacys too powerful and if the last shots havent been fired yet rest assured they will be soon and then the confederacy will be looking for its next target and what do you think that will be umoja perhaps said pasteur but there are steps being taken to protect umoja what steps steps id prefer not to talk about just yet said pasteur arcturus wandered what pasteur meant but didnt press the point if the man wanted to tell his secrets hed tell them in his own lime have you spoken to your family recently asked pasteur wondering at the abrupt change of topic arcturus said not for a while no but thats one of the reasons i came i saw the broadcast on the unn about the declaration of martial law yes things have become very dangerous on korhal arcturus poured some tea and helped himself to a cinnamontopped pastry so tell me whats been happening he said ive watched the unn reports of bombings terrorist atrocities and attacks on confederate militia bul i imagine theyre either wildly exaggerated or halftruths and every communication ive had from mother is so cryptic as to be unintelligible shes being careful said pasteur pouring himself a cup of tea confederate intelligence agents are monitoring everything that comes off korhal especially transmissions from someone in your family the skyspire and the summer villa are almost certainly under allround surveillance i know you and my father were behind most of the attacks against the confederacy on korhal but are you really that dangerous to them more than you realize said pasteur korhal is one of the most important worlds in the confederacy a model of what the earliest colonists hoped to build in this sector for decades the old families trumpeted korhal as the jewel in their crown an exemplar world that proudly displayed all they could achieve they thought korhals example would be what would persuade moria and umoja to join the confederacy but they were wrong all it did was show us the yoke of tyranny ever more strongly and now that korhals in rebellion theyre terrified that if their most treasured colony could turn against them others might be tempted to do the same do you think my family is in danger i know they are in danger said pasteur theyve been in danger ever since your fathers close of session speech at the palatine forum but then youd have known that it you had stayed long enough to hear it please lets not go down this road again said arcturus its old news and frankly im bored with your throwing it in my face tell me about my family pasteur sat back in his chair visibly composing himself menially youre right im sorry arcturus but i can still remember your mothers tears that day its not an easy thing to forgive shes forgiven me shes your mother said pasteur thats what mothers do arcturus studied pasteurs face as he spoke seeing the deep lines around his eyes and the gleam on his pate where his hair was little more substantial than thin wisps of gray smoke the years of clandestine support for his fathers rebel faction on korhal had not been without its price achton felds a good man but he doesnt have the resources of the confederacy hes worked wonders in protecting your family and hes been lucky as well as skilled but your fathers enemies only need to be lucky once and its all over arcturus was shocked he had no idea things were so volatile on korhal the reports concerning his father had largely belittled his importance or depicted him as some kind of raving madman which he now realized should have told him immediately how seriously the confederacy viewed angus do you think the confederacy will try and kill him its possible said pasteur angus is such a valuable figurehead that they might attempt something that direct but i think maybe his very visibility is what will protect him if theres anyone with a grain of sense in the tarsonis council theyll know that it may do more harm than good to target angus arcturus snorted in derision yes and having sense is a quality the councils known for after all hence why i believe things to be so dangerous your father and achton feld have amassed a popular army that numbers in the millionstough disciplined and loyal men and the momentum and support your fathers built up among the civilian populace and neighboring worlds means its only a matter of time until the confederacys forced off korhal for good it sounds like they dont need any help then dont be so naïve said pasteur this is just when the tarsonis council is at its most dangerous when it thinks it might lose korhal and have no other option but force are you talking about an invasion said arcturus incredulous at the prospect of confederate marines storming the planet of his birth pasteur shrugged perhaps but i dont think so felds army is well trained and has the very best weapons we could supply rifles explosives tanks antiair missiles the works any invasion would cost the confederacy dearly and i dont think thats a risk theyre willing to take and if youre wrong then there will be bloodshed like nothing weve ever seen said pasteur chapter arcturus found them at the bottom of the garden by the side of a river valerian was industriously working within a small cove he had clearly dug by hand with a very small shovel while juliana sat nearby on the grass walking out to meet them arcturus took a deep breath of the faintly spicy umojan air enjoying the aroma of an atmosphere unpolluted by the venting of the kitty jays engines or the reek of oil scorched metal or turned earth and rock ailin pasteurs home on umoja was large and well proportioned fashioned from white steel and wide panes of bronzed glass with a pleasing symmetry and elegant design that complemented the natural landscape with the grass and trees constantly reflected in the glazing arcturus knew that such a dwelling would be both rare and expensive on a planet such as umoja where the climate was often harsh and land at a premium the gardens before the house were kept green and lush by integrated water atomizer and an army of robot groundskeepers tended to the numerous hedges and covered arbors that dotted the gently curved slope the path arcturus followed led down to a slow meandering river at the far end of the garden and tucked discreetly out of sight behind a sweep of hedges was the landing platform on which arcturuss ship had set down the previous evening they hadnt seen him yet valerian too intent on his labors in the dirt and juliana too involved in watching hertheir he corrected himselfson at work valerian stooped to retrieve something from the mud and proudly held it up for his mothers inspection she nodded and took it from him placing it on a tray beside a pile of books as valerian finally spotted arcturus dad he cried dropping his spade and clambering from the cove juliana turned at the sound of her sons shout and smiled as she saw arcturus valerian charged over the grass toward him and arcturus realized he was more terrified of this moment than he had been when the goliath had had him dead to rights on onuru sigma valerian launched himself like a missile and arcturus caught him in his arms as the boy wrapped himself around his neck laughing like a lunatic arcturus was surprised at how light he was the boy weighed next to nothing dad youre here i wanted to talk to you last night but grandfather said i was too tired but i wasnt i really wasnt i promise arcturus didnt know what to say hed never had any problem speaking to dorothy when she was younger but she was his little sister and he had known her and loved her since her birth valerian was seven years old and this was their first meeting what do you say to your son when hes seven years old and youve never met him thats quite all right valerian said arcturus eventually i think your grandfather was right anyway i think i was too tired as well arcturus put valerian down and was summarily led by the hand toward the excavated cove where the boy had been working i want to show you my dig said valerian do you want to see it im looking for aliens at the bottom of the garden well not aliens exactly but fossils of them you know what fossils are i do indeed said arcturus i do some digging myself you know i know my mum told me said valerian she said youre the best miner in the galaxy did she now said arcturus as they passed juliana yeah she said you were a big soldier and then you became a prospector and that youre going to be rich and that youre the best miner ever and valerian interrupted juliana slow down show your father what youve found so far sure yeah said valerian dropping to his knees beside the tray of his finds arcturus knelt on the grass beside the tray as juliana brushed a strand of honey blonde hair from her face beneath the sunlight arcturus noticed how pale her skin was pallid and without the light golden sheen of valerians she caught his glance and turned away as though embarrassed i think ill leave you two boys alone for a while said juliana pushing herself to her feet and ruffling valerians hair will you be all right yeah said valerian without looking up from his finds arcturus nodded to juliana and saw the desperate hope in her eyes well be fine he said im sure we can stay out of trouble for a little while cant we valerian you bet agreed the boy juliana made her way back toward the house and arcturus watched her go now that he was over the initial shock of discovering that he had a son he was reminded of his former desire for juliana ailin pasteurs daughter had always carried herself with an elan that was wholly natural and effortless but as arcturus watched he saw that elegance had all but vanished no not vanished but changed had motherhood changed her or was he simply seeing her through different lenses that time and distance had crafted without his noticing more the latter he suspected for by any objective reasoning juliana was still beautiful in some ways more so last night he had wondered if they might yet be a family but if he was honest the burning desire he had once had for her was now cold and dead the tactless light of day cast its unflattering illumination over the idea and arcturus knew that any such notion was wishful thinking at best dangerous delusion at worst arcturus desired an heir that was certainly true but a family life he turned back to valerian as the boy said something im sorry i think this is alien said valerian holding up a piece of shell that even arcturus could see was a cracked shard from the shell of one of the domesticated umojan insect creatures yes i think it is probably a giant winged monster from another galaxy you really think so oh undoubtedly said arcturus lifting a piece of fossilized bark and this looks like its a scale from some kind of alien lizard dont you think valerian nodded sagely yeah thats what i thought a big maneating lizard that could swallow a whole squad of soldiers in a single bite did you see anything like that when you were a soldier arcturus shook his head no i didnt but im quite glad about that i dont think id have wanted to be swallowed whole well no i suppose not said valerian that would be stupid arcturus took a closer look at his son as the boy rummaged through his finds and held each one up for his inspection though he bore the genetic hallmarks of a mengsk valerian did not have the physicality of arcturus or angus the lad was thin much thinner than even dorothy had been at his age and his arms were skinny and without definition by valerians age arcturus was a fine athlete and had become proficient with the dueling sword not that in this modern age of gauss rifles and missiles arcturus had much use for an archaic weapon like a sword but the harsh lessons had taught him balance honed his muscles and provided him with a proper appreciation for the martial arts given julianas disposition it was unlikely she had encouraged such pursuits and the sheen of sweat on valerians brow was testament to his lack of stamina are these your books asked arcturus as valerian finished showing him the junk hed pulled from the riverbank yeah they were mums but she gave them to me to keep may i asked arcturus reaching for the books sure arcturus lifted the top volume a thin picture book on archaeology complete with diagrams of animal skeletons and geological strata he remembered reading this book as a child and seemed to remember giving it to dorothy as he examined the next book valerian said thats my favorite mum gave me that for my last birthday the book was leatherbound its cover edged with gold thread and its title printed in elaborate cursive script poems of the twilight stars read arcturus opening the book and turning its pages the interior was filled with color plates depleting fantastical beasts and verses of escapist nonsense that talked of ancient beings that walked between the stars in ages past he read one of the poems a ridiculously trite piece composed of numerous rhyming couplets that used childishly overblown similes a quick flick through the book revealed that every single poem was similarly hokey and worthy of nothing but utter contempt this was what valerian was reading a quick examination of the spines of the other books revealed one to be a guide to understanding your inner soul while the other was a history book of umoja at least that was something worth reading this is yours asked arcturus holding up the book of poems yeah ive read them all but that ones my favorite mum reads it to me before i go to sleep at night and this is the sort of thing you like no military books or adventure stories im not allowed books like that mum says that the galaxys a horrible enough place as it is said valerian she says i dont need to read that kind of thing she says itll just upset me does she now yeah she likes that one too but youre a young boy you should be reading action and adventure stories space battles and heroes my father gave me logan mitchellfrontier marshal when i was about your age its a classic have you read it valerian shook his head no whats it about its about a man called logan mitchell who keeps law and order on one of the fringe worlds lois of guns lots of girls and plenty of shootouts with corrupt officials logans a hardtalking hardfighting man who always gets the bad guy pretty simple stuff really but its good fun and full of blood and guts why would i want to read about blood and guts and shootouts that sounds horrible i thought most boys liked reading things like that well i dont said valerian i dont like guns have you ever fired one no would you like to arcturus saw the gleam in the boys eyes and smiled like most people who professed to dislike guns arcturus figured valerian had never actually fired one and had probably not even ever held a firearm there was something about firing a weapon that appealed to the primal urge in everyone male or female and even avowed pacifists couldnt deny the thrill of unloading a powerful weaponeven if only into a paper target come on then said arcturus ive a gauss rifle and a slugthrower on the kitty jay its time you learned something about being a man valerian lay back on his bed struggling to hold back tears of frustration and disappointment as he rubbed analgesic ointment into his shoulder where the butt of his dads gauss rifle had bruised him black and blue if valerian hadnt already hated guns he would have learned to despise them thoroughly during the time his father had spent with him the last seven days had to rank as the greatest and worst week of valerians life the greatest because his dad was here and he was just as he had pictured him tall strong and handsome everything his dad said sounded clever and important even if a lot of it was beyond valerians understanding the worst because nothing valerian did seemed good enough for him valerian had greeted every day as a chance to win his dads approval and every day he hoped he was going to grow up just like him he found himself trying to adopt his dads mannerisms his walk his posture and even his speech it was just a pity that his father paid little or no attention to valerians many acts of devotionm seeming only to notice the things he couldnt do the lessons with the gauss rifle and slugthrower had been a disaster the savage recoil of the rifle knocking valerian onto his back and the bucking pistol spraining his wrist the guns were loud and even when he managed to hold them straight he couldnt hit any of the targets his dad set up at the edge of the river every failure seemed to irritate his dad but no matter how he concentrated squinting down the barrel and pressing his tongue against his upper lip he could not get the hang or love of firing a weapon not only that but his favorite books had been consigned to the trash and replaced with freshly uploaded digitomes of economics history technology and politicsthings he wasnt interested in and which didnt have any aliens in them they were confusing and used big words he didnt understand none of them had any stories in them apart from the history ones but even they were really boring and didnt have any pictures of the bits that sounded like they might have been exciting the one thing valerian did enjoy was the sparring with wooden swords which he and his dad engaged in on the lawn before the house the weight of the sword was unfamiliar but his dexterous hands could move it quickly and nimbly around his body though he was bruised and sore at the end of each of these sessions his dad would look at him without more usual expression of disappointment and nod youre fast said his dad taking his arm and squeezing it hard but you lack power you need to build up your strength and stamina if youre going to be a swordsman but why do i need to be a swordsman valerian had protested surely no one fights with swards anymore now that we have guns and if you find yourself without a gun or you run out of ammunition what will you do then anyway learning how to use a sword isnt just about fighting with one it also teaches you balance speed coordination discipline all things you sadly lack im afraid that had stung for it was harsh and unnecessary his grandpa had argued with his dad after valerian told him what had been said valerian had heard them shouting at each other from behind the closed door of his bedroom grandpa had left the house yesterday and though valerian didnt know what was going on he had seen that his grandpa looked really worried his mum told him that the ruling council of umoja had been called to an emergency sitting whatever that was and that something very important was going on she didnt say what that might be but valerian could read his mums moods as easily as if she had spelled them out and he could tell she was worried as well as what was worrying her about grandpa he knew she wasnt too pleased with his dad either but she had kept her opinions to herself as far as valerian knew at leasl he hadnt seen them argue with ailin pasteur gone from the house arcturus helped himself to another measure of the mans brandy and sank into one of the leather seats before the fireplace he sipped his drink its taste pleasant enough and remembered his first sip of brandy the night the confederate assassins had come to kill them at the summer villa thinking back to that night arcturus remembered sitting in the dining room and talking to his father and felt a sudden and wholly unexpected pang of nostalgia for those longago days back then everything was simpler he mused then realized this kind of thinking was just the rosy mist of memory softening problems that at the time had been huge and calamitous time he knew had a way of distorting the truth of experience embellishing past pleasures and diminishing hardships though he was still a young man arcturus felt old now part of that was no doubt the fact that he had a son a factor surely designed to make any man feel as though he had advanced in ageif not maturityby an order of magnitude arcturus wondered if his own father had felt like this when presented with his newborn son he didnt think so since angus would have had nine months and more to get used to the idea fatherhood had been sprung on arcturus like a bolt of lightning from an open sky the idea had taken root though and instead of railing against the idea of a son arcturus had begun to feel that perhaps it was for the best he now had an heir and had skipped the messy years of nappy changing and midnight feeds he had sent a message to korhaltagged specifically for his mother and dorothy telling his parents of this latest development though it had taken him several days to work out exactly how to tell them of valerians existence without casting himself in an unfavorable light that hadnt been easy arcturus had fought kelmorian pirates been shot at by angry miners and faced furious superior officers but composing himself to record a message to send home and inform his family he was now a father had been the most nervewracking experience of his life arcturus remembered when hed been about eight or nine and had broken one of his mothers ornamental dancers with a poorly thrown padball hed sweated for days to pluck up the courage to tell her hed broken it the sensation engulfing him as his finger hovered over the record icon on the vidsys was uncomfortably familiar to the cold dread hed felt as he stood before his mothers drawing room bathed in a guilty sweat he smiled realizing it didnt matter how old you wereyour parents would always be figures of authority and it never got any easier telling them something difficult just as would always be their child no matter that you grew up fought battles made a life for yourself and perhaps even started a family of your own the evolutionary dynamic between parents and their children was inescapable in any case hed sent word of valerian to korhal and three days had passed without a response which surprised him he had expected his mother to respond more or less instantly to the news that she was a grandmother and dorothy she was now an auntie if anyone should have reacted with glee he would have expected it to be her arcturus knew dorothy would love valerian but what kind of relationship could he expect to have with the boy would they bond or would they remain distant as arcturus and his own father had the last week had given him an inkling as to how their relationship would go and it was not a pleasant realization to discover it would likely be one of disappointment the boy was weak and displayed no aptitude for the skills and enthusiasms a man needed to prosper arcturus would journey to korhal soon to formally present valerian to his family and the boy would need toughening up if he was to became a worthy successor in the meantime hed received word from diamond de santo regarding the claim and the news was all good the initial core samples brought up by the rigs was about as pure as it ever got and the yield from the rocks was like nothing any of the workers had ever seen arcturus smiled as he recalled the excitement in de santos voice as she spoke of the value of the claim shed also mentioned a rumor going around the interguild networks that the guild wars were in fact over that the kelmorians had lost arcturus hadnt heard anything of that news since ailin pasleur had no cineviewers in his home claiming they showed nothing but confederate propaganda and mindless brainrotting melodramas anyway arcturus could sympathize with that view so hed connected remotely to a unn satellite feed via the kitty jays console and sure enough the channel curried the triumphant news of the defeat of the kelmorians images of marching marines and hundreds of gleaming siege tanks rolled across the screen and the gushing announcer spoke of the craven capitulation of all enemy forces as though the confederate military machine had just defeated the most bloody regime imaginable instead of a loose alliance of pirates and miners was this why ailin pasteur had been called away bored and slightly disgusted by the relish the unn was taking in its paymasters victory arcturus had disconnected with the feed and returned to pasteurs home to pour himself the brandy that warmed him as surely as the crackling fire in the hearth arcturus was enjoying this rare moment of solitude when he heard juliana enter the room behind him he recognized the hesitancy of her step and knew it signaled another argument about the bay what is it juliana he said without turning your son is in tears again she said why doesnt that surprise me why are you being like this said juliana coming around the chair to stand before him like what why are you being so hard on valerian she asked ignoring his question her face was hard and pinched with anger cant you see he adores you even though you belittle him every time you see him hes just met his dad and all you can do is tell him how bad he is at everything arcturus put down his brandy angry with her now that is because he is bad at everything he cant even hold a gun let alone fire one the books youve been foisting on him are turning him into a flowerwearing believer in universal harmony and hes as skinny as a rake theres no meat on his bones and he gets tired after even light calisthenics if im hard on him its because im trying to undo the damage your mollycoddling has done we love him here arcturus said juliana we dont force him to do what we think he should do i thought you of all people would respect that our son is free to choose what he wants to learn and what he wants to be passionate about arcturus shook his head thats just the kind of woollyheaded nonsense thatll leave him unprepared for life beyond this cozy little bubble youve built around him youre raising a bookish effeminate weakling juliana the galaxy is a hard ugly place and if you carry on raising him like this hell not survive when he has to face it alone do you understand me i understand all right snapped juliana you want to make a carbon copy of yourself and would that be so bad retorted arcturus surging to his feet at least ive made something of myself ive gone out into the galaxy gained real experience and forged my destiny with my own two hands whats the boy ever going to manage on his own hes a mengsk and hes made for great things but hell never amount to anything like this whatever he wants to do with his life is up to him said juliana we cant choose the path of his life for him utter rubbish said arcturus children need discipline and you have conspicuously failed to give him that hes too young to know the right path when he sees it so it behooves us to make sure we put him on it juliana balled her fists and arcturus saw the strength he thought shed lost resurface in her i wish you could hear yourself arcturus i really wish your younger self could hear what youre saying now what are you talking about everything you rebelled against when you were younger thats what youve become youve become your father dont be foolish juliana i am nothing like my father she laughed bitterly for someone so clever arcturus you can be so blind i listened to all the things youd tell me over the years the grand plans for the future and your ambitions for greatness and i believed them i think on some level i still believe you will do great things but you wont be doing it alone anymore you have a son and he needs his father and im doing what a father needs to juliana im giving him the benefit of my experience to turn him into a man hes only sevenlet him be a child pleaded juliana does he need to grow up just yet arcturus was about to deliver a withering reply when the door opened and one of ailin pasteurs servants entered immediately arcturus could sense the mans urgency what is it asked juliana turning and snapping at the man a communication for mr mengsk said the servant a message said arcturus and you had to interrupt us for that ill open it later no sir said the man its not a message its a realtime communication from korhal arcturus frowned to communicate in real time between worlds was incredibly expensive and could only be done by those with access to the most powerful and advanced equipment from korhal is it my mother he asked no sir its a mr feld said the man and im afraid he says he has some bad news arcturus cradled the brandy bottle in his lap knowing that draining the last of its contents was the wrong thing to do but not caring for right and wrong anymore his tears had long since dried but the grief still tore his heart with cold steel claws the words feld had spoken echoed within his skull they re dead all of them they were etched into his memory with a permanency that could never be erased it was impossible surely no one could have penetrated the security around them no one could have defeated the manifold security systems that protected them from harm it was impossible they killed them oh god arcturus im so sorry hed known something was wrong the minute hed seen achton felds face his image on the vidsys had been grainy and staticwashed the signal degraded after so immense a distance piggybacking along myriad relays boosters and carrier waves a communication like this was the equivalent of your fone ringing in the middle of the night and jerking you from sleep with a deep gnawing fear in your belly no one foned with good news in the dark no one went to the expense and trouble of a realtime communication with good news what is it feld arcturus had said sitting in from of the vidsys unit hed used to send the news of valerians birth to korhal im sorry arcturus im so sorry said feld tears running down his cheeks sorry for what listen feld spit it out whats wrong said arcturus a lead weight of cold fear settling in his stomach theyre deadall of them wept achton feld who said arcturus when feld didnt continue all of them sobbed feld struggling to form the words angus your mother even even dorothy arcturus felt as though a great black void had opened up inside him his hands began to shake and he felt cold his mouth was dry and his mind stopped functioning unable to process the reality of what feld had just said no he said at last no youre wrong this cant be right youve made a mistake you must have made a mistake feld they cant be dead no i wont allow it im so sorry arcturus i dont know how it happened everything was normalall the security systems were functional theyre still functional i just dont know arcturus felt his limbs go numb as though they were no longer his to control a rushing sound like the sea crashing against the cliffs below the summer villa roared in his head felds mouth moved on the screen but arcturus no longer heard the words his hands pressed against his temples and tears of grief anger and sucking awesome loss flowed with them as if hed taken an emotional emetic his humanity flowed from him in his tears and every petty feeling hed ever harbored toward his family every feeling of compassion and every shred of restraint was washed away in a tide of hot tears the sheer unimaginable scale of what had happened settled upon him it was too much no one could suffer such a crippling loss and remain whole the power of his grief tore through him like a hurricane breaking chains of restraint honor and mercy scouring away all thoughts except one shining beacon that offered a ray of hope a slender branch of survival to which he could cling revenge the people that had caused him this hurt were going to die all of them arcturus knew that killings like this could only be the work of the confederacy only they had agents with the skill and gall to perpetrate something so heinous only they had the temerity to think they could get away with it well arcturus mengsk was going to disabuse the confederacy of that notion what was it his father had said when all you have is a hammer everything starts to look like a nail the diamond clarity of the thought swept away the drag of his grief and he took a great draft of air feeling himself fill with righteous purpose as he did so his tears ceased and his back straightened tell me what happened said arcturus his voice icy and controlled itheyre dead isnt that enough said feld you need to come back to korhal oh ill be coming back soon enough promised arcturus but tell me what happened feld saw the urgent need in his eyes and nodded wiping a hand across his face arcturus was impressed say what you liked about achton feld he was a professional i came up in the morning with the daily security brief jusl like i always do said feld shoring up his own walls against the grief with commendable discipline i passed through the biometric identifiers swiped my card and went through into the penthouse angus is usually waiting for me but he wasnt there this morning which immediately made me suspicious katherine i mean your mother normally has a pot of java on but i didnt smell it thats normally the first thing i notice you know the smell of fresh java but not this morning i knew something was wrong so i made a sweep of the apartment what did you find feld took a deep breath i couldnt see anyone there was no sign of forced entryi mean nothing but the door to the balcony was open and said arcturus when feld didnt go on he could see it was taking all of felds selfcontrol to keep speaking and arcturus prepared himself for the worst his jaw tightened hed already had the worst what else could there be feld nodded i went out on the balcony and thats where i found them the damn force field had shorted out and they were just lying there like they were asleep your mother dorothy and your father dead how did they die does it matter snapped feld why the hell do you need to know something like that i need to know said arcturus i dont know why i just do they were shot said feld katherine and dorothy were shot one in the heart and one in the head and my father was he shot too again feld paused his face averted as though unwilling to meet arcturuss gaze no he wasnt shot he was decapitated what cried arcturus decapitated what are you talking about you heard me shouted feld they cut his damn head off arcturus and we cant find it the sick bastards took it with them hed terminated the communication soon after telling feld to wait to hear from him that hed be in touch to sort out what their next move would be hed marched from the room and returned to the drawing room where hed lately been arguing with juliana and swept up the boattle of brandy an hour passed maybe more but arcturus didnt feel the passage of time his brain whirling in a million different directions as he tried to process the gaping emptiness in his soul he took mouthfuls of the brandy the liquor as potent as ever but seeming to leave him unaffected his entire body was numb to its powers and he drained half the bottle before hurling it into the fire with a splintering crash of glass waste of good brandy he hissed as the alcohol burned off in bright flames he heard the door open behind him arcturus said a mans voice im so sorry i came as soon as i heard he turned to see ailin pasleur and juliana standing at the entrance to the room as though afraid to intrude on his grief but happy to watch from the sidelines his heart twisted with contempt julianas face was streaked with tears and she held valerian close to her the boys eyes were wide and fearful not quite comprehending what was going on valerian untangled himself from his mother and came over to stand next to arcturus is your mum and dad dead he asked arcturus nodded yes valerian they are and my sister too how did they die asked valerian hush valerian said juliana dont ask such things the confederacy killed them said arcturus his voice low and threatening they killed them because my dad spoke out against them they killed them because they are animals valerian reached out and hesitantly put his hand on arcturuss shoulder im sorry theyre dead whispered valerian arcturus looked into his sons eyes and saw the honest sincerity of a child his expression uncluttered by adult notions of propriety or reserve thank you valerian he said ailin pasteur approached and guided valerian back to his mother he took the seat opposite arcturus and said whatever you plan to do next i can promise you that youll have the support of umoja like my father did said arcturus bitterly more than that said pasteur arcturus ive just come from an emergency sitting of the ruling council and in the wake of the kelmorians defeat councilor jorgensen has announced the formation of the umojan protectorate it will be an organization to keep our colony free from confederate tyranny to resist their expansionist policies and offer a safe haven to those who stand for freedom very noble of you said arcturus if a little belated you might be right admitted pasteur but its a start a start said arcturus staring into the crackling fire yes a start a sudden terrible thought lanced into arcturuss brain with the force of an impaler spike and he looked over at valerian and juliana fear clenched in his guts and took the breath from him whal is it said pasteur seeing the urgency in his eyes julianayou and valerian have to leave said arcturus rising to his feet right now what i dont understand what are you talking about they know said arcturus pacing the room his thoughts crashing together like a convoy of groundcars rearending one another or if they dont yet they will soon slow down arcturus said pasteur who knows what the confederacy snapped arcturus the message i sent to my family about valerian if theyre good enough to defeat felds security systems without breaking a sweat then its a mathematical certainly they know where i am and that i have a son were loose ends and the confederacy doesnt like loose ends when it comes to murder you think theyd come here to umoja said juliana holding valerian even tighter arcturus laughed the sound hollow and coming from the bleakest emptiest part of his soul dont think for a moment they wont they will do whatever it takes to destroy their enemies you have to get out of here and stay on the move or theyll find you and that cant be allowed to happen dont be ridiculous said pasteur we are well protected here ridiculous said arcturus if my familys killers can penetrate the skyspires security they will simply walk in here and kill you all in a heartbeat no the only way to evade people like that is to not be here when they come for you hes right daddy we need to go said juliana her voice brittle with fear though arcturus knew that fear was for valerian and not herself i wont let anything happen to val pasteur hesitated and then nodded reluctantly ill have a ship here within the hour stay on the move warned arcturus dont stay in any one place too long youre not coming with us said juliana no said arcturus they dont know it yet but the confederacy has just created the greatest enemy they will ever know whay are you going to do asked pasteur im going to burn the confederacy to the ground hissed arcturus chapter the sword came at him in an arcing line of silver and valerian twisted his wrists to bring his own weapon up to block the blades connected with a shriek of steel and he spun from the reverse stroke as master miyamotos sword darted forward valerians sword came down deflecting the stroke as he backed away from the relentless attack sweat ran down his face in runnels and his breathing came in short sharp gasps in contrast master miyamoto looked as serene and unflappable as he always did no matter whether he was pouring tea or executing flawless sword movements dressed in a simple creamcolored keikogi and hakama master miyamoto was as unreadable as ever no trace of expression betraying his intended movements in this dangerous ballet called a sword bout valerian wore identical training clothes though tailored for his smaller nineyearold frame which had finally begun to fill out as he grew older and took more exercise he was still slender and asceticlooking but the last two years had seen his shoulders and arms begin to strengthen and offer promising hints of the man he might become they were alone in the garden master miyamoto allowed no one to observe their training not even valerians mother roughly built walls of high stone enclosed the garden a rectangular courtyard of gently swaying plants freshly tended herb patchesand a slatepaved sparring area next to the eastern wall a fountain gurgled peacefully in the center of the garden and the cold air was thin scented with the earthy smell of ripe crops this region of icarus iv always smelled due to the loamy richness of the soil that made it such a fertile world for agriculture and the faint yet unmistakable hint of chemical fertilizer birds perched on the high walls the only spectators able to observe valerians grueling training rituals and their twittering conversations were like a chorus of amused theatergoers enjoying a boys humiliation at the hands of a fencing master what is the meaning of victory said miyamoto slowly lifting his sword up and back to defeat your enemy said valerian circling as master miyamoto slid sideways no said miyamoto launching a lightningfast thrust toward valerian that is not enough valerian averted the attack his speed impressive and slashed his sword at his trainers side his blade struck empty air and he realized hed been lured into the attack as the flat of master miyamotos blade struck him painfully on the bleep then what is it he yelped every time he failed to answer a question correctly valerian received a slinging rebuke from master miyamotos weapon it is to destroy him said master miyamoto to eradicate him from living memory you must leave no remnant of his endeavors utterly crush his every achievement and remove from all record his every trace of existence from such defeat no enemy can ever recover master miyamotos sword looped around his body in a series of perfectly executed maneuvers that had valerian attempted them would have seen him limbless earless and dead that said master miyamoto is the meaning of victory you would know this if you had paid attention to the books on your fathers reading list or the one i gave you i read that one said valerian returning to the guard position and bowing to master miyamoto not closely enough again valerian nodded and once more dropped into the еn garde position his long blade extended before him after three hours of training with master miyamoto valerians arms burned with fatigue and his chest felt as though a fire had been set in his lungs master miyamoto returned valerians bow and the two of them circled one another their swords shining in the afternoon sun the enemy comes at you in a great horde said master miyamoto how do you fight valerian cast his mind back to the text his tutor was referencing it was a treatise recovered from the data vaults of the reagan the supercarrier that had brought the colonists to umoja supposedly written by an ancient warrior king of earth its words were instructions in the arts of war diplomacy and personal discipline the book had no official title but master miyamoto called it the book of virtues and seemed to know its text verbatim valerian had read the book as it was high on the list of approved texts his father had set him but he found it difficult to recall its teachings while trying to avoid a stinging slap from the flat of master miyamotos blade quickly said master miyamoto his sword raised to strike do not think know valerian lifted his blade letting his mind float back over the many evenings hed sat at his desk with the pages swimming before his tired gritty eyes he had read the book a dozen times or more and as he let his thoughts concentrate on the tip of his tutors sword the words came to him without conscious thought its best to try and direct them into a narrow defile or enclosed space valerian said why a slash lo the body so that their numbers work against them a rolling block how will they do that a thrust to the chest crowded together those at the front will impede those behind a parry and riposte valerian shifted left and launched his own attack the push from the rear will prevent those at the front from retreating or finding a better path very good said master miyamoto easily deflecting valerians attacks and what of balance it is the key to success said valerian smiling as yet again the words came easily to him why repeated master miyamoto parrying a clumsy attack and rolling his blade around valerians sword a leader who puts his faith in his guns will be outmaneuvered said valerian deflecting the blow and circling around to his right then he must train all his warriors in closequarters combat offered miyamoto no for then he will lose his force to enemy fire countered valerian very good so what does it mean to have balance it means that every element of an army must work in harmony so that its effectiveness is greater than the sum of its parts master miyamoto nodded and lowered his blade he spun the weapon quickly and sheathed it in the scabbard at his belt we are done for the day he said valerian was relieved for his body was aching but he was also disappointed for he had finally begun to appreciate the lessons of the book of virtues and how to access them while he trained it was just a beginning but it was an important beginning he felt he returned master miyamotos bow and sheathed his sword running his hands through his blond hair he wore it long pulled tightly into a ponytail during sword practice and its golden hue was no less bright than it had been when he was a youngster master miyamoto turned on his heel and made his way along a stoneflagged path toward the fountain at the gardens center he took a seat on the ledge around the fountain and dipped his hand into the cold water valerian followed the swordmaster and sat next to him taking a handful of water and splashing his face you are improving said master miyamoto it is good to see thank you said valerian its hard work but i think im beginning to get it it will take time agreed miyamoto nothing good ever comes without effort i remember telling your father the same thing valerians interest was suddenly piqued for master miyamoto had never spoken of his dad before now save when he had first arrived miyamoto had arrived a few weeks after valerian and his mother had fled umoja informing juliana that arcturus mengsk had retained him to become the boys tutor in all matters martial and academic his mother had been furious at his dads presumption but the matter was not up for discussion master miyamoto had only been persuaded to leave his position at styrling academy to teach the boy for an exorbitant fee and only valerians desire to win his fathers approval had persuaded juliana to let miyamoto stay you taught my dad to use a sword asked valerian i did miyamoto nodded he casts a long shadow valerian but it is my hope that you will be able to escape it and fulfill your potential i bet he was good with a sword said valerian he looks like he could fight he was a fair swordsman conceded miyamoto he was strong and won most of his bouts before even a single blow was struck how there is more to fighting than simply wielding a sword said miyamoto more often than not a man is defeated by his own doubts i dont understand in any contest of arms where life and death rest on the outcome most mens fear will see their opponent as stronger faster and more capable explained miyamoto such doubts only serve to make it so to win you must have utter belief in your abilities no doubt must enter your mind is that what my dad did miyamoto stood as though deciding that he had said too much yes your father had complete faith in his abilities but victory is not the only measure of a man it isnt no there is honor a man may lose everything he has yet still retain his honor nothing is more important always remember that valerian no matter what anyone else tries to teach you even your father honor is more important than dying absolutely said miyamoto some things are worth dying for like what defending noble ideals or fighting for the oppressed the honorable man must always stand firm before tyrants who would dominate the weak the abuse of power must always be fought and men of honor do not stand idly by while such evils are allowed to exist just like my dad said valerian proudly master miyamoto bowed to him no he said sadly not like your father valerian stripped off his training garments and dumped them on the floor of his bedroom he grabbed a towel and made his way into the bathroom turning on the tap and stepping back from the tub as chilly water gurgled and spurted from the showerhead eventually the wale warmed and valerian stepped under ihe hot sprav over the last year he and his mother had spent on icarus iv valerian had gotten used to a liquid shower as opposed to the sonic ones hed grown up with on umoja the hot water soothed his muscles and refreshed him in a way the vibrational removal of dirt molecules and dead skin from his body just couldnt even though it was wasteful to use water this frivolously valerian decided it was entirely worth it he stepped from the shower and began toweling himself dry stopping for a moment to look at himself in the fulllength mirror on the back of the door though he was young his body was developing quickly and his upper body strength was growing every day accompanied by a squad of soldiers he ran every other morning jogging around the patrolled perimeter of the umojan agrarian complexa distance of some six kilometers and was pleased with his increased endurance he flexed and posed in the mirror enjoying the fantasy that he was some dashing interplanetary hero like his dad despite master miyamotos words valerian was proud of what his dad was doing valerian returned to his bedroom a cluttered space filled with books digitomes an unmade bed and sliverskinned trunks full of clothes his collections of fossils rocks and alien artifacts were proudly on show in a number of display cabinets and a number of antique weapons were hung on the wall they had belonged to the previous owner of the mansion in which they now dwelled surely the most salubrious accommodation theyd stayed in since leaving umojaand valerian had liked them so much he had left them there hed asked master miyamoto if he could train with some of the more exoticlooking weaponsa falchion a glaive or a falxbut his tutor had forbidden him to touch any more weapons until he was competent with a sword at least still it did no harm to have them around as many were plainly hundreds of years old and gave him a connection to times long gone in a small way they made it easier to hold on to the concept of alien civilizations existing in forgotten ages of the past the concept of millions of years ago was almost impossible to grasp but a few hundred years was easy and by such small steps he could imagine larger spans of time valerian cleared a space on his bed and dressed himself in loosefitting trousers and a blue shirt of expensive silk he settled back on the bed and lifted the copy of the book of virtues master miyamoto had given him and began to read unlike the majority of valerians other books this was an oldfashioned one of paper pages bound together within a leather cover which bore an inscription on the inside in letters he couldnt read master miyamoto had said his own father had written the words on the morning of his death only after much cajoling had master miyamoto told valerian what the words meant valerians tutor had lifted the book and though he clearly knew the inscription by heart his eyes had nevertheless followed the path of the words on the page his voice choked with emotion as he read his fathers valediction what is life read master miyamoto it is the flash of a firefly in the night it is the little shadow which runs across the grass and loses itself in the sunset valerian had found the words wonderfully uplifting and looked down at the wolf head picked out in gold thread over the breast packet of his shin the symbol was that of the mengsk family and valerian bore it proudly whenever he was in a place of safely on those rare occasions they ventured into public he had been warned not to display anything that might link him to his dad given how his dad was portrayed in the media that was a sensible precaution it had been two years since he had seen his father standing on the underground platform where his ship the kitty jay was berthed it was a moment of confused emotions for valerian he had been sad to see his dad leave but even as a youngster he had sensed the tension between his mum and dad and grandpa he sensed a familiarity to the drama before him his dad leaving and his mother left behind with his grandpa there to deal with the emotional fallout even though he hadnt thought of that moment in such terms hed sensed the reality of them as though theyd been spelled out his father had knelt beside him and fixed him with his gaze i would have liked to spend more time with you valerian said his dad yeah agreed valerian id have liked that there is much to be done if you are lo be a worthy heir but i have work to do and you cannot be part of it yet you are not strong enough or wise enough but you will be you are going to hear a lot of bad things said about me in the coming years but i want you to know that none of it will be true what im doing is for the good of humanity always remember that and valerian had remembered it despite his mothers reservations valerian eagerly watched every report on the unn concerning his dad he saw bombings assassinations and the spread of revolution throughout the sector some of those reports were plainly so ridiculous that even a nineyearold could see through them but others appeared to be unvarnished truth that needed no embellishment images of burned bodies and mangled corpses being carried from wrecked confederate buildings that had been torn apart by explosives burning confederate vehicles targeted by one of the many insurgent groups that were slowly but surely accreting under his fathers banner and leadership factories belonging to the old families were bombed each target carefully chosen to cause maximum disruption to the economic infrastructure of the confederacy of course none of the news broadcasts spoke of this but master miyamoto made valerian always look to answer the most important question of all when looking at his dads handiwork why why was that particular factory destroyed why was that particular official killed each question forced valerian to think beyond the simple bloody facts of the act itself and to search for deeper purpose than simply the causing of harm though it was hard watching so many images of death and suffering valerian fell sure it was for a higher cause these people were part of the confederacy and they had murdered his dads parents and sister in cold blood master miyamoto had urged valerian not to see things in these blackandwhite terms but such deeper considerations stood little chance of recognition in the face of a youngsters loss highminded ideals were all very well until you were put to the test of having to hold on to them in the face of personal tragedy the confederacy had robbed his dad of his parents and his sister and valerian had lost two grandparents and an aunt he had never met never got the chance to know and now never would if that wasnt worth some bloodshed then what was valerian knew that his dad was wanted throughout confederate space a wanted terrorist and murderer but these were labels hung on him by his enemies so valerian didnt pay them much attention he knew who his dad was and knew that when he saw him againwhenever that might behe would not be the disappointment he now realizes he had been when theyd first met he recalled his mother tearfully telling him that his dad had called him bookish effeminate and weak an admission she later regretted but which could not be taken back in that moment valerian had made a personal vow to himself that he would never be thought of that way again and had thrown himself into physical exercise as though his life depended on it there had been some communication with his father but it had all been done through his grandfather and was sporadic at best icarus iv was the fifth place they had lived in two years and looked like it wouldnt be the last valerian tried not to get comfortable in any once place knowing an imperious command could be delivered at any time instructing them to move on valerians grandfather would sequester yet another outlying umojan outpost or colony to hide them and the process would begin again the necessity of this was brutally demonstrated when valerian had once complained about the need to move incessantly and begged his mother to not uproot them again she had agreed not to move on for a little longer but one night valerian had woken to the sound of shouting soldiers gunfire and the flash of explosions not a word not a whimper val my darling said his mother dragging him from his bed and handing him over to an umojan soldier in battered combat armor valerians memories of that night were confused and fragmented but he remembered being carried through the night its darkness spilt with stuttering flashes of fire hed taken a tumble as the man carrying him collapsed but was picked up again realizing at the same time that the first soldier had been killed theyd been hustled onto the dropship that was always prepped nearby and as it lifted off in a screaming rocking ascent valerian clung to his mother and said mommy will daddy ever come for us yes honey shed replied he will one day as the pilot flew them to safety valerian had lain with his head in his mums lap for hours letting her stroke his golden hair and soothe away his worries he heard her crying and pretended to be asleep letting her think she had succeeded valerian never again complained about their need to keep on the move it was hard to be always on the move but as hard as it was for him with no real friends and no sense of stability to his life he knew it was harder still for his mum she tried to hide it and denied it whenever he brought it up but valerian knew she was quite ill exactly what was wrong with her he didnt know but he could see the gray pallor of her skin and the way the weight seemed to melt from her bones no matter how much she atewhich wasnt very much at the best of times al night he heard her racking coughs and cried as he thought of her pain and his inability to do anything about it through all of this valerians most pressing question was why why did his dad not come to see her he knew his grandfather must have sent word to him that juliana was ill but the weeks and months passed with no sign of his dad didnt he care it was hard for valerian to reconcile the mounting evidence of his dads indifference to their plight against the image hed cultivated since a youngster the subject of his mums illness was always quietly dismissed whenever he brought it up but valerian knew that if whatever was wrong with his mum was serious enough to warrant its being kept from him it must be extremely serious indeed a succession of physicians had come and gone but none of them appeared to offer anything that stopped his mums terrible hacking cough or enabled her to put on weight hed heard words like long term inoperable terminal nonviable immedicable and yet others he didnt understand but the meaning was all too clear as each doctor arrived valerian felt a flutter of hope but as each one left that hope was crushed evidently his grandfather was not about to give up even if it seemed his dad already had valerian fell his anger grow and tried to suppress it one of the few teachings of his dad that had stuck was that anger was a wasted emotion angry people do stupid things valerian his dad had said speak when youre angry and youll make the best speech youll ever regret so when your anger rises think of the consequences before you act he put down his book and closed his eyes trying to calm his seesawing emotions but finding it difficult with all the noise coming from downstairs it took a second to dawn on him that the noises from downstairs were not normal for this time of day and he sat up as he caught a measure of the urgency in them valerian heard the sound of someone crying and made his way quickly to his bedroom door something was definitely going on so he made his way downstairs heading toward the large room at the rear of the house that served as a warm gathering place in the evening he heard shouted oaths and more crying and a cold hand seized his heart as he suddenly wondered if something had happened to his mum valerian broke into a run and skidded into the room from which the sounds of crying were issuing the room was full of people all staring in rapt attention at something displayed on the flickering holographic image of the cineviewer in the corner of the room valerians first feeling was relief as he saw his mum standing in the center of the room but then he noticed that there were a lot of people here who looked as though theyd just been given the worst news imaginable a few heads turned to face him their faces streaked with tears then quickly turned back to the unfolding drama on the cineviewer the image was fuzzy and dark but from here it appeared to be showing a large black ball whats going on he asked why is everyone so sad oh my darling val said his mum rushing to him and sweeping him up in a hug oh honey its korhal korhal the planet dad comes from what about it his mum pulled back as though not sure she should tell him what was going on its okay mum he said just tell me korhals gone honey gone how can a planet be gone said valerian its too big to be gone his mother struggled with her words her eyes streaming with tears i meannot gone exactly but the confederacy has launched a thermonuclear strike against korhal said master miyamoto appearing at his mums side a thousand apocalypseclass nuclear missiles according to a military press release valerian felt his stomach lurch and terrible fear freeze his limbs korhals destroyed dad is dad dead no no hes alive said his mum we had word from your grandfather not long after the first news reports came through your dads fine relief flooded him and he disengaged himself from his mums arms as everyone in the room continued to watch the image on the cineviewer he stood before the flickering image of korhal watching the black disc of the world as nuclear firestorms raged across its surface with elemental fury the once bountiful and green world was now a superheated sphere of blackened glass and phantoms even with his limited understanding of the physics of nuclear detonations valerian knew that a thousand missiles was an inordinate amount of overkill such an overwhelming attack would have killed every living thing on the planets surface how many people lived on korhal he asked more than thirtyfive million said master miyamoto all dead the thought of such devastation was humbling that so many people could be wiped from existence in such a short period of time was unbelievable what manner of madman could ever think to unleash such wanton destruction the confederacy did this asked valerian men without honor did this replied master miyamoto chapter flames burned with a greenish glow from the bombedout munitions plant but valerian couldnt tell if the color was the result of ignited chemical spillage or a fault of the cineviewer fire crews fought a futile battle with the blaze and medics dragged screaming men and women from the wrecked interior of the building valerian felt no sympathy for these peoplethey were employees of the old families and therefore part of the system that maintained the bloated corrupt form of the confederacy the same men who had destroyed korhal six years ago the image panned from the blazing plant to a sandyhaired young man standing at the edge of a perimeter enforced by confederate marines clad in full combat armor and looking eager to use the heavy gauss weapons they carried another atrocity unleashed by arcturus mengsk and his sons of korhal that forces to number the dead in the thousands said the reporter his voice appropriately outraged and mixed with not a little relish thought valerian an unknown number of bombs placed with uncanny skill throughout the ares munitions factory has resulted in its complete destruction theres no word yet from official sources of the number of people murdered in this latest act of terrorism but one thing is certain it will be high back to you michael valerian muted the sound and shook his head as the image of the burning factory was replaced with the neonlit chrome interior of the unn studios on tarsonis the broadcast was a few days old and he was under no illusions that much of what the reporter had said was true which was a rarity these days the sons of korhal an appropriate name thought valerian one apparently coined by his father in the wake of the nuclear attack on korhal as he began rallying fragmented and scattered bands of revolutionaries to him in his bid to topple the confederacy those ragtag soldiers had been molded into an army that wasif what he was hearing from his grandfather was true proving to be a grave threat to the continued existence of the current regime though to hear the reports of the unn arcturus mengsk was a madman a lunatic who made raving pronouncements over the airwaves of his supposed divinity and the alien creatures that used mindcontrolling drugs on the tarsonis council on those rare occasions where the unn played snippets of his fathers broadcasts they were so chopped up edited or manipulated that even a child could tell they bore no resemblance to their original content it had been eight years since valerian had last seen his father eight years of forced relocations and moving from planet to planet as they kept one step ahead of confederate assassins and kill teams whether or not such killers were still after them was a moot point it did not do to take chances when their lives hung in the balance this hideaway was a particularly bleak refuge thought valerian though it at least had the benefit of relative proximity to umoja for covertly delivered supplies and a steady stream of news that wasnt weeks if not months out of date valerian got up from his bed and stretched thinking that perhaps he would go for a run doing a few circuits of the orbital along its outer ring before returning to his medical digitomes of oncological research tethered in orbit above an inhospitable rock named van ostens moon despite the fact that it was not a moon having nothing to orbit orbital didnt even warrant a name such were its remoteness and insignificance to anyone else he supposed he had only himself to blame for the tedium of the orbital it was a destination he had picked from a list of suitable candidates after recognizing the name from an archaeological report penned by a dr jacob ramsey that valerian had read two years ago ancient ruins had been discovered on van ostens moon and orbital had been shipped across space and converted from its original function as a base for mining operations to one of archaeological discovery the expedition had been abandoned due to lack of funding and the ruins never fully explored much to dr ramseys chagrin from the frustrated tone of the report but ramseys loss had been valerians gain and he had leapt at the chance to discover ruins that might be genuinely alien having long ago discarded his collection of fossils unearthed in various gardens and riverbanks so far hed made a single trip to the barren rock a desolate craggy wasteland with the merest scrap of an atmosphere to its name with an escort of soldiers to view the ruins the surface of van ostens moon felt as though one were walking on something that ought to be a piece of something far larger but where this intuition had come from valerian had no idea the atmosphere was gritty and cold like breathing in on a frozen winters day though breathing apparatus was not required the thin air made it all too easy to become lightheaded and disorientated to avoid arousing the attention of the confederate exploration corps shipments of exploratory equipment were coming in piece by piece and it would be some time before valerian had assembled enough kit to begin a full examination of the ruins but what he had seen so far had been awesome in its breathtaking scaleawesome in the original sense of the word as in capable of producing awe wonder or admiration not the watereddown colloquialism it had became where a pair of new shoes could be called awesome perched on the edge of the world overlooking what might once have been an ancient seabed the ruins towered over the mesas around them spiraled nubs of brokendown towers and collapsed caverns that were too enormous and geometrically perfect to have been created by anything but an intelligent hand in everything valerian saw there was a curious fusion of the organic and the artificial weathered walls were laced with strangelooking alloys within the natural rock and canyons mountains and caverns had been artfully engineered to their designers needs he found vast and airy caverns roofed by rounded riblike vaults and curved tunnels that stretched deep into the surface of van ostens moon though he was glad the site had been left largely unexplored valerian had to wonder at the stupidity of the bureaucrats who had withheld funding for such a wondrous find the sense of scale and the seeming age of the site were astounding the deterioration of the rock suggesting spans of lime more akin to geological ages rather than that of any time period comprehensible to humans who had built the structures was a mystery one that valerian fell he could solve had he but the resources and time though his father ensured that he and his mother were never short of moneythe mineral find he had discovered just before their first meeting had turned out to be a seemingly neverending source of funds one that was now jealously guarded by a veritable army of soldiers tanks and goliathsvalerian knew that time was against him with his father the most wanted man in the galaxy it was only a matter of time until the hounds were snapping at their heels again and they were forced to move on his mothers sickness had already forced him to halt his exploration of the alien ruins but the actions of his father force him to leave them behind either way the end result was the same valerian continued with his stretches knowing that a hard run would work out some of his stress and anger toward his father it was difficult to be angry with someone you hadnt seen for so long but valerian only had to think of his mothers condition and the familiar smoldering coal of his bitterness would flare into life once more a nervous knock came at the door to his room and he said come in charles the door opened and a young man only a few years older than valerian entered the room he was dressed in an immaculately cut suit and his head was crowned with a shock of wild red hair that seemed at odds with the blandness of his features charles whittler had become part of their roving band of fugitives a year ago an aide servant equerry and general manservant who had arrived at the instruction of his father valerian was sure whittler was reporting to his father but what was not so clear was why valerian played dumb but for all that he did not trust whittler the man was a capable valet who attended to valerians needs with alacrity and competence good morning sir said whittler i hope im not disturbing you not at all said valerian i was just about to go for a run ah then i fear may have come with a summons that might inconvenience you what is it your mother asks to speak with you said whittler valerian made his way along the steelwalled corridors of the orbital the fluorescent strips set into the ceiling and walls bleaching everything of life and color it had once been a mining installation and on such a facility visibility was more important than aesthetics a concept valerian could understand even if he didnt subscribe to it everything on board orbital was simple and functional as was to be expected where space was at a premium and burly largely unskilled men were expected to spend great deal of their time the air had a dry recycled quality to it and valerian found himself wishing for the hundredth time to be back on umoja with its scented air and copper skies he walked at a brisk pace his body now in the throes of its teenage development and changing dally he was still handsome to the point of beauty his skin flawless and his hair golden his features were in transition from boy to man but he could already visualize the form they were going to take and knew they would be perfect whittler walked alongside him his legs seeming to move at twice the speed of valerians just to keep up with him he was slender and apparently fit but there was little vigor to the man a trait valerian was blessed with in abundance how was she when you spoke to her asked valerian much the same sir though there was a certain animation to her today really thats good any idea why no sir replied whittler though she did receive a communique from her father how do you know who it came from charles asked valerian did you look at it first i most certainly did not replied whittler the very idea your grandfather always sends a communication at the beginning of the month it is the beginning of the month ergo it is from your grandfather beginning of what month were in space charles i keep a record of the diurnal rotations on umoja and tarsonis to keep track of our time relative to them in such dislocated circumstances i find it helps fix oneself if there is a predetermined point of reference to cling to youve traveled a lot in space more than i have cared to was whittlers noncommittal answer valerian wanted to ask more but felt he would get little in the way of an answer that meant anything so let the matter of whittlers previous travels go and concentrated on the summons issued by his mother juliana pasteur was not a well woman and her health had only deteriorated over the last six years after his fifteenth birthday valerian had demanded to know what was wrong with her and at last she had told him the truth of what the doctors had discovered though sometimes he wished she hadnt his mother had been diagnosed with a carcinoid tumor a rare cancer of the neuroendocrine system the cancer had arisen in her intestine and grown slowly over the years which was why it had taken so long for her to suspect there was more wrong than she realized by the time shed consulted a physician the cancer had already spread to her liver and begun to attack other parts of her body with unthinking biological relentlessness its progress had been slow but steady robbing her of her vitality and stripping the meat from her bones not even the most advanced surgical techniques could defeat the cancer without killing her in the process valerian had cried with her as she told him and gently guided him through the same reactions she had experienced denial shock anger sadness guilt and fear she was going to die and had made her peace with that it was more than valerian could do he had immediately ceased his visits to the surface of the planetoid they circled and thrown himself into researching his mothers condition despite the apparent hopelessness of the endeavor perhaps because she had been told she could live for several more years before death finally claimed her his mother had tried to dissuade him from wasting his time looking for a miracle cure sometimes fighting to hold on to something you love can destroy it in the process she had said to him one evening holding him as he cried lets enjoy the time we have left val let me watch you grow and live your life dont waste it chasing windmills but nothing she said to him could penetrate his need to do something no matter that this was an enemy he had no means to light he discovered that not even the most advanced intrascopic lasersdevices capable of targeting specific areas of the body with precise amounts of heatnor the latest drugs or even nanobrachytherapy could defeat this foe without first killing its victim valerian however was a mengsk and he did not give up easily requesting fresh digitomes and the latest researches from the top medical institutes on umoja and tarsonis via safe routes to avoid compromising their security of course sir said whittler and valerian started he hadnt realized theyd reached his mothers room and wondered how long hed been standing here are you going in asked whittier he look a deep breath yes of course im going in valerian sat beside his mothers bed and held her hand wishing he could pass some of his own vitality on to her he had plenty to spare so where was the cosmic harm in evening the balance but the universe didnt work that way he knew ir didnt care that bad things happened lo good people and was entirely indifferent to the fate of the mortal beings that crawled around on the debris of stars no matter what those who believed in divine beings might claim his mother sat upright on her bed her skin pale and translucent as though pulled too tightly across her skull her hair fell around her shoulders its golden luster now the sickly jaundiced yellow of a chronic smoker she was still beautiful but it was a serene beauty bought with the acceptance of death valerian found it hard to see her fearful that if he looked too long he might lose grip on his emotions at times like this he cursed his father for the lessons of emotional control have you been to your ruins today val she asked no mum he said i havent i dont go to them anymore remember oh yes i forgot she said waving a bony arm before her i have trouble remembering things now you know valerian looked around the room its austere functionality putting him in mind of a morticians workspace he hated the reek of defeat that filled the room are you thirsty he asked in lieu of something meaningful to say she smiled yes honey pour me some water would you valerian filled two plastic cups with tepid water and handed one to her making sure she had it held in both hands before releasing his grip she lifted the cup to her gaunt face and sipped the water smiling as she handed it back to him charles told me you received a message today i did she said with a smile that served only to make her face look even more cadaverous than it did already its from your grandfather what does he have to say for himself this month he says your father is coming to see us the cup of water fell from valerians hands the spire of rock soared above valerian like the horn of some massive buried narwhal its surface pitted and worn smooth by uncounted centuries he ran his hand across the surface feeling tingling warmth through the fluted surface of the rock that was quite at odds with the chill of the air around him sheer cliffs of curving rock arched up overhead a natural canyon that valerian suspected had once been roofed by ribbed beams of stone but which now lay scattered and broken at his feet frozen gritty winds howled as they funneled through the canyon lamenting the fall of so mighty a structure and valerian wondered what great catastrophe had occurred here to cast it down the sky rippled through the thin atmosphere stars pulsing in the far distance their light already millennia old he pulled his thick jacket tighter about himself and adjusted his goggles as he descended the looserubbleandscree slope that led to the colossal cave mouth ahead he had ventured within this cave before and fell a deep sense of connection to the past within its shimmering hybrid walls to know that longforgotten hands had crafted this palace with ancient artifice was an electrifying sensationproof that life had existed in the galaxy long before the arrival of human beings the secrets that might yet be buried here were beyond measure and valerian longed for the opportunity to plumb the depths of those mysteries both for the sake of knowledge and for the rewards it would bring valerian paused as he took a moment to savor the solitude smiling to himself as he realized that this was probably the most alone he had been in his entire life he was the only human being on this rock and the freedom of that sensation was intoxicating the news that his father was coming to orbital had made valerian surly and irritable he found himself unable to concentrate on his researches and his mother had even berated himsomething she almost never did the only peace he found was on the surface of van ostens moon alone with his thoughts and the ruins of a forgotten race of alien builders what had brought them here and what had become of them these were mysteries valerian felt sure he could unlock were he but given the time time it all came back to time time he and more especially his mother didnt have hed managed to persuade charles whittler that he could travel to the surface of van ostens moon without escort and had landed one of the orbitals two flyers al the mouth of the largest canyon complex on the surface he wore a pair of loosefitting cargo pants and a heavy insulated jacket over his back was slung a rucksack filled with a comm unit surveying equipment and food and water he wore a slugthrower in a shoulder holster and his favorite sword was belted at his hip he wanted solitude but he wasnt about to venture into alien ruins without taking some precautions the journey down the rocky canyon had been easy going so far but his breath was still tight in his chest and he slipped the mouthpiece of a small aqualung canister over his nose and mouth a squall of dust blew off the ground and valerian looked up to see the orbital s second lander flash overhead circling and coming in to alight at the mouth of the canyon he cursed at the interruption and had half a mind to just carry onward to hell with the new arrival but he forced the thought down the lander touched down without fuss and within moments the side hatch opened and a tall figure emerged into the twilight world of van ostens moon valerian recognized him immediately and his heart hammered on the cage of his ribs there was no mistaking the powerful cut of the man even from this distance his father arcturus mengsk descended the ladder and began the trek to meet his son valerian saw that the man was dressed similarly to himself with heavyduty work wear and rugged boots like valerian his father carried a pack over his shoulders and moved with the natural assurance of a man used to being in control as his father approached valerian took the time to study him arcturuss hair was still dark but the first signs of gray were appearing at his temples and in his beard only in his midthirties his fathers ongoing war against the confederacy was evidently aging him prematurelythough he was still an imposing proud figure despite the thin atmosphere his father seemed untroubled by his exertions and maintained a steady pace toward him over the rough terrain he waved al his son and despite himself valerian waved back his mother had once told him that people often found themselves going out of their way to please his father for no reason they could adequately explain valerian wondered if he too had been affected by that realitywarping effect arcturus dropped over a fallen slab of rock and took a deep breath of the thin air bracing isnt it said his father valerian removed the aqualung canister and said thats it thats your greeting after eight years ah youre angry said arcturus pausing and taking a seat on a smooth boulder a natural reaction i suppose do you need to berate me for a while before we talk as men it wont do any good but if you feel you must then go ahead valerian felt the angry outburst he had planned to deliver wither in his breast and the angry retort on the tip of his tongue become stillborn right he said i might as well get mad at these rocks for all the good it would do words spoken in anger are just hot air valerian they rarely hurt so whats the point of them there are no words as ultimately destructive as those which are ultimately considered youd know about that said valerian the unn is making you look like some kind of crazed madman arcturus waved his hand no one believes whats on the unn anyway and the more they vilify me the more people are waking up to see that i have the confederacy worried and do you have them worried his father stood and came over to him looking him up and down as though inspecting a prime specimen of livestock oh id say i do the confederacy is about to fall i can see the cracks widening with every day that passes my father and your grandfather knew what they were doing but they werent thinking big enough and you are very much so said arcturus nodding in the direction of the cave mouth valerian had been heading for now what say you show me whats been occupying your time on this barren rock valerian nodded and set off without another word picking his way down the slope toward the yawning cave its scale was immense and it took them a further hour to reach the bottom of the canyon the towering cliffs wreathing them in shadow and cold the surfaces of the rocks were smooth and glassily transparent as though vitrified by intense heat and striated with what looked like gleaming metal perfectly round gemstones were buried within the bean of the rock fascinating said his father the surface has an igneous look to it but appears to be metamorphic do you know the substance of the protolith no said valerian suddenly wishing he knew more about the formation of rock and had more specialist equipment here i dont even know what that means ah no i suppose you wouldnt said arcturus metamorphic rocks come about when a preexisting rock type the protolith is transformed into something altogether new what sort of thing could cause that change arcturus pressed his hand against the rocks resting his forehead on the smooth face of the stone usually its caused by high temperatures and the pressure of rock layers above but tectonic processes like continental collisions would do it as well any sufficiently large geological force that causes enormous horizontal pressure friction and distortion could cause this but i dont think were looking at any natural phenomenon here why not because whatever caused this transformationif it even was a transformation didnt take place over geological spans of time i think it happened virtually overnight but then ive just arrived im sure youve looked more deeply into the geological formations already valerian hadnt had the chance to go any deeper than observational study but suspected his father already knew that and was bandying about his knowledge in an unconscious display of superiority of course said valerian attempting to reassert his power my studies have shown that this formation is a blend of natural forces and artificial engineering see here where the natural camber of the rock has been molded and interfaced with what looks like some kind of metal reinforcement arcturus looked closely at the rock valerian indicated yes like a neosteel rebar in plascrete valerian waved his father onward come on lets go inside its quite something youll not have seen anything like it dont be so sureive seen a lot these last few years nothing like this promised valerian his father stood in the center of the cave though to call it such was to vastly diminish its unbelievable incomprehensible scale it was a gargantuan cathedral of light and stone and metal fashioned deep in the bean of a mountain by an ancient race of gods for surely no beings but gods could have hollowed out so massive a peak and not have it collapse in the millions probably billions of years since they had first devised the means of its construction gracefully curving ribs of rock soared overhead each one thicker than the hull of a battlecruiser corbels the size of siege tanks jutted out of the walls and airy flying buttresses supported hanging finials and graceful descending archways of stone distance rendered them slim and delicate but valerian guessed most were at least twenty meters thick the very walls seemed to shimmer with internal bioluminescence scads of light darting along the lengths of metal set in the stone like flickering embers of electrical current gems pulsed with a faint glow as though in time with an infinitely slow and inaudible heartbeat fluted stalactites descended in tapering spears penetrating the roof like an inverted crown of ice pushed through the mountains summit a light mist hung in the upper reaches of the enormous cavern a cloud system that kept the air moist and reduced the internal humidity the interior of the cave seemed to point even more conclusively to a deliberate hand in its creation its scale making a mockery of any such human constructions entire fleets could fit within this enormous cavern andm for all valerian knew perhaps they had its incredible said arcturus and valerian was surprised to hear genuine emotion in his voice ive never seen the like told you said valerian pleased he had been able to surprise his father and you think this is alien dont you replied valerian surprised at the question i suppose its possible conceded his father but even if its true what does it matter whoever built this is long dead and gone arent you curious about who built it what great secrets we might learn from them not especially they are nothing but dust now and no one remembers them how great could they have been valerians frustration at his fathers obstinate refusal to grasp the enormity of such revelations grew with every word arcturus uttered and his temper began to fray he realized hed been sucked into his fathers reality by the mans apparent interest in the ancient cave valerian shook himself free of it as all the things he had wanted to say to his father suddenly rushed to the forefront of his mind where have you been all these years he blurted why did you never come for us didnt you care for us his father turned from his contemplation of the vast cavern its majesty forgotten in an instant as he saw that the pleasant fiction of a father and son bonding was at an end it was too dangerous he said simply the confederacy wants me dead and if they knew where you were they would use you to get to me theres no great mystery to it valerian my mother is ill said valerian did you know yes i know do you care of course i care snapped arcturus what kind of childish question is that childish is it childish to wonder where you were when the mother of your son is dying ailin told me your mothers cancer was inoperable said arcturus is he right he is confirmed valerian fighting to control his anger and hurt and all this running from planet to planet and moon to moon isnt doing her any good its just making her worse and what would it have achieved if i had come rushing to your side save put you both in danger said arcturus did you want me to come and help you hold your mothers hand as she lay on her deathbed is that it well valerian im sorry but that would have achieved nothing i have greater concerns than comforting you or your mother valerian wanted to launch himself al his father and wipe the uncaring expression from his face with his fists but he kept his anger locked tightly within himself though he hated to admit it valerian found himself admiring the mans ability to think logically and focus in the face of what would have broken the composure of a lesser man but still he had things to say to his father that needed saying regardless of whether or not they would penetrate his armor of conceit greater concerns like overthrowing the confederacy exactly said arcturus and such a goal requires sacrifice we have all lost people in the course of this war son including me my parents dorothy achton who he was my fathers head of security and a good man what happened to him he was on korhal when the missiles hit ah but their deaths will gain meaning when the confederacy lies in ruins and you and i step in to fill the void we can do it valerian i have an army behind me that is the equal of anything the confederacy can field its only a matter of time until they break and we can rule what they leave behind but we can do it right and found an empire for the good of humanity the good of humanity spat valerian you mean the benefit of the mengsk dynasty arcturus shrugged i see no difference between the two he said and youd want me beside you said valerian trying to keep the hope from his voice of course replied arcturus coming over and gripping his shoulders you are my son and you are a mengsk who else would be worthy to stand at my side as my successor you didnt think so before pointed out valerian i heard what you said about me you called me bookish effeminate and weak words spoken in anger long ago said arcturus dismissing the hurt his words had done with a wave of the hand but look at you now you have done me proud boy and im impressed i cant pretend im not you have achieved a lot since i saw you last i didnt do it for you father he said i did it for me i know that and thats good a man should never do anything to impress others he must always do things on his own and for his own sense of validation and what if i dont want to your successor said valerian youve been controlling my life from afar for so long now i think youve gotten used to the idea that ill always jump at your command well im not like that father i am my own man and i make my own decisions his father smiled and nodded letting go of his shoulders and sitting on a nearby hunk of fallen rock i remember saying something similar to my father long ago valerian felt the anger drain from him and took a long drink of water from a plastic canteen he removed from his pack did it do you any good not really said arcturus accepting the canteen from valerian i called him a terrorist and a murderer but now ive done far worse than he ever did i guess if someone does something truly terrible to you its easier to justify your retaliation no matter how vile it is the confederacy killed my family and obliterated my homeworld what could i possibly do that would approach an atrocity of such magnitude i dont know said valerian i dont think i want to know then what do you want valerian i want to be part of your life but i want to make my own destiny i said that to my father too replied arcturus however i have since found that time and history have a way of sweeping us up and making use of our talents irrespective of what we might want what do you mean i mean that destiny will sometimes force us down the road it intends for us and theres nothing we can do about it is that what you think happened to you maybe but i dont think so why not because destiny dances to my tune said arcturus valerian laughed at that but the laugher died when he realized his father wasnt joking chapter destiny dances to my tune the words came back to valerian as he watched the gigantic aai haloscreen in the main commercial square of gramercy city capital of tyrador viii fully thirty meters wide and nine high the artificial advertising intelligence projected an image atop a shimmering podium before a giant skyscraper normally the aai advertised clothes soft drinks or the latest model of groundcar but today promised to be quite different a flickering threedimensional image of his fathers face hovered over the podium for once speaking to those who watched without interference from confederate censors or unn editors upward often thousand people filled the squaretraders shoppers businessmen refugees criminals and enforcers of the lawall silent and filled with nervous excitement as they listened to the words blaring from the speakers set within the podium the voice of arcturus mengsk spoke over a magnificent tableau of stirring imagery sweeping landscapes and wraith fighters flying in formation fellow terrans began his father his voice booming its pronouncement like that of a stern but magnanimous god i come to you in the wake of recent events to issue a call to reason let no human deny the perils of our time while we battle one another divided by the petty strife of our common history the tide of a greater conflict is turning against us threatening to destroy all that we have accomplished valerian watched the faces of the people of gramercy city around him feeling slightly in awe of being in so vast a crowd until recently the largest number of people hed seen gathered in one place had been a dozen or so servants in his grandfathers home on umoja which seemed so long ago it was like another life taking refuge on tyrador viii had been valerians ideahiding in plain sight in the midst of a populous planet though given the fate of the confederacy in recent months and this current announcement it looked like their enforced flight was now at an end it is time for us as nations and as individuals to set aside our longstanding feuds and unite continued the stentorian voice of his father as the image on the screen changed to mighty battlecruisers sweeping majestically over korhal the tides of an unwinnable war are upon us and we must seek refuge on higher ground lest we be swept away by the flood an image of a confederate battlecruiser on fire from stem to stern filled the viewer and the crowd cheered a collective outpouring of decades of repressed anger and frustration valerians father continued the confederacy is no more whatever semblance of unity and protection it once provided is a phantom a memory with our enemies left unchecked who will you turn to for protection the montage of images moved on as the cheering continued the shattered confederate vessel replaced with juddering shots of what valerian now knew were a protoss ship and a snapshot of a zerg higher organism drifting in space the devastation wrought by the alien invaders is selfevident we have seen our homes and communities destroyed by the calculated blows of the protoss we have seen firsthand our friends and loved ones consumed by the nightmarish zerg unprecedented and unimaginable though they may be these are the signs of our time flashing violent images of battling wraiths sped across the screen though what they were shooting at wasnt clear the time has come my fellow terrans to rally to a new banner demanded his father in unity lies strength already many of the dissident factions have joined us out of the many we shall forge an indivisible whole capitulating only to a single throne and from that throne i shall watch over you a tingle ran up valerians spine but he couldnt tell whether it was one of relief or dread his fathers words had sounded more like a warning than a promise of protection the image returned to the soaring spires that were even now being rebuilt on korhal amid the ashen devastation of the confederatess spiteful attack the camera closed on the buildings finally settling on a huge black flag bearing a symbol that had become familiar lo everyone over the last few years a red arm holding a whip in its fist the whip forming a circle around the arm the sons of korhal the camera lingered on the flag as his father delivered his closing words from this day forward let no human make war upon any other human let no terran agency conspire against this new beginning and let no man consort with alien powers and to all the enemies of humanity seek not to bar our way for we shall win through no matter the cost static formed a glittering column of white noise as the voice of arcturus mengsk faded and was replaced by the unwavering symbol of the sons of korhal valerian turned away from the enormous aai as he heard the familiar snap and sizzle of the haloprojectors firing up to repeat the message once more valerian had no need to hear it again he had memorized the words as soon as hed heard them he turned and made his way along the crowded thoroughfares pushing against the tide of jubilant people making their way toward the central square valerian found a side street he knew and on it a small coffee house he frequented the shop was empty when he reached it and valerian helped himself to a hot drink making sure to leave a few credit notes on the scuffed wooden bar he took a seat by the window and watched the cheering crowds pass by their faces alight with joy valerian knew that the people here would for a while remember this day with golden memories the day the hated confederacy was overthrown and replaced with well no one had been sure until today who would step into the void of authority left by the confederacys sudden shocking demise no one except valerian mengsk he had known exactly who it would be todays sectorwide broadcast had only confirmed it his father had declared himself emperor arcturus mengsk i of the terran dominion but no one was yet sure of the legitimacy of his claim valerian had heard some people talk of elections while others cried out in support of a man who had until recently been condemned throughout human space as a terrorist never more was the aphorism about history being written by the victors about to be proven correct destiny dances to my tune in the three years since he had heard his father speak those words valerian had come to understand his ultimate aim hed seen his suspicions turn to certainly as over and over again his father had defeated every force the confederacy sent against him with a combination of guile brute force and displays of utter ruthlessness that still had the power to stagger valerian when he thought of them indeed the last year had seen a multitude of changes all of which had come with such unprecedented speed that it was hard to process them with any degree of comprehension humanitys first system shock had come with the news that the worlds of chau sara and mar sara had been destroyed by a fleet of ships belonging to an alien race known as the protoss the second had followed soon after when it became apparent that both worlds had been destroyed to ensure the destruction of a second alien species a species whose name soon became synonymous with wholesale destruction and parasitic infestation of world after world the zerg valerians initial excitement concerning the now indisputable evidence of alien life had been dampened somewhat with the realization that neither the protoss nor the zerg were likely candidates as the builders of the ancient structureshed decided they were temples of some sortthat hed explored on van ostens moon the zerg were a vile agglomeration of genetically mutable creatures driven by bloody instinct and an insatiable hunger to devour while the protoss were a strange aloof race оf psionic warriors though this latter race possessed technology far in advance of and just plain different from that of the terrans it did not seem likely they were a resurgent branch species of the temples builders the news that humanity was no longer alone was greeted with horror in some quarters religious ecstasy in others some people wanted to greet these new arrivals with open arms and hearty welcomes while otherssavvy to the current zeitgeistarmed themselves for war this latter group were to be proved the more perceptive with the arrival of these alien races open warfare ignited throughout confederate space with local brushfire skirmishes flaring into fullscale revolts and of course arcturus mengsk was there to fan the flames refugees fled before the tides of this increasingly ferocious war and conflicts revved up from terrorist attacks to fullfledged planetary battles throughout the sector thousands were dying every day and calamity followed calamity for the confederates as they lost their grip on their colony worlds one by one then came the destruction of amiga prime the truth had been suppressed of course but valerian had it on good authority from his grandfather that the great arcturus mengsk had used stolen psiemitter technology to lure the zerg to the confederate colony to defeat his enemies which had in turn drawn the protoss there to scour the planet bare of all life the terror that had followed this catastrophe spread through what remained of the confederate colonies like a virus through a fringe world shantytown the stream of refugees became a raging torrent and freighters crammed with terrified people fled in thousands from the epicenters of the fighting to the outer rim territories valerian remembered his mothers reaction to the news of his fathers complicity in the death of antiga prime seeing her visibly sag at what the man she had once loved was becoming valerian had realized some time ago that his fathers once noble ideals of throwing off the yoke of confederate tyranny and ending the corruption of the old families had withered and been replaced with a desire for an empire of his own his mother despised what his father had become but valerian secretly admired the singlemindedness with which arcturus pursued that one ambition knowing that one day it was destined to be his the thought still struck an ambivalent chord within him not long after the destruction of antiga prime his father had ordered valerian and his mother to find a new refuge one far from the core worlds of what remained of the confederacy it was typical of his father to send such a blunt message but valerian had sensed something deeper behind it as though some terrible event was about to be set in motion that required valerian and juliana to be as far from it as possible he hadnt known what that was until news reached them of the fall of tarsonis capital world of the confederacy like antiga prime before it tarsonis was overrun by the zerg drawn there by his father to destroy his enemiesthe old families who had murdered his parents and sister and consigned millions people to death on korhal as acts of vengeance went valerian had to admit it was a masterstroke bold without mercy and unstoppable the confederacy died with tarsonis it had been the linchpin of human space for so long that without it the colony worlds folded and collapsed leaving arcturus mengsks dominion triumphant in the ruins of his enemies defeat no sooner had the confederacy fallen than his father had made contact telling him that the time was approaching when he would bid valerian step into the light as his son valerian couldnt deny the attraction of that idea for he was now eighteen and ready to take his place on the galactic stage as a force in his own right he was his own man now intelligent erudite charming and capable able to fight with sword rifle or rhetoric as the occasion and honor demanded but whether he would be the successor his father imagined well that was another matter altogether valerian finished his drink and left the deserted coffee shop time to go home he said in the end it was another six months before valerian was to see his father again the demands of building the dominion from the ashes of the confederacy taking longer and placing more demands on the newly installed emperor than had been foreseen valerian hadnt minded at first content to spend time back on umoja at his grandfathers house with his mother now that they were free of the need to move from place to place to avoid confederate kill teams but as the weeks turned to months his impatience grew and the enforced idleness of life on umoja began to grate on him he was the son of an emperor yet had nothing of importance to do his mothers condition had progressed with every remission fallowed by a resurgence of the invisible sickness that was consuming her new technologies had slowed her descent but hadnt been able to stop it and the doctors had solemnly informed him that she could last only another six months at most they had been saying that for years though and his mother had surprised them all with her dogged tenacity and courage between periods of caring for his mother valerians days were spent honing his already fearsome skills with a blade and gun under the stern gaze of master miyamoto his old tutor had accompanied him back lo umoja and had declared valerian the best student he had ever taught he devoured every digitome he could get hold of learning everything he could of the protoss and zerg he scoured the information networks for any sign of fresh alien ruins but in the aftermath of war archaeology was no ones priority save his on this evening valerian walked behind his mother in the gardens of his grandfathers house following the path toward the river which glittered like molten copper in the sunset she had bid him accompany her to the riverbank and they had set off as the servants prepared the evening meal juliana ate little these days but valerians appetite was as hearty as ever he wore a formfitting suit of charcoal gray kneehigh boots of gleaming black leather a doublebreasted jacket with more than a hint of the soldier to it and a scarlet cloak draped around his shoulders his hair was unbound and fell about his shoulders in a cascade of gold the image of his mothers in her prime now that there was no reason to hide his ancestry and every reason to display it valerian proudly wore a bronze wolfhead medal of the mengsk family upon his breast his mother sat in an automated wheelchair controlling its movements with an alpha wave reader fitted just behind her right ear returning to umoja had done more to restore his mothers constitution than all the years of drugs and painful chemotherapy intramuscular nanostimulators had prevented her muscles from atrophying completely and it was wonderful to see some of her vitality restored to her even though valerian knew she could not last much longer he loved that she smiled again now that she was home the air was clear and crisp the umber sky warm and like honey over the distant horizon as the day drew to a close the scent of the air was heavy and valerian took a deep breath instantly transported back to his boyhood and a lime where he was innocent of the wider scope of the galaxy around him its good to be home isnt it said his mother her voice thin but stronger than it had been in many years back on umoja i mean valerian nodded yes though i still find it hard to think of anywhere as home now i know honey said his mother and im sorryit was no way to grow up being shunted from pillar to post like that it was hardly your fault after all what choice did we have i know but i want you to understand that i wish i could have given you a normal childhood a normal childhood said valerian what is that anyway does it even exist of course it does i had a perfectly normal childhood growing up here i guess said valerian as they rounded a bend in the path next to a stand of poplars and the river came into view and i remember this place fondlythough too much has happened for me to think of it as home anymore thats sad said juliana pointing to an irregular chunk taken out of the otherwise smooth course of the riverbank you remember that little cove there water had since filled the cove where it gamboled in miniature whirlpools but valerian remembered kneeling in the mud with a small shovel and a tray of unearthed treasures yes he said with a smile i remember i used to dig there for alien fossils i was so proud of you said juliana i am proud of you valerian youve grown up into such a wonderful handsome boy my heart almost breaks every time i look at you mother dont go on said valerian embarrassed by her praise but enjoying it nonetheless i mean it she said more urgently this time i might not have much time left and there are things i need to say to you my darling boy and i wanted you to remember something good from your childhood before i say them what is it he asked instantly alert as he sensed finality at the implication of his mothers words youve had to grow up so quickly and i know thats been hard on you but youre going to have to grow up some more soon im not going to be around much longer quiet mother said valerian keeling beside her and taking her hand those doctors dont know what theyre talking about not one of them has been right about your condition youve confounded them all and i know youll outlive every one of us youre so sweet she said running a hand along the side of his face but we both know that this will get me in the end no matter how fast i run please said valerian his voice trembling dont talk like this i have to im sorry said juliana tears welling in the corners of her eyes why cried valerian because soon your father will be here and im not strong enough to stand up to him anymore if i ever was this last comment was said bitterly and seemed to give her the strength to continue your father is a dangerous man said his mother and i dont just mean to his enemies he uses people valerian he uses them and he chews them up and when hes done with them he spits them out i wasted my life believing in him and my heart would break if i thought you were about to become the same kind of man he is i gave up my dreams for your father thinking he needed me and that hed come for me when the time was right but he never did why are you saying these things mother i dont need to hear them yes she said squeezing his hand with all her strength yes you do you have to be strong enough to resist your fathers influence by all means admire himhe has many admirable qualitiesbut dont try to be like him no matter what happens be your own man in all things and dont let him maneuver you like one of his chess pieces valerian felt the strength of her purpose pouring from her with every word as though she were channeling every last bit of her energy into making sure he understood her he could understand the cause of her bitterness toward his father but did she truly appreciate the grand designs his father had set in motion and the sacrifices necessary to realize them valerian looked into his mothers sunken eyes seeing the pain and sorrow that filled them and suddenly thought that maybe she understood the price of his fathers ambition all too well do you understand me she said urgently please tell me you understand i understand said valerian though in truth he did not i do father may be many things but he wouldnt sacrifice his own son to further his ambitions i hope youre right val she said opening her arms and taking him into her embrace i really hope youre right they sat in silence for many minutes holding on to one another and letting cathartic tears fall without inhibition valerian took a breath then released his mothers skeletal frame i love you valerian she said my wonderful handsome boy you are the best thing i have done with my life valerian tried to answer her but his throat was too choked to speak his mind too overwhelmed at the thought of losing his mother he wiped his eyes with a handkerchief and dabbed away the last tears with the heel of his palm this was not the way of a mengsk he thought a mengsk was stronger than this his heart a fortress valerian turned as he heard the crunch of gravel on the path behind him recognizing the diffident tread of charles whittler who remained his constant companion still accompanying whittler was valerians grandfather ailin pasteur what is it charles asked valerian im sorry to intrude sir but weve just received confirmation from general duke and said valerian when whittler did not continue he wasnt too happy about keeping his ships beyond the outer shipping markers he demanded to bring his ships into umojas orbit before allowing the emperor to descend to the planets surface and i told him to shove his demands up his ass said ailin pasteur valerian was shocked al his grandfathers outburst knowing he detested expletives as a sign of poor upbringing and a lack of vocabulary ill bet that went down well with duke said valerian hed never met edmund duke but his grandfather had told him of his reputation and how hed defected to the sons of korhal when his ship crashed amid a ravenous zerg swarm valerian had taken an instant dislike to him recalling the teachings of master miyamoto and his notions of honor as antiquated as such beliefs might be now they still had a hold on valerians soul i dont care how it went down continued his grandfather the ruling council is concerned at the direction arcturus is taking his terran dominion to say were unhappy at the idea of a fleet of dominion warships parked in orbit around umoja is an understatement and what did duke say duke didnt say anything sir said whittler it was the emperor himself who sent word valerians head whipped up at the mention of his father the emperor agreed to the umojan conditions said whittler and valerian could hear the sycophancy in his aides voice so when will he get here he will travel to us aboard an insystem gun cutter he has arranged to be here first thing in the morning valerian nodded and watched the sun set over the horizon the descending orb bathing the landscape in a russet glow the color of blood did it work asked the armored figure standing in the doorway of the ships bridge the voice was muffled by the helmet but the aching need was clear it worked confirmed the tech in oilstained overalls hunched over a battered juryrigged comm unit the stuff we got on braxis was the real deal ive been able to decode all the dominion datalinks we got it all his flight plan iff codes full manifest and arrival point pilots already plotting us a course the figure nodded hands curling into fists good stay on it listen for any more chatter will do the figure turned and made its way along a metalframed corridor that led deeper into the starship the cmc powered combat suit emblazoned with the red and blue flag of the confederacy painted on several of the armored plates a gauss rifle was slung over one shoulder and a longbladed combat knife was sheathed in a leg holster the corridors walls were denied from smallarms fire scorched by the impacts of shiptoship lasers and corroded from bioorganic weapons of the zerg the interior of the ship had clearly seen better days it was a miracle the ship was spaceworthy at all considering the damage it had taken during the battle around tarsonis when mengsk had unleashed those hellspawn monsters on them all the figure made its way into the depths of the ship passing barrack rooms where confederate marines cleaned their armor and stripped their weapons down for the hundredth time there was no garrulous banter between these warriors anymore the fall of the confederacy and death of everything they held dear had seen to that at last the figure came to a metal doorway and rapped a heavy gauntlet on the shutter come in said a voice with a laconic almost liquid accent the figure entered the room and removed the armors helmet captain angelina emillian shook her head and ran a hand through her tousled hair we got what we need she said addressing the man who sat on the edge of the rooms only bed his white uniform jacket was unbuckled revealing a hairless slabmuscled chest and he polished a large rifle that lay across his lap everything he said putting down the rifle yeah said emillian the codes we got on braxis are still active they dont know we hit the base at boralis yet so they havent bothered to change them excellent work angelina he said standing and buckling his jacket assemble the marines and warn them this ones going to be hard when we launch your dropship you be going in hot we wont be able to extract you unless you kill him that dont matter said emillian as long as that bastard mengsk is dead i dont care i know he said believe me i understand hatred very well i trained him did you know that yes he said and thats why i know youll kill him youre better than him emillian nodded toward his rifle you sure you dont want to go in with us i know how you like to use that bad boy not this time he said our new allies are readying another mission as well as the assassination of mengsk and i need to help them coordinate oh and where might that be the shipyards at dylar iv said samir duran chapter the last time valerian had waited for his father on umoja he had been seven years old he remembered his wideeyed optimism at the thought of meeting the heroic man who stood head and shoulders above lesser mortals this occasion shared similarities with that day in that arcturus mengsk was now literally head and shoulders above lesser men emperor arcturus mengsk the first it had a strange sound to it as though it had not yet settled and was yet to earn its rank as a title valerian stifled a yawn and wished hed been able to sleep last night hed told himself it was simply that hed drunk too much caffeine but he knew it was the thought of his acknowledgment as the emperors son that had caused his sleepless night with the resources of the dominion at his disposal nothing would lie beyond his grasp he could lead archaeological teams back to van ostens moon or any number of sites that had recently come to light the day had dawned bright and warm as though umoja itself were preparing to welcome the new emperor and the sun was a bloated red orb in the coppery sky valerian stood on the lawn before his grandfathers house dressed in his finest suit and boots with his ubiquitous scarlet cloak that accentuated his broad shoulders like armor his sword was slung low by his left leg and a handcrafted blaster pistol was bolstered on the opposite hip he presented a perfect image of an emperors son and despite his mothers reservations about today he could see she was pleased with how fine he looked she sat in her wheelchair wearing the most flattering clothes that could be tailored for her painfully thin form her hair was washed and cleaned and even after all she had said about his father al the riverbank last night valerian could see she had put on a little makeup even those cast aside by his father still made an effort to look presentable for him standing with them was his grandfather charles whittler and master miyamoto resplendent in his finest fighting robesand behind them a line of ailin pasteurs servants it had been whittlers idea to have the serving staff stand ready to greet the new emperor and though valerians grandfather had balked at the idea of putting on such a dogandpony show valerian had persuaded him that it couldnt do any harm the great emperor likes to make us wait grumbled pasteur well the ruling council did make him halt his ships beyond the outer marker pointed out whittler and gun cutters arent exactly the fastest ships a battlecruiser would have arrived here much sooner his grandfather mumbled something under his breath valerian didnt catch it but could guess its substance ailin pasteur and charles whittler had gotten off on the wrong foot and had never bothered to try and find the right one he suspected his grandfather was unsure as to which of the mengsks whittler owed his loyalty proving to valerian that ailin pasteur was a shrewd judge of character there said master miyamoto pointing to a spot of light in the orangeflecked clouds valerian looked up feeling his heartbeat shift up a notch as he saw the glowing cruciform shape of an aircraft dropping through the atmosphere two lighter ships swooped protectively around it flying figureeight patterns above and below the larger ship valerian fell a hand lake his and looked down to see his mother staring in apprehension at the approaching flyers itll be all right said valerian she looked up at him with a weak smile remember what i told you she said i will he promised the shapes resolved themselves from the clouds and valerian saw that the central craft was a heavy gun cutter a widebodied pugnaciouslooking aircraft long ago rendered obsolete by the development of the wraith fighter but it had range and was capable of interplanetary travel within a system so had never quite vanished from the inventory with the losses taken in the war against the confederacy he guessed his father could not afford to be too choosy when it came to weapons of war the other two ships were wraiths sleek airsuperiority fighters that could engage ground and air targets with equal lethality the gun cutter slowed its descent and rotated in to land its ventral thrusters kicking in as it approached the ground its bulbous engine nacelles were too wide to allow the craft to fit into the underground hangar but the pilot contented himself with landing next to the platforms open hatchway the wraiths continued to fly overhead patrols as the gun cutter settled its heavy bulk onto the ground thats never going to grow back grumbled pasteur as the cutters jets seared the grass you use robots to tend the garden so wheres the harm said valerian with a smile not the point replied his grandfather lack of respect for others is what it is further discussion w as hailed as the side hatch of the gun cutter rumbled open in a haze of steam smoke swirled as a dozen soldiers in combat armor jagged down the assault ramp and took up the position of honor guard on either side of it a shape appeared in the smoke and valerian smiled at the theatricality of his fathers emergence into the umojan sunlight emperor arcturus mengsk wore a long brown duster edged in gold thread and a brocaded internal lining his suit was styled like a marines dress uniform and finished with a glittering wolfhead belt buckle his boots were polished and a long sword was buckled at a rakish angle on his hip as arcturus marched down the ramp valerian saw his father had aged the silver in his beard and hair more pronounced than when he had last seen him yet for all the signs of maturity his father was still a year shy of forty and carried himself with the confidence and power of a man half his age everything about him radiated his absolute belief in himself and valerian knew that though in any other man this would be arrogance with his father it was simply a statement of fact the soldiers fell in behind arcturus as he crossed the lawn toward them with a purposeful stride valerian noticed the shock in his eyes at the sight of juliana in that one quickly masked window valerian caught a glimpse of his fathers fear of infirmity and things he could not call on his fearsome intellect and power to fight valerians grandfather stepped forward to meet arcturus his ambassadorial mask slipping into place as he shook hands with a man with whom he had run the gamut of emotions admiration mistrust anger forgiveness and finally mistrust again arcturus welcome to umoja i remember the last time you said that to me ailin said arcturus you didnt mean it then and i suspect you dont entirely mean it now so long as you are here in peace then you are welcome replied pasteur ever the diplomat eh said arcturus turning to greet valerian his father came forward with his arms open and his face alight with genuine pleasure my boy it does my heart good to see you you look well very well i am father said valerian embracing him and enduring a series of hearty slaps on the back for his trouble his father was at his ease with such comradely gestures but valerian had always found them awkward and forced valerian broke the embrace and his father turned to juliana if you dare say i look well ill take that sword and stick you with it she said i was going to say that it was good to see you replied his father but you look better than i was led to believe so thats good im flattered said juliana but his father had already moved on to greet charles whittler and master miyamoto playing the role of the approachable man of the people valerian saw the falseness of it and wandered how others could not perhaps he was more like his father than he knew able to see through the charade as if it were his own at last his father stepped back and said you are all very dear to me my friends and it means a great deal after all we have been through together that we should meet like this in the wake of my great triumph arcturus came forward and put his arm around valerian pulling him forward to stand at his side before the assembled onlookers we live in momentous times said arcturus but going forward together we can achieve anything we desire father and son we will build a better world for everyone polite applause rippled from the serving staff and valerian dearly wanted to believe his fathers words feeling somewhat swept up in the grandeur of his vision for the future only master miyamoto looked unimpressed staring in consternation at the sky are those yours he said shading his eyes from the sun valerian followed miyamotos gaze and a hot rush of adrenaline flooded his system four wraith fighters emblazoned with the flag of the confederacy diving in on an attack run everyone inside shouted arcturus the assembled crowd needed no encouragement and bolted for the house the two wraiths tasked with patrolling the skies above the emperor reacted as soon as their pilots realized the codes they were receiving on their iff threat panels were a lie but by then it was already too late the first fighter exploded as a stream of bright laser bolts stitched a path over its fuselage and ripped off its right wing the second wraith avoided the initial volley of gunfire and was able to return fire amazingly the pilots shots impacted on one of the attackers blowing out the cockpit in a shower of superheated blood and glass the enemy fighter spiraled toward the ground plowing into the grass in a spectacular fireball cartwheeling across the lawn and smashing into the house drowning out the screams of panic that filled the air shattered glazing and buckled steel caved inward and black smoke billowed upward from the wreckage buried in the structure of the house the dominion pilots defiance was shortlived however as the remaining three confederate fighters boxed him in and blew his craft араrt in a hall of laser fire burning wreckage fell into the river sending up huge spouts of water as it crashed valerian grabbed his mother from her chair and carried her close to his chest as he ran for the house knowing there wasnt time to get her to safety with more dignity sizzling bolts of energy sawed across the lawn as the first wraith flew in low on a strafing run half a dozen of his grandfathers serving staff were scythed down bodies blown apart from inside by the passage of violently hot lasers through their flesh valerian dropped to the ground as the ruby bolts ripped up the ground on either side of him he tasted earth and blood and smelted the stink of seared meat his mother cried out in pain and he rolled onto his side seeing her lying helpless next to him the confederate wraiths screamed overhead their wingmounted weaponry firing upon the helpless targets below them his fathers marines returned fire on the wraiths as they fell back toward the house but the pilots werent worried about smallarms fire from the ground impaler spikes sparked from the fighters fuselages or missed altogether but they at least gave the semblance of a fight back the gun cutter that had brought his father to umoja was powering up its engines but before it could lift off it was struck by a withering salvo of gunfire from the predatory wraiths one of the engine nacelles exploded spraying whitehot fragments in all directions whickering razoredged shrapnel cut down fleeing men and women in a bloody storm as the gun cutter lurched sideways it plowed a huge furrow in the ground throwing up sprays of earth and clods of mud as its one remaining engine roared into life and spun it around on its axis the gun cutter lurched one last time and vanished from sight tumbling down into the open shaft of the landing platform it had previously been too big to fit within with one of its engines blown off that was no longer a problem valerian heard someone shout his name and looked over the corpsestrewn lawn toward the house seeing his father and grandfather crouched in the shelter of a recessed doorway both men were furiously beckoning to him as the wraiths circled around for another strafing run valerian didnt waste time looking up and simply scooped his mother off the ground and ran as fast as he could to safety oh god val im so scared she cried dont worry he gasped i wont let anything happen to you the house suddenly seemed impossibly far off as though his every step carried it farther and farther away from him his fathers soldiers were painting the sky with impaler fire and valerian risked a glance over his shoulder as he heard the distinctive choppingair sound of a dropship on a fast insertion run a heavy lander in the colors of the confederacy was dropping rapidly through the clouds a midsized assault boat capable of carrying around twenty to thirty soldiers depending on their loadout valerian forced himself to run faster and suddenly he was at the doorway his father grabbed him and hauled him into the house the breath heaved in his lungs and his heart rate was racing like never before from eight years of age he had trained to fight with gun and sword but this was the first time hed been exposed to real combat valerian handed his mother off to charles whittler who set her down on a carved wooden bench as ailin pasteur slammed the door shut and engaged the maglock they were in the east wing hallway a terrazzofloored vestibule that linked the main receiving rooms and the guest quarters along with his mother and father master miyamoto whittler and ailin pasteur there were five soldiers and a handful of weeping domestics what the hell is going on mengsk demanded ailin pasteur who is trying to kill us his father took a breath and placed his hands on valerians shoulders his relief at his sons survival plain for all to see there has been some opposition to the institution of my reign he said turning and drawing his sword as his soldiers formed up around him i can only assume that this is a manifestation of that opposition opposition exploded ailin this is more than bloody oppositionthose men are going to kill us arcturus laughed in pasteurs face kill us dont be foolish ailin this isnt a fortress arcturus that door isnt going to keep them out for long theyre not going to kill us ailin repeated arcturus you sound very sure snapped pasteur i am replied arcturus i may die one day but it wont be today not at the hands of fools who cant accept theyre beaten charles whats the comm situation i need reinforcements charles whittler still holding juliana pasteur upright had one hand pressed to his ear in which was nestled the blinking light of a comm bead all the local networks are jammed sir he said our assailants appear to have cast an electromagnetic pulse net around us and i do not believe any of the house comm units are strong enough to burn through it at least not before we are dead also im picking up hundreds of channels of white noise across a wide spectrum even if someone could pick up our broadcast theres too much interference for anyone to understand the signal arcturus nodded theyre using a cassandra scrambler so we cant expect any local help then well were going to have to look elsewhere for aid there is nowhere else said ailin pasteur theres always somewhere else you can turn said arcturus as his father spoke valerian pressed himself lo the outer wall and looked through the glass panel at the side of the door flying shrapnel had punched a neat hole in the glass and he saw the confederate dropship hammer into the lawn its skids gouging great chunks from the soft earth its assault ramp dropped and a host of armored marines emerged they spread out and began moving cautiously toward the house in pairs incoming he said turning back to face his father marines at least thirty his father nodded and addressed ailin pasteur do you have a refuge here a safe room yes in the central service core get to it take valerian juliana and charles and two of my soldiers ordered arcturus lock yourselves in and wait for the cavalry understood you three soldiers and miyamoto youre with me arcturus cried juliana what are you going to do im going to get us some help he said the only comm unit strong enough to penetrate a cassandra screen is on the gun cutter if we can get to it i can call in duke and his boys im going with you said valerian im not running no said his father youre getting to safety im going with you repeated valerian thats the end of it no argument arcturus looked set to dispute him then saw his determination valerian felt his heart soar at the pride he saw in his fathers eyes the cutter went down the landing shaft yes said arcturus yeah said valerian its engine blew out and it fell in which means we can reach it from the house arcturus thats insane said juliana edmund dukes ships are too far away to reach us in time and for all you know the cutters comm unit is destroyed if i know duke hell be halfway here already said arcturus sorry ailin you didnt really think id leave my ships that far out did you damn you arcturus said pasteur you go too far arcturus gave a hollow laugh if duke gets here in time youll be glad i do valerian straightened as his father turned and handed him a gauss rifle you ready he racked the slide of the weapon im ready his father led the way and valerian master miyamoto and the three marines dashed after him the flaming wreckage of the crashed wraith blocked their initial route through the house but valerian guided them around it to reach the concealed elevator in the main hall the power was out so they took the stairs clattering down flight after flight in their desperate hurry valerian heard gunfire from above and paused in his descent torn between his desire to follow his father and his need to protect his mother he realized he hadnt even said goodbye and took a step back up the stairs dont be foolish shouted arcturus we can only help them by reaching the cutter valerian hesitated but he knew his father was right and headed down once more taking the stairs two at a time eventually they reached the bottom and emerged into the system of corridors maintenance caves and stores of the landing facility wretched smoke billowed and heaved throughout the underground complex and sprays of water drizzled from the sprinklers set into the roof valerian coughed at the acrid stench of burning fuel rubber and plastic pressing his hand over his mouth to avoid the worst of it he flinched at the sound of breaking glass and turned to see master miyamoto at an emergency fire point hauling a trio of breathing apparatus facemasks from within he handed one to valerian and one to his father before fitting his own mask which way to the platform asked arcturus his voice echoing and artificialsounding through the mask i dont remember the layout that way pointed valerian heading off down a side corridor running bent over to keep out of the smoke his eyes still stung from the fumes and his mouth tasted of tar but he couldnt deny the exhilaration he felt going into battle alongside his father valerian negotiated them through the network of tunnels until they arrived at the blast door that led out onto the platform the neosteel door had been torn from its mounting by the enormous impact of the gun cutters fall and lay buckled on the concrete floor they clambered over the shattered door and entered the cavern of the landing platform the gun cutter lay canted at an angle its fuselage torn open where it had been peeled back by the rock walls of the shaft smoke billowed upward from its remaining engine toward the bright oblong of daylight and burning pools of fuel collected beneath the wrecked craft were going to have to be quick said arcturus damn right agreed valerian i dont want to get blown to bits by an exploding gun cutter thank you very much yes it wouldnt be a very epic way to meet your end would it said his father lets make sure we dont then eh with that his father began clambering up the slope of twisted metal and debris toward the tear in the fuselage as he reached the gaping wound in the side of the culler he turned and called down to valerian keep watch above us and back along the corridor if our enemies pick up the signal from the cutter you can be sure were going to have company chapter valerian found cover behind a twisted sheet of the gun cutters fuselage training his rifle down the length of the passageway they had come from master miyamoto took up position across from valerian and his fathers three marines found cover that would allow them to enfilade the enemy eventually their attackers would realize that their target was not in the house once the enemy marines figured out where their quarry had gone and what they were doing theyd throw everything they had at them valerian and his soldiers had dragged piles of debris back toward the cutter to form rudimentary barricades and shared out what ammunition they had for the gauss rifles the clock was ticking but for what it was worth they were ready or at least as ready as five men could be to hold off thirty trained soldiers the heat in the cavern was stifling and sweat ran down valerians face inside his facemask his breathing sounded incredibly loud and his peripheral vision was practically nonexistent in frustration he tore the mask off and dropped it next to him the air was tight and oxygendepleted but much of the smoke from the wrecked cutter was being vented up through the wide landing shaft not the best conditions in which to fight a battle but who ever got to fight a battle in ideal conditions and valerian was willing to risk some respiratory difficulty to actually see the men he was going to have to kill he wiped a hand over his face trying to keep his breaths shallow and blinked regularly to keep his eyes moist he could just about make out the echoing sound of gunshots and wandered where they were coming from had his grandfather and charles managed to get his mother to safety while his fathers marines fought back or was he hearing echoes of shots being fired execution style like those that had ended the life of his fathers parents and sister the thought that his mother was in real danger almost sent him running back along the corridor but he forced himself to remain where he was allowing emotion to rule his actions would only get him killed and that would do no one any good least of all himself he glanced up toward the cutter what was taking so long was the comm unit broken was his father even now trying to repair it how long had passed anyway valerian found he couldnt even begin to guess how long it had been since the attack began it felt as though several hours had elapsed but he suspected that it was one at best the elasticity of time in a combat situation was something hed read about but had never expected to experience firsthand he felt the hairs on the back of his neck rise and looked over to where master miyamoto crouched his farmer tutor was staring at him jabbing a finger down the corridor and valerian fell his mouth go dry as he heard the clatter of boots and the bark of shouted orders this was it the enemy hed run from all his life was finally here but this time valerian mengsk wasnt running this time he was fighting he shouldered his gauss rifle and licked his lips as he saw shadows moving through the ruptured aperture of the blast door risking a quick glance back at the cutter he silently willed his father to get a damn move on a pair of confederate marines ducked around the edge of the torn doorway master miyamoto rose from cover and opened fire a meterlong tongue of fire blasting from the muzzle of his weapon the first marine dropped master miyamotos expertly aimed fire punching unerringly through his visor and filling the inside of his helmet with iron spikes valerian pulled the trigger working his fire over the second marine the recoil of the gauss rifle was fearsome designed to be absorbed by a powered combat suit which valerian conspicuously wasnt wearing the roar of the weapon was deafening but valerian kept the rifle on target knowing that his targets armor would defeat all but the most concentrated clusters of impacts the man fell as the three soldiers opened up as well the additional weight of their firepower tearing through the marines armor and spraying the wall behind him with blood valerian ducked back into cover as return fire sawed through the doorway impaler shots rattled from the metal around him and he flinched as a ricochet sliced across his arm he heard shouts and rose once more sending a blast of fire toward the doorway shots filled the air smacking from the debris and rock walls as the enemy marines laid down a curtain of suppressive tire valerian heard something skitter across the ground and his heart leapt into his mouth as he saw a gently wobbling oval disc come to rest no more than a few feet from him without thinking he dropped to one knee and scooped up the grenade lobbing it back the way it had come it exploded an instant later the noise agonizingly loud and the wave of overpressure swatting him onto his back he scrambled to his knees coughing and trying to force the air to return to his lungs valerian heard screams and cries for medics sounding tinny and impossibly distant he felt warm wetness in his ears and reached up his fingers coming away bloody a greasy fog bank of acrid smoke swirled upward from the grenades detonation valerian felt around for his rifle only now realizing it had been snatched from his grip by the blast more blasts of gunfire sounded but he couldnt tell who was shooting he found his rifle and swept it up the top portion of the barricade hed been sheltering behind had been torn away by the explosive force of the detonation valerian realized if hed stood to throw the grenade back his upper body would have been vaporized perhaps seven marines were lying screaming on the ground ripped open and their guts spilled out over the floor fragments of armor and ruptured body parts littered the ground but it was impossible to tell exactly how many men had died shouting marines tried to drag their wounded comrades to safety but valerian and miyamoto gave them no respite cutting them down in a deadly crossfire valerian experienced a surge of exhilaration and fell the urge to laugh well up within him with almost uncontrollable force amid all this killing and death the sensation was ludicrous and he suddenly realized how ridiculous this notion of battle was men who had never met were trying to kill one another valerian knew why he was fighting to protect his loved ones and save his own life but these marines what were thеу fighting for a fallen regime that had lied to them and probably erased the truth of their own lives with invasive brain surgery that was no reason to die yet here they were fighting a battle to the death as he was contemplating such weighty thoughts a trio of grenades arced into the chamber valerian saw them coming and dropped cursing at his stupidity the middle of battle was no place to meditate on the absurdity of war yet it had seemed the most natural thing in the world at the lime strange what the mind will do in times of stress he thought clearly the marines had learned their lesson and the grenades exploded almost as soon as they landed grenades explode up and out so valerian pressed his face to the floor as the enormous force of the blast roared over him two of his fathers soldiers vanished in a seething orange fireball and the gun culler lurched dangerously as the blasts shock wave dislodged the rubble holding it in place more choking clouds of smoke billowed upward and valerian knew their defiance was at an end he heard the sound of charging marines and the rippingcloth sound of sustained gauss fire impaler spikes zinged from sheet metal and neosteel armor plates and the last of his fathers soldiers cried out in pain as he was brought down valerian coughed and rolled to his feet hed hung on to his rifle this time and though he knew it was futile aimed it toward the marines assaulting their position a continuous roaring howl like the thunder of the mightiest storm front filled the enclosed landing platform chamber valerian dropped to his knees with his hands pressed against his ears at the overwhelming unbelievable volume the marines in front of valerian disintegrated in a storm of blazing light chewed up by hypervelocity slugs and exploding like wet red sacks of meat he looked up to see the dorsalmounted cannon turret of the gun cutter spewing shells from its quadbarreled weapon mount armor and bone and flesh vaporized under the holocaust of cannon fire the sheer killing power of the guns at such close range was utterly terrifying valerian could just make out his father sitting behind the weapon working its fire over their attackers in merciless arcs even as he watched sparks and ricochets hammered the upper fuselage of the cutter and valerian looked up to see half a dozen marines firing down into the landing platforms shaft from above the armored plexiglas of the turret held long enough for his father to drop out of the gunners compartment but within seconds the interior was a shattered ruin of broken plastic and metal more shots rained down from above and valerian ducked back as impaler spikes hammered into the ground beside him he fell a hand seize his arm and with his rifle raised swung to face his assailant master miyamoto slapped the barrel away and valerian let out a shuddering breath at how close hed come to cutting the man down in a pointblank burst of fire need to get into the cutter gasped miyamoto blood streamed from a cut on his head and his robes were soaked with red at his shoulder and hip youre hurt i know replied miyamoto with typical brevity nothing i can do about it though valerian nodded and pressed himself against the buckled hull of the cutter they couldnt break from coverthe marines on the surface would pick them off valerian could hear more shouts coming from beyond the doorway these ones dont know the cutters turret is out of action hissed miyamoto guessing why none of their enemies were showing themselves that will not last we need to move yeah agreed valerian damn it i hope my father got a message through to duke either he did or he did not said miyamoto he should be here by now but he is not so we still need to fight always the teacher eh said valerian scrambling around the edge of the cutter keeping low and making sure he didnt expose himself to the marines up top always there is more to learn countered miyamoto the man who thinks he knows everything in fact knows nothing valerian let out a laugh though there was a slightly desperate quality to it despite the precariousness of their situation and the undoubted pain of his wounds master miyamoto still found the time to dispense a bon mot there he said bending over and pointing to a hole ripped in the cutters underside we can climb in through there master miyamoto nodded glancing back toward the doorway for any signs that their attackers were moving in you go in first said miyamoto i will cover you valerian didnt argue and slung his rifle over his shoulder dropping to his belly and crawling toward the hole he jumped as he heard a blast of gunfire spinning around in time to see master miyamoto drop his rifle and sink to his knees with a gaping raw wound in his stomach his former tutors eyes were shut and his face was serene as he crumpled to the ground beside him valerian looked up and saw a marine in scarred and dented armor behind miyamoto and raised his hands entire plates had been torn from the marines combat suit and impaler impacts and shrapnel scoring covered almost every inch of the armor the marines helmet had been ripped off and blood clotted the cropped hair the hair was blonde and valerian realized that miyamotos killer was a woman in her early forties and even through the mask of blood grime and sweat he saw she was exceptionally attractive was it better to be killed by a goodlooking marine or an ugly one the thought made him smile and he giggled in her face man you are one crazy son of a bitch said the marine limping toward him with her rifle aimed unwaveringly at his chest im gonna enjoy killing you valerian wanted to reach for his rifle but knew he would be dead in a heartbeat if he so much as twitched a muscle in its direction he was dead anyway and they both knew it as she approached her eyes narrowed and she let out her own bark of laughter i dont believe it she said youre mengsks kid arent you with that face you gotta be related to him somehow hell we got ourselves a twofer i am valerian mengsk he said proudly son of emperor arcturus mengsk the first that figuresyou got that same damned arrogance valerian tensed who are you he demanded why are you doing this what do you care who i am im going to kill you is all you need to know i want to know the name of my murderer he said angelina emillian she said i recruited your old man into the marine corps and taught him all he knows so you might say im making up for that mistake now emillian brought her weapon up and said so long valerian before she could pull the trigger a blur of silver steel flashed and the rifle exploded as master miyamoto sliced his sword through the magnetic accelerator pack with the last of his strength valerian blinked away the brilliant afterimages as emillian staggered and dropped her useless weapon drawing the combat knife sheathed on her leg she leapt at him with a feral snarl of rage valerian swept up his rifle and unloaded the last of his clip into her most of his spikes flattened themselves on her breastplate but a squirting spray of blood arced from her neck and she landed next to him with a gurgling scream valerian kept his finger pressed to the trigger his breath heaving as the firing mechanism whined and the magazine clicked dry nice shot said a voice behind him and he turned his head to see his father emerge from the hole in the cullers belly thanks gasped valerian dropping the rifle and looking over to master miyamoto valerian could see the man was dead and silently thanked his tutor for saving his life his father squatted next to angelina emillian and valerian could almost read the expression on his face part anger part regret i never expected to see you again he said and valerian was amazed to realize the marine wasnt dead his impaler spikes had punctured her neck and ripped open her carotid artery she was still alive but had moments left at best i kinda wish you hadnt she gasped her words wet and gurgling you died for nothing said arcturus you know that dont you screw you mengsk replied emillian wllh a cough of blood it dont matter now anywaythe ued are going to clean your clock but good who said his father who are the ued emillian turned her head toward valerian damn i was right about you mengsk i knew if you had kids theyd be trouble angelina who are the ued demanded his father but angelina emillian was dead the inside of the cutter smelled of fuel burned meat and iron valerian coughed a few times then slammed a fresh clip of impaler spikes into his rifle the crafts keel was buckled and sections of deck plating had popped from the framework sparks crackled worryingly from broken panels and spurting cables frothed with leaking hydraulic fluid lights flickered and fizzed the electrics buzzing and spilling as the cutters batteries shorted in and out the contents of stowage lockers were spilled over the deck playing cards canteens fresh magazines and the personal effects of the marines who had accompanied his father to umoja valerian braced himself against a groaning stanchion did you get a message to duke i think so said his father looking through a tear in the cutters side you think so dont you know his father shook his head quickly checking the load on his rifle with a cassandra scrambler its hard to tell what goes in or out but i think duke heard me i certainly heard him swearing enough to make me think he knows whats going on do you think hell come i do yes edmund duke may be many things but while he believes hell benefit from his association with me hell be loyal and right now he knows im his best shot at making something of himself i hope youre right said valerian joining his father at the torn bulkhead im sure i am said his father if edmund has a grain of sense hell have been keeping his sensor suite trained on umoja since i left the command ship with any luck hell have come running as soon as he picked up the weapons discharges valerian cocked his rifle as they heard the sound of voices from outside he peered through a shrapnel hole and saw marines ten of themfully armored and loaded for bearnegotiating their way through the blasted debris that filled the chamber valerian and arcturus were on their own now and with only two gauss rifles between them valerian knew they didnt stand muchor indeed anychance of defeating their foes he decided there were worse ways to end his allotted span than to die fighting next to his father we wont stop them all said valerian arcturus grinned speak for yourself valerian nodded emboldened by his fathers attitude and shouldered his rifle the marines saw them and charged valerian and arcturus opened fire at the same time their impaler spikes hammering the nearest of their attackers the marine stumbled and fell but his armor protected him from injury valerian ducked back as a spray of spikes hammered the cutter tiny pyramids punched into the internal skin of the fuselage by their impacts his father squeezed off a burst of fire and whipped back into cover the roar of gauss fire filled the cutters interior a shrieking howl of metal slamming on metal once again valerian aimed his rifle through the ruptured hull of the cutter opening up on a redarmored marine as he clambered over the remains of one of their juryrigged barricades impaler spikes hammered the man but he shrugged off the impacts and kept coming more fire sparked off the cutters hull and valerian knew they could not hope to stop these marines where their previous attackers had come at them with fatally misplaced confidence these were taking no chances operating in pairs and covering each others advance with suppressive fire valerian slammed in a fresh magazine his last and took a deep breath this was it this was the end and what better way to go out than in a blaze of glory he looked over at his father and saw the same determination to make their ending one worthy of remembrance you ready he asked im ready replied arcturus they whipped around together rifles raised and opened fire and the landing shaft was suddenly filled with a cascade of incandescent bolts of blistering light that slammed down from above percussive explosions bloomed skyward and the cutter rocked backward as a wave of heat and pressure washed over it the tremendous impacts shook the damaged vessel so violently its keel split in two arcturus and valerian were thrown to the deck as the streaming torrent of light hammered the world beyond the interior of their refuge to oblivion al last the waterfall of molten light ceased and valerian blinked away the starbursts behind his eyes his ears rang with the concussion of the explosions but he was alive and that was something he hadnt expected his father lay across from him looking dazed but otherwise unhurt what the hell gasped valerian seeing nothing but blackened walls and complete annihilation outside arcturus laughed told you he said valerian looked up blocking the light from the open shaft was an enormous steel behemoth that floated above the landing hatch in defiance of the laws of gravity as a monstrous rippling heat haze surrounded its engines valerian covered his ears against the teethloosening rumble the insignia of a red arm holding a whip on a black background was emblazoned on either side of a cavernous docking bay and it took valerian a moment to realize he was looking at the underside of a dominion battlecruiser a voice heavily accented and with a thick drawl blared from an external loudspeaker someone order a heroic rescue said general edmund duke in the immediate aftermath of the fighting no clue could be found as to how these confederate diehards had managed to learn the particulars of the emperors visit to umoja nor could any light be shed on the identity or allegiance of the ued that angelina emillian had spoken of before her deaththough this mystery would have a bloody answer soon enough arcturus promised ailin pasteur that a full and thorough investigation would be undertaken and while no direct accusations were made it was clear the emperor suspected the umojans of a degree of complicity in the attack more dominion ships were on their way to the emperor and in response capital ships of the protectorate were en route to persuade him that it would be in his best interests to withdraw them as soon as possible the survivors of the attack gathered in ailin pasteurs cavernous dining room shaken and bloodied but glad to be alive when valerian saw his mother he raced toward her dropping his rifle and embracing her as she wept tears of joy to see him alive i thought you were dead she sobbed im a mengsk he said we dont die easy endings but first we have to bury her valerian sat in the leather armchair before the dying coal lire swirling another tawny port in his glass as his father poured himself another rich amber brandy that wasnt his usual drink of choice but hed always drunk brandy when in ailin pasteurs home and didnt see any need to change now the funeral service of juliana pasteur had been brief but dignified attended by the majority of the umojan ruling council and a few of the emperors closest advisers ailin pasteur had read his daughters eulogy and no one had been surprised when he did not ask arcturus to say anything valerian had planned to speak but when the moment came he had been unable to move such was the weight of grief pinning him lo his seat his mothers death was the most painful thing valerian had ever endured it had taken a further eighteen months after the attack on her fathers house for her to die her last breath taken a month before valerians twentyfirst birthday it had not been an easy death her last year had been spent confined to bed with only infrequent bouts of lucidity valerian had spent those months at her side holding her hand mopping her brow and reading passages from poems of the twilight stars often she forgot who he was or believed him to be her longlost love arcturus her great and glorious prince that had been hard to bear for she recalled a man who no longer existed if he ever had her last morning had been glorious the sun a brilliant bronze disc in the sky and the wind fresh off the river carrying scents of faroff provinces and the promise of undiscovered countries valerian had opened the curtains and said its wonderful out there today you should go for a run replied his mother its been so long since you went outside maybe i will he answered later she nodded and propped herself up in bed though her illness had robbed his mother of much of her former beauty the copper light from the newly risen sun bathed her in a pearlescent glow that most healthy people never mind cancer sufferers could only dream of you look beautiful today said valerian she smiled and said sit with me valerian sat in the chair next to her bed but she shook her head no on the bed he did as he was bid and she slipped her arms around him pulling him to her as she had done so many times when he was a little boy she stroked his golden hair and kissed his forehead my dear boy she said you are everything i wished for do you remember that day beside the river before the attack on your grandfathers house yeah i remember what about it do you remember what i said to you there i do he said wary as to where this conversation was going youve been so good to me since then honey but its time for you to live your own life now you cant be tied to me anymore what do you mean i mean that its time for you to be your own man now val said his mother urgently and he could hear her heartbeat flutter like a caged bird in her chest you tried so hard to make me better and fought against something that cant be fought but its time to let go no he said tears gathering in his eyes as he held her tightly you have to said juliana acceptance is the only way you can defeat death my beautiful boy ive made peace with it and now you have to as well tell me you understand valerian closed his eyes unwilling to say the words but knowing that she was right for had fought against the inevitable for so long that he had forgotten there was nothing he could do to prevent it his mother was dying and part of him would die with her but so long as he lived part of her would live on that was her legacy to him her goodness and her compassion had always been part of his character her life and beauty and vitality part of his soul but so too was his fathers ruthlessness and determination to succeed at any cost those qualities passed on by his parents had blended within him to make him who he was and only now did he understand what that meant he was neither his mother nor his father he was valerian mengsk with all the qualities and faults such a state of being entailed the things he had inherited and learned from both of them would forever guide his steps but the final choice of where his life would lead was down to him i understand he said and he knew she felt the truth of his words i know you do my dear you make me so proud i love you he said as tears streamed freely down his face i love you too valerian said his mother those had been the final words she said to him her heart finally giving out as she held him on that last glorious morning on umoja valerian had stood and folded her arms in her lap smiling at the serenity he saw in her the lines of care worry and pain erased from her face in death she was at peace and she was beautiful his father had come to umoja a week later and they had circled one another like the largest wolves in a pack each gauging the others strength as mourners arrived for the funeral now with the burial concluded and the guests sipping expensive wine and eating canapes father and son retired to valerians study your grandfather spoke well said his father pouring a glass of brandy and taking the seat opposite valerian it was a moving eulogy yes but youd expect that said valerian his voice hollow and empty what with him being a politician i suppose so agreed arcturus so said valerian when his father lapsed into silence you were going to tell me of korhal of your father and my mother yes mused arcturus swilling brandy around his glass are you sitting comfortably his father then went on to speak for several hours telling him of his youth on korhal his time with the confederate marine corps and what had transpired between him and juliana valerian had been surprised by his fathers candor but soon realized that arcturus mengsk had no need to lie to anyone anymore his father had done most of the talking but as the tale had caught up to the present valerian had spoken injecting his fathers story with his own memories at the conclusion of the narrative both men lapsed into silence it was a silence that wasnt uncomfortable simply a space between two men who had not yet decided what to say to one another valerian broke the silence first i wont be like you he said im not asking you to be like me said his father taking a mouthful of brandy i never wanted that i just wanted you to be someone i could be proud of and are you proud of me his father considered the question for a moment before answering yes i am proud of you you are intelligent and have courage two qualities that will get you far in this galaxy but you have more than that valerian you have greatness within you just as i do and everything we have talked about today only reaffirms my belief that we mengsks are made for greater things than the common herd can expect of their lives i am my own man father and ill not live my life in your shadow his father chuckled nor do i expect you to ah valerian so many of the things you say remind me of the arguments i had with my father all those years ago arcturus stood and drained the last of his brandy sometimes i think were doomed to repeat the mistakes of our fathers throughout eternity i wont make the same mistakes you made promised valerian no im sure you wont agreed arcturus youll make new ones thats not very reassuring it wasnt meant to be son said arcturus now come on pull yourself together we have an empire to build
