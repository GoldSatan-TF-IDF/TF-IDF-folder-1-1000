bertrice small beloved prologue the night was black and hot not a hint of a breeze stirred the fronds of the tall stately date palms the onyx sky was studded diamondbright with stars and all was very very still as if the earth itself was poised waiting on the edge of the great oasis city of palmyra the house of the famous bedawi warrior chief zabaai ben selim stood alone within a woman labored to bring forth her child her slim white body was tense with the agony of her travail wet with the perspiration of her effort and the intolerable summer weather she bore her travail grimly refusing to cry out for to do so was a weakness of character in her mind and she had not won zabaai by weakness in her semidelirium she remembered the day she had first seen him he had been visiting her fathers house in alexandria on business and had by mistake wandered into the womens garden their glances had met and her lovely grayblue eyes had widened at his fierce black gaze her soft pink lips slightly parted with surprise and her young breasts heaving with emotions she had not known existed aroused him no word passed between them he had not even asked her her name instead he had found his way out of the garden sought out her father and asked for her to wife it had been a great impertinence on his part for her father was not only one of the wealthiest men in alexandria he was also a direct descendant of egypts last great queen cleopatra simon titus gave his daughter her personal freedom in the roman manner what did she want he had asked she had wanted zabaai ben selim that hawkvisaged desert man with his piercing black eyes who in the space of one single moment had captured her soul with his own it mattered not to her that he was twentytwo years her senior or that he had another legal wife and several concubines it mattered not that any child she gave him would be unimportant in the line of inheritance nothing mattered but her love for this marvelous man and so simon titus had reluctantly given his consent they had been married within the month and then she had left the elegant comfort of her fathers alexandrian house to live a life that found her wandering half the year across the syrian deserts and living the other half in the beautiful city of palmyra it was the custom of the bedawi to spend the broiling summers in palmyra and so part of her dowry had been a fine house and gardens on the citys edge a terrible pain far worse than any previous ripped through her and she bit down on her lip it would soon be over and her child would at last be born zabaais eldest wife tamar told her to bear down and she did push iris push push tamar encouraged her aiiiiii came the collective cry of the other women as the infant began to appear between its mothers legs push i am iris snapped irritably at the older woman then push harder tamar had no mercy the child is but half born iris you must push again gritting her teeth iris pushed down fiercely and suddenly felt something wet and warm sliding from her body emptying her out and miraculously the pain began to subside tamar caught the child and holding her up announced it is a female she then handed the baby to another woman and pushed iris back onto the birthing stool you must yet bear the afterbirth only then will you be done one more push will do it i want to see my daughter let rebecca clean the birthing blood from her first as always you are too impatient tamar scolded but she understood how it was the firstnay every time within minutes iris was sponged with cooling rose water and dressed in a simple white gauze night robe the baby girl who had wailed lustily after her birth was now neatly swaddled and placed in her mothers arms tamar looked to one of the other women and commanded sharply fetch my lord zabaai as chief wife she was obeyed and looked upon with fear and respect it was her son akbar who would one day rule the tribe looking down on iris tamar thought it was no wonder that zabaai loved her she was so very beautiful with her milky skin ashblond hair and bluegray eyes she was so very different from the rest of them a woman zabaai could not only love but converse with he entered the room a man of medium height and strong build his dark eyes sparkling his dark hair and beard untouched by silver despite his fortythree winters his handsome face was sharply sculptural with its high cheekbones and hawklike nose his lips were full and sensuous his entry brought all the women but tamar and iris to their knees he looked at his two wives and his black eyes softened he loved them both tamar the wife of his youth and iris the wife of his old age the other women might give him variety and occasional pleasure but these two he prized the gods have blessed you with a daughter my lord tamar said a daughter he was surprised yes my lord a daughter the kneeling women glanced slyly at each other and the uncharitable and the jealous among them were hard put not to voice their glee they were the mothers of sons and the best the alexandrian bitch could do was a mere daughter they watched expectantly for their lords righteous wrath wondering if he would deny the brat and order it exposed instead a smile split his face and he chuckled with delight iris iris he said his deep voice warm with approval once again you have done the unexpected and you have given me the one thing which until now i have lacked a daughter thank you my beautiful wife thank you the kneeling women were aghast praised for having a daughter all men wanted sons the more the better and zabaai had never been an exception he was proud of his thirtyfive sons even remembering all their names and ages but the more perceptive among the women understood it was the great love he felt for iris that would excuse almost any fault they sighed with resignation iris laughed and her laughter was soft and filled with mischievous glee have i ever done the expected my lord she asked his black eyes laughed back at her glancing at the other women zabaai said curtly leave us not tamar my lord iris would not offend tamar who had always been kind to her she did not forget that if zabaai died tamars eldest son akbar would hold her fate and her daughters in his hands zabaai bent to look at his new daughter used to large boy babies he was somewhat awed by the delicate girl child he had sired the infant slept dainty dark lashes fluttering slightly against the palegold skin her dark hair was a small tuft of down upon a wellshaped head despite her slumber her tiny hands moved with a fluttery restlessness the slender fingers fascinating him with their translucent miniature nails he regarded her almost warily for although he knew what one could do with a son he was not quite sure what one did with a daughter and this child of all his children was the one born out of the great love he felt for its mother looking up he observed she is very small both iris and tamar laughed girls tamar said are usually tinier at birth my lord oh he felt a trifle foolish but then it was his first daughter where is the chaldean he demanded suddenly remembering here lord from a dark corner of the room a hunched shape emerged as it came forward it became an elderly man with sharp eyes and a long snow white beard dressed in dark flowing robes upon which were sewn a pattern of silverthread stars and moons the old man bowed low and iris held her breath waiting for the slightly askew turban to tumble off his head into her lap it didnt did you mark the exact moment of this childs birth in the skies chaldean i did my lord zabaai at the very moment your daughter slipped from her mothers womb the heavenly bodies of venus and mars met in conjunction never have i seen the signs so propitious it portends great things for her what great things chaldean the full natal chart will reveal all my lord but i can tell you now that your daughter will be successful in both love and war for she is already i can see beloved of the gods zabaai nodded satisfied the chaldean was the most respected astrologer in the east noted not only for his accuracy but his honesty as well as the old man backed out of the room zabaai looked upon his young wife with great affection how shall i reward you my little love for this marvelous child he said let me name her my lord iris replied very well he agreed pleased another woman would have asked him for jewels tamar could not contain her curiosity what will you call her zenobia came the answer she who was given life by jupiter zenobia zabaai mused it is a good name you must rest now tamar said taking the infant from iris let your bab look after zenobia while you sleep iris nodded beginning to feel sleepy now that the immediate excitement of the birth was over zabaai arose bending a moment to kiss his young wife and then he and tamar left the room alone iris sighed and stretched herself gingerly to find a more comfortable position how beautiful the baby was tomorrow she would have a lamb sacrificed in the temple of jupiter to give thanks for her daughter she wondered about the chaldeans predictions not completely understanding them then as sleep began to overtake her her anxieties faded what did it all really matter as long as zenobia was blessed and protected may you be favored by the gods all your life my daughter iris murmured softly and then she fell asleep part one the girl happy birthday zenobia zenobia bat zabaai now six smiled happily back at her family she was a lovely child tall for her age with long unruly dark hair that her mother had coaxed into ringlets for this auspicious occasion and shining silvergray eyes her simply draped white tunic with its pale blue silk rope belt set off her light golden skin zabaai ben selim swept his only daughter up into his arms and gave her a resounding kiss dont you want to know what your presents are my precious one zenobia giggled and looked mischievously at her adored father of course i do papa but mama said i must not ask until they were offered zabaai ben selim was unable to contain himself any longer ali he roared bring in my daughters birthday gift into the open courtyard of the house came her fathers favorite slave leading a dainty prancing stormgray mare bridled in red leather with tinkling brass bells and wearing a small matching saddle zenobia was speechless with surprise and delight more than anything she had wanted a fine arab horse for her very own she had spent the last six months hinting at it none too gently to her father oh papa she finally whispered then you like her zabaai ben selim teased his beloved only daughter oh yes yes papa yes zabaai you did not tell me iris looked worried a horse she is far too little do not worry my love the mare has been bred for docility i promise you tamar put a gentle hand on iriss shoulder and said in a low voice dont overprotect her iris you will do her no favor if you do bedawi women are bred to be independent i want to ride her now zenobia cried and zabaai lifted his daughter up onto the mares back she sat proudly as if she had been born to sit there come on akbar ill race you zenobia challenged her fathers heir i must get to my horse he protested amused well hurry she fussed at him and was quickly off through the courtyard door in the year in which she was eleven zenobia decided she would not go on the winter trek with her family palmyra had suddenly become a fascinating place to her how she loved the city with its beautiful covered and colonnaded streets great temples and broad marble avenues its wonderful shops and openair markets each with a different and distinct smell leather tanning perfumes being blended wet wool being readied for weaving and dyeing the silkdyeing vats the livestock the spices exotic foods of all kinds she simply couldnt bear to leave it again with stubborn resolve she had secreted herself when no one was looking and now she hugged herself gleefully convinced she would not be found zenobia tamars voice echoed sharply through the virtually empty house zenobia where are you child come now you cannot hide from us any longer the trek has already begun zenobia you are being foolish iriss voice was becoming tinged with annoyance come to us at once under the great bed in her fathers bedchamber the child crouched chuckling softly she would not spend the winter in the damned desert again this year the gods only knew she hated it miles and miles and miles of endless sand long boring days of blue skies cloudless and as placid as pap she sniffed with distaste then there were the goats while her very best friend julia tuilio got to spend the whole delicious winter season in palmyra going to the theater and to the games she zenobia bat zabaai spent her winters herding a flock of dumb smelly goats it was embarrassing the bedawi measured a mans wealth in the livestock he owned which made zenobias father an extremely wealthy man but how she hated chasing those silly temperamental goats all winter only nights in the desert were interesting she loved it when the skies grew dark and filled with crystalline stars some so bright and so large that they seemed almost touchable her father had taught her to read the stars and she believed that as long as she could see them she would be able to find her way back to palmyra from hades itself ha zenobia there you are tamar reached beneath the bed and pulled her out with strong fingers no zenobia shouted furiously struggling will not go i hate the months away from palmyra i hate the desert dont be foolish tamar replied patiently you are bedawi and the desert is our way come along now zenobia theres my good girl tamar raised her up the child pulled defiantly away from the older woman her strangely adult eyes flashing i am only half bedawi and even that half does not like the desert tamar had to laugh for it was the truth and she could not really blame zenobia she was young and the city was exciting as iris joined them zenobia flung herself at her pretty parent i dont want to go mama why can we not just stay here the two of us papa will not mind the theater season is just beginning and julia says that a wonderful troupe of dancers and actors from rome will be performing here this winter our place is with your father zenobia iris never raised her soft voice but there was no arguing with her tone she stroked her only childs sleek dark head what a beauty the little one was turning out to be and how much she loved her could i not stay with julia her mama says it would be all right you dont need me to herd the goats zenobia made one last desperate try no zenobia came the firm and quiet reply but a tiny smile twitched at the comers of iriss mouth poor zenobia she thought she knew just how her daughter felt but she would say nothing for she knew sympathy only encouraged rebellion iris too disliked the desert but never in all the years she had been zabaais wife had she ever admitted it aloud it was part of her husbands heritage and when she had married him she had accepted it she held out her hand to her daughter come now my dearest let us go without further ado the others are already several miles ahead of us and you know how i dislike galloping a camel it makes me sick if i must do it for too long come along yes mama zenobia sighed defeated the three had turned to go when they heard strange footsteps on the stairs outside the bedchamber door tamar stiffened sensing danger then pulling zenobia from her mother she pushed the girl down and back under the bed with its bright red satin hangings stay there she hissed urgently and whatever happens do not come out until i tell you do you understand do not come out until i call you the door to the bedchamber was flung open before zenobia could protest she could not see from her hiding place that the room had suddenly been invaded by a small party of roman soldiers tamar quickly stepped forward saying good morning centurion how may i help you the centurion eyed her boldly thinking as he did so that she was a fine figure of a woman with her big pillowy tits and that she looked clean and diseasefree whose house is this he demanded tamar recognized his look she prayed she could stay calm this is the house of zabaai ben selim warrior chief of the bedawi centurion allow me to introduce myself i am tamar bat hammid senior wife to zabaai ben selim this other lady is my lords second wife iris bat simon why are you alone where are the servants the centurions tone was arrogant i can see that you are new to palmyra centurion the bedawi spend but half the year in palmyra the other half we spend in the desert my husband left but a few minutes ago iris and i were checking to be sure that everything was secure one cannot trust the slaves to see to it she paused a moment hoping he would be satisfied and let them go seeing his intent still unchanged she decided to attack may i ask why you have entered this house centurion it is not the policy of the roman army to enter private houses within a friendly city my husband is a wellrespected citizen of this city honored by all who know him he holds roman citizenship centurion and is personally acquainted with the governor i would also tell you that zabaai ben selim is cousin to this citys ruler prince odenathus he did not look at her directly when he said the gates were wide open as we rode by and since we saw that the house appeared to be deserted we came to check that robbers were not stripping the property of a roman citizen he was lying and both of them knew it the gates had been firmly locked behind zabaai when he had left tamar was afraid but she knew that to show fear would encourage these men in whatever mischief they were planning as always she said her voice heavy with sincerity the romans are the keepers of the peace i shall tell my lord zabaai of your concern centurion he will be well pleased she turned to iris who stood nervously behind her come iris we must hurry to meet our lord zabaai our camels are in the stable centurion would one of your men be kind enough to fetch them for us how do i know that you are who you say you are the centurion said you might be thieves for all i know and then i should be in trouble with my commanding officer the ring of men was closing in about them my lord zabaai his wives and his entire family are well known to the roman governor of this city tamar repeated threateningly she was very afraid now these she realized were not regular legionnaires these were auxiliaries barbarians recruited from gallic and germanic tribes noted for being pitiless without mercy or respect for anythingincluding women i am sure that you are both well known in the city the centurion said insinuatingly and the men with him laughed their eyes hot his gaze bold and cruel he reached out and pushed tamar aside i want a better look at you he said to iris pulling her forward at first she looked at him unflinchingly her bluegray eyes scornful but her heart was thumping violently against her ribs she felt as if she were staring death in the face the centurion let his hand caress her ashblond hair almost lingeringly slowly the hand wandered downward over her body fondling her breasts centurion she said in a quiet strained voice not only am i wife to zabaai ben selim but i am the only daughter of the great banker simon titus of alexandria do not allow a simple rudeness to escalate into a serious crime you lie he said pleasantly you are a whore of palmyra centurion do not do this thing iris said her voice now trembling do you not have a wife or a sister would you like it if someone did this thing to them he looked at her dispassionately and she saw no pity or mercy in his iceblue eyes it has been a long time since i have had a fair woman he said and then he pushed her back onto the bed her instinct for survival made her attempt to rise but he shoved her back brutally and iriss control left her she screamed totally terrified the centurion slapped her viciously with one hand while ripping her gown and pushing it up to her belly with the other his knee jammed between her resisting thighs while she fought him clawing at his face with her nails maddened with fear already ashamed of what was happening to her she had known no man but her loving gentle husband she had known nothing but tenderness and kindness at his hands iris had never imagined that a man could do this to a woman even knowing it was useless she continued to fight him because something deep within her refused to accept this horror and the centurion in his fury at being thwarted continued to strike her into submission both her eyes were almost swollen shut when she felt him gain the advantage and thrust with a cruel burning pain into her resisting body her reason finally left her as he pounded against her again and again conscious only of his own pleasure in subduing the woman by the gods he grunted this is the best piece of cunt ive fucked in months beneath the bed hidden by the coverings the child zenobia squeezed her eyes tightly shut she was terrified by the strange sounds above trembling and confused at hearing her mother begging in such a frightened voice then her mother screamed and she could no longer hear womens voices only mens rough laughter and words she didnt comprehend iris never heard them she never knew that she was mounted by not only the centurion but half a dozen other men who patiently waited their turn to violate her now still body in the end the centurion raped her a second time cursing when he came too quickly in his pique he cut her throat as one would butcher a helpless lamb swiftly bloodlessly tamar pulled down onto her back on the cool tile floor her garments yanked over her head fared little better than iris but tamar knew enough not to fight back they left her still body for dead when the last man had finished sodomizing her not even bothering to use the knife on her she lay barely breathing while the soldiers stripped the room of the few things left in it for most of its furnishings had gone with zabaai ben selim as they always did terrified she held her breath when they ripped the hangings from the bed along with its coverlets she prayed to every god she could think of that in their greedy and lustful haste they would not see the child zenobia those fervent prayers were answered her eyes met the terrified ones of the girl and they warned iriss daughter not to move to be as silent as the tomb it seemed like an eternity that she lay there upon her stomach on the cool tiles her violated body aching unbearably she dared not even groan for fear they would realize that she was alive finally after searching through every room for valuables the soldiers left the house of zabaai ben selim she heard their horses clattering noisily in the courtyard and wondered why she had not heard them before probably because they had led the animals in quietly so as not to surprise anyone left in the house at least she now knew that they were cavalry and that would narrow her husbands search for the guilty ones certain that they were now alone she moaned with pain and tried to sit up zenobia scrambled from beneath the bed her young face wet with tears as she helped tamar the child was pale and still shaking she carefully avoided looking at the bed is my mother dead tamar nodded dont look child why tamar why did they do it you told them who you were why did they hurt you why did they kill my mother tamar spat out a broken tooth you cannot tell the romans anything she said contemptuously finally managing to sit up with zenobias aid her back against the bed suddenly embarrassed by her disarray she pulled down the skirts of her dalmatica which were now ripped torn and stained by the soldiers leavings i do not believe that they stole the camels child go to the stables get one and ride like the wind to your father tell him what has happened i cannot go zenobia i must wait here it is my fault said zenobia tears welling up in her silvery eyes my mother is dead if i had not been such a child if i had been ready to leave when everyone else was ready instead of hiding like a brat she began to weep piteously tamar sighed deeply she ached in every joint and she wanted to scream at zenobia that it was indeed her fault for delaying them so that the soldiers caught them unprotected then she looked at the childs face woebegone at the loss of her mother no child she said firmly suddenly even believing it you must not blame yourself it was fate the will of the gods go now and fetch your father will you be all right zenobia sniffed anxiously bring me a pitcher of water and i will survive then you must go but be careful i will leave by the back gate zenobia promised tamar nodded wearily she suddenly felt very tired and very very old she would survive if only to see those who had done this to her and so wantonly murdered iris punished she sat in the midday heat after zenobia left her watching almost dispassionately as two large horseflies buzzed about iriss brutalized body zenobia left the house going by way of the kitchen garden to the stables where three impatient and cranky camels waited chewing their cuds she felt nothing neither grief nor anger nor fear she was numb with shock remembering her mothers pleas for mercy never had zenobia heard iriss voice as it had sounded this daybegging and terrified the echo of it still rang in her ears and she believed it would haunt her for the rest of her life absently she patted her own camel an unusually mildtempered blond beast mounting it she guided the animal through the back gate of her fathers house after leaning down to unlatch the lock and out onto the desert road the camel moved swiftly taking bigger and bigger strides until it seemed to be flying just above the road zenobia sat atop its back and firmly settled into the red leather saddle her white linen chiton pulled up to leave her golden legs free to manipulate her mount her agile mind racing why had the men hurt her mother she did not really understand at all for she had never known anything but kindness and indulgence from the men in her life her father and all of her older brothers spoiled her terribly as did their close friends she knew that men sometimes beat their wives for she was not entirely sheltered but that was within the realm of the respectable everyone said that a woman needed correction occasionally still she had never seen her father beat his wives and her mother did not even know the men who had attacked her if iris did not know them then why were they angry with her and why did they hurt her kill her she simply could not understand was brutality then a trait particular to the romans alone was it some peculiar form of madness that afflicted them that made them turn on innocent strangers she goaded the camel to greater speed with her little heels for ahead she could see the dust of her fathers caravan soon she was passing the groups of families who made up their tribe all waved and called out to her in greeting as her camel galloped by them their smiles were indulgent for she was a great favorite with everyone in the tribe and not simply because she was their leaders daughter zenobia bat zabaai had always been a merry kindly child at the head of the group she could see her father and her eldest brother akbar she began to wave at them to call out frantically her young voice sounding hollow in her ears hola little one akbar called in a teasing voice want to race that fleabitten old nag against my champion then he saw her pinched and pale little face and turning to his father cried out father something is wrong the entire caravan was stopped and dismounting his own camel zabaai lifted his young daughter down from hers a crowd began to gather about them what is it my flower the chief of the bedawi asked where are your mother and tamar the romans zenobia began the romans came and mother is dead and tamar is grievously hurt what what is it you say zenobia the romans are our friends the romans have killed my mother she screamed at him her control finally gone the hot tears beginning to pour in dirty runnels down her small face tamar hid me beneath the bed i could not see them but i could hear them they did something to my mother that made her scream and cry and beg them for mercy never heard my mother beg i never heard my mother beg but they made her beg and then they killed her tamar is so fearfully hurt she cannot even rise from the floor you must come home father you must come home zabaai ben selim felt his legs go weak beneath him he knew what had been done to his wives even if his innocent young daughter did not his only question was why with a howl of outrage pain and grief he began to tear at his beard and his clothes then when the first onslaught of his anguish passed he began to give orders and the caravan was quickly turned about however zabaai ben selim his elder sons and his daughter did not wait for the others remounting their camels they quickly rode back along the desert road to the outskirts of palmyra where his house stood in the bright midday sun they rode so hard that the following caravan met their dust which still hovered in the air turning it yellow in the heat tamar was but halfconscious when they arrived and now zenobia finally dared to look upon her mothers violated body gasping with horrified shock at what she saw iriss body was sprawled grotesquely upon the bed her paleblue dalmatic and her snowy interior tunic ripped away to expose her lovely breasts which were bruised and bleeding there were great purple blotches on the insides of her milkwhite thighs her beautiful sweet face with the grayblue eyes blackened and tightly shut in death the tender red mouth viciously savaged and bitten was barely recognizable those who had known her would have been horrified to see how battered her beauty was now mama it was a cry torn from deep within zenobia she stared in sorrow at her mothers murdered body unable to fully comprehend now that she had looked unwilling to believe that iris was really dead take the child out zabaai commanded tersely to no one in particular she should not have seen this take her away no zenobia whirled to defy her father but she was shaking with shock and grief i had to see and now i will never forget i will remember what the romans did akbar didnt even argue with his small sister he picked her up with a strong arm and carried her weeping from the room she nestled deeply into his arms as if trying to escape the truth and her bitter sobs tore at his own heart wearily he sat down on the stairs leading to the lower level of the house and rocked his little halfsister iris had been several years younger than he was when his father had brought her back from egypt those long years ago he had imagined himself in love with her for a brief time he suspected that she had known but she had never embarrassed him or played the flirt she had treated him with respect a tight sob escaped his own throat zenobias voice shattered his memories why did they kill her akbar why she was looking up at him now her little heartshaped face dirty and wet with her tears they killed her because they are roman pigs he said angrily everyone not born a roman they call a barbarian but it is they who are the real barbarians they say that rome was founded by two orphan brothers left on a hillside to die but rescued and suckled by a shewolf i believe it they are wild animals to this day what did they do to my mother akbar she asked fearfully he hesitated not sure he should answer her she was yet a child she could even be his own daughter he had a boy her age he wasnt sure how much she knew of men and women still he knew from past experience zenobia would not be put off do you know little flower how a child is conceived yes she said softly mother had been telling me of these things for she said that i would one day be a woman in my own body when a man makes love to his woman a child is the natural result of their union it is good my mother said that is correct he answered her he did not elaborate she understood enough that he might explain and so he said the romans forced your mother to make love with them zenobia when a woman is forced it is called rape the romans raped your mother dishonoring her dishonoring our father our family and the bedawi when they had finished with her they then cut her throat so there would be no witnesses against them my mother they assumed dead without the knife zenobia was silent a moment and men she said was tamar raped too yes he said in a tight voice my mother was also raped is that why she hid me akbar zenobia asked she did not want me to be raped had you been raped my sister the dishonor would have been the worst of all for you are a maiden and have never known a man part of your value to your future bridegroom will be in your virginity a man marrying a maiden does not like to travel a road already well traveled by others akbar said solemnly she became silent again and snuggled deeper into his lap she understood now why her mother had cried and begged the romans she had been attempting to save her virtue and her husbands honor what awful beasts the romans were zenobia wanted vengeance from her fathers bedchamber came the sound of wailing the other members of the tribe had arrived and the women going into the room sobbed with sadness sympathy and shame zabaai ben selim came out from his room and said curtly to his eldest son bring zenobia to her own chamber akbar i would question her akbar arose and carried his sister to her room in the womans part of the house setting her down upon her bed he patted her reassuringly and gave her a small smile zabaais own face was grim and forbidding he looked sternly at his young daughter i have heard tamars tale now i want to hear it from your lips she gulped and then told him the story from her childs viewpoint blaming herself for causing me two women to be delayed he said nothing whatever anger he felt toward his young daughter melted in the face of their shared grief the romans would pay oh yes they would pay a dozen of his sons had already been dispatched into the city with orders to bring the roman governor back to him along with palmyras young ruler prince odenathus only when they saw the horror done his wives would he remove iriss body from his bedchamber and bury it with the honor it deserved his arm went tenderly around zenobia and hugged her you are not responsible my child rest now and i will send bab to you i regret that you must tell your story a final time to the governor zabaai left the room his anger now beginning to surface over the shock and the sadness he had been a citizen of palmyra for his entire life he also held roman citizenship as did all palmyrans it was incredible that imperial soldiers were allowed to get out of hand in a peaceful and nonhostile client city suddenly he wanted to be alone so that he might grieve but it was not yet time for that first he must beard the romans and demand his rightful vengeance returning to the dressing room off his bedchamber he washed the desert dust from his face and changed robes the slaves removed the basin of rose water that they had brought him then they perfumed and combed his beard he was yet a fine figure of a man of medium height with his full darkblack beard just beginning to be sprinkled with silver only his dark eyes dull with their pain betrayed his feelings his son entered the room they are here father zabaai nodded and went out to greet his guests peace be with you my lord prince and you also antonius porcius you are welcome in my house though it be a house of sorrow peace be with you also my cousin the prince replied but before he might say more the roman governor spoke irritably what is this urgency he demanded his manners gone in the face of his annoyance and the heat headache that pounded in his temples i am pulled from my couch by these bearded ruffian sons of yours zabaai ben selim and forced to come along without explanation i remind you chief of the bedawi that i am the emperors governor in palmyra and as such i am to be treated with respect it is in that very capacity antonius porcius that i have summoned you here you you have summoned me antonius porciuss voice was an outraged squeak his small double chin quivered angrily yes came the thunderous reply zabaai ben selim ruler of the bedawi have summoned you you would do well to listen carefully my lord governor to what i am about to tell you this morning my people and i departed palmyra for our annual winter trek into the desert as you well know we leave this time each year during the rainy season in the desert to graze our herds outside palmyras boundaries two of my wives were forced to remain behind for my only daughter zenobia dislikes this winter wandering and with a childs logic believed if she hid we would have to leave her in palmyra of course her mother and tamar found her as the women made to leave they heard unfamiliar footsteps on the stairs leading to my bedchamber and with incredible foresight tamar hid my little daughter beneath a bed praise the gods that she did roman soldiers had broken into my house antonius porcius led by their centurion they attacked my two wives raping them leaving tamar for dead cutting my poor iriss throat all the while hidden beneath the bed my poor little girl cowered terrified those men were roman auxiliaries antonius porcius auxiliaries of the alae it should not be hard for you to track them down i want them punished i will accept nothing less than thendeaths imperial governor nothing less prince odenathus looked distressed at his elder cousins words your lovely iris dead zabaai what can i say to you how can i comfort you for such a loss then in a sympathetic gesture he tore his robe what of the child your daughter zenobia she was untouched yes the gods be praised the soldiers did not suspect that my innocent little daughter was also within the room had they found my precious child i have no doubt whatsoever that she too would have been viciously attacked what kind of men are you allowing into the legions these days antonius porcius palmyra is not a newly captured city where romans may rape and loot at will we are a client kingdom whose citizens are proud to possess roman citizenship antonius porcius a man in his early middle years was shocked by what zabaai ben selim had told him he was a fair man who loved palmyraindeed had lived in it most of his adult life still he was romes governor and he had to be sure that the bedawi spoke the truth how do i know what you say is true zabaai ben selim where are these women you say were attacked can they identify their attackers come with me zabaai led the way into his bedchamber where iriss battered body still lay amid the tangle of her shredded clothing tamar in shock still sat on the floor her back against the bed her eyes staring vacantly the smell of blood in the hot closedup room was now quite apparent and the flies buzzed noisily about the dead body the roman governor a small plump man looked upon iris with open horror he had met her on several occasions and remembered her as beautiful and gracious the bile rose in his throat and he gagged it back uncomfortably ashamed of his entire sex in the face of this tragedy your evidence is irrefutable he said sadly rome is not at war with palmyra and her loyal citizens we are the keepers of the peace the men involved in this terrible incident will be found immediately tried and punished as quickly as possible today came the harsh reply the sun must not go down upon those criminals unpunished the soul of my sweet iris cries out for justice antonius porcius be reasonable zabaai ben selim pleaded antonius porcius am being reasonablethundered the bedawi chieftain i have not sent my men into the city to cut the throats of every roman soldier they happen upon that is being reasonable my lord governor suddenly tamars eyes refocused and she spoke i can identify the centurion involved and his men my lord governor i shall never forget his hellish eyes for they were like blue glass there was no feeling in them at all none they were blank he had eight men with him and their faces will haunt my dreams forever i shall never forget antonius porcius turned away embarrassed he was often a pompous man but he was also a good man the evidence before his shocked eyes was sickening my lady tamar he said gently turning back to the woman on the floor you say that the men were auxiliaries and of the alae how do you know this they were quite tall tamar said and very fair with yellow hair eyes as blue as the skies above and skin where it was not brown from the sun as white as marble they spoke in guttural accents as if latin were not familiar or easy for them and they went upon horses my lord governor their clothing was the clothing of the legions i am not mistaken nor am i confused by my ordeal i remember i will always remember he nodded and then asked once more in a gentle tone you are quite sure that they understood fully who you were both iris and i explained carefully slowly several times they were bent on mischief my lord governor the centurion said iris lied that she was aa fearfully tamar glanced toward her husband a what demanded zabaai ben selim a whore of palmyra tamar whispered zabaai ben selim howled his outrage at her words antonius porcius shuddered i must ask you this my lady tamar he said apologetically with a glance of worry toward zabaai ben selim who killed the lady iris do you know or can you remember beginning to shake with the shock once more tamar said iris was taken by the centurion twice it was he who killed her after he had finished the second time i pretended to have expired from their attacks and so they left me for dead what could the child see the governor asked she saw nothing praise the gods tamar replied however she heard everything the bed coverlets hid her from their lusting eyes i shall always remember the confused look in little zenobias eyes those eyes asked a thousand questions i could not answer what will this have done to her antonius porcius she has never known anything but kindness from this world the governor turned to zabaai ben selim can the lady tamar be made ready to travel i will have the entire garrison assembled before the city walls it will not be hard to find the guilty ones with such a witness only one of the auxiliary legions is from gaul the other one comes from africa and its men are as black as ebony i want the centurion zabaai said quietly do what you will with his men but i want the centurion antonius porcius agreed quickly saying only if you punish and execute him before the entire garrison i want a severe lesson made of him so this will never happen again we are better off without such scum i agree zabaai ben selim replied i will accompany the governor back into the city my good cousin the young prince said will two hours be sufficient time for you to prepare the lady tamar for her journey to justice before zabaai ben selim might reply tamar said in a suddenly firm voice i will be ready my lord prince if i live but one moment past the time i testify against those beasts it will be enough prince odenathus embraced his cousin then he and the roman governor left the room in the upper hallway they saw the child zenobia who had come from tier room her mothers servant bab trailing behind her odenathus stopped greeting her in a kindly voice do you remember me my small cousin she stopped and he was suddenly struck by her beauty she was but eleven he knew but already she showed promise of becoming an incredibly beautiful woman in a city famed for its beautiful women she had grown tall since he had last seen her some two years ago but her body was still the flat and rangy one of a child her long hair loose and free of any ribboned restraint was as black as a clear night sky odenathus reached out and stroked her head as he might his favorite hunting saluki slipping his hand down to raise up her oval heart of a face her hair was soft as was her palegold skin her eyes were incredible almondshaped with long thick black lashes they were the dark gray of a thundercloud yet within their depths he could see golden fires banked now by her grief she had a straight little nose and such a lovely mouth that he had to restrain himself from bending down to kiss her lips reminding himself sternly that she was yet a child still he thought regretfully she was a very tempting nymph of a creature i remember you my lord prince zenobia replied softly i am sorry zenobia he said helplessly it was then that the silvery thundercloud eyes flashed why do you tolerate the roman pigs within palmyra she burst out angrily at him the romans are our friends now as they have ever been my flower this has been an unfortunate incident he said smoothly aware of his companion the imperial governor friends do not rape and murder innocent women she said scornfully you have become one of them my lord prince a mincing and perfumed fop of a roman hate them i hate them and i hate you also for allowing them to put a yoke about our necks he could see her eyes were now filled to overflowing with shining tears but before he could say another word she turned away fromhim and ran followed by her grumbling servant woman poor little girl prince odenathus said sadly she was her mothers only child and they were very close antonius porcius i can see how terribly she has been affected by this horrendous crime the roman governor looked after the fleeing child yes he said rome had a bad habit he thought of making enemies once the prince and the governor had returned to the city antonius porcius called immediately into his presence the twelve officers who were attached to the two legions at his command he carefully explained the situation to them and then asked will the officers of the auxiliary legions stand by us in this matter i guarantee my africans said the tribune of the ninth legion they detest the gauls his fellow officers nodded in agreement i can see no reason why my gauls should not see the justice in your punishment antonius porcius said the tribune of the sixth legion somewhat stiffly assemble the entire garrison then the governor commanded two roman legions or twelve thousand foot soldiers plus two hundred forty cavalarymen and two full auxiliary units equal in size to the legions assembled themselves outside palmyras main gate such a mighty gathering could not help but attract the curious as word of the soldiers movement flew throughout the city the citizenry hurried outside the gates to see what was happening on a raised and awninged dais in the hot lateafternoon sun sat the roman governor antonius porcius resplendent in his purplebordered white robes with a wreath of silvergilt laurel leaves upon his balding head he waited with palmyras princely ruler odenathus septimius a young man of twentytwo years the prince set more than one woman in the crowd to dreaming he was tall with wellformed and muscled arms and legs bronzed by the sun the short skirt of his white tunic was embroidered in gold his midnightblack hair was curly his large eyes velvetbrown his mouth was wide and sensuous his cheekbones high his jaw firm he was an intelligent and educated man who played a waiting game with the romans he was not yet strong enough to overcome the invader but he did have plans the child zenobias angry accusation that he had become one of them had pleased him because it meant that he had succeeded with his ruse the romans trusted him reaching up odenathus adjusted the crown of palmyra upon his head it was a beautiful crown all gold formed in the shape of the fronds of the palmyran palms indigenous to the city it was however hot in weather like this he sighed and brushed away a tiny trickle of sweat that attempted to slip down the side of his face the governors trumpeters blew a fanfare and the noisy crowds grew silent with anticipation then antonius porcius stood up and walked to the edge of the dais solemnly with a politicians flair for the dramatic he let his gaze play over the hushed crowds finally he spoke his nasal voice surprisingly strong today the glory of rome was tarnished it was tarnished not by those who are native to her but rather by those upon whom she so graciously conferred the prize of her citizenship rome will not tolerate this rome will not permit those whom we have sworn to protect to be abused by anyone rome will punish those who would break her lawsand the laws of palmyra he paused a moment to allow his words to sink in and then he continued this morning a wife of zabaai ben selim great chief of the bedawi was viciously raped and slain within her very home another of this loyal mans wives was also attacked and left for dead a collective gasp arose from the assembled citizens of palmyra followed by a low ominous muttering antonius porcius held up his hands to quiet the anger of palmyra there is more he cried loudly and the crowd grew silent again the woman who survived has pushed her shame aside and has come forth to identify those who assaulted her and the poor slain one his words had barely died out when the crowds of palmyran citizens began to part to allow the camels of zabaai ben selim through to the official dais the sight was both frightening and impressive the bedawi chieftain led the group from atop his own black racing camel behind him rode his forty sons from the eldest akbar ben zabaai to the youngest a boy of six who sat his own camel proudly and unafraid behind the bedawi chief and his sons rode the other men of his tribe followed by the walking and mourning women who wailed a cadence of sorrow the camels stopped at the foot of the dais and knelt in the warm sand to allow their riders to dismount to everyones surprise one of the sons of zabaai ben selim turned out to be his only daughter the beloved child zenobia flanked on either side by her father and akbar ben zabaai she stood straight and stonyeyed before the roman governor and prince odenathus we have come for roman justice antonius porcius zabaai ben selim cried his voice rang clear in the still afternoon rome hears your plea and will answer you fairly zabaai ben selim came the governors reply lucius octavius sir the commanding tribune of the sixth legion stepped forward assemble your alae yes sir came the brisk reply and the tribune turned shouting his commands as he did so gaulish alae to the front ho the one hundred twenty men of the cavalry from the gallic provinces moved slowly forward finally stopping and lining up in tenrows of twelve men each their horses shifted edgily feeling the mens nervousness zabaai ben selim walked back to where the women of his tribe now stood silent and led forth his chief wife tamar together they moved along the rows of roman horsemen and tamars strong voice was soon heard as she pointed a short brown finger at the guilty ones that one and that one these two legionnaires of the sixth legion dragged the accused men down from their shying horses and then before the governor at the very end of the rows of cavalry tamar stopped and zabaai felt a boneshattering shudder go through her looking up he encountered a pair of the coldest blue eyes he had ever seen and a thin cruel mouth that drew back in a mocking smile it is he my husband it is the centurion who raped and killed iris zabaai looking into the knowing eyes of the gaul understood for a brief minute the terror and the shame that his sweet favorite wife must have felt in her last minutes a fierce rage welled up within his breast and with a wild cry of fury he pulled the centurion from his mount in an instant his knife was at the mans neck edging a thin red line across his throat only tamars insistent voice was able to stop her attackers immediate execution no my husband he must suffer as our iris suffered do not i beg you grant him the blessing of a quick death he does not deserve it through the red mists of his anger zabaai felt a hand on his hand heard the plea of his wife and lowered his weapon his black eyes were suddenly filled with tears and he turned away to hide them using his sleeve to wipe the evidence of this weakness away so others might not see it is that all of them tamar he asked her gruffly yes my lord she answered him softly wanting to take him into her arms and comfort him if it had been a terrible ordeal for her so had it been for him he had lost the thing dearest to him in the entire world he had lost sweet iris and tamar knew that he would never again be the same that more than anything else saddened her for she loved him she slipped her hand into his and together they walked to the foot of the dais where zabaai said quietly my wife says that these are all of the guilty ones antonius porcius the roman governor rose from his carved chair and came forward to the edge of the platform his voice rang out over the crowd these men stand accused by their victim whom they left for dead can one of them deny his part the governor looked at the guilty eight who hung their heads unable to face either tamar or the others antonius porcius spoke again my judgment is final these beasts will be crucified their centurion is now to be given to the bedawi for torture and execution the roman peace has prevailed a dutiful round of cheers rose from the ranks a greater cheer from the palmyrans then several legionnaires of the sixth legion dragged forward the wooden crosses that had been brought to the site in anticipation of the punishment to be meted out the guilty men were divested of their uniforms and stripped naked they were then bound upon their crosses which were lifted high and held by one group of soldiers as others pounded them into the sandy ground from atop ladders that had been raised to aid them the heat of the late afternoon was barely tolerable but if the gauls survived to noon the following day their agony would be exquisite for spending a morning in the broiling sun of the syrian desert would swell their tongues black the wet rawhide strips binding their arms and their legs to the wooden crosses would dry shrink and then cut into their flesh stopping the circulation of blood and bringing incredible pain as unable to help themselves the men would sag with their own great weight depending upon how physically fit they were they would begin dying and they would die by inches the cries of their centurion vinctus sextus would follow them into hell as he would be kept carefully alive until all of his men were gone before their frightened eyes he was even now being stripped preparatory to his torture it began simply enough a stake was driven into the ground and he was bound to it his face against the wood his back to the crowd zabaai ben selim a slender whip of horsehair in his hand administered the first five blows they were not heavy blows but rather sharp cutting lashes that gave exquisite pain tamar weakened though she still was was able to give the prisoner five blows then each of the sons of zabaai ben selim struck the roman once the last five blows were delivered by zenobia who wielded the whip surprisingly well for a child it was thought by the crowd in all fiftyfive stripes crossed vinctus sextuss back but the gaul was a tough one and not once did he cry out although he remained conscious the entire time zabaai ben selim smiled grimly there would be plenty of time for cries and the gaul would eventually beg for mercy just as zabaais sweet iris had been forced to beg it would be many many hours before vinctus sextus expired and he would wish for death a thousand times before death finally came the beating over the centurion was cut down and dragged across the hot sand to where a block had been set up beside the block of marble an open pot bubbled over a neat leaping fire forced to kneel vinctus sextus watched with the first dawning of horror as his hands were swiftly severed from his body before his cry of protest had faded away in the hot afternoon not my hands he shrieked i am a soldier i need my hands the wolfish faces of his captors grinned mockingly at him and he realized that even if they should let him live he would be too maimed ever to do battle again he watched fascinated as the blood from his severed arteries arced red into the golden sand but then he was dragged across the small distance to the boiling pot and his severed stumps were plunged into the bubbling pitch to prevent his death from blood loss his first real scream of agony tore through the spectators who sighed with one breath relieved that the centurion was finally feeling the pain he deserved a son of zabaai gathered up from the sand the two hands their fingers outstretched in protest and the chief of the bedawi smiled once again never will those hands again be able to give pain gaul he said we will take them into the desert where we will feed them to the jackals vinctus sextus shuddered the greatest fear of the men of his northern tribe was to be buried maimed without his hands he would be forced to wander in a netherworld that was neither earth nor the paradise of his own woodland gods he was already condemned by the loss of his hands yet he still fought on he was dragged back across the sand and staked flat upon his back spreadeagle wide two women from the street of the prostitutes pushed through the crowd and presented themselves to zabaai one of them spoke we will help you chief to the bedawi and we will ask nothing in return since coming to palmyra this man has injured several of our sisterhood and until now we have had no recourse to justice the woman was a tall brunette of mature years and quite skillfully painted the beautiful young girl who had come forth with her was no more than fourteen a blueeyed golden blonde from northern greece with no pretense of modesty the girl stripped off her palepink silk robe and stood naked before the crowd her youthful body was pure perfection with marvelous globeshaped white breasts a slender waist and generously shaped hips and thighs a sigh rippled through the crowd with deliberate slowness the girl moved to stand behind vinctus sextuss head gracefully she knelt and bent to brush his face first with one of her full breasts then with the other the man groaned with pure frustration as zabaais deep voice taunted him what magnificent fruits eh gaul vinctus sextus felt his fingers ache and twitch to grasp the tempting flesh rubbing against his face instinctively he struggled to move his bound arms too late he remembered that he no longer had any hands and a curse rose to his lips zabaai ben selims youngest son the sixyearold hassan had possession of the gauls severed hands and he danced mischievously about the bound man waving his trophies taking the hands he placed them on the prostitutes plump breasts rubbing them lewdly while the crowd roared with laughter at the boys impishness the centurion reverted to his native tongue screaming and it was obvious that he cursed the crowd his fate and anything else that came into his mind he should be in appalling pain antonius porcius said to prince odenathus why is he not the boiling pitch is mixed with a painkilling narcotic the prince replied they did not wish him to die of the pain and so they have eased it considerably the governor nodded they are skillful torturers the bedawi should i ever need such men i shall call upon them the crowd ohed and ahed at each subtle torture fathers held their children on their shoulders for a better look the two roman legions and their auxiliaries stood silent and at attention but there were many white faces among them especially those nearest the unfortunate gaul antonius porcius had already vomited discreetly into a silver basin held by his personal body servant as a final torture vinctus sextus was tenderly bathed in warmed water that had been sweetened with honey and orange then each of the sons of zabaai ben selim emptied a small dish of black ants upon his helpless form it was too much for even the hardened gaul he began to scream frantically begging for mercy begging that they kill him now his big body writhed desperately in an effort to remove the tiny insects feeding upon his sweetdrenched body soon his screams grew weaker realizing that the show was now over the citizens of palmyra stayed just long enough to see the roman soldiers break the legs of the eight men who had been crucified then began straggling back into the city proper followed by the marching legions the men of the sixth and the ninth would consume a great deal of wine in the next several hours in a concerted effort to forget this afternoon his legs somewhat shaky the roman governor made his way from the dais and walked over to where zabaai ben selim stood with his sons and the girl child zenobia are you satisfied with roman justice chief of the bedawi he demanded i am satisfied it will not return my sweet iris to me but at least she will be avenged with the deaths of these men will you now leave on your winter trek we will stay here until the criminals are finally dead came the quiet reply only then will justice be done their bodies will then accompany us into the desert to become carrion for the jackals and the vultures so be it said antonius porcius relieved to have the whole messy affair over with well he thought to himself one good thing came from this that young blond prostitute was the loveliest creature he had seen in months he intended buying her from her owners for he was tired of his current mistress the wife of a rich palmyran merchant impatiently he signaled to his litter bearers the gods go with you this winter zabaai ben selim we shall be happy to see you back in palmyra come the spring the roman governor then climbed into the litter and commanded his bearers to hurry back into the city prince odenathus watched him go and then he smiled a mischievous smile he is as transparent as a crystal vase our roman friend he said to zabaai ben selim his desire for the blond whore was quite apparent but he shall not have her such a brave girl deserves better than our fat roman governor she is i take it already on her way to the palace was zabaai ben selims amused reply of course my cousin the couch of a bedawi prince is far preferable to that of a mere roman zabaai ben selim could not help but smile at his younger cousin the prince of palmyra was a charming young man with not only an intelligent mind but a keen sense of humor but like many others in palmyra zabaai still worried that odenathus was not yet married and had no heir for palmyran law dictated that no illegitimate child might inherit the throne he looked closely at odenathus and asked when are you going to wed my prince you sound like my council it is a question they ask daily he signed lifes garden is filled with many beautiful flowers my cousin i have yet however to find one sweet bud that attracts me enough to make my princess perhaps he chuckled i shall wait for your little zenobia to grow up zabaai it had been said in jest but no sooner were the words out of prince odenathuss mouth than zabaai ben selim realized that it was the very solution to his problem of a husband for his daughter it was something that both he and iris had worried about for none of the young men of his tribe would have been suitable for their daughter there was simply no getting around the fact that zenobia was different from other girls not only was she far more beautiful than the ordinary bedawi girl but she was highly educated fearless and quite outgoing she could ride and race both camel and horse as well as any man because she had begged him to do so he had let her take aims training with her younger brothers and he was forced to admit that she was the best pupil he had taught in years even better than her eldest brother akbar she had a natural grace and a flair with weapons that was surprising for someone so young strangely no one gave a second thought to the unconventional things she did for she was zenobia and unlike any girl his tribe had ever produced he was proud of his daughter still no young male bedawi wanted a wife who not only rode better than he but could surpass him in handling a sword a spear and a sling a woman needed to know how to cook how to birth children how to herd animals and sew zenobia was definitely not the kind of wife a man of his tribe could love and cherish but odenathus was a different type of man bedawi in his heritage on his fathers side he was yet a man of the city and men of the city preferred their women more educated zabaai ben selim looked at his young cousin and said would you actually consider zenobia for a wife odenathus my daughter would make you a magnificent wife my cousin you could have no better she is more than well born enough for you for on my side you share the same greatgrandfather and on her mothers side she descends from cleopatra the last queen of egypt she is not yet a woman but in a few years she will be of marriageable age i will only give her as a wife not a concubine and it must be agreed that her sons be your heirs prince odenathus was thoughtful for a long moment it was certainly not a bad idea and would solve his problem as well zenobia bat zabaai was dynastically a good match for him she was also an educated and intelligent girl from what he had seen of her if a man was to have intelligent sons then he must marry an intelligent wife odenathus thought she might be an interesting woman someday how soon after zenobia becomes a woman would you be willing to give her to me zabaai he asked a year at the very least came the reply i will not even broach this matter with her until she has begun her show of blood and men she will need time to adjust to the idea of marriage she has lived all her life in the simple surroundings of the tribe but my daughter is not just any girl odenathus she is a pearl without price palmyras young ruler looked across the sand to where the girl child zenobia sat crosslegged upon the desert floor watching with strangely dispassionate eyes the agony of her mothers killer she sat very straight and very still seemingly carved out of some inanimate material he had seen young rabbits sit just that way she seemed not even to be breathing he shook his head in wonder the gaul was suffering horribly and yet the child showed no signs of compassion or even of revulsion a man could breed up strong sons on the loins of such a woman as this child would one day become but he wondered fleetingly if such a woman would recognize in her husband a master perhaps if he took her to wife early enough and molded her womans character himself it would be possible odenathus found that he was willing to take a chance he found himself inexplicably drawn to zenobia for her very strength of character intrigued him greatly he smiled at himself he would not however give zabaai ben selim too great an advantage and so he said in what he hoped was a slightly bored and jaded tone a match between zenobia and myself is a possibility my cousin do not give her to anyone else yet and let us talk on it again when the child becomes a woman if my heart has not become engaged elsewhere zabaai smiled toothily it will be as you have said my lord prince and my cousin he replied smoothly he was not for one moment fooled by odenathuss cool attitude or his nonchalance he had seen the genuine look of interest in the young mans warm brown eyes when he had gazed so long and so thoughtfully at zenobia will you bid my daughter farewell my prince he asked we will not reenter the city again until late spring once the soldiers have died we will go on our way into the desert as we have planned odenathus nodded and bade zabaai ben selim a safe trip then he walked across the desert floor to where zenobia sat seating himself beside her he took her little hand in his own it was cold and instinctively he sought to warm it holding it rightly in his own the roman dies well she said acknowledging his presence but it is early yet and he will in the end cry to his gods for mercy it is important to you that he beg for mercy yes she spat the word out vehemently and he could see that she was once more going to withdraw into her private thoughts she hated well for one so young and until today so sheltered more and more this child fascinated him i would bid you goodbye zenobia he said piercing again into her selfabsorption zenobia looked up how handsome he is she thought if only he hadnt given in to the romans so easily if only he werent such a weakling farewell my lord prince she said coldly and then she turned back to contemplate the dying man goodbye zenobia he said softly lightly touching her soft dark hair with his hand but she didnt notice he stood up and walked away the sun was close to setting now and had turned the white marble towers and porticos of palmyra scarlet and gold with its clear light but zenobia saw none of it campfires sprang up on the desert floor as she sat silently watching her mothers despoiler about her the bedawi went about their own business of the evening they understood and waited patiently for the childs thirst for vengeance to be satisfied vinctus sextus had been unconscious for some time but then he began to revive slightly roused by the waves of pain that ate into his body and his soul as the painkillers given him earlier wore off that he wasnt already in hades surprised him slowly he forced his eyes open to find a slender girl child sitting by his head contemplating his misery wwho are you he managed to ask through parched and cracked lips i am zenobia bat zabaai the child answered him in a latin far purer than any he had been able to learn it was my mother that you slaughtered pig give me a drink he said weakly we do not waste water here in the desert roman you are a dying man to give you water would be to waste it her eyes were gray stones and totally without feeling as they stared at him you have no mercy he was curious did you show my sweet mother mercy the childs eyes blazed intense hatred at him you showed her none and i will show you no mercy pig none he managed a wolfish parody of a grin at her and they understood each other he had shown her blond beauty of a mother no kindness or mercy he wondered if having been given a glimpse of his fate he would do it all over again and decided that he would death was death and the blonde had been more than worth it men had died for less he blinked rapidly several times to clear the fog over his blue eyes so he might see the child better she was a little beauty facially but she yet had the flat unformed body of a child all women beg when beneath a man didnt your mother ever tell you that zenobia looked away from him and across the desert not quite understanding his words the sun had now set and the night had come swiftly about her the golden campfires blazed merrily while the stars stared down in their silvery silence you will die slowly roman she said quietly and i will stay to see it all vinctus sextus nodded his head slightly he could certainly understand vengeance the child was one to be proud of even if she was only a girl i will do my best to oblige you he said with a scornful and defiant sneer then he drifted into unconsciousness when he opened his eyes again it was pitch black but for the light of the campfires that darted across the sand the child still sat motionless and totally alert by his side he drifted off again returning as dawn came he watched it creep across the desert floor with tiny slim fingers of violet and apricot and crimson he could still feel the pain worse now than it had ever been and he knew death was near to him the narrow stripes upon his back had festered in the night the thousand ant bites on his body stung and burned unbearably the rawhide bindings on his arms and legs had now dried and were cutting painfully into his ankles and his wrists his throat was so parched that even the simple act of swallowing hurt him above the sun rose higher and higher until it blinded him even when he closed his eyes he could hear his surviving companions moaning and crying out to their own gods to their mothers as they hung upon their crosses he tried turning his head to look at them but he could not he was stretched wide and tight movement was now quite impossible five are already dead the child said brutally you romans are not very strong a bedawi could last at least three days soon the groans stopped and the child announced you alone are left roman but i can tell that you will not last a great deal longer your eyes have a milky haze over them and your breathing is rough he knew that she was right for already he felt his spirit attempting to leave his body he closed his eyes wearily and suddenly he was back in the forests of his native gaul the tall trees soared green and graceful toward the sky their branches waving in the gentle breeze ahead was a beautiful and cool blue lake he almost cried aloud with joy and then his lips formed the word water no water the childs voice cut ruthlessly into his pleasure and he opened his eyes to face the broiling blazing sun it was too much by the gods it was too much vinctus sextus opened his mouth and howled with frustrated outrage and pain the sound of the childs triumphant laughter was the last thing he heard it mocked him straight into hell as he fell back dead upon the desert floor zenobia arose swaying for her legs were stiff she had sat by vinctus sextus for over eighteen hours and in all that time she had neither eaten nor drunk anything suddenly she was swept up in a pair of strong arms and she looked into the admiring face of her eldest halfbrother akbar his white teeth flashed in his sunbrowned face you are bedawi he said i am proud of you my little sister you are as tough as any warrior i would fight by your side anytime his words gave her pleasure but she only said where is father her voice was suddenly very adult our father has gone to bury your mother with the honor and the dignity she deserves she will be put in the tomb in the garden of the house zenobia nodded satisfied and then said he begged akbar in the end he begged the same way that he forced my mother to beg she paused as if considering that and then she said softly i will never beg akbar whatever happens to me in my lifetime i will never beg never akbar hugged the child to his breast never say never zenobia he warned her gently life often plays odd tricks upon us for the gods are known to be capricious and not always kind to us mortals will never beg she repeated firmly then she smiled sweetly at her brother besides am i not the beloved of the gods akbar they will defend me always odenathus prince of palmyra sat his horse and watched the maneuvers of a bedawi camel corps its warriors were magnificently trained and under the direction of their captain they performed extremely well the prince turned and said to his host well my cousin zabaai if all your troops perform this well if all your captains are that competent i foresee a day when i may drive the romans from my city may the gods grant your wish my lord prince too long has the golden yoke been about our necks and each year the romans take more and more of the riches that come to us from the indies and cathay we are beggared trying to feed their rapacious appetites odenathus nodded in agreement and then said will you present me to the captain of your camel corps i should like to congratulate him on his leadership zabaai hid a smile of course my lord he raised his hand in a signal and the camel cavalry whirled away from him galloped down a stretch of desert and then turned to come racing furiously back to stop just short of the two men the prince would like to present his compliments captain zabaai said the leader of the corps slid from his mount and bowed smartly before the prince you handle your men well captain i hope that someday we may ride together it will be an honor my lord although i am not used to sharing my command with anyone the captains burnoose was tossed back and the ruler of palmyra found himself staring into the face of the most beautiful woman he had ever seen she laughed at his surprise and said do you not recognize me my cousin zenobia he was astounded this could not be zenobia zenobia was a child this statuesque goddess could not be the flat and leggy child he remembered three and a half years had passed since he had last seen her youre staring she said what he was totally confused you are staring at me my lord is something wrong youve changed he managed to say in a somewhat strangled voice i am almost fifteen my lord fifteen he repeated foolishly by the gods she was a glorious creature you may go now zenobia zabaai dismissed her we will expect you at the evening meal yes father zenobia turned and grasping her camels bridle swung herself back up into the saddle raising her hand as signal she led her camel corps away as the two men reentered zabaai ben selims tent did you or did you not propose a match between your daughter and myself several years back zabaai the palmyran prince demanded i did the girl was to become my wife a year after she became a woman is that not correct yes my lord has she now reached her maturity yes my lord it was all that zabaai ben selim could do to keep from laughing odenathuss desire was so open as to be embarrassing then why is she not my wife came the anguished cry nothing was formally proposed my lord when you did not make formal application for my daughters hand i was forced to conclude that you were not seriously interested besides your devotion to your favorite deliciae is well known she has given you two sons has she not deliciae is a concubine odenathus protested her sons are not my heirs only my wifes sons will hold that distinction you do not have a wife zabaai ben selim reminded do not toy with me cousin odenathus said you know full well that i want zenobia to wife you knew that the moment i saw her i would want her why did you simply not present her to me why that silly charade with the camel corps it was no charade my lord zenobia commands her own corps and has for two years now if i let you marry her it must be with the understanding that she is free to go her own way she is not an ornament to be housed like a fine jewel in the box of your harem my daughter descends from the rulers of egypt and she is as free as the wind you cannot pen the wind odenathus i will agree to whatever you wish zabaai but i want zenobia the prince promised rashly the first thing i want is that you get to know one another zenobia may have the body of a woman but she is yet a child where men are concerned she is still a virgin zabaai chuckled not that the young men of my tribe have not tried odenathus but my daughter is yet a virgin it is very difficult to make love to a girl who can outwrestle you zenobia is as you undoubtedly noticed quite tall for a girl she gets her height from her greekegyptian ancestry not the bedawi she is at least as tall as you odenathus not at all like your deliciae who can look up at you zenobia will look you right in the eye why did you not offer her to me again zabaai the truth my cousin zabaai ben selim sighed because i am reluctant to give her up odenathus she is my only daughter iriss child and when she is gone from me i will miss her if you wed her you will find in her an interesting companion she will not simper at you like so many of these harem females she will be your friend as well as your lover are you man enough to accept a woman on those terms yes came the unwavering reply so be it then the bedawi chief said if zenobia has no objections after you two have grown to know one another then you may have her to wife may i tell her he asked no i will tell her my cousin and i will tell her immediately so there will be no confusion or restraint between you the two men separated men the prince returning to his own tent and the bedawi chieftain to his daughters quarters he found her sponging herself with a small basin of perfumed water grumbling as she always did over the scarcity of the precious liquid here in the desert still she was careful not to waste the water and reused it several times storing it in a goatskin bag between her ablutions praise jupiter that it is almost time to return to palmyra she greeted him you have no idea father how i long for a decent bath he chuckled and sat crosslegged on a carpet odenathus wants to marry you he said coming directly to the point isnt that what youve wanted for me all along father she took up a small linen towel and mopped where a few drops of water had spilled on her table you have to marry eventually zenobia but i want you to be happy odenathus is a wealthy pleasant and intelligent young man still if there is someone you would prefer then it shall be as you desire my child only one thing concerns me about the prince she said it distresses me that he gives in to the romans so easily and without a fight i do not understand it it is quite simple zenobia zabaai replied palmyra as you know was founded by solomon the great king of israel it has always been a commercial state we have never been interested in expansion in taking our neighbors lands our only interest is in making money and because everyone needed us and our talents and because we are located here in the syrian desert no one bothered us we have been friends to the world but rome is a conqueror and has a conquerors fear of her neighbors palmyra is an outpost for rome against persia cathay and the indies but because we are a nation of merchants and not soldiers we have never been prepared to defend ourselves after all we have never needed to if odenathus ever attempts to thwart rome they will destroy the city without a thought he does the next best thinghe welcomes them and in doing so saves us all do not judge him too harshly when the time is right he will drive them from our land and we will once again be our own masters if i marry the prince will my children be his heirs the gossips say he is quite fond of one of his concubinesand her children i will have no one elses children supplanting mine your children will be his legal heirs my daughter then i will marry him father wait my child zabaai cautioned get to know him before you agree to this match if you then still wish to wed him so be it you say that eventually i must marry father the prince has asked for me and i will agree if i must wed then at least it will be to a man who lives in palmyra so i may at last be free of your desert she twinkled mischievously at him and zabaai chuckled indulgently how he loved this child the prince is handsome continued zenobia he has always been kind to me and i have never heard anyone say that he is not a fair or good ruler there seems to be no malice in him at all zenobia knew no matter how fair her father meant to be she could not refuse the prince still she loved zabaai all the more for pretending the choice was hers you say nothing of love my child for a marriage to be successful mere must be love between a man and a woman the moment i saw your mother those long years ago in alexandria i knew i loved her and she knew she loved me love sustains a man and woman in the hard times you and mother were unusual father tamar tells me that love is something that grows between a man and a woman i believe that given time i can love odenathus and he already loves me i can tell did you see how foolishly he behaved today i didnt mean to laugh at him but he looked so silly with his mouth open she giggled with the memory zabaai didnt think that this was the time to explain to his daughter the difference between lust and love let her believe that odenathus was already in love with her it wouldnt hurt to give the prince that small edge make yourself beautiful my child he said and then in a rare show of open affection he kissed her cheek you may eat with us instead of the women this evening left alone zenobia turned to her mirror a round of burnished silver pensively she stared into it everyone said that she was a beauty and compared to other girls her age she was but would she be able to compete with the women of palmyra would odenathus think that she was beautiful she knew all about his concubine deliciae and she would have to accept the woman a slave girl from northern greece deliciae was said to be very beautiful fairskinned azureeyed yellowhaired zenobia looked at herself with a critical eye palegold skin the cheeks of her oval face touched with apricot long thick straight dark hair silken to the touch so perhaps it would be pleasing to him she seemed to remember that he was always caressing her head she looked harder at herself she was tall for a woman she knew but her body was flawless her limbs well rounded without being fat thanks to the active life she led she gently slipped her slender hands beneath her breasts and looked at them critically they were round firm and full she knew the value that men put on womens breasts saw with satisfaction that she would not be found wanting there her waist was slender the hips slim but pleasingly rounded zenobias gaze moved upward again in the mirror to her face and she stared hard the cheekbones were high the nose quite straight and classic the lips full and generous the chin small square and determined her eyes she decided were her best feature almondshaped topped by slender arched black brows and thickly fringed with black lashes they were deep gray with tiny golden flecks like leaves in a winter pond the color darkened to almost black when she was angry remaining a deep gray at other times they were the kind of eyes a man couldnt resist looking into although zenobia was too young to realize it her eyes were the mirror of her soul telling anyone who was wise enough to look deeply into all her secrets if he does not find you the most beautiful woman in the world then he is blind in both eyes little sister zenobia turned her eyes from the mirror it is his favorite concubine i am worried about akbar men of the desert are susceptible to fair women he has not married her came the reply she is a slave akbar men do not marry their slaves they may love them but they do not marry them what if he loves her but marries me simply for heirs i have been surrounded by love my whole life akbar i was conceived by a great love i cannot live without it what if he does not love me you do not have to marry him little sister father has said he will not force you to it i am almost fifteen my brother most girls my age have been married for two years and already have children what if i never find this love that exists between a man and a woman if i do not marry prince odenathus who will i marry akbar who will have an educated woman to wife i often wonder if mother and father did not do me a great disservice educating me perhaps i would have been better off if i had learned nothing but womans ways she sighed and flung herself on her couch akbar stared at his halfsister in surprise and then he began to laugh by jupiter you are afraid never did i think to see the day when zenobia bat zabaai would be afraid but you are you are afraid that odenathus will not like you you are afraid of a blueeyed yellowhaired whore zenobia my sister the poor prince of palmyra is already half in love with you if you will be but kind to him he will be your devoted slave for the rest of your life all he desires is a little encouragement as to the concubine deliciae of course he is fond of her she is an amiable creature surely you cannot be afraid of that piece of fluff she is so so womanly and i am more at home with a weapon than a perfume bottle you are unique my sister would you like a woman like me akbar the concern in her young face was so intense that he almost hurt for her too easy a conquest can be pleasant but very boring my sister be yourself with odenathus he will love you akbar walked over to where his younger halfsister lounged and bent to kiss her head stop brooding foolish child and make yourself beautiful for the prince i will come back shortly and escort you myself to fathers tent for the evening meal when she looked up he was gone and bab was entering the tent dearest bab zenobia thought affectionately how she was going to enjoy living in a civilized city again bab had been her mothers servant and had come with iris from alexandria when iris had died she had simply taken over zenobia and continued on with her duties she was getting on in years now thought zenobia and the traveling was becoming harder for her she watched with loving eyes as the older woman moved about the tent preparing her mistresss clothing for the evening ah your dear mother would be happy with this match bab commented it is your son who will be the next ruler of palmyra after odenathus at least if i do marry him zenobia teased you will spend your declining years within a city instead of out upon the desert declining yearsbabs lined and weathered face registered instant offense and who is declining i should like to know i served your mother i serve you and i expect someday i shall serve your daughter declining years humph she bent over the cedar chest and drew forth a soft white cotton chemise and a snowwhite tunic youll wear these she said holding them out zenobia nodded and shrugged off the short black chiton she had been wearing bab took a small sea sponge and dipping it in fragrant oil smoothed it over her mistresss nude body the young girl wrinkled her nose with delight she loved the rich hyacinth fragrance remembering that iris had given her a small flacon of the perfume when she was ten bab slipped the chemise and then the tunic over zenobias head the tunic was made of fine linen and bab belted it with a length of thin leather that had been gilded with silver leaf there were matching silver sandals for zenobias slender feet the tunic was sleeveless and its neckline was draped low revealing the soft perfection of her breasts bab sat the girl down while she brushed and brushed the long black hair finally braiding it and looping it under once to be fastened with a pearlanddiamond hair ornament she then offered her young mistress a small jewel case which zenobia stared into for a few moments studying the precious gems and metals finally she removed a carved silver bracelet a smooth ivory one banded with silver one of carved ivory and another of polished blue lapis which she slipped on one of her arms into her ears she fitted silverandlapis earrings and upon her fingers went two rings one a large creamy round pearl the other a carved scarab of blue lapis that had belonged to her mother bab nodded her approval of zenobias choices and took up a small brush which she dipped in kohl carefully she painted the girls eyes to highlight them but zenobias lips and flushed cheeks needed no artifice having their own color the girl reached for an ivory scent bottle and uncorking it daubed the exotic hyacinth fragrance on herself she stood and looking at herself in the mirror said well i suppose i am as ready as im going to be bab bab chuckled you will ravish him my pet zenobia smiled but it was a smile without enthusiasm zabaai ben selim might be a bedawi chief but he was a man who liked his comfort his tent was set upon a low platform that could be separated into several sections for easier transport inside the floor was covered with thick wool rugs in reds blues golds and creams the tent poles were gilded and the finest brass and silver lamps hung from the tent ceiling burning perfumed oils the great tent was divided into two sections the smaller sleeping area separated from the main part of the tent by woven silk carpets from persia the furnishings were simple but rich low tables of wood and brass chests of cedar and many colorful pillows for seats there were several men in the room besides the prince and her father she saw several of her halfbrothers besides akbar there was hussein and hamid and selim all full brothers to akbar all tamars sons they grinned knowingly at her causing a blush to color her cheeks which made them chuckle indulgently for some reason their smug complacency drove a streak of rebellion into her heart and mind how dare they presume that all was settled come my daughter and sit between us zabaai commanded her gendy he had seen the fire in her eyes and guessed that she might be feeling a bit fractious zenobia sat down quietly keeping her eyes lowered furious with herself for suddenly feeling shy silent slaves began to serve the simple meal a young kid had been roasted and there was a dish of rice with raisins zenobia was delighted to find in the middle of the table an arrangement of fruits the like of which she hadnt seen since they left palmyra almost six months earlier there were grapes both purple and green figs and dates peaches and apricots a small smile of delight curved the corners of her mouth and she reached out to take an apricot you must thank odenathus for such bounty zenobia her father said you brought the fruit from palmyra she looked up at him with her marvelous eyes and for a moment the prince thought he was going to drown in the depths of them finally he managed to find his voice i remembered how you dislike trekking the desert and thought by now you must long for fresh fruit you brought it for me she felt shy again see what an easy woman she is to please odenathus akbar teased another woman would have asked for emeralds and rubies but my little sister is satisfied with apricots tis an admirable trait in a wife i thank you for the fruit my lord she was silent again zabaai was concerned it was not like zenobia to be so quiet and shy he wondered if she were ill but then he realized that the prince too had said very little during the meal both he and zenobia were behaving like two young animals placed in the same cage for the first time warily they circled each other and sniffed the air cautiously for signs of hostility the bedawi chieftain smiled to himself remembering himself in his younger days with each new girl each girl except iris it had always been different with iris he was somewhat troubled that zenobia seemed reluctant about young prince odenathus but then she had never before been exposed to a suitor the meal concluded with sweet cakes made of thin layers of dough honey and finely chopped nuts there had been marvelous greek wine served all during the meal and the men were feeling relaxed zenobia had drunk very little and seemed unusually sensitive to her halfbrothers teasing normally she would have bantered with them finally zabaai said in what he hoped was an offhand manner my daughter the moon will not rise until quite late tonight there is a fine display of stars take odenathus and show him your knowledge of astronomy you could put zenobia anywhere on this earth my prince and she would be able to find her way back to palmyra by using the sky to guide her i have a fine observatory in the palace odenathus replied i hope you will visit it someday he rose and holding out his hand helped zenobia up together they walked from the tent while behind them zabaai quelled his sons ribald humor with a stern look silently they strolled through the encampment and zenobia stole looks from beneath her long lashes at the prince he was really a very handsome young man she had to admit unlike her father and halfbrothers who wore the long enveloping robes of the bedawi odenathus was dressed in a short tunic of naturalcolored linen a painted leather breastplate and a red military cloak zenobia approved this plain and sensible clothing and his sturdy practical sandals as they walked she noticed that his hand was callused and dry and firm it was a good sign she thought directly above us is the planet venus she said when i was born venus and mars were in conjunction the chaldean astronomer who was present at my birth predicted that i should be fortunate in both love and war and have you been he asked i have always been loved by my brothers and my parents of war i know naught has no young man declared his undying affection for you she stopped and pondered a moment there have been young men who act silly around me they behave like young goats when they are trying to attract the attention of a desirable nanny you mean they butt heads he teased zenobia giggled they have done everything but that i do not believe however that that is love perhaps you have not given them a chance to offer you love just as you have been denying me that chance this evening he turned her to him and they were face to face but she shyly turned her head away look at me zenobia he commanded gently i cannot she whispered what he teased her once again a girl who can lead a mounted troupe of soldiers cannot look at the man who would love her i will not eat you up zenobiaat least not yet he amended look at me my desert flower look into the eyes of the prince who would lay his heart at your feet his hand raised her face up and their eyes met zenobia shivered in the warm night tenderly odenathus explored her face with his elegant fingers outlining her jaw brushing the tips of his fingers over her high cheekbones down her nose across her lips your skin is like the petal of a rose my flower he murmured in a deep and passionate voice zenobia was riveted to the ground she thought she would faint for she couldnt seem to catch her breath and when she swayed uncertainly his muscled arm reached out to sweep her next to him she had no idea how tempting she was to the prince her moist coral lips slightly parted her dark gray eyes wide her honest innocence was the most tantalizing and provocative spur to his passions but odenathus maintained a firm control over his own wants it would be so easy to make love to her this very minute he thought it would be easy to sink onto the sand drawing her down how he would enjoy teaching this lovely girl the arts of love but some deeper instinct warned him that now was not the time instead he held her firmly and said in what he hoped passed for a normal voice we will get to know one another my little flower you know that i want you for my wife but because i care for you i want you to be happy if being my wife would bring you sadness then it cannot be you would do me honor if you would stay at the palace this summer then we may get to know each other within the protective circle of our families i i must ask my father she replied softly i am sure that zabaai ben selim will agree he let her go then and taking her hand again turned back to the encampment escorting her to her tent he bowed politely and bid her a good night it was a bemused zenobia who passed into her quarters the desert night had grown cool and bab sat nodding by the brazier zenobia was relieved for she didnt want to talk at this moment she wanted time alone in the silence to think she was quite confused prince odenathus had roused something within her but she could not be sure if it was the kind of love that grew between a man and a woman how could she know she had never felt that kind of love zenobia sighed so deeply that bab awakened with a start you are back child the old woman rose slowly to her feet let me help you get ready for bed was the evening a pleasant one for you did you walk with the prince did he kiss you zenobia laughed so many questions bab yes the evening was pleasant and the prince did not kiss me though i thought once he might you did not hit him the way you have done with the young men of the tribe bab fretted no i didnt and had he tried to kiss me i wouldnt have the older woman nodded satisfied the prince obviously sought to win over her lovely child and that was good he was obviously a man of sensitivity and that too was to be commended zenobia little hornet that she was could be won over by honeyed persuasion force would be fatal bab helped her young mistress to undress and settled her in her bed good night my child she said and bending kissed the girls forehead he wants me to spend the summer at the palace bab do you think father will agree of course he will agree go to sleep now my dear and dream beautiful dreams of your handsome prince good night bab came the reply by noon the next day the camp was struck and they were on the road back to the great oasis city the prince rode next to zenobia who proved far more talkative in the saddle than she had been the previous evening by the time the city came in sight two days later they were in the process of becoming friends the prince left the caravan of zabaai ben selim at his home and rode on to the palace to prepare for zenobias visit he was greeted by his mother alzena who had been a persian princess alzena meant the woman in the persian language a feminine woman who personified beauty love and fidelity odenathuss elegant mother was all of these things she was petite in stature athough quite regal her skin was as white as snow her hair and eyes black as night alzena loved her son her only child above all else but she was a strongwilled woman who wanted no serious rivals for her sons attention she held palmyra in contempt forever comparing it unfavorably to her beloved persian cities as a consequence she was not popular among palmyras citizens although her son who loved and championed his city was she knew that odenathus was back within the palace before he had passed through the gates but she waited for him to come to her pacing the outer chamber of her apartments she glanced at herself in the silver mirror and was reassured by what she saw she was still beautiful her face still virtually unlined at forty her midnightblack hair unsilvered her eyes clear she wore garments in the parthian fashion cherryred trousers a palepink sleeveless blouse a longsleeved cherryred tunic embroidered in gold threads and small freshwater pearls upon her feet were golden leather sandals her hair was piled high upon her head in an arrangement of braids and curls and dressed with twinkling bits of garnet glass she saw the admiration in his eyes as he entered the room and was pleased odenathus my love she murmured in her strangely husky voice a voice that was in direct contrast with her very female appearance i have missed you she said embracing him where have you been these past few days he smiled broadly at her and drew her to the cushioned bench i have been in the desert mother at the camp of my cousin zabaai ben selim i have invited his daughter zenobia to spend the summer here at our palace alzena felt a chill of premonition and sure enough her son continued i would like to marry zenobia but she is young and hesitant i thought if she spent her summer here and came to know us she would be less unsure although her father can order her to wed with me i should far prefer it if she wanted to do so alzena was totally unprepared for her sons news she needed time to think but first she would try the obvious odenathus there is plenty of time for you to marry why this haste mother i am twentyfive i need heirs and what are deliciaes children they are my sons but they cannot be my heirs they are the children of a slave a concubine you know all of this mother you know that i must marry one day but a bedawi girl odenathus surely you can do better than that zenobia is but half bedawi as am i mother he smiled a bit ruefully he was more than well aware of her overpossessiveness although she assumed him ignorant of her feelings her mother was a direct descendant of queen cleopatra and zenobia is a beautiful and intelligent girl i want her for my wife and i shall have her alzena tried another tack one that would give her time to think of course my son i am only concerned for your happiness poor deliciae she will be simply heartbroken to learn that she is to be replaced in your affections deliciae has no illusions as to her place in my life odenathus said sharply you will see that zenobia is made welcome wont you mother since you are so determined to have her to wife my son i shall treat her as i would my own daughter came the sweet reply and odenathus rose and kissed his mother i ask nothing more of you he said and left her to visit with his favorite concubine deliciae no sooner had he gone than alzena picked up a porcelain vase and flung it to the floor in a fit of temper a wife by the gods she had hoped to prevent such a thing heirs he wanted heirs for this dung heap of a city palmyra for all its boast of being founded by king solomon couldnt compare with her ancient persian cities of culture and learning this place to which she had been exiled these past twentysix years was but a dung heap in a desert well he wasnt married yet perhaps if she worked on that stupid little fool deliciae if odenathus wanted the bedawi girl let him couple with her but make her his wife never deliciae had greeted her master warmly pressing her ripe body against his in a provocative manner holding her face up to him for a kiss welcome my lord i have missed you greatly as have your sons he kissed her a fond but passionless kiss she was a sweet girl but he had long ago tired of her you have all been well he said oh yes my lord although vernus did fall and give his knee a bad scrape you know how he must do everything that linos will do even though his brother is older nuzzling at his ear she drew him over to a couch and down with her the nights are long without you my lord the gardenia scent of her perfume overwhelmed him and he suddenly found it cloying he unwound her plump arms from about his neck and sat up he did not want to make love to her he realized with surprise that he didnt want to make love to any of the women who peopled his harem deliciae he said i wanted you to know that i will soon be marrying in a few days zenobia bat zabaai the only daughter of my cousin will be coming to visit the palace she will become my wife and her children my heirs her children your heirs what of my sons your sons surely you knew that the children of a concubine cannot inherit the kingdom of palmyra your mother said that my children were your heirs it is not for my mother to say my mother is a persian when she married my father she should have become a palmyran but she did not she has spent all her life here belittling my kingdom never bothering to learn its ways she might have made me the most hated ruler ever to govern palmyra had i followed her example fortunately i followed my fathers example and he warned me to wed with no foreigner lest my sons be taught to hate their inheritance the law is clear deliciae the children of a concubine cannot inherit the kingdom of palmyra you could change the law my lord could you not i will not he said quietly your sons are good boys but they are half greek zenobia and i are both bedawi and our sons will be too you are half persian she accused and your precious bride as i recall had an alexandrian greek for a mother but we were raised here in palmyra and we are our fathers children our fathers are bedawi by that logic our sons are bedawi she countered odenathus felt a mixture of irritation and sadness he did not want to hurt deliciae but she was leaving him no choice silently he damned his mother for having dared to raise her hopes now he fully understood why alzena had encouraged his liaison with poor deliciae though she had always hated the women of his haremand he realized feared them too he sighed and said who were your parents deliciae my parents what have my parents got to do with this answer me who were your parents his voice was sharp i dont know she said irritably i cannot remember as i was quite young when i was taken from them were they freedmen i dont know tell me your earliest memories think back and tell me what you first remember of your life her brow wrinkled and for a few minutes she was silent then she said slowly the first thing i can remember is passing sweetmeats in an athenian brothel i war very small no more than four or five the men used to take me on their laps and cuddle me and call me their good and pretty little girl you were not a virgin when i bought you he said of course not she said my virginity was auctioned off in damascus when i was eleven i made my owner very rich for no virgin ever brought him a higher price then you had been a prostitute for three years when i bought you from the lady rabi yes why do you ask me these things you knew what i was when you purchased me yes deliciae i did you are not a stupid woman think on it you do not know your parents your antecedents or even where you originally came from before i purchased you you were a professional whore you performed before the entire city of palmyra the day i bought you how can i make the sons of such a woman the heirs to my kingdom the laws of this city are the laws of solomon himself my wife will be above reproach and my sons antecedents documented back a hundred generations for all to know and see there will never be any doubts this is as it should be for the next ruler of palmyra he put an arm around her and kissed the top of her golden head i know you understand deliciae then you marry only for legitimate heirs her voice held a note of new hope that he felt obliged to discourage i marry for love deliciae i have always been honest with you i bought you to thwart the roman governor who would have satisfied his desires and then sent you back to the lady rabi where you would have spent the remainder of a very short youth pleasuring many lovers each night instead i bought you and made you my concubine you have all you desire in this world and more you are honored and safe you are free from want and so you shall remain until the end of your days unless of course you displease me the last was a gentle warning what will happen to my sons deliciae demanded if they are not your heirs then what will happen to them they will be educated to serve palmyra to serve me and to serve my successor they are lords of the city your sons are my sons and they are safe even from zenobia bat zabaai she said spitefully why would zenobia want to harm your sons you are foolish my pet and bitter in your disappointment but remember that it was neither i nor zenobia who told you that your sons would inherit my kingdom if you are angry deliciae then direct your anger toward the one who deserves it direct it at my mother for it was she who misled you deliciaes fair skin was mottled red in her anger and she felt most put out odenathus was right it was alzena who had led her to believe that her children would inherit their fathers small kingdom deliciae was not a stupid woman and on reflection she realized that she was indeed fortunate not only had she been plucked from what would have been an extremely disagreeable life but her two sons were her guarantee of remaining in this comfortable position what a fool she would be to ruin it all because another womans unborn children were to be the next rulers of palmyra her master was tired of her she knew very well deliciae thought i am safe and my sons are safe i shall even make friends with zenobia bat zabaai that will certainly annoy alzena the old cat she smiled to herself her breathing beginning to even out again as the anticipated pleasure of irritating odenathus s mother swept over her why do you smile my pet because i realize that you are correct my lord and that i am being very foolish with your permission i will welcome zenobia bat zabaai as your wife and my princess odenathus smiled back at deliciae i knew my pet that on reflection your intelligence and innate good sense would surface he stood and once again kissed the top of her blond head i will see the boys later my pet now i go to give orders so that all may be in readiness for zenobia when she enters the palace tomorrow everything must be perfect deliciaes beautiful eyebrows lifted delicately as she watched him retreat from her rooms odenathus must indeed be in love if he was bothering with household details zenobia bat zabaai must have changed from the skinny grimeyed child who sat so dispassionately watching a man die almost four years ago she shrugged she was well out of the palace intrigues let the little bedawi girl cope with it all in midaftemoon of the following day zenobia entered the palace grounds alone she rode quietly on her camel at an hour when most people were napping in the heat she had no wish to draw attention to her visit as alzena watched stonily odenathus leapt forward to aid the cloaked figure from her mount and her hood fell back revealing her beautiful face my lord zenobia said softly inclining her head in greeting welcome to my home zenobia he returned i hope you will make it your home soon my flower zenobia blushed peach color staining her palegold skin it will be as the gods will my lord he turned and drew alzena forward this is my mother zenobia the prince said my lady i am honored you are welcome to the palace my alzena sought for the correct word my child i hope your stay will be a happy one thank you my lady zenobia said politely a few minutes later she was settled in a comfortable apartment with bab busily unpacking her things and chattering away bab had come to the palace ahead of her by several hours now this is what a palace should be like bab enthused its big there are fine gardens and the rooms are airy there seem to be plenty of slaves to serve us i hope the food is decent hush bab your tongue runs away with your good sense bab chuckled and continued with her unpacking shaking out zenobias garments i am not sure your clothing is elegant enough for the palace we should have come later and taken the time to make you new things you fuss too much old woman the girl teased either the prince likes me or he does not and if he does not then no amount of fine feathers will help me it is not the prince who concerns me but his mother bab lowered her voice i have heard that she is very unhappy that he wishes to marry the gossip is that she hoped he would be content with the concubine deliciae they say that the princess alzena is a very headstrong and possessive woman is it me she objects to bab or simply any girl it is both my baby bab replied she and zenobia had always been honest with each other zenobia was thoughtful for a moment then she spoke again the best way to handle the lady i believe is for me to be sweetness itself how can she find fault with good manners and a pleasing attitude she chuckled how will you handle the concubine my child you cannot live in the same palace and not meet i have no doubt that we shall meet but when we do i shall make her my friend zenobiabab was shocked i have no choice bab if i marry odenathus i must be a help to him not a hindrance how can he govern palmyra successfully if there is strife within his household if there is he will first worry and then resent me no i must win over both his mother and deliciae she smiled at bab do not worry i am not unmindful of what is involved but now i should like a bath surely such a simple thing is available to me in this marvelous place of course child all is in readiness for you come come bab took her mistress by the hand and led her into a tiled bath where zenobias hyacinth scent already filled the air half a dozen black slave girls waited to attend the honored guest who looking at the lovely deep bathing pool delightedly shed her dusty garments and then stepped into the tepid water her round full breasts and long legs were noted by two spies placed in her apartment by alzena and deliciae when zenobia had bathed bab wrapped her in a soft cotton robe then the girl lay down upon her couch to rest until the evening meal she was tired from the tension of preparing for the visit and not a little apprehensive tonight she would meet with alzena and she would probably be faced with the beautiful concubine deliciae yet despite her fears zenobia slept the sleep of the young and the innocent when she awoke she found herself alone rising she walked across the room onto the open portico below her was a large walled garden and beyond the city of palmyra was spread like a rich meal upon the table of the desert already the lamps were being lit as the blue dusk quickly turned to black night a faint breeze carried the scent of something so elusive that even zenobias sharp nose could not identify it she felt relaxed and knew that whatever happened this evening she would be in total control you are awake zenobia turned and walked back into the room i am awake bab you should have called the older woman grumbled i wanted a moment alone humph came the reply but bab understood zenobias sleeveless white tunica with its draped low neckline was a simple garment she smiled a secret smile by the very innocence of her dress she would point up the difference between herself and odenathuss mother leave my hair loose she said and bab nodded brushing the long thick tresses containing them only with a simple white ribbon band embroidered with tiny seed pearls zenobia reached for her jewel case from it she removed a single large creamgold teardropshaped pearl on a thin golden chain fastened about her neck it nestled between her young breasts a temptation between twin temptations matching clusters of pearls on gold wires dangled from her ears arm bangles of carved pink coral and thin gold wires with pearl bangles braceleted her arms a single round pearl set in gold adorned one hand drawing attention to her long tapering fingers with their polished nails bab nodded her approval as zenobia daubed on her perfume it is perfect my baby you will outshine the old witch and the greek concubine the words were scarce out of babs mouth when one of the black slave girls hurried in to announce a eunuch is here to escort the lady to the banquet hall with a faint nod to bab zenobia followed the girl and then the eunuch hurrying through the vast palace so quickly that she scarce had time to note a thing along her way the slave girl had been wrong however for it was not the banquet hall to which they went but rather a small family dining room dressed in greens and golds alzena was already there reclining on a dining sofa next to her was an exquisite fairskinned blonde dressed also in parthian fashion but her colors were sky blue embroidered in silver zenobia my child alzena purred this is the lady deliciae good evening to you zenobia replied sweetly alzena was somewhat disconcerted for the girl showed neither distress nor anger at deliciaes presence she was either totally unfeeling very stupid or very clever and the fact that alzena couldnt determine which gave her pause she eyed zenobia suspiciously as the girl settled herself upon the dining couch marked for her then turned to deliciae saying i understand that you have two sons how fortunate you are i hope i shall one day be the mother of sons alzena choked on her wine spilling some of it on her gown and sending a servant scuttling for water and a cloth zenobia cooed solicitously oh you have spilled your wine i do hope it will not stain your tunic deliciae eyed odenathuss prospective wife from beneath her heavily mascaraed lashes and forced back a chuckle the little bedawi girl was wise to alzena and ready to do battle with her although deliciae could see that alzena was not quite sure yet as to the girls character and intelligence she took the opportunity to gauge her rival and sighed the girl was positively beautiful she makes me look insipid thought deliciae a slave was rubbing frantically at alzenas tunic as the prince of palmyra walked into the room his glance swept over the three women and then he said sharply deliciae what do you do here did you not invite me my lord your mother said that i was to come to supper tonight you were not invited came the icy reply please return to your quarters deliciae rose stricken and zenobia instantly realized that odenathuss mother was using the woman as a pawn please my lord prince she said do not send the lady deliciae away i was so enjoying her company it does not distress you my flower i would not have you unhappy deliciae and i are of an age we will quickly become friends i know zenobia put a hand on his arm please my lord prince her glance was melting and odenathus felt his heartbeat quicken if it pleases you my flower deliciae may remain he said gruffly wishing to the gods as he said it that neither deliciae nor his mother were in the room so he might kiss that adorable mouth that pleaded so prettily with him instead he signaled impatiently to a slave to fill his goblet with wine thank you my lord prince zenobia said softly alzena almost gnashed her teeth with frustration he was in love the gods be cursed her son was in love and there would be no reasoning with him still if she could show up the chit for the unsuitable creature she was then perhaps odenathus would see reason a bedawi girl princess of palmyra never the meal was fairly plain beginning with artichokes in olive oil and tarragon vinegar followed by baby lamb broiled thrush on asparagus green beans and cabbage sprouts and finished with a silver bowl of peaches and green grapes the prince could hardly take his eyes from zenobia much to his mothers consternation and deliciaes resignation zenobia ate heartily of the beautifully cooked meal while the others could only eat sparingly after the last of the dishes had been cleared away and the wine goblets refilled a troupe of dancing girls and a jongleur entertained deliciae saw how desperately odenathus longed to be with the beautiful girl he desired for a wife and so as the dancing girls ran from the dining room she rose saying would you permit me to withdraw my lord i find i am quite fatigued the prince smiled gratefully at her and nodded as deliciae bowed to alzena and zenobia and departed the room for a few more minutes they reclined in silence odenathus waiting for his mother to withdraw when it finally became apparent that she was not going to do so he stood and holding his hand out to zenobia said come my gardens are justly famous you will excuse us mother i expect you will want to retire now for it is quite late zenobia put her hand in the princes and rose i should very much like to see your gardens my lord prince without a backward glance at alzena odenathus swept zenobia outdoors into a vast and darkened garden here and there torches blazed along the paths but it was virtually impossible to see zenobia could not resist a chuckle i hope you know where you are going she teased him i should hate to end up in a fish pond he stopped and swinging her around looked into her face i want to kiss you he said fiercely how beautiful she looked with the torchlight flickering molten gold across her features what her heart began to hammer wildly and she felt almost afraid looking into his handsome face her gray eyes widened slightly with surprise i want to kiss you he repeated if you were any other girl i should not even ask oh her voice was suddenly very small and as he looked at her a slow smile crossed odenathuss face you are like the fresh breeze that blows across the city at sunset my flower one hand moved from her shoulders to encircle her slender waist to draw her hard against him the other scalded up her neck and face to tangle in the jet silk of her hair his dark head dipped his mouth brushing lightly and swiftly across hers sending small shock waves racing through her body as she desperately struggled with herself to regain control over her emotions zenobia his voice caressed her name and she shivered what was he doing to her how could the sound of his voice saying her name render her breathless zenobia her legs felt weak and she fell back slightly against the encircling brace of his arm his head was poised above hers for a brief moment and then it came swiftly down and his lips closed over hers his mouth was warm and smooth and hard but zenobia innocent as she was to kisses felt his restraint he kissed her gently with great tenderness his lips drawing the very essence of her from her untutored body deep within her core she felt the ache begin she longed for something but she knew not what and when after what seemed an eternity he finally lifted his lips from hers she murmured more he looked upon her his brown eyes almost liquid with his passion oh zenobia you have intoxicated me he said softly and then he kissed her again this time his kiss was less gentle but she felt no fear only a desperate longing to know more he parted her lips his tongue seeking learning the velvet softness of her mouth she wantedshe wanted she knew not what only that she didnt want him to stop she shivered deliciously as he sucked for a moment on her little tongue and then she nestled closer against him her young breasts taut with a groan of impatience he thrust her away from him you are so young my flower he said softly it was almost a reproach have i displeased you she was distressed he could see come he took her hand and they began to walk again through the darkened garden you do not displease me zenobia in fact you please me mightily at this moment i very much want to make love to you then let us make love she said simply i have never been with a man before but both tamar and bab say it is a natural and good thing between a man and woman i am not afraid my lord prince he smiled in the darkness no woman i believe should make love to a man for whom she doesnt care for whom she has no feelings that my flower is immoral i have never made love to a woman who did not love me a little tonight you have barely been awakened to the sensual side of your nature and you long to know more you do not yet know me zenobia there is time for us i promise you you make me feel like a child she pouted you are a child he said but there will come a night when you and i care for one another and then zenobia i shall make you a woman fully aware of her passionate powers she sighed i must be content with your judgment then my lord prince for i know naught of such matters odenathus laughed softly i think i shall enjoy this small submission for i suspect that you seldom defer to anyone i know that i am not like other women she said defensively if you truly want me my lord prince then you must accept me as i am i do not know if i can change nor if i choose to do so i want you as you are even if i suspect that my desert flower has thorns he stopped for a moment tipped her face to his and kissed her again sending a pleasurable thrill through her please learn to love me zenobia i ache to love you love me she said or make love to me both he admitted she gave him a quick kiss in return you are an honest man she said i believe that we can be friends and friends i have been told make the best lovers odenathus was amused she was quite serious and he had never met a female who was so delightfully interesting why do you not use my name zenobia he asked you call me my lord prince but you never say my name you have not given me permission to use your name my lord prince i may be naught but a bedawi girl but i have manners she paused and in the dark he could not see the twinkle in her eyes besides i do not like your name you do not like my name he was astounded it is a very serious almost pompous name my lord prince if we are to be married you cannot keep calling me my lord prince it is not settled that we are to be married she said calmly besides i do not think of you as odenathus septimius my lord prince he could hear the teasing laughter in her voice and with the same spirit he entered into her little game we will be married my flower never fear i am going to teach you to like me to love me and to call me by my name he paused if you cannot call me odenathus then what will you call me in public i shall call you my lord prince but in private you shall be hawk for you look like that bird to me with your long straight nose and your piercing dark gaze he was flattered beyond measure as she had known he would be so i am hawk to you he chuckled do you fancy to tame this wild bird my flower one should never tame wild things my hawk one should gain their trust and respect become their friend as you and i shall do once again she had surprised him and he grinned to himself hawk i shall be if it pleases you zenobia but now it is late come and i will return you to your quarters taking her hand he moved through the dark gardens with the surefootedness of a camel traveling a familiar trail they entered the palace and she followed him up an almost hidden staircase and found herself in the hallway outside her own rooms they stopped before the large double doors can you ride a horse he said yes be ready at dawn he said and turning strode off down the corridor for a moment she watched him go and then his figure in its long white tunic disappeared around a corner zenobia sighed and stood for a moment before her door then one of the soldiers guarding her apartment leaned over and opened the door with a blush she hurried into her rooms and closed the door behind her as bab hurried forward it went well my baby for the first time in her life zenobia did not want to talk to her dearest servant what had been between herself and the prince was something she did not choose to share with anyone it went well bab good good the older woman approved sensing that if she did not give bab something more the servant would continue to pry zenobia said i am to go riding at dawn with the prince bab was successfully diverted dawn yes zenobia feigned a yawn within minutes zenobia found herself undressed and in bed to her delight she was alone for bab had been allocated a separate small room off her antechamber she stretched out in the comfortable bed wiggling her toes in delight beneath the fine silk coverlet her mind busy with thoughts everyone said she had a choice about this marriage but the truth was that it was a choice already made marriage to palmyras prince would make her a woman of property and a person of importance all she had to do was produce the next ruler of palmyra he was a gentle man the prince like her father he seemed to genuinely care what she felt and what she thought there was no real choice and yet was it that terrible a fate she turned restlessly in her bed remembering his kissesand what they had done to her in a way those kisses had frightened her for they had rendered her so helpless she hadnt known what was expected of her she had never allowed a man to kiss her before the young men of her tribe had wanted to often enough seeking to catch her alone or entrap her in a tight place but she had always escaped their seeking mouths their eager hands using violence if necessary for she was no mans toy and never would be he had held her gently tasting of her lips just enough to arouse her curiosity which she suspected was exactly what he had intended he had touched her nowhere else and yet she knew from bab and tamars prattle that a man liked to fondle a womans body why hadnt he touched her was there something wrong or displeasing about her body wide awake again zenobia rose from her bed and walked out onto the portico overlooking the garden and the city distracted she paced back and forth for some minutes what was wrong with her to her complete surprise she was near to tears where was her hawk now had he left her at her door only to go to deliciaes arms two tears rolled down her cheeks and she brushed them away furiously why should she care what he did zenobia his voice sounded in her ear and startled she cried out strong arms wrapped around her and to her horror she burst into tears sobbing wildly against his bare chest he let her cry and when at last her weeping began to abate he lifted her up in his arms and carried her back into her bedchamber sitting on the edge of her couch he cradled her against him why do you cry my little flower are you homesick nno what is it then i thought you had gone to deliciae i have not sought deliciaes bed for months i go to her apartments to see our children do not tell on me though zenobia or you shall ruin my reputation he was close to laughterjoyous laughter she cared she cared enough to weep when she thought him with another woman still he must not press her too closely though her slim hand caressing the back of his neck was maddening where did you come from she asked him my chambers are next to yours my flower came the reply the portico is mine to walk upon too and i also found it difficult to sleep she was suddenly aware of his bare chest of the fact that he wore nothing but a wrap of cloth about his loins of the fact that she was practically naked herself in her sheer white cotton chemise it was something that had not escaped the princes notice and he could feel his manhood rising to meet the challenge of her beautiful body he moved to put her away but her arms tightened about his neck zenobia his voice held a plea love me a litde she said softly he shuddered zenobia my flower have mercy i am only a man love me a little hawk she repeated and then she moved her body in such a way that her chemise fell open she shrugged the flimsy garment off her shoulders and it fell to her waist baring her round full breasts the sight was a glorious one and for a moment he closed his eyes and invoked the gods to aid him he ached to possess this lovely girl who taunted him so his hands itched to caress her but he tried to practice restraint in the face of incredible temptation then her hand reached down caught at one of his and lifted it up to one of her breasts zenobia he groaned zenobia but his hand was already responding to the soft warm flesh beneath it oh hawk she murmured against his ear do you not want me even a little do you want me he managed to gasp her breasts were like young pomegranates firm and full in his hand i hurt she responded inside of me mere is an awful ache and i do not understand it is desire you feel my flower he let his eyes stray down catching his bream as he saw me full glory of her breasts the nipples were large and round the color of dark honey he longed to taste me sweetness of her flesh but now was not the time he had been quite serious when he had told her he had never made love to a woman who did not care for him she would be his wife but he would give her time to adjust time to learn to love him he wanted that love for he knew that zenobia had never given her heart let alone her body to any man she was yet a child for all her voluptuousness of form and facility of mind and it was the woman he looked forward to knowing a woman that he would help to shape and mold he held the girl child his own desires successfully under control now as he gently caressed her crooning soft words of comfort in her little ear his tenderness had the proper effect and she quieted soon falling asleep against his shoulder when her breathing was calm and even he stood and turning carefully placed her upon her bed drawing the silken coverlet over her he stood for a long minute looking down on her drinking in her loveliness and then with a sigh of regret he blew out the lamp and left the room he stood out on the portico gripping the balustrade his eyes sightless not even aware that the desert night had grown cool how long would he have to wait he wanted this girl by his side he wanted to share his whole life with her the burdens as well as the good things he somehow believed that zenobias shoulders were strong enough to bear some of his load treading a path between the romans and his warlike persian neighbors to the east was not an easy task especially when he also had his own commercial community to satisfy it was up to palmyra to keep the caravans safe then too there was the other woman in his life his mother the prince grimaced the only favor alzena had ever done him was to give him life and even that had been done grudgingly he had heard the stories of his birth and how she had fought against becoming a mother right up to the last minute it had been said that if she had cooperated his birth would have been an easy one but she had not and consequently had injured herself making it impossible to ever have another child his father had never forgiven her but then neither of his parents had loved the other theirs had been a political marriage and it was said his mother had resisted the match being in love with a prince at the persian court it was also said that his father had been forced to rape her on their wedding night and that he had been conceived then both his parents had loved him but his father had not allowed him much time with alzena it was not until his fathers death that he had come to know her better but by then he was eighteen and a man grown still he had recognized her unhappiness seen what havoc a loveless marriage could bring and vowed that never would he touch an unwilling woman he had even tried to make friends with her but she became possessive and even destructive consequently he gave lip service to his filial duty and kept his own counsel he was clever though and so openly solicitous of his mother that she believed she had won him over and was constantly advising him attempting to interfere in the government of palmyra a task for which she was singularly unsuited the hardest part of it all was that he had no one to talk to to share this burden the sudden sound of the water clock dripping the minutes away reminded him of the lateness of the hour turning he walked back into his own bedchamber lay down and with habit born of great discipline fell quickly asleep when the desert dawn came reaching across the sands with fingers of molten flame tinting the land apricot and gold two figures rode from the city black silhouettes against the colorful morning sky odenathus had personally chosen a spirited arab mare for zenobia the mare was white as was his own big stallion and newly broken zenobia was her first mistress what is her name the girl asked as they rode from palmyra she has none as yet my flower it will be up to you to name her as she is my first gift to you she is mine her voice was incredulous with delight she is yours he repeated letting his eyes stray to her long legs bare beneath her short chiton he was going to have to do something about that for he wanted no man ogling those lovely legs i am going to call her alula zenobia said happily he smiled and nodded his approval alula meant the first in the arabic tongue it is a good name and youre clever to think of it my flower what is your stallion called ashur the warlike one he replied and is he warlike i am unable to keep any other stallions in my stables he has already killed two now i keep but geldings and mares ill race you she challenged him not today my flower alula is but newly broken and will need time to become used to you besides i must return for i have a full schedule today may i come with you it will be far more interesting than chatting with the women i am not used to sitting about doing nothing but painting my toenails and soaking in a perfumed tub he chuckled sympathetically when you are my wife you may come with me zenobia hades she realized she would be forced to remain in the womens quarters caught between alzena and deliciae he read her thoughts and chuckled at her discomfiture ah my poor flower caught between the wasp and the butterfly how did you know what i was thinking she demanded the look on your face was stronger than any words you could have spoken he replied if you become my wife zenobia i will not pen you in a harem i promise you you will be free to come and go as you please for i will do what no prince of palmyra has ever done for his princess i will make you my equal i dont want to live in the womens quarters she said suddenly if i become your wife i want my own house within the palace i would choose my own servants and purchase my own slaves i want no spies in my household she drew her mare to a halt the sun was now risen and the sky was bright blue and cloudless for as far as the eye could see following her lead he stopped his stallion and turned to face her i am unschooled at playing games hawk she said quietly let us be frank with each other you wish to marry me and my father has agreed to it but how soon depends on me for both you and my father have understood my need to accept this marriage my father believes that you are the right man for me and because of the great love he bore my mother he would have me happy i am fortunate not many men would understand my feelings i am also fortunate in his choice of a husband for me for you too understand that i cannot be fettered i must be free you have been kind to me and i believe that i am beginning to care for you the things that i shall ask of you will not be difficult i understand he answered her and you may have anything that is within my power to give you zenobia ah hawk you make very rash promises she teased one should never agree to anything until one has heard all the terms would you teach me my flower can you not learn from a woman came the sharp retort do you love me a little he demanded do you love me hawk i think i fell in love with you on the day your mother was killed you were so confused and hurt and frightened i wanted to reach out then and hold you in my arms but i was prince of palmyra and you but the child of my cousin it was not meet that i comfort you greatly though i wanted to zenobia she was very surprised by this confession and quite pleased as well still he must not be allowed to become sure of her both tamar and bab said that a woman should never allow a man to become too confident i hope you are not going to tell me you spent the three and a half years since my mothers death pining for me for i shall not believe you hawk i forgot completely about you my flower he said bluntly pleased with the outraged gasp that followed his statement the little minx was suddenly too sure of herself and had his father not warned him never to let a woman become too confident then how can you say you love me i loved the child that day and when i saw the lovely girl she had become i fell in love all over again i will never lie to you zenobia i love you he reached out and took her hand in his oh my flower i do love you have pity on this poor prince who would lay his heart and his kingdom at your feet when are we to wed just a little time she pleaded i cannot wait long zenobia i am a lonely man and i long to have you by my side to love to talk with to share with he could have said nothing more calculated to win her over i will marry you as soon as the priests permit she answered him and when his eyebrows lifted in surprise at her sudden decision she smiled you need me my hawk have you not just said it our marriage has been a fact since you and my father agreed upon it only the date has remained in doubt logic tells me if i was distressed by the thought of your being with deliciae last night then i must love you a little even if i cannot admit it to my self yet oh zenobia he said i wonder at the woman you will become why should you wonder she laughed you will be here to see he too laughed so i shall my flower so i shall then turning his horse back toward the city he said it is time we returned zenobia i will not race you but let us gallop a way so alula may show you her paces before his words had died on the wind she wheeled the mare about and was off surprisedshe was always surprising him he put spurs to ashur and followed her together they thundered down the barely visible desert road leading back to palmyra the horses hooves stirring up tiny puffs of yellow dust he watched her bent low over her mount tendrils of her windloosened hair blowing about her face what a glorious creature she was this girlwoman who was so soon to be his wife as they came through the main entry into the large courtyard the guards at the palace gates were hard pressed not to grin at one another in pure delight leaping lightly from her mount zenobia cried out triumphantly i beat you we werent racing he replied werent we her gaze was mocking but then she turned and again laughing a soft provocative laugh ran into the building he felt a quickening in his loins and then he chuckled their wedding day could not come soon enough to suit him despite his crowded day he intended seeing zabaai ben selim before the sun set and settling with him the details of his betrothal to zenobia a public announcement would be made the next day and then the little minx would be committed purposefully he strode across the courtyard to his own section of the palace soon he thought soon my flower and then neither of us shall ever be lonely again for we shall have each other forever forever he liked the sound of the word palmyra queen city of the eastern empire lay almost halfway between the equally ancient city of baghdad and the blue mediterranean sea it was said to have been founded by solomon a fact of which the palmyrans were mightily proud built upon and around the great oasis where the major caravan routes between east and west crossed it was the city through which all the riches of the world passed en route west to europe or east to persia cathay and the indies greeks and romans syrians and jews arab merchants of all tribes gathered here building great storehouses and warehouses in which safely to keep the silks carpets spices ivory jewels grain and dates that passed through their hands they built luxurious villas in which to house their families as well as their concubines for as all inanimate valuables arrived in palmyra so did the choicest of the worlds slaves the architects of the city had a passion for columns and all the major buildings were adorned with them about the central courtyard of one temple were raised three hundred seventy graceful colonnades and upon projecting stones half way up each column stood statues of palmyras most famous men the citys main avenue was lined on each side with two rows of pillars seven hundred and fifty to a side and the temple of jupiter had a milelong colonnade consisting of fifteen hundred corinthian columns the city had been built for merchants by a wise king and a thousand years later it was still firmly controlled by commercial interests the main business and shopping streets were all covered over so even in the heat of a summer noon one could conduct his business in relative comfort although not prone to attack due to its inaccessible location palmyrans had raised around the city a wall seven miles long to discourage the boldness of desert raiders this was the kingdom over which zenobia bat zabaai would soon reign as wife to its prince zabaai ben selim was suddenly and for the first time really considering the serious responsibility he was placing upon his only daughters shoulders he sat comfortably in odenathuss private library a carved alabaster goblet of fine cyrenean wine clutched in his hand behind him a deafmute black slave plied a large woven palm fan creating just enough breeze to ease the still heat of the late afternoon as he had come into the city today he had looked at it as if for the first time in his entire life when one is used to something one sees with dulled eyes he thought he had been born here on this oasis and the city had always been a part of his life today he had really looked and what he had seen made him think it was not just the magnificent architecture of the city but the marvelous parks kept green by the oasiss underground springs that suddenly stunned zabaai the intellect behind the creation of the city was overwhelming zenobia he knew would not be content simply to be an ornament and a broodmare what part would she play he wondered in the government of this city palmyran princesses were famed for their beauty not their administrative abilities he shook his head wearily had his ambition for his beloved child outstripped his good sense zabaai my cousin odenathus hurried into the room his white robes whirling about him forgive me for keeping you waiting i have been comfortable in these pleasant surroundings my lord prince i have asked you here so we may discuss the terms of this marriage before i call in the scribes what will you give as dowry i shall give a thousand purebred goats five hundred white and five hundred black there will be two hundred and fifty fighting camels and a hundred arabian horses not to mention jewelry clothing household goods and the deed to her mothers house the prince was astounded by the magnificence of zenobias dowry never had he suspected that it would be so large but then her father could easily afford it for his herds were enormous the dowry agreement was drawn up by the princes scribe who set his quill flying across the parchment as each point was stated a transfer of goods between the brides father and her husband would make odenathus zenobias legal lord according to the bedawi laws but the prince was hellenized as had been zenobias mother and the bride herself they would be married in the atrium of zabaais home the exact date depending on the omens to be taken this very evening by the temple priests alzena was sent for and she and the princes greek secretary witnessed the signing of the document of betrothal and the formal words in which odenathus said to his future fatherinlaw do you promise to give me your daughter as wife may the gods grant their blessing i promise zabaai said may the gods grant their blessing odenathus finished so alzena said sourly you are really going to do it you disapprove of this match my princess do not be offended zabaai ben selim i think your daughter a sweet child but i cannot see the necessity for my son to marry he already has children palmyra has never been governed by a bastard line came the sharp reply surely you must know the law odenathus hid a smile as his mother very discomfited replied stiffly you have always been most outspoken zabaai ben selim i can only hope your daughter does not take after you zenobia is herself she will be a credit to the city indeed alzena snapped and she turned and abruptly left the library zabaai ben selim smiled blandly at the prince and said you will want to see zenobia before we leave it was a statement leavethe prince was somewhat taken aback now that the betrothal is official my lord zenobia must return home she cannot stay here in the palace under the circumstances she will return on her wedding day you may not see each other until then but i thought we might spend this time getting to know one another better he protested disappointed alas custom demands we be discreet came the reply whose customs odenathus demanded ancient bedawi customs my lord was the silken answer there will be plenty of time for you and my daughter to get to know one another after the wedding i will have the priests from the temple of jupiter sacrifice a lamb this very night to determine the date the prince said but first i will go to zenobia and bid her farewell i will await your return my lord settling back in his chair zabaai held out his goblet for the slave to refill he watched with dancing dark eyes as the young man hurried from the room how very eager he was and a brief separation would whet his appetite even further for this marriage alzena might carp and complain but zabaai wagered with himself that odenathuss few sweet memories of zenobia would spur him eagerly on toward their wedding day odenathus did not go directly to the apartments where zenobia was housed first he stopped at his treasury walking into the roomy jewelry vault he carefully selected a ring that would be his betrothal gift to his future wife it was not a hard choice for he had seen the ring months before when it had been discovered by his treasurer in a rotting leather bag hidden on a back shelf the treasurer had been quite excited saying that the ring was one sent to king solomon from shebas queen as a token of her affection and was catalogued in the ancient records of the treasury having made his choice the prince hurried to find zenobia he was met however in the apartments anteroom by bab the older woman looked him up and down nodding approvingly she is just come from her bath highness if you will wait but a minute my lady will be fit to receive you my thanks bab odenathus replied courteously he instinctively liked this small round woman in her simple robe her graying hair hidden beneath its veil her face was brown from the desert sun and there were deep laugh lines carved about her black eyes and on either side of her mouth you will be good for my child the woman said with the quiet assurance of a beloved servant i already love her bab i want her to be happy be firm my lord firm but gentle can one be firm with zenobia he teased bab chuckled appreciatively but before she could answer zenobia entered the room odenathuss eyes were immediately riveted to the girl oblivious to all else smiling bab slipped from the room and left the lovers alone he could scarce take his eyes from her flushed and rosy from the bath the faint hyacinth scent clinging to her unbound hair her simple white tunic for a moment he stood powerless to move then he heard her voice my lord the spell broken he reached out and pulled her almost roughly into his arms one arm held her firmly against his hungry body the other hand tangled in her soft hair drawing her head to his bending he let his lips brush hers lightly and was satisfied to feel a faint tremor rush through her oh zenobia he murmured kissing the corners of her mouth her closed and fluttering eyelids then his lips found hers and as his kisses deepened her arms slipped up and about his neck her lithe young body pressed as hungrily against his enchanted by her budding passion he ran his tongue over her lips which parted instinctively tenderly he explored the fragrant cavity of her mouth the hand that had earlier held her head now moved to caress her breasts the ache that had so mysteriously materialized the night before reappeared to taunt her it swept over her from out of nowhere leaving her breathless and confused his thumb rubbed insistently against the already stiff peaks of her nipples and she wanted to cry with the strange pleasure that it gave her it was so new so wonderful this marvelous sensation that was called love after what seemed the briefest eternity he released her and for a moment she swayed dangerously but finally her head cleared and she grew steady once more she heard his voice coming at her from what seemed a long way off but the words were clear your father and i have signed a formal betrothal agreement my flower but zabaai says you must leave the palace before the public announcement is made tomorrow we cannot see each other until our wedding day but why she burst out disappointed custom he says for a minute her lips clamped shut and then she said it must be as my father has decreed her obedience pleased him i have brought you the traditional gift he said taking her left hand up and placing the ring upon the third finger whose nerve it was said ran directly to the heart zenobia stared down at the large round black pearl in its simple gold setting it is incredible she said softly i have never possessed such a ring my treasurer says that it is listed in a catalogue of gifts sent from the queen of sheba to solomon when he was here in palmyra overseeing the construction of the city i knew that it would be perfect for you my flower it glows against the warm apricot tint of your skin he turned over her hand which he had yet to relinquish and placed a tender kiss upon the palm sending delighted little tingles down zenobias spine suddenly shy she withdrew her hand from his his mouth captured hers again in a swift kiss oh my zenobia he murmured his breath warm against her ear so sure of herself in everything but love i will teach you to understand those feelings that assail you and even frighten you a little i will teach you to love and be loved in return there will be no fear or hesitation between us my flower and we will trust each other only his lips caressed hers lightly once more i love you zenobia i love you she had never come so close to fainting in her entire life and clinging to him childlike she whispered breathlessly i love you also my hawk i do saying the words seemed to bring a strange relief neither of them heard the door to the antechamber open and are you ready to leave yet my daughter zabaai ben selim stood there smiling benignly almost guiltily they sprang apart and blushing zenobia said i must change into my chiton father no odenathus replied i will return you to your home in a litter i would prefer that you did not ride with bare legs for all to see to zabaai ben selims surprise zenobia bowed her head in assent and moved to his side i am ready then father the bedawi chief could only think to say bab will come later with your things my daughter but she was already moving past him and out the door i will send you word as to the date of the wedding late tonight my cousin the prince said and the bedawi chief nodded his assent as he followed his daughter from the room just before sunset in the temple of jupiter the high priest slaughtered a pure white lamb after gazing at the smoking entrails he announced that the most propitious time for the nuptials would be but ten days hence receiving word from the royal messenger zabaai ben selim smiled to himself wondering how large a gift odenathus had donated to the temple in order to receive such a desirable verdict concerning the date of his marriage the coming celebration was announced to the public the following day and the citizens of palmyra rejoiced in the roman governors palace antonius porcius blandus still the empires representative took the news less cheerfully hades he said in an annoyed voice to his visitor i had hoped he would remain satisfied with his little greek concubine had he died without a legitimate heir rome might have the city completely and unopposed we have the city the governors visitor said as long as palmyra has a legitimate ruler there is always a chance of uprising antonius porcius retorted i had been led to believe that odenathus is totally loyal to rome was the reply oh he is loyal it is his bride that i fear what a vixen he has picked marcus alexander zenobia bat zabaai half alexandrian greek and egyptian half bedawi savage some gaulish auxiliary alae murdered her mother four years ago and she has hated the romans with a passion ever since small wonder the other man murmured you do not know this girl the governor protested she sat in the midst of the men who were responsible and for over eighteen hours she watched them die she was but a child and yet she sat as still and as cold as a statue as she watched their agony there was no pity in her a man in love is a fickle creature and odenathus is i am told totally enamored she could influence him against us i think you put too much importance on the marriage of a petty princeling and a halfcaste girl antonius porcius no girl will defeat and destroy the empire there have been men who tried and they have all failed rome is and will always be invincible the governor sighed why was it that romans never understood antonius porcius thought bitterly i know the east and its peoples unless love has softened that hardeyed child i remember she will bear watching he turned his attention to his dinner guest marcus alexander britainus the wealthy son of a roman patrician and his british wife lucius alexander britainus had been a roman governor in britain who had married a powerful local chieftains daughter marcus alexander was their eldest son a younger son aulus had already inherited his maternal grandfathers estates and responsibilities in britain there were two sisters lucia and eusebia who were married to prominent romans and already settled matrons marcus alexander was not married he had already served in the army and now he was coming to palmyra to set up a trading business that would bring the goods of the east to britain where his younger brother would market them a strange business for the son of an eminent roman patricians usually amused themselves in lighter pursuits still the early romans had been diligent and industrious the governor could not help but wonder if in addition to his business marcus alexander would be the governments unofficial eyes and ears there had been talk of allowing prince odenathus to govern for rome when he antonius retired in a few years although the prince still ran the city with the exception of minor judicial matters it was all done under the governors direction the young palmyran ruler had proved extremely friendly and trustworthy and why not thought antonius porcius roman legions kept the persians at bay rome however was not apt to allow odenathus totally free rein there would be someone sent to watch and the governor suspected that marcus alexander was that person by the time odenathus was given alleged control marcus alexander would be a part of palmyran life and no one would suspect him at all never in all the history of romeeither as republic or empirehad the alexander family been implicated in any kind of disloyalty they were romans first and always marcus was an attractive man thought the governor although he had inherited his british mothers coloring and height he was tall by any standards measuring several inches over six feet his hair was the warm burnished color of a chestnut his eyes a bright almost startling blue rimmed in outrageously thick lashes of the same color as his hair he had a firm and wellmuscled body in proportion with his great height he was obviously not a man who lolled about the banquet table his only exercise the lifting of a wine goblet antonius porcius could not help but notice marcus alexanders hands they were large and square yet the fingers were slender and tapering the hands bespoke power but at the same time gentleness the governor had not a moments doubt that the women of palmyra would flock to the newcomers bed for the attractive body was topped by a handsome face of classic elegance marcus alexander might have his british antecedents size and coloring but he had his fathers features the face was oval with a squaredoff chin and jawline the forehead was high the nose pure roman long and aquiline the piercing blue eyes were set well apart the mouth was sensuously big and yet the lips were narrow thenexpression faintly mocking faintly amused those lips now spoke you are staring antonius porcius is there something amiss what no no marcus alexander nothing is wrong i was simply thinking how like your father you are in features i served with him for a time in britain wretched climate britain i could never get warm there and here in palmyra ill wager you can never get cool came the teasing reply the governor chuckled drily these old bones of mine prefer the heat of the east to the damp of britain and gaul marcus alexander swished the falernian wine about in his goblet do you really think this marriage will be a dangerous thing for rome he paused then said quietly perhaps the girl should be eliminated before the event even takes place antonius porcius felt an icy chill sweep over him he chose his words carefully zenobia bat zabaai does not like rome or romans it is true but i suspect that you are correct she is but a slip of a girl what real harm can she do an empire she will be kept busy in her husbands bed and in the nursery for many years to come and then she will be so busy with her grandchildren that her life will be gone before she has time to think of revenging against rome for her mothers death i am growing old marcus alexander and sometimes see shadows where none exist and thought the governor i certainly do not want that girls death on my conscience better you are too cautious than not cautious enough will you be going to the wedding oh yes the palmyrans have long been hellenized it will be a traditional confarreate ceremony celebrated in the atrium of zabaai ben selims house and after the banquet the bridal procession will wind back through the city to the brides new home at the palace its really no different from rome perhaps i shall stand with the crowd outside the brides house to see her when she leaves was the reply she is very beautiful the governor said perhaps by eastern standards marcus alexander said i myself prefer blondes so did odenathus antonius porcius said until he saw zenobia indeed the governors guest was thoughtful i shall most certainly then want to see the bride although girls on their wedding day have a glow about them that gives beauty even to the most unattractive of females then see her before her wedding day the governor said mischievously she has returned to her fathers house and is in the habit of riding in the desert early each morning perhaps if you too ride early you will see her marcus alexander was curious and so the next morning he rose before dawn and followed the caravan road a small distance into the desert waiting behind a dune he watched as the sun began to color the sky and reflect onto the vast sands his patience was finally rewarded and his ears pricked at the sound of drumming hoofbeats into sight came a magnificent white arabian galloping flatout along the track and on the horses back low and almost at one with it was a rider who slowly drew the sweating animal to a halt then straightened marcus alexander caught his breath it was a girl but what a girl long bare legs full breasts and a face that could only be described as the most beautiful he had ever seen he had never imagined that a woman could be that lovely when he moved his horse out into view from behind the dune she turned slowly to gaze at him haughtily good morning he said zenobia nodded silently to the giant of a man who had so suddenly materialized before her i am marcus alexander britainus lateiy come to palmyra i am zenobia bat zabaai do you always ride alone zenobia bat zabaai dont you marcus alexander was the disconcerting reply i am a man so i have noted good morning marcus alexander she urged her horse forward wait he caught at the white mares bridle but zenobia was faster and yanked the horses head away causing the animal to rear up bringing her mount under control zenobia turned her full attention on the man before her her gray eyes were almost black in their fury and her voice though controlled was filled with anger never touch an animal im riding again marcus alexander never you greeted me and the laws of hospitality demanded that i do so in return but i do not like romans i especially do not like blueeyed romans blueeyed romans murdered my mother four years ago after they had broken into our home and used her for their pleasure i ride alone through choice now get out of my way i wish to ride on your pardon zenobia bat zabaai i regret that my personal appearance brings back painful memories for you i meant no offense but i am new to palmyra and although i enjoy riding i am not certain i would not get lost in your desert i merely sought the privilege of riding with you so i might grow familiar with the track she felt guilty for her outburst but she had no intention of either backing down from her stand or of letting the roman know that her conscience had been pricked it is best that you not ride in the desert without an escort marcus alexander there are always marauding persians or a renegade bedawi or two looking for a foolish traveler to rob and murder they do not distinguish between romans and other peoples for it makes no difference to them whose throat they slit or whose purse they cut as she sat stiffly proudly staring at him the thought flitted through her mind that he was a very attractive man perhaps the most handsome man shed ever seen instantly she felt contrite it was her hawk who was the most handsome man in the world marcus alexander had the most incredible urge to lift zenobia from her horse and kiss that scornful mouth until it softened but he did not he could not jeopardize his position in palmyra and making love to the princes bridetobe would certainly do that instead he nodded and said you are probably correct zenobia bat zabaai i would do well to return to the city immediately and then because he could not resist it he said for all i know you are one of those women used to lure the unsuspecting traveler to his doom it gave him great satisfaction to hear the furious gasp of outrage behind him as he rode off a beautiful girl he thought a bitter girlbut who could blame her antonius porcius had simply said that zenobias mother had been killed by roman legionnaires he had said nothing of rape poor girl this was certainly not the time to explain the differences to her between renegade gauls and romanized britons like himself he rode a short distance then turned his head to look back she had whipped her horse into a gallop and was tearing across the desert at an incredible speed marcus alexander chuckled to himself he liked a woman with real spirit he worked hard during the next few days driven by the exslave who was to be his righthand man severus had been his tutor as a boy but when his father offered to free the man severus had asked to remain in the service of the alexander family it was a request they could not deny and from that day on severus had learned from lucius alexander the ways of business he had arrived in palmyra two months before marcus alexander to purchase a villa and warehouse now marcus alexander had to take the reins though he strove to concentrate his mind was constantly being interrupted by visions of a longlegged girl as spirited as the white mare she rode it came as something of a shock to him to realize that he wanted her because he could not have her marcus alexander son of lucius wealthy handsome and since birth denied nothing within reason had fallen in love seriously for the first time in his twentyfive years as the appointed day for the wedding grew closer the excitement within the house of zabaai ben selim rose to a fever pitch though none of zabaais women except tamar had ever paid the slightest attention to zenobia all now wanted to help wanted to take the place of the brides mother each advised her as many times daily as they could get near her each attempted to choose her manner of dress and each bitterly resented the interference of the others zenobia became as a choice piece of meat to be haggled over by the women in the market she was finally forced to beg her father to tell his women that she wanted only tamar to help her tamar who was her friend would be the brides mother and no other zenobia was finally left in peace on the evening before the marriage zenobia took the small locket that her mother had given her when she was born and laid it on the altar of the household gods these gods had watched over her childhood but tomorrow that childhood would be gone never to return and so she laid upon the altar in solemn sacrifice the last vestige of her early years had she been younger she would also have brought her toys but those had long since been discarded as she stood quietly in the little family garden that enclosed the altar she prayed for her mother and wished that by some miracle known only to the gods themselves that iris would be by her side tomorrow tamar and bab were both so good to her that she almost felt guilty but for the first time in many months she missed her mother terribly it was not so much iriss golden beauty she recalled but rather the sweet smell of her perfume the gentle touch of her hand the swish of her long skirts when she left zenobias room at night she remembered the beautiful woman who always had time to explain who hugged easily and without the least hint of embarrassment who laughed happily to see her daughter and her husband together playing a tear slipped down zenobias cheek and then another until her face was wet with sorrow across the garden bab saw the girls shoulders shaking with her grief and made to go to her but tamar held her back no said zabaai ben selims surviving wife she has never really cried since iriss death and she needs to weep let her leave her sorrow behind with the rest of her childhood things bab nodded you are right of course but how i hate to see her hurt if i could i would shield her from all the evil in life you would do her no favor then bab zenobia must face everything that comes her way by herself if she does not know evil when she encounters it how will she deal with it i know i know besides i babble foolishness who has ever been able to shield zenobia from anything bab replied let us go inside tamar replied soon our child will come to try on her wedding garment for luck she must not know that we have observed her in a private moment the two women returned to their quarters and awaited the girl whom they both loved so they might share this traditional time with her that her own mother could not both believed however that iris watched from the paradise within the underworld to which the just are confined sleep was elusive for zenobia that night like any young bridetobe she was both fearful and excited about the morrows events the tantalizing moments that she had had with the prince those two weeks back had only increased her curiosity when she finally dozed it was only to awaken with a start remembering a confused jumble of a dream in which a roman had gazed upon her with mocking blue eyes zenobia sat up trembling wondering if the shade of her mothers murderer had come to haunt her on this the night before her marriage then she remembered the roman marcus alexander britainus whom she had met in the desert a few days earlier he had been the man in her dream puzzled she wondered why she had dreamed of him with a confused little shake of her head she lay back down to rest and fell into a light sleep in the hour before dawn the public augur arrived and a young ewe was sacrificed the omens were considered most favorable the house of zabaai ben selim was decorated with a multitude of flowers the boughs of palm trees colorful bands of wool that had been entwined about the pillars and exquisite tapestries hung all about the atrium where the ceremony would take place before first light the guests began arriving in her bedchamber aided by tamar and bab zenobia completed the final preparations she had already bathed and washed her lovely black hair which was now divided into six locks with a spearshaped comb this was an ancient custom dating from the time when marriage by capture was the rule rather than the exception these locks were carefully coiled and held in place with ribbons of silver lamé the wedding gown was a white tunic of gossamer silk woven by tamar and bab the straight garment was made from a single piece of cloth and fell to zenobias feet which were shod in silver sandals the tunic was fastened around the waist with a band of wool tied in the knot of hercules for hercules was the guardian of wedded life when he became zenobias husband only odenathus would be privileged to untie this knot over her tunic the bride wore a flamecolored veil atop her head was a wreath of sweet white freesia downstairs the groom had arrived with his mother and friends he wore a silverbordered white toga and was given a wreath of white freesia matching his brides for his head the augur formally pronounced the omens as favorable the wedding was ready to begin zenobia was brought forward by tamar who had been chosen as pronuba for the ceremony zabaais wife then joined the bride and grooms hands before the guests and zenobia spoke the words of her consent to this marriage she spoke them three times once in latin once in greek and once in the aramaic dialect of her tribe so that everyone in the room might understand when and where you are gaius i then and there am gaia now the high priest from the temple of jupiter led the couple to the left of the household altar and facing it they were seated on stools covered with the skin of the sheep sacrificed earlier then a bloodless offering of a wheat cake was made to jupiter by the high priest a second cake was eaten by the bride and groom next the high priest recited prayers to juno goddess of marriage and to the gods of the countryside and its fruits the utensils necessary for the offering were carried in a covered basket by a boy called a camillus whose parents were both living zenobia had chosen for this important role her young nephew zabaai ben akbar as the ceremony concluded the guests cried felicitermeaning good luck and happiness odenathus turned zenobia to face him seeing him for the first time since she had left the palace almost two weeks ago she felt shy and blushed there was a hum of approval by those close enough to see gently he kissed her on the forehead i have missed you my flower he said so only she might hear i have missed you hawk it was the only private moment they would get for many hours to come a lavish wedding feast had been planned and it would last until evening knowing what was expected of her zenobia took her new husbands hand and together they led the guests into zabaais magnificent outdoor dining room in the back garden of the villa here dining couches and tables had been set up around a tiled court with a center fountain that shot a spray of water from the mouth of a marvelous golden sea dragon who writhed in the center of the fountain the bride and groom shared a couch at the center table while the other guests were seated according to the order of their importance the meal was divided into three parts the appetizers consisted of asparagus in oil and vinegar tuna and sliced egg on beds of lettuce oysters that had been brought overland packed in snow and thrushes roasted a golden brown and set upon beds of cress all on silver platters decorated with apricots and ripe olives the second course offered loin of goat legs of baby lamb roasted chickens ducks both domestic and wild hare great bowls of vegetables such as green beans young cabbage sprouts cauliflower imported from europe lettuce and onions radishes and cucumbers olives both green and ripe there were loaves of bread round and hot from the ovens when the main part of the meal had been cleared away crystal bowls of almonds and pistachios were set upon all the tables along with platters of green and golden pears red and purple plums peaches apricots cherries pomegranates grapes black purple and green there were sticky honey cakes shaped like butterflies and wrapped about chopped nuts and poppy seeds a wedding cake filled with raisins and currants was served and pieces of this cake were distributed to all the guests to take home for luck throughout the meal a mixture of water and wine had been served but as the desserts were being offered rich red wine was poured and repoured into eager goblets as the diners became more boisterous the entertainers appeared there were wrestlers jugglers dancing dogs and dancing girls who were very well received indeed the late morning had melted into afternoon and now suddenly evening had come the most important part of the wedding was about to take place it was essential to the validity of a marriage that the bride be escorted publicly to her husbands house with much ceremony and pomp all afternoon the crowds had been gathering outside of zabaai ben selims house and along the route that would be taken by the couple on their way back to the princes palace now with the arrival of the torchbearers and the flute players the procession began to form bab had already gone on ahead to the palace and zenobia had earlier bid the rest of her fathers household a proper farewell the marriage hymn was sung by all the guests and odenathus pretended to take zenobia by force from tamars protective embrace the bride then took her place of honor in the procession attended by her three youngest brothers two of whom walked beside her holding her hands the eldest of the three lit the way ahead with the wedding torch of hawthorn before the procession moved off into the street zabaai ben selim spoke low to his daughter remember we are your family if you need us zenobia you have but to call she smiled a radiant smile at him i will remember and pray the gods i never have need of your offer my father it is best to be prepared was his reply come my flower odenathus was by her side smiling she smiled back happily and the procession was off across the street in the crowd of wellwishers marcus alexander watched as zenobia moved away she was as beautiful as he had remembered and for the first time in his life he felt envy for another man envy for the prince of palmyra who would soon untie the knot of hercules on zenobias wedding dress and then spend the rest of the night making love to that exquisite creature would he be gentle or would he fall on the girl like a beast and frighten her he sighed he would be gentle he would caress that softerthansilk skin somehow marcus alexander knew zenobias skin would be soft until a fire raged within that beautiful body a fire to be possessed and to possess seeing the look of longing on marcus alexanders face severus realized with shock that his master had fallen in love with the new princess of palmyra there was no time to ponder it for the crowd was joining in the procession already beginning to sing songs full of coarse jests and double entendres as they accompanied the bride through the city to her new home it was the same everywhere severus thought not at all shocked princess patrician or commoner were all escorted with the same vulgar songs at the first crossroads they came to zenobia dropped a coin in offering to the gods of that place a second coin she presented to odenathus as symbol of the dowry she brought him and a third she kept to put upon the altar of her new homes household gods as they moved along the crowds scrambled to obtain some of the sweetmeats sesame cakes and nuts that the prince scattered along his route a traditional prayer for his wifes fertility it seemed as if the entire city had joined in the procession by the time they reached the palace at the main gate zenobia stopped and wound the doorposts with wool symbol of her duties as mistress of the house and anointed the door with oil and fat emblems of plenty odenathus then picked her up and carefully carried her across the threshold gently setting her back on her feet within the great atrium of the palace a final time zenobia said when and where you are gaius i then and there am gaia the doors were then closed before the invited guests odenathus offered zenobia fire and water in token of their new life together taking the marriage torch from him zenobia put it to the wood laid upon the atrium hearth and then tossed the now dead torch among her guests who scrambled eagerly for the lucky item she then recited a prayer to the gods thanking them for her good fortune and begging them that she be fruitful tamar still in her role as pronuba led zenobia to the marriage couch an ornamental piece of furniture that was always placed in the atrium on the night of the marriage and remained there afterward this was the signal for all guests to leave and shortly the bridal couple were alone for a few moments they stood in silence then the prince said are you tired my flower yes then we shall go to bed here he heard the panic in her voice as her gaze swept the large open atrium finally lighting on the large and gilded marriage couch no not here zenobia he kept his voice steady and even to reassure her you have your own house within the palace grounds we will go there now for it is there you and i shall live together is bab there not tonight my flower tonight we will be alone oh her voice was very small and her hand very cold when he took it to lead her off i hope you will be pleased with your house my flower it is not overly large for i did not think you would want a large home every workman craftsman and artisan in the city has worked for the last two weeks to build you your house it is new oh hawk i did not mean for you to go to so much trouble i wanted you to have a house that was your very own my love the structure is of sundried brick sheathed on the outside with white marble it is a simple house but it is two stories there is an atrium in the front so you may receive guests a library for me to work in a dining room facing south that we will use in winter and one facing north for the summer we need no banquet hall for the palace has several of those there is also a kitchen on the main floor and one goodsized room i thought you might enjoy using for yourself as well as a comfortable chamber for bab i thought she might enjoy being on the ground floor with not so many stairs to climb the bedchambers are on the second floor along with the baths i have chosen only a minimum amount of furniture because i thought that you might enjoy choosing your own things from the bazaars as for slaves you will choose your own but for the next few days it is only necessary that bab serve us they had exited the main palace and now walked through vast gardens already moonlit and filled with small night creatures tuning up with song they turned onto a graveled path lined in palmyran palms and at its end she saw a lovely small palace as they reached its open doors he once more picked her up and carried her over the threshold but once inside he did not put her down instead he walked through the atrium to the passageway that hid the stairs and carried her up to a bedchamber where he deposited her in the middle of the floor help me with this damned toga he said quietly surprised she obeyed i hate togas but high state occasions demand i wear them silently she took the garment and laid it carefully on a chair as she was unfamiliar with the room and did not know where the storage chests were kept he sat down and bent to unlace his sandals quickly she hurried over and knelt to aid him sliding the sandals off quietly admiring his graceful feet she started at the touch of his hand on her head you dont have to take my sandals off my flower i want to she replied i will not always be the sort of wife you want my hawk but these small things i will do for you and as long as i do you will know that i love you his hand reached down to cup her chin and raise her head up for a long moment he stared into those beautiful calm gray eyes and then his lips but brushed hers sending a little tingle through her she lowered her eyes shyly only to become suddenly aware that he now wore only a short tunica interior zenobia stared fascinated at her husbands muscled and shapely legs they were long and smooth and tanned amused he watched her for a moment he could almost sense that she wanted to touch him but was yet afraid he stood up drawing her with him his hands going to the knot of hercules that was tied about the waist of her wedding dress for several moments he struggled with it muttering under his breath as the knots puzzle eluded him who in hades tied this thing zenobia giggled tamar she obviously didnt want me to unfasten it ah mere he drew the wool band off and the tunic hung loose wordlessly he drew it over her head and put it on the same chair that held his toga adding her tunica interior before she realized he was taking it she stood stunned as he knelt and drew off her silver sandals standing back up he carefully undid the ribbons that held her long curls reaching out to take up her brush which lay set out on a nearby table he turned her about and slowly brushed her hair free of its tangles admiring its sheen and its length which ended at the base of her spine turning her about again he set her back from him and stood gazing upon her nude beauty surprised by his firm action and stunned to find herself naked before a man zenobia stood quietly under his inspection for several long moments she had absolutely no idea what he expected of herif indeed he expected anything other than compliance having studied her quite thoroughly from the front the prince walked slowly around his new wife viewing her from every possible angle my lord zenobia whispered halfafraid what do you want of me roused from his reverie he realized her discomfort and gently drew her into his arms zenobia he said softly his voice strangely thick to her ear i have seen many beautiful women in my time but never have i seen a woman as perfect as flawless as you my flower then you want me want youthe words were almost strangled in his throat i have wanted you for weeks now you little idiot i think i want you she said softly and he laughed how can you know what you want my little virgin bride i am the only man who has ever touched you but you liked it zenobia oh yes my flower you liked it just now when you knelt to take my sandals off you wanted to touch me she blushed how could you know that because i am a man and i know women he smoothed his hand down her back beneath her hair to caress and fondle a buttock surprised she jumped and he murmured against her ear no my flower dont be frightened i know how innocent you are and we will go slowly there should never be haste between a man and a woman only time to enjoy his hand tipped her face up to his and he tenderly kissed her i love you zenobia princess of palmyra he kissed the tip of her nose i love your pride and your independence he kissed her eyelids which had closed at his first sweet assault i love your beauty and your innocence but most of all i love just you my little desert flower i should not have married you had i not loved you bending slightly he swung her up in his arms and carried her across the room to lay her on their marriage bed her heart was hammering wildly in her ears and her eyes were shut tight but she heard his voice teasingly say i have studied you most carefully my darling and now i offer you the same opportunity she heard the rustle of cloth as he drew off his interior tunic open your eyes zenobia he commanded her and there was laughter in his voice a mans body is nothing to fear if anything it is amusing for it has not the beauty of form that a womans has i however think i am rather pretty as far as men go a small giggle escaped her but her eyes remained closed zenobia his voice was mockstern open your eyes i command it her eyes flew open and she sat up i will not be commanded hawk and then her gray eyes widened and she gasped ohh mischievously he grinned down at her am i not pleasing to your eye my flower he posed himself parodying the athletes in the arena she was unable to take her eyes from his body he was an inch or two taller than she was and he was beautifully formed his legs were long the calves and thighs firm and shapely he had a narrow waist that fanned upward into a broad chest and wide shoulders his arms were long and muscled and he had slender hands and long fingers his body was tanned and smooth and looking at it now she was again overcome by the desire to caress him as he had caressed her two weeks earlier she had carefully kept her eyes averted from his sex but now she let her eyes slide downward color flooding her cheeks at her daring to her surprise the beast she had been half fearful of was nothing more than a gentle creature nestling small and soft upon its dark furred bed again he sensed her thoughts it only grows large when i desire you you said you wanted me she accused i do want you my flower but wanting and desiring are two different things the wanting is in my head and my heart the desire comes from my body he stretched out next to her on the bed there has been no time for desire this day reaching out he drew her to him no time until now zenobia and then his mouth was covering hers tasting and possessing until with a great shudder she gave herself up to his building passion she had never expected a mans mouth to be so tender it gently commanded her and she obeyed parting her lips to receive his velvety tongue which stroked hers until suddenly she felt a fire beginning to build deep within her pulling her head away from his she tried to clear the dizziness with several breaths of air but he only laughed and captured her mouth again in a torrid embrace finally satisfied that her sweet lips had received their due his mouth scorched a path down the side of her face his slender fingers moving ahead along her slim neck pressing a hot kiss against her ear he murmured can you feel your own desire rising my love and he gently bit on her earlobe before moving on to the soft curve of her silken throat zenobia was beginning to tremble and when her husbands hands found her round full breasts she gasped softly with longing she wanted his touch she craved it for men perhaps the terrible ache that was filling her entire being would dissolve and go away reverently he fondled each tender globe and then without warning his head dipped down to capture within his warm mouth a quivering and already taut nipple hungrily he drew on her virgin breast and she cried out surprised not only by his action but the corresponding tightness in the hidden place between her legs he raised his head and his voice soothed her dont be afraid my flower is it not sweet her answer was to draw his head back down to her breasts where he resumed his pleasing dalliance but soon he sought to explore further one arm encircled her waist while his other hand brushed across her belly which fluttered wildly beneath his touch his head dipped and his tongue teased her navel causing her to writhe beneath him the hand moved lower yet to her smoothly plucked venus mound and now he could feel her beginning to resist him she tensed beneath his fingers and he could hear the nervousness in her voice please hawk please no why are you suddenly afraid of me he sought to touch her again but she caught defensively at his hand please it suddenly occurred to him that perhaps she did not know the way between a man and a woman did tamar tell you how it should be between us between a husband and his wife he asked her no came the reply but i know it is the same as with the animals the male mounts the female is that not correct people are not animals zenobia animals feel need and they satisfy that need without any thought a man with a woman is a different thing my flower he firmly moved her hand away and gently caressed her i have always believed that the gods created woman to be worshiped by her lover when i touch you with love i worship at the shrine of your perfection you must not be afraid of me or of my touch i have never been touched there before she said low trembling beneath his fingers in answer he kissed her again murmuring against her mouth dont be afraid my darling dont be afraid and she felt him very carefully exploring her more intimately a strange languor was spreading over her leaving her limbs weak and helpless he was her husband and yet should he be touching her like that his finger gently penetrated her body and she cried out struggling to escape him but the prince quickly shifted her so she lay completely beneath him atop her he whispered soft love words into her ear no zenobia no my darling dont be afraid dont fight me my flower she could feel every inch of his very masculine body his smooth chest pressed against her full breasts his flat belly pushed against her gently rounded one his thighs met hers with a heat that brought a moan to her lips all this time her hands had never sought to touch him but now she could no longer control the wild desire that he was awakening in her when he buried his face in her soft throat his kisses seemingly endless her arms wound about his neck and then palms flat she caressed the line of his back ending as she cupped his hard buttocks in a gentle grasp oh hawk she whispered your skin is so soft for a man what do you know of men zenobia was the reply his voice was strangely harsh his lips burning against the tender flesh of her throat i know nothing but what you would teach me my husband came the soft reply and her hands moved back up again to clasp about his neck i would teach you to be a woman my flower are you brave enough he demanded his dark eyes burning into hers she trembled against him but her gaze was unwavering as she said yes my hawk yes i am brave enough now his mouth covered hers in a sweet kiss and she felt him slide his hands beneath her to raise her hips up just a little her blood was racing wildly through her veins and she couldnt control her trembling now suddenly she felt something hard probing insistently between her shaking thighs hawk oh my lord i want to be a woman but i am afraid again she squirmed away from him and huddled in a comer of the bed the prince groaned with frustration he had never wanted any woman so desperately in his life he was tempted to force her beneath him and take what he wanted of her she would forgive him afterward but when he lifted his head up she was staring with large terrified eyes at his manhood you cannot she cried you will tear me asunder for a moment he enjoyed the flattery of her innocence you will birth our children there my darling he explained patiently if a whole baby can fit then i can wordlessly she shook her head in the negative but he drew her firmly back into his arms kissing her tenderly gently stroking her until the firestorm began to build within her again she felt so strange as she had never felt before her body was honeyed fire that leapt and flowed under his orchestration the pleasurepain building until she believed she could bear it no longer she was vaguely aware that he was once more covering her burning flesh with his own but suddenly it didnt matter she wanted it she wanted him he felt her body relax beneath him and in that instant his shaft entered the portals of her femininity gently easing into her incredibly tight sheath her virginity was tightly lodged and he stopped a moment kissing her closed eyelids tenderly brushing back a stray lock of hair from her forehead she whimpered a halfpassionate halffearful sound and he could feel her heart pounding beneath his chest zenobia felt as if he was tearing her apart his manhood filled her gorged her and the pain was fierce she tried to he still keeping her eyes tightly shut so he might not know and have his pleasure spoiled when he stopped momentarily lying atop her attempting to soothe her she felt a slight relief but then he drew back and plunged swiftly through her maiden barrier she shrieked with the hurt and fought to escape him but he was firmly in control pushing deeper into her resisting sweetness no no she sobbed the tears beginning to come and then suddenly she became aware that his manhood which just moments ago had seemed like a redhot poker was suddenly the source of the most marvelous sweetness yet the ache was increasing she no longer seemed able to fight him off his shaft moved back and forth within her and the world about her seemed to pulse and spin with a myriad of sensations zenobia had never imagined that anything could be as magnificent as this joining of bodies she was as lost within him as he was in her the pleasure built higher until the ache dissolved without warning and she was falling falling into a warm and welcoming blackness she clung to him lost within her private world and the prince was ravished by her response to his passion tenderly he gathered her into his arms so that when once more she became herself she would feel cherishedfor indeed she was pressing soft little kisses upon her face he murmured reassuringly to her i love you my darling my adorable wife i love you so he said the words over and over until she finally opened her eyes and looked up at him oh my hawk i love you too i want to please you but will it always hurt like that never again he promised her it was only because you were a virgin zenobia i cannot understand tamar not telling you tamar has had only sons zenobia replied and perhaps she did not wish to frighten me then why not your bab it was not babs place to tell me those things she said primly odenathus sighed with exasperation then i suppose it must be my place to school you my flower yes my lord came the demure reply he looked sharply at her then laughed for her eyes were mischievous do you laugh at me my wife he demanded in a teasingly threatening tone yes my lord her look was melting he could feel his desire rising once more and wondered if he dare take her again it had been a hard breach of her maidenhead and he had not a doubt that she was sore i want you again my hawk she punctuated her remark by turning her head to gently bite at his forearm a shiver ran through him as he realized that his bride was a passionate woman reaching out he rubbed her nipple until it stood tall a tough little soldier upon the rise of her delicious flesh she pulled his head down kissing his mouth whispering against his lips take me now my darling i bum mounting her he slipped into her sweet sheath feeling her wince slightly slowly he moved within her pushing deep then pulling himself completely out only to plunge once again into her burning body he felt her nails rake his back and heard her cry no i want the sweetness my hawk do not deny me the sweetness he laughed as he sat straddling her do not be in a hurry my flower there is much pleasure to be gained by taking time to enjoy each other and then he commenced a tantalizingly slow movement that would drive her to the brink of madness zenobia found herself helpless before the delicious sensations that began to assail her there had been pain the first time but then it had been good and she had liked it now though here had been a moments discomfort when he had begun again it was different yet still good she didnt believe it could be any better but each moment brought new delights until she was spinning away lost in time and not caring all she could think was that she had been a fool to fear him above her the prince groaned with his own pleasure falling across her breasts but zenobia was totally unaware both fell into a deep sleep but with the resilience of a healthy young animal zenobia awoke after a few hours it was the middle of the night black and so very still the lamps still burned for neither she nor the prince had thought to snuff them out a slight wind came through the portico and the lamps flickered casting odd redgold shadows against the wall she lay on her back quietly observing the room in which she had become a woman it was she realized a womans room it was her room the room in which she would share tender sweet intimacies with hawk the room in which she would birth her children the room in which as an old woman she would probably breathe her last it was a simple place she thought as her eyes slowly swept the chamber but then he had said that it had not been decorated because he thought she might enjoy planning the decor of their home here was something new and challenging are you awake his voice tore at the stillness yes what are you pondering my flower an honest reply sprang to her lips only to be swallowed back he would hardly think it complimentary that on their wedding night she was thinking of how to decorate their home i was thinking of you hawk she said what were you thinking that i love you she replied he raised himself up on his elbow and looked down into her face smiling we will be friends as well as lovers as well as husband and wife oh zenobia i am so glad that i have you i have been so alone since my father died neither my mother nor deliciae can be a friend to me for they do not understand my feelings for palmyra but you understand my flower dont you this is a great city and we shall make it greater so that our son will be an even greater lord than his father and grandfather how can we be great as long as the romans rule us she demanded soon antonius porcius will retire he explained to her and he has told me that the emperor will send no one to take his place the romans trust us zenobia i will shortly rule the city in my own right as the princes of palmyra did before me how can you rule in your own right when the romans still garrison troops within our city zenobia demanded my wedding gift from the emperor is command of those troops my beautiful wife she sat up startled you are to command roman troops i am now what do you think my flower i wonder why after years of occupation the romans suddenly decided to let you rule without a roman governor i wonder why you have been put in charge of their troops because the romans know that they can trust me zenobia and once you have total control will you overthrow them her gray eyes shone with pride no zenobia i need romes soldiers for palmyra the world is no longer what it once was we are surrounded by dangers not even dreamed of in my grandfathers time i need an army to protect this city why romans rome is the central power in the world if i use her troops then i do not have to force my own people into the military service romes troops cost me nothing the tribute we pay to the empire comes from the caravans and not from my people i cannot believe that you have bent your neck to their yoke she cried tell me you have been but jesting with me my hawk zenobia you are yet a child and do not understand these matters he said gently when you see how the government is run the monies involved then you will understand why it is necessary for us to cooperate with rome come now my flower why are we discussing such weighty matters in the midst of our wedding night he leaned over and kissed her mouth she pulled back her gray eyes serious you once promised to share your responsibilities with me hawk have you now changed your mind i do not make promises i do not intend to keep my flower there is however a time for everything and this is not the time to be discussing my government when is the right time she demanded angrily must i make an appointment with you as do your ministers shall i tell your secretary in the morning that the princess of palmyra wishes an appointment with the prince of palmyra so she may discuss the government with him by the gods he exclaimed we are having our first fight zenobia he reached out a hand and stroked her shoulder how beautiful she was with her midnightblack hair swirling about her shoulders you must take the good with the bad she muttered not easily placated and shocked by the revelation that she was quarreling with him i will share everything with you my darling he promised but we are just married this is our honeymoon and i do not want to speak of politics or finances with you at this moment what bride would choose these things over love in her marriage bed her resistance began to melt and he reached out and drew her into his arms oh hawk she murmured i have so much to learn that i am impatient it is as i have said my flower you are yet a child in many ways but i will teach you he nibbled at the corners of her mouth and delicious little tingles of excitement ran through her the prince smiled down at her and then his lips took full possession of hers there was no gentleness this time only a fierce and burning demand that zenobia found impossible not to answer she returned his kisses passionately until her mouth was bruised and aching but to his surprise she did not yield herself entirely his hands moved to caress her marvelous breasts his lips moved from her lips downward along a trail of soft perfumed flesh that quivered beneath his touch she knew what to expect this time or at least she thought she did but the warm and softly breathing mouth that murmured love words into her ear the mouth that moved teasingly along the straining muscle on the side of her neck to bury itself in the tender hollow of her shoulder shook her to the quick he stayed but a moment in that sweet nook only to move onward to cover the swelling tops of her breasts with quick kisses before beginning his assault upon her nipples which stood at attention eagerly awaiting him zenobia he murmured then his tongue began a slow teasingly sweet encirclement of a nipple round and round it moved sending waves of heat through her veins until she wanted to scream for the pleasure left her weak and breathless it occurred to her suddenly that he was diverting her from the discussion she had been trying to conduct with him her first reaction to this thought was outrage that he held her opinion so lightly but then as his mouth closed over a nipple and he began to suckle upon her sensitive breast all coherent thought vanished she gave herself up to the delights of his lovemaking oh my hawk she whispered afraid to break the lovely spell that seemed to surround them i love you slowly he raised his head so he might look upon her beautiful face and for a moment zenobia thought she would drown in the dark dark liquid pool of his eyes his voice had an intensity that gave her the eerie feeling that he had divined her very thoughts and i love you my exquisite bride i will share all with you my love we have an eternity of sharing before us marcus britainus looked up from his inventory sheets yes severus what is it the princess of palmyra is here sir here his heart leapt within his chest then he realized that she probably did not remember him she wishes to purchase furniture and see our fabrics and accessories sir help her then severus he lowered his head again to the scrolls marcus britainus severuss voice was severe you cannot avoid princess zenobia if you continue to shun her this fascination will increase until no other woman can match the woman you have created in your imagination this is the ruler of palmyras wife you must greet her how old must i get before you will realize that i am no longer a green boy marcus grumbled there is something of the boy in every man marcus britainus came the quiet reply marcus left his office and stopped for a moment to gather his thoughts she is here had she sought him out fool his practical nature reared its head why in the name of all the gods would she remember him she hated blueeyed romans besides from all he could gather her marriage to odenathus was a love match shaking his head at his own foolishness he straightened the folds of his toga pura and entered the atrium of his warehouse with a firm step zenobia rose from the bench upon which she had been seated and watched him come toward her the blueeyed roman of course she vaguely remembered that he had introduced himself at their brief first meeting merchants were supposed to be old men she thought irritably but this was certainly no old man he topped her by at least eight inches and zenobia knew few men to whom she must look up it gave her a vaguely uncomfortable sensation made her feel at a disadvantage with him around her her maidens giggled and made rather pointed and suggestive remarks about the handsome merchant zenobia felt her cheeks flushing slightly newly awakened to sensuality she could not help but look upon marcus alexander with a womans eye and somehow she thought that must be disloyal to her hawk reaching her he knelt and paid her homage highness rise marcus alexander britainus she said and before she realized it the words were out why are you so tall are you a giant no your highness he answered her in an even voice although he was tempted to laugh i take my height from my mothers people the dobunni my grandfather was their prince he smiled down at her if i may say it you are tall for a woman highness i take my height from my mothers people too marcus alexander britainus my mother was an alexandrian greek descended from queen cleopatra zenobia was openly proud how fitting that queen cleopatras beautiful young descendent should be the princess of palmyra highness came the reply zenobia looked up at the roman but the deep blue eyes held no trace of mockery only the deepest respect this is a better beginning marcus alexander britainus she answered him that he was amused to note to himself was the only reference she made to their first meeting severus tells me that you seek to purchase furniture highness yet i have heard palmyras palace is most beautifully decorated palmyras palace is but the house that my husband and i share within the palace gardens is but newly built my warehouses are full your highness and i myself will escort you remain here zenobia commanded her halfdozen maidens for the first time he noticed the women who accompanied her fluttering butterflies all of whom admired him openly please follow me your highness he said leading her from the bright atrium through a corridor and finally into a huge room filled with furnishings of every description great bolts of multicolored silks linens and wools and decorations of every type stunned zenobia stood looking at it all this gave him a moment to feast his eyes upon her perfect beauty she was even fairer than he remembered her skin glowed with a radiance that told him she was well loved his envy of odenathus was tinged with sadness she was wearing a sleeveless lownecked palelavendercolored stola that had been belted at the waist with three narrow strips of gilded leather her long dark hair was no longer loose and flowing as he remembered it instead it was parted in the middle and drawn into a heavy coil at the nape of her neck affixed with amethyststudded gold combs and long matching pins it is so much her awed voice brought him out of his daydream the shipment arrived but yesterday he answered i have visited several other warehouses marcus alexander britainus but i have seen nothing to compare with your merchandise she paused a moment and then looked up at him marcus alexander britainus i need your help my help he felt his heartbeat accelerate can you keep a secret you must for i should die of embarrassment if anyone knew for some reason i trust you although you are a roman a blueeyed roman at that yet my instinct tells me to trust you will you keep my secret he nodded thank you she drew a deep breath i know nothing about furnishing a home marcus alexander britainus nothing at all all my life has been spent either in a tent trekking the desert or in my mothers house here in palmyra mothers house was a part of her dowry and she furnished it before i was born she never had any need to purchase things and she died before she might teach me that which a good wife should know can you help me tell me what i will need he knew what that speech had cost her for she was very proud and he had an almost uncontrollable urge to reach out and take her into his arms to soothe her instead he mastered himself and said quietly i am honored my princess that you have entrusted me with your confidence i will endeavour not to fail you you are a diplomat as well as a businessman marcus alexander britainus her gray eyes regarded him carefully the empire has lost a valuable servant in you part of being a businessman is being a diplomat highness he replied smoothly shall we begin with the couches zenobia laughed and nodded by all means let us begin with the couches she agreed he led her into a section of the warehouse that was completely filled with couches carefully lined up side by side row upon row they were extremely ornamental made of finely grained and finished woods the arms and legs carved ornately or inlaid with tortoiseshell ivory even precious metals several couches had frames of solid silver and legs inlaid with jewels or carved in high relief to depict scenes of the gods in various attitudes of play there was a couch with a rather graphic scene of jupiter as the swan seducing the maiden leda zenobia marcus noted quickly turned away from that particular piece of furniture for some reason her modesty pleased him there are no cushions or coverings for the couches she asked most merchants have such items already made and on the couches highness i however prefer to allow my customer a choice of fabric for i should hate to lose a sale because you disliked the color of the cushions that is very clever of you marcus alexander britainus he chuckled with delight for it gave him great pleasure to be complimented by this girl quietly he listened to her needs and then suggested several possibilities always explaining why he chose one couch over another so she might learn but leaving the final decision to her they next moved on to chairs they were not upholstered but they did have fabric cushions the tables were elegant with supports and tops of marble solid or veneered woods or thin sheets of precious metals such as gold or silver the most beautiful and the most expensive table in the warehouse was a round one made from cross sections of exquisitely marked perfectly matched african cedar zenobia reverently rubbed her hand over the surface of the table almost purring her pleasure do not tell me marcus teased her you must have it am i wrong to choose it she inquired hesitantly no it is a fine piece in fact to my mind it is one of the best tables ever done it will be fearfully expensive though highness her winged brows raised themselves slightly i do not recall asking you the price marcus alexander britainus just the faint hint of a smile touched the corners of his mouth shall we move on to chests and cabinets your highness zenobia followed him into another section of the warehouse with what she hoped was a regal step there with marcuss aid she picked several wooden cabinets each one more beautifully decorated man the last the cabinets were compartmented but had no sliding drawers locks or hinges she chose a dozen ironbound wooden chests with ornamental locks and hinges of dark bronze then moved on to purchase footed charcoalburning iron floor stoves to heat the rooms on chilly evenings and winter days next zenobia bought lamps to light her home exclaiming with delight at the variety available to her following marcuss advice she chose only lamps made of metals for they he assured her would last a lifetime there were lamps with handles that could be carried from room to room some that would be suspended from the ceilings by chains and others that would be kept on stands or tripods the lamps were graceful in form and all had been finely crafted precious and semiprecious stones set within the gold and silver it had taken over two hours for zenobia to make her purchases and now she must choose fabrics for her couches and pillows i am exhausted she complained to marcus i mink i should rather lead my camel corps in a desert drill than shop your camel corps he kept his voice curious but impersonal the bedawi are great fighters when they have to be marcus alexander britainus when i was thirteen my father began to train me as he had trained all my brothers in the art of desert warfare as even today he trains his youngest sons whom do you fight my princess the bedawi have few enemies came the reply but as my father has said we must never grow soft so all your brothers lead camel corps oh no marcus alexander britainus to lead a bedawi camel corps you must be the best only three of my older brothers and i have our own troupe although one of my younger brothers appears promising she smiled a shy smile at him you have been so kind marcus alexander britainus now i must choose fabrics lead on please the conversation was closed and he knew that he could not reopen it she was young and she was inexperienced he would question antonius porcius the whole idea of this slender and delicatelooking creature being a warrior fascinated him he smiled in return and said i will have a chair brought so you may sit your highness the slaves will bring the fabrics to you he gave several sharp orders and zenobia quickly found herself comfortably seated an alabaster goblet of cool juice in her hand another terse command from marcus alexander britainus and the slaves began to bring great bolts of fabric unrolling several lengths of silks so she might see them properly zenobias eyes widened at the glorious colors that were spread before her like a thousand sunrises and sunsets rolled into one there were solid colors and brocades and silks shot through with gold and silver threads the delicately woven wools were both local and imported and there were many shades ranging from dark red to black the best linen was from egypt he informed her and cotton was grown only in the eastern provinces i dont know where to begin she said and so he advised her as to which fabrics were best showing her how to match colors and textures to make a pleasing effect bending over her he breathed the subtle scent of hyacinths that she always wore tortured himself with quick glimpses of her palegold breasts rising and falling calmly above her stolas low neckline with superhuman effort he restrained the emotion that encouraged him to turn her to him and cover those luscious breasts with hot kisses you have been so wonderfully kind marcus alexander britainus her voice came at him from a million miles away i did not until today believe there was any kindness in the romans i see now that i was wrong there is good as well as evil in all peoples your highness if i have taught you not to make quick judgments then i may count it a victory for palmyra and her peoples my husband rules palmyra not i all women rule their husbands your highness i have that on the best authority for my mother and my sisters have often told me so zenobia laughed i am rebuked she said rising from her chair tell me now marcus alexander britainus when will all these wonderful things i have purchased be delivered to the palace i will have them sent tomorrow your highness they might come today but we will need time to upholster your couches if you will permit it i will escort you to your litter now he stood outside his warehouse and watched as the large litter filled to overflowing with zenobia and her maidens disappeared down the street escorted not he noticed by palmyran soldiers but bedawi warriors he knew now more than ever that this exquisite woman was the only woman for him whatever happened he must remain near her he wasnt sure quite yet how he was going to do it but somehow he would as if venus herself had heard his wish and taken pity on him the opportunity presented itself the following day when he personally oversaw the delivery of zenobias purchases to the palace she greeted him gaily then began to direct the slaves as to where they might put each article then odenathus joined them kissing his young wifes cheek and smiling indulgently at her explanations i should not have been able to do any of this my hawk had it not been for marcus alexander britainus then we owe you a debt marcus alexander britainus odenathus said indeed you are not in the mold of our average merchant you seem more educated a patrician i would swear my family is patrician your highness the alexander family dates back to the earliest days of rome the key to our survival i suspect is that we have never involved ourselves in political intrigues each generation has been taught that only by hard work will they profit the family estate which is located in the hills outside of rome near tiber was given to us in the first days of the republic my grandfather who is the current head of the alexander family still oversees the farm and the vineyards yet you are a merchant marcus alexander britainus why is that palmyras prince demanded my father was a younger son your highness unlike others in his family he chose to serve the government eventually he was sent to britain as governor there he met and married my mother and there he began in order to finance his growing family to purchase and send back to rome rare articles of beauty when he was finally recalled to rome he discovered that he had a burgeoning business my grandfather allowed my father to start his own branch of the family he continued to pursue his business finding it preferable to life in the country my younger brother aulus resides in britain where he purchases goods to send back to italy i was sent here to obtain the magnificent goods of the far east and to send the luxuries of the west east odenathus eyed the tall roman you have served with the army yes your highness with the praetorian under the young emperor gordianus in africa odenathus was impressed my wedding gift from the emperor is that i am to be made commander of romes legions here in palmyra a magnificent gift highness i have no doubt you will bring glory to the region replied marcus i think that marcus alexander britainus should stay for the evening meal my hawk zenobia said she turned to marcus you will stay wont you the prince smiled im afraid you cannot refuse us marcus alexander britainus there was no way marcus could decline gracefully the truth was that he did not want to for though it pained him to see the prince being so affectionate with zenobia at least he marcus was with her also the winter dining room of the little palace faced south and its walls were overlaid with thin slabs of pale yellow marble its cornices and baseboards of carved and gilded wood matching the latticework that covered the windows the east and west walls of the room had magnificent frescoes bright with gold leaf brilliant colors and mosaic work one showed a party of hunters after hippopotami and crocodiles on the nile the other offered mounted hunters with their sleek fleet dogs chasing down gazelles in the desert the floor was done in tiny pieces of blue green and yellow mosaic three dining couches each one sectioned to seat three people were set about a square dining table the prince took the center couch zenobia sat to his left and marcus was placed on his right in the place of honor marcus ate automatically not even noticing the food served to him on silver plates he was far too busy answering the many questions zenobia fired at him he spoke of different philosophies for a time then she looked shrewdly at him saying do you believe in these things marcus alexander britainus he smiled at her i am a realist i believe in that which i can see i do not mean to offend i am simply curious there is so much i do not know of this world and i want to learn the most beautiful woman in palmyra the prince remarked and she is not satisfied with all she has it is not enough to be beautiful my hawk if you had wanted a fluffy kitten of a wife you would have been married long since what is it you want to know my princess i will gladly share my little knowledge with you the prince nodded and zenobia said bleakly marcus alexander britainus i do not even know what the sea looks like and that my roman friend is but the beginning of my ignorance he began to speak and in his eloquence he made wonderful word pictures that allowed them to see the sea and the ships upon it he told of rome set upon her seven green hills and britain the land of his birth with its misty wet weather and even greener hills he spoke of his service in africa that primitive land of fierce contrasts and all the while zenobia sat motionless absorbing his every word like a sponge the night darkened beyond the dining room windows and the servants cleared away the fruit and honeyed nut cakes the goblets were refilled with aromatic red wine and marcus spoke on until out of the comer of his eye he saw the prince yawning behind his hand it is late he said and i have been droning on like a schoolmaster you have barely begun to tell me what i seek to know zenobia murmured perhaps then marcus alexander britainus will come again and tell us of his experiences the prince said politely tomorrow zenobia replied tomorrow both men looked startled yes tomorrow you must command him my hawk to come each day for an hour and teach me of the world beyond our city odenathus seemed annoyed and glanced somewhat irritably at the roman marcus alexander britainus is a busy man my flower is he so busy that he cannot spare an hour each day she protested marcus could see that the prince was beginning to eye him with something akin to jealousy yet he desperately wanted to be with zenobia perhaps he said looking directly at the prince you would allow me to visit with her highness twice a week my lord by rearranging my schedule i could manage it zenobia had risen and now she twined herself about her husband provocatively i do not ask you for jewels or other baubles my hawk all i seek is knowledge how can you object you spend your days meeting with your councillors the slaves care for the house and i am left to the pursuits of boredom of course i might visit with your dear mother or perhaps deliciae she smiled up at him with false sweetness i do not want you in the company of another man the prince hissed surely you are not jealous my hawk zenobias voice was a whisper now but marcus always sharp of ear could make out every word and winced at her next statement he is practically old enough to be my father besides i shall have bab with me and if you insist my maidens also i care not how many people are with me as long as i may learn teasingly she blew into his ear please marcus turned his eyes away from them he could not bear to see her affectionate with the prince he drew a deep breath and made an attempt to control his emotions zenobia was married to odenathus they were obviously very much in love would you mind coming to teach my wife marcus alexander britainus no my lord i should consider it an honor he kept both his face and his voice grave very well then so be it and i thank you marcus alexander britainus the roman rose from the table i have overstayed the bounds of good hospitality he said with your highnesss permission i shall take my leave you have my permission marcus alexander britainus he bowed from his waist and exited the room hearing behind him zenobias little cry of glee oh my hawk thank you thank you thank you she flung herself upon him and kissed him quite vigorously he protested faintly zenobia we are in the dining room the couch is big enough for both of us my hawk she murmured loosening his robe and nuzzling at his nipples he groaned all thoughts of the roman driven from his mind and wrapped his arms about her burying his face in her soft shoulder zenobia zenobia what am i to do with you make love to me my hawk she answered him boldly he untangled her arms from about his neck and stood pulling her up with him a fine idea my flower but not here for some poor slave to stumble upon us he brushed a kiss across her pouting mouth and with a faint smile led her through their house and upstairs to their bedchamber leave us go to your beds was his curt order to the slave girls who awaited their young mistress as on their wedding night two months earlier they quickly undressed each other shivering in the cool air of a desert summer night they stood for a few moments and his hands caressed the marvelous mounds of her breasts moving downward to smooth along her firm thighs and hips he pushed her away from him and stood back admiring her nudity in the flickering light of the perfumed lamps you are like a golden goddess to be worshiped and adored i never tire of looking at you he said she stood quietly no longer afraid or shy of him and when he knelt before her she stroked the dark head that pressed itself into her soft belly she was beginning to feel languorous as she always did when he began to make love to her but as always he sensed the moment when her legs began to weaken and stood to pull her atop him as he fell back upon the bed for a long moment their mouths met in a fiery embrace and then zenobia drew away she sat upon him and wetting her finger in her mouth began to encircle his nipple teasingly he watched her through slitted eyes a faint smile upon his face in just two months the virgin he had married had become the most sensuous woman he had ever known she was wonderfully passionate and constantly inventive in one sense it was fortunate that her mother had died before she might pass on to her daughter those inhibitions that invariably divided a married couples sexual life into the acceptable and the unacceptable pushing himself into a sitting position he pulled her forward and impaled her on his ready lance reaching out he grasped one full breast and pulled it to his open mouth sucking hard on the sensitive nipple while his other hand slipped under her to caress her buttocks zenobia moaned and sought for the wonderful motion that always eventually brought her relief he however would not allow it holding her still between iron thighs while his mouth and hands wreaked delicious havoc and her desire became more frantic his lips captured her in a deep kiss his tongue driving into her mouth his hands clutching her tightly holding her still while her ardor mounted until finally she was tearing her mouth away from his and begging him to give her release swiftly he rolled over pinning her beneath him and began the thrusting motion that would give them the pure pleasure they both sought with a wild cry zenobia wrapped her arms and legs about her husband and within moments was lost within a shining splendor that finally dissolved in a tumultuous allengulfing explosion of passion too quickly it was over and they both lay exhausted and panting amid the tangled bedclothes by the gods odenathus halfwhispered venus has blessed us both my flower you are all the woman a man could ever want and you all the man a woman could want my hawk she replied admiringly the same words were spoken that very night to marcus alexander by a beautiful and famed courtesan in palmyras street of the prostitutes he looked down on the woman a rather magnificent ambereyed blonde with a marvelous figure do you mean in all your vast experience sadira no man has pleased you as i have his blue gaze was somewhat disbelieving his voice mocking why do you find that so hard to believe marcus she quickly countered him not in the least disconcerted by his manner i came to make love he said not to talk he reached for her but she eluded his grasp you want a whore tonight marcus alexander i am not a whore but a courtesan there is more to me than a pair of open legs a ready sheath i can see however that your mood is not conducive to my company i am sorry sadira he groaned there is a black mood upon me tonight and i cant seem to rid myself of it i will listen if you choose to speak marcus where were you before you came to me i had dinner at the palace was the answer the gods no wonder youre in a bad mood having to sit through a state dinner would make anyone out of sorts was that old bitch alzena there how her nose must have been put out of joint by the princes marriage to that lovely little bedawi our new princess has a way of holding her head that leads me to believe the princes mother will not rule zenobia of palmyra sadira chuckled how very much in love those two are and they make no attempt to hide their passion for each other her eyes grew mellow and then amorous come my big and passionate roman let sadira take your evil humor and turn it into one of joy she pulled his head down and kissed him with superb skill marcus let her believe she was succeeding but his mind had already fled back to contemplate zenobia zenobia and her husband whose passion for each other could not be a secret thing no one in palmyra was particularly surprised when their beautiful princess began to thicken about the waist and formal and official announcement was made that an heir to the desert throne was expected a year and a day exactly after his parents marriage a son to be named vaballathus was born to palmyras princess a brother demetrius followed but fifteen months later the government in rome had been wracked with internal strife for several years there was no real imperial family left soldieremperor after soldieremperor rose with the support of one faction of the army only to fall when another faction raised its own choice the current emperor valerian had been called by his troops from raetia in gaul he had marched on rome taken the government in hand and given it the first stability it had known in many years he made his twentyoneyearold son already a tough battlehardened general his coemperor valerian had said it plainly he might be a man in his sixties but if he was assassinated as were some of his predecessors his son gallienus would not only avenge him but take over the emperor then turned an eye to see where he had honest allies to the east in the city of palmyra he noted the young prince odenathus was well thought of by the roman governor antonius porcius blandus the prince had been given command of the legion in palmyra and had been successfully holding the persians at bay he had a wife and two young sons both possible hostages in the event he should prove difficult at a later date now the roman governor had made application for retirement and as he had served fifteen years in palmyra it was a request that could not be denied the governor suggested that no new roman be sent out to the city but rather that odenathus be made king a client king of the empire his loyalty was certainly unquestioned and it seemed to valerian a perfect solution how could he clean up matters here in rome if he had to worry about the eastern provinces the order went out odenathus septimus was to be king of palmyra the city went wild at the news and the celebration that followed lasted nine days before the populace fell into a drunken stupor that lasted another two days in the palace alzena preened i am now queen of palmyra she purred queen zenobia is queen deliciae said you are not odenathuss wife you are his mother if the girl is queen why should i not be is she worthy no i am worthy have i not served this city all these years deliciae laughed harshly you you serve palmyra for almost thirty years you have done nothing but complain about palmyrathe people hate you your name is a curse the only thing you ever did for palmyra was to birth a good king in the three years since odenathus married zenobia she has produced two healthy sons for the dynasty and worked unceasingly for the good of the city everyone loves her does that include the roman marcus alexander britainus alzena asked slyly why is he always here and alone with her by the gods you are a wicked woman alzena you know very well that the roman comes but twice a week and that zenobia is never alone with him she learns from him about the world outside of palmyra and this makes her fit to be queen of this desert dung heap bah it is an excuse to be with her lover oh you are an evil creature deliciae cried your son and his wife love each other deeply your nasty tongue will never part them alzena beware lest you become your own victim what a stupid creature you are deliciae the older woman said her voice dripping with scorn how many bedawi shepherds do you suppose mounted zenobia before her marriage to my son even her brothers especially the eldest akbar who dotes on her so did not deny themselves ill wager those savages do not think of incest as a sin zenobia was a virgin and you know it you saw the bloody bedclothes the morning after their wedding night as did i i well remember your torturing me with the fact that she was purity to my filth as you so charmingly put it alzena what will happen to your sons deliciae when zenobias eldest becomes king of palmyra think on it you little fool my sons will serve the family as they are being taught to serve it a kings mantle is a heavy burden and it is one i would prefer be left to another to the rightful heir vaballathus sluttish idiot was alzenas parting remark as the two women went their separate ways alzenas attitude toward her daughterinlaw was not particularly improved on hearing that she the kings mother was to be created princess dowager a title thought of by zenobia as my wife has so carefully pointed out mother odenathus explained you cannot be known as princess of palmyra for if we should have a daughter that would be her rightful title then why was i not created the dowager queen alzena demanded furiously there can only be one queen of palmyra said zenobia quietly throughout the ages there has been much trouble when a kingdom had an old queen and a young queen i am most certainly not old snapped alzena outraged more by the word old than anything else there can be only one queen zenobia repeated and her gray eyes their golden lights dancing met the furious blackeyed gaze of her motherinlaw how dare your alzena hissed venomously you a little desert savage how dare you attempt to lord it over me i was a princess born i am royal by birth not marriage do you think a few mumbled words by a priest of jupiter can make you royal you have accepted your royalty as a right zenobia shot back you believe that having been bom royal is merely enough but i tell you alzena it is not being royal bears with it many and great responsibilities when have you ever thought of anything except yourself have you ever thought of your people worried about their welfare not just today but in the years to come when you shall not be here and someone else reigns in your stead being royal means knowing the world about us so we may best judge this citys course so our people will always even in the centuries to come be prosperous and happy they are not responsibilities lightly taken but i gladly help my lord husband odenathus to carry his burden and you approve of this alzenas voice was almost a shriek you approve of this mannish attitude on the part of your wife she is exactly the kind of woman father would have chosen for me came the devastating reply and what am i alzena was outraged the young king smiled why you are what you have always been you are a supreme bitch there was a furious gasp from the older woman but odenathus put a friendly arm about his mother and continued with his speech do not be offended mother i actually admire you for in a strange way you are admirable you took your position those many years ago when you came to palmyra and you have never deviated from it such strength of will is to be commended he gave her a gentle hug be content mother with your lot you have little to complain of for all of your wants are most generously met you have made her your enemy zenobia later told her husband she was never my friend was his reply she is your mother and although you have never been allowed to feel any love for heralthough you were never close as a mother and a son should bein her own strange way she has been proud of you and she has loved you you were cruel my hawk and that is not like you you hurt her and alzenas memory for an offense real or imagined is a long one why do you defend her my flower she has never been your friend she undermines you at every opportunity she gets she cannot hurt me while you love and trust me hawk and i shall never give you cause not to love or trust me we are as one perhaps it would be better if you discontinued your lessons for the time being are you jealous she teased him then grew serious oh hawk he knows so much he has taught me philosophy poetry history and western music and art i am learning how the roman empire grew and that has already taught me that power especially the vast power that the romans have gained is dangerous for it corrupts completely marcus says that from the time the roman empire began its eventual destruction was inevitable they are weak now my hawk marcus tells me that the emperor is far too busy persecuting the christians to care about the eastern empire that is why he made you king my hawk be a king and throw off the golden shackles with which rome binds us no zenobia if we revolt the emperor valerian will be here in the twinkling of an eye we will be free one day but now is not the time besides the persians have become bold again i cannot fight rome face to face while i have another enemy at my back the persians will never be romes allies zenobia replied scornfully no you are right but if i leave palmyra to fight the romans how long do you think it would be before king shapur and his armies would march into palmyra they have always coveted this city and its riches i will not destroy vaballathuss inheritance what kind of inheritance is it when it can be taken away the romans made you king they can just as easily unmake you no they need me and it is little enough that they call me king in order to gain my aid wait and see my flower one day we will ihrow off the yoke that has bound us all these years but first i must remove the persian threat from my rear flank the romans do me a favor zenobia they have given me the troops with which to deal with king shapur and while you do battle with king shapur i will hold the city for you my hawk my mounted camel corps and my mounted archers will hold back any attacker she promised he swept her into his arms and with one swift motion loosed her long black hair it swirled about them like a storm cloud and his mouth met hers in a long and burning kiss zenobia felt herself melt body and soul into him but at the same time she was filled with great strength she slipped her arms about his neck and when he freed her lips she looked adoringly up at him oh zenobia you are a wife to be proud of my darling was i not blest by mars at my birth she replied the retired governor antonius porcius blandus who had so often threatened to retire to antioch or damascus remained in palmyra upon his release from the imperial civil service and where would i go he had demanded irritably when zenobia teased him about it i have grown old in romes service and i have spent most of my life here in the east i could not stand italys climate any longer did you know that it can sometimes snow in the imperial city bah why do i bother to tell you that you know nothing of snow besides all the family that i knew is gone oh i have an older brother who writes me every year to tell me of the family but it means little to me perhaps now that i have retired i shall marry i never before had time for a wife indeed antonius porcius you must marry zenobia said i can recommend the state of matrimony quite highly she fully expected him to choose some proper widow who would provide him with an instant family in his old age instead to her great surprise the former governors choice was zenobias childhood friend julia tullio who at nineteen was still unwed the young queen was shocked you do not have to marry that old man if you do not want to julia how could your family allow such a thing he is older than your father as a matter of fact he is five years younger than my father came the amused reply dearest zenobia i want to marry antonius i have known him all my life and i care for him i am honored he has chosen me but you do not love him zenobia protested you did not love king odenathus when you married him and do not shake your head at me for you didnt you have fallen in love with him since your marriage and now you cannot remember a time when you didnt love him zenobia be sensible i am almost twenty and i very much want to be a wife and a mother antonius is a kind and good man he is tender and generous and we have much in common in fact i have more in common with him than with any young man i have ever met besides a husband should be older than his wife is not the king older than you by some years only ten was the reply oh julia isnt there some younger man you would prefer what of marcus alexander britainus he is much younger than antonius porcius marcus alexander julia shuddered delicately then looked searchingly at zenobia his heart is occupied and besides he terrifies me his heart is occupied elsewhere oh julia do tell i have heard no gossip of it who is she so she doesnt know julia thought am i the only one who sees that he loves her then she said it is not a woman zenobia but his business that is his wife his mistress his everything oh to her puzzlement zenobia found herself rather relieved that marcus alexander had no lover julia smiled do not fret yourself zenobia i am not being forced into this marriage i still believe that you could do better zenobia said now julia laughed no i could not she paused for a moment as if debating with herself then she said most important of all my dearest friend i shall be loved loved zenobia looked puzzled yes loved only when i accepted his proposal did antonius admit that he loved me he said he had loved me since i was a child but that he dared not speak until he was sure that my heart was not engaged elsewhere for he did fret in his mind over the vast difference in our ages but what of children julia will you be able to have them it will be as the gods allow came the reply no no i meanwell do you think he can can what then julias face grew pink oh she said can he zenobia repeated i expect so julia said slowly my father still does and for that matter so does your father age i have been told is no deterrent deterrent to what marcus alexander britainus entered the room the two women giggled and zenobia catching her breath said nothing that should concern you marcus but come and wish julia good fortune for she is to be married indeed he came forward and smilingly planted a kiss upon julias blushing cheek and who is the fortunate man if i may ask it is i who am fortunate marcus alexander i am to wed with antonius porcius i will not be corrected in this julia tullio it is antonius porcius who is the lucky one marcus said firmly may the gods smile upon you both and i hope that i am to be invited to the wedding julia colored prettily again and said breathlessly but of course you are to be invited marcus alexander she then turned to zenobia i must go now i have already stayed overlong and i only came to tell you my news she rose as did zenobia and the two women embraced before julia hurried out the door zenobia watched her go and then turning back to marcus said i pray the gods she will be happy he is so much older than she is and if they have children she will spend all her time nursing her babes and her elderly husband you do not think that a husband should be older than his wife highness older yes but not thirtytwo years older julias father is his contemporary and how does julia feel she says he loves her and that she cares for him then you should not worry highness suddenly the door opened and deliciae hurried in followed by bab alzena is coming deliciae said and she has the king with her she wants to make trouble between you and has told him that you are alone with marcus alexander why on earth should that matter zenobia demanded but marcus instantly understood and nodded at deliciae who then said bab and i have been with you the whole time highness julia tullio is to marry antonius porcius zenobia said quickly comprehending the urgency of their mission if not the reason behind it the two other women had barely settled themselves in a corner when the door to the room again opened and alzena hurried in followed by odsnathus there she pointed a long bony finger at zenobia did i not tell you my son did i not say it was so this wicked creature is alone with another man it is as i have suspected all along she is betraying you before either odenathus or zenobia could say a word old bab sprang from her comer seat how dare you accuse my innocent mistress of such perfidy she shrieked it is you who is the wicked creature really alzena came deliciaes amused voice from another part of the room and they all turned to look at her your obsession is beginning to do strange things to you ah well tis but a sign of age i expect alzenas mouth fell open in surprise she was alone i tell you the tullio girl left and she was alone with him ala my maid told me she was alone with him and she would not lie to me perhaps she was not aware that both bab and the lady deliciae were in the room with her highness when i arrived marcus said finally finding his voice alzenas viciousness had surprised him odenathuss mother looked for someone to attack and as bab was too far beneath her she chose deliciae if you were here as you say you were she snarled then what did you speak of tell me that we spoke of julias forthcoming marriage deliciae said sweetly she is shortly to marry antonius porcius i think mother that this must be the end of it you have made an error and you owe both my wife and my friend marcus alexander an apology never her face contorted with fury alzena stormed from the room i will leave you to your lessons zenobia the king said i must return to the council from which i was dragged he bowed to her turned and left the room for a moment a heavy silence hung in the room and then marcus said quietly am i to be told what this is all about alzena is angry because she is not to be known as queen of palmyra she simply seeks to make trouble zenobia said wearily she accused us of being lovers highness a dangerous accusation for youand for me an untruth from the mouth of a bitter woman it is as noisy bird chatter do not underestimate her hatred zenobia deliciae said had i not overheard that old bitch ala chortling her story you would have indeed been alone with marcus alexander and even if the king had believed you a suspicion would always exist in some dark corner of his mind odenathus would never distrust me deliciae odenathus is simply a mortal man zenobia listen to her my baby bab said urgently zenobia sighed irritably come marcus let us get on with our lesson of the day i apologize to you for alzenas behavior it must be her time of life humph bab said with a sniff it is her nature and that is as sour as a lemon the old woman speaks a truth deliciae murmured zenobia ignored them both and looked to marcus he forced back a smile that threatened to turn up the corners of his mouth today he said we shall discuss your illustrious ancestress cleopatra queen of egypt even deliciae and bab now turned interested faces to him and listened as marcus began to unfold the fascinating tale of the woman who had ruled egypt and captured the hearts of two illustrious romans of the day zenobia however was not listening there was little marcus could tell her of cleopatra that she did not already know alzenas unfounded accusation disturbed her in a way far different than anyone would have thought suddenly zenobia found herself looking upon marcus alexander not just as a friend or a roman or her teacher but as a man had his eyes always been that blue and the lashes so long and thick the gods he was so handsome with a guilty start she lowered her eyes from his features afraid her thoughts would be as plain to him as they were to her what was the matter with her that her thoughts took such a path then the wicked worm of curiosity reared itself and zenobia found herself wondering what it would be like to be held tightly against his broad chest by those strong arms to feel that mocking mouth upon her mouth shamed color flooded her face and with a little cry she rose and fled from the room poor zenobia deliciae said with genuine sympathy that wretched alzena has obviously upset her greatly i wonder the gods dont strike the old witch dead with one of their thunderbolts it would be a great justice aye bab muttered i pray for it nightly he said nothing what had caused her to flee the room he didnt know but it was not odenathuss mother of that he was certain it was not in zenobias character to be dishonest so that night as she and odenathus lay side by side fingers intertwined sated with pleasure she said quietly ala told alzena the truth today i was alone with marcus but twas only a few minutes my hawk he arrived while julia was with me and when she left we stood talking it did not occur to me that we were being indiscreet suddenly deliciae and bab were there saying that your mother had set her slave to spy on me and that you were both coming they begged me to pretend that they had been with me the entire time i regret that i did so for now i have lied to you without meaning to he stroked the silken head that lay upon his chest smiling to himself in the darkness he had known that she was alone with the roman for he had set his own spies upon her weeks ago it was not that he distrusted her or that she had given him any cause to doubt her love but his mothers barbs had set the worm of uncertainty gnawing at him in the dark part of the night when he awoke and he was suddenly afraid of losing her he had known there was no harm in the little time she and marcus had been alone he knew that the roman treated zenobia with great respect and perhaps a little bit of affection the kind of affection that one might give a younger sister they were friends marcus alexander britainus and his wife and zenobia had few friends for who would dare to be friends with a queen he would not spoil that friendship for her despite his mothers constant suspicion they were simply the ravings of a sick and bitter woman thank you for telling me this my flower he said quietly but i have never doubted that your relationship with marcus alexander is anything more than friendship between teacher and pupil she sighed with relief and again he smiled to himself never again would his mothers words have the power to distress him he and zenobia were as one now as they had ever been you will be regent for me when i go to war against the persians he said when will you go within the month he replied king shapur again harasses antioch i cannot help but notice that every time he does so he carefully bypasses palmyra in his march to the coast zenobia said odenathus chuckled he knows that i shall eventually beat him my flower he wishes to retain the illusion of invincibility as long as possible she laughed neither of you lacks for pride my hawk i shall probably miss antonius porciuss wedding but you will go and then you shall write me all about it oh she said i had almost forgotten my secretary has arrived just today who dionysius cassius longinus i told you that i had sent for him to come from athens where he has been teaching rhetoric if i am to govern for you while you play the soldier i must have someone of my own whom i can trust do not forget that i have watched your council meetings and i know how difficult your councillors can be there is not one of them who wouldnt forward his own interests before palmyras you my hawk have the patience of a christian but i am not sure that i do speaking of the christians beware of my councillor publius he has a serious quarrel with the christian merchant paulus quintus and he will play the outraged moralist in order to gain his way i will remember she answered him is there anything else you think i should know only that i adore you my flower he said and she murmured softly against his chest sending tiny icy shivers up and down his spine i do not think i want to go off and play soldier he said if it means i shall be parted from you we have never been separated before my flower come back either with your shield or upon it she teased him quoting the saying of ancient spartan women to their men are you so anxious for me to go you have proved yourself many times my hawk but i have never been given that chance with you away i shall rule the city in my own right and i will at last know what i can do he winced you are as painfully honest as ever my flower oh hawk she was instantly contrite i shall miss you i shall but i do want to know what i can do i know zenobia i know that go to sleep now my flower you will not get much rest once you become ruler she was quickly asleep her even breathing a warm puff against his bare chest he held her protectively enjoying her softness her scent of hyacinth he would he suspected miss her a great deal more than she would miss him for everything she was to do while he was gone was new to her and she looked forward to it with enthusiasm indeed he wondered if she would miss him at all for a brief moment he regretted marrying such an intelligent and independent woman but then he had known what she was like and still he had wanted her he wanted her now the world was full of compliant bodies but interesting women were a rarity whenever she surrendered to him he felt a sense of victory it was never with others the way it was with her he smiled at his fancies it was really very simple odenathus thought he loved her do not hide behind false piety with me publius cato your majesty misunderstands me came the oily reply i misunderstand nothing publius cato the emperor has shown us the direction to take do you say he is wrong the collective intake of breath was quite audible be careful longinus mouthed at zenobia her nod was barely perceptible the emperor is correct in all things publius cato if he persecutes the christians in rome then surely in rome they deserve it but here in palmyra our few christians are honest citizens who obey our laws and meet their obligations promptly i suspect that your zeal for a persecution stems from the fact that you owe a rather large debt to paulus quintus the merchant who by coincidence is a christian the goods he sold me were inferior then it is a matter for the courts isnt it publius cato the court ruled yesterday majesty zenobias secretary said did it zenobia was more than aware of the verdict but she wanted the rest of the council to know too and what was the courts decision longinus the court ruled in favor of paulus quintus majesty the goods were not shoddy as claimed by publius cato he was ordered to pay paulus quintus for the merchandise i see the look zenobia sent the rest of her councillors was one of patient tolerance is there anyone else here who feels that the christians are a danger to this government or to the city itself i will listen to anyone who wishes to speak eloquent silence followed publius cato rose angrily from his seat and made for the door this council is not dismissed zenobias voice was icy i will not stay here and be insulted by a woman that a woman bore you publius cato is certainly not a point in our favor zenobia replied but if you leave this chamber without my permission you will forever be dismissed from the council i am queen of palmyra and will be queen she smiled faintly come now publius cato you have given many years to this government and have rendered it valuable service on any number of occasions i can understand your desire for revenge but whatever is between you and paulus quintus you must not bring your wishes for vengeance into our government when you have calmed down you will see that i am right come now and sit we have much business to dispose of before i dismiss you all two other councillors had gotten up and now spoke urgently and softly to publius cato who redfaced shook his head in the negative you can do no more majesty longinus said the man is impossible it would be better not to make enemies whether he returns to his seat or not he will be your enemy at least you have made a public attempt at reconciliation if he is rash enough to leave he will look the churl he is and you may appoint one of your own people and if he returns what then she cocked her head to one side he will attempt to block everything you do for he is a petty man longinus replied then his eyes widened slightly and he said gleefullythe gods have heard my prayers the fool is leaving zenobias face was regretful but she gained immediate sympathy from everyone in the room i mourn the loss of publius cato she said but if i did not serve the interests of palmyra first i could not serve the interests of palmyra at all for a moment she looked saddened then her gray eyes grew bright and alert again with publius catos departure we lack a quorum unless i immediately appoint someone to take his place we must disband and there is so much to be done i do not feel we can afford to lose the time are there any objections to my appointing at least temporarily cassius longinus my secretary to fill the place left by publius cato although he has been away several years he is a native son of this city i can see no impediment to such an appointment said marius gracchus the eldest and senior member of the council after a brief moment all the others nodded their heads in agreement it is settled then majesty welcome dionysius cassius longinus you are not the first member of your family to serve this council i remember your illustrious grandfather quite well several hours later after the council had been dismissed longinus said to his mistress i am not sure that you did not plan that whole thing actually i did not expect publius cato to resign his post but when he did it was only natural that i appoint you in his place and im sure odenathus will approve my choice longinus you do not know me zenobia turned her gray eyes on him and smiled faintly i know you longinus when we first met i instantly knew the kind of man you areintelligent honest and shrewd you will be loyal to me and therefore to palmyra you have neglected to say that i prefer men for lovers longinus replied wickedly zenobia laughed have you ever made love to a woman longinus but you need not tell me i shall grant that your private life be your own her eyes sparkled mischievously at him and he was forced to laugh with her i suspect that you are not going to be an easy person to work with majesty why longinus i am simply a woman she answered with mock humility longinus arched an elegant eyebrow in amusement but zenobia chose to ignore him and continued you are to escort me to antonius porciuss wedding tomorrow be here in the hour before dawn the hour before dawn he looked anguished i do not think my blood courses through my veins at such an hour majesty i do not need your blood longmus just your body zenobia answered drily well he answered i think we shall make a handsome couple good night majesty zenobia chuckled softly and poured herself some wine before seating herself in a chair thoughtfully she sipped the sweet red liquid she had faced her first great challenge today and she believed that she had acquitted herself quite well as longinus had said whatever had happened publius cato would have been her enemy by using his own weakness against him shehad removed him from the council and replaced him with one who would be loyal to palmyra she did not think odenathus would disapprove her choice when he returned from his war cassius longinus she smiled to herself she liked him he was a man of wit and culture and given his reputation no one could accuse her of infidelity with him she wondered briefly what made him prefer men over women as lovers then shrugged it mattered not for he was already a friend and she knew he would be a good servant of palmyra he was attractivethough tall and lean his gray hair closecropped his brown eyes lively and interested his nose was long and he had an intimidating way of looking down it that made most people nervous both his manners and his dress were elegant his nature was generous although he could become impatient with what he called the general stupidity of the populace he was a tireless worker she had discovered in the few months he had been with her and this pleased her for she disliked being idle especially with her husband away a faint scratching at the door caught her attention and she called come in i thought you might be lonely deliciae said entering the room i am glad for your company zenobia answered although nothing was further from the truth she had been enjoying her solitude the council met almost the entire dayyou must be exhausted i thrive on hard work deliciae idleness is anathema to me is it true that you removed publius cato from the council the city is abuzz with rumors already she was amused publius cato made an error in judgment when he attempted to use the government to pursue a personal grudge alzena says women do not belong in government alzena would quickly change her mind if odenathus had left her as regent instead of me zenobia laughed let us not speak of her though deliciae instead tell me how you spent your day in idleness zenobia the very idleness you so abhor i spent most of my time beautifying myself although for what or whom i do not know i spent an hour with my sons but alas they are at an appalling age and speak only of weapons and horses are you happy deliciae no but then what is there for me i am odenathuss concubine although he has not used me as such in five years i am the mother of sons who no longer need me i have not the mind of weighty matters as do you i am as nothing what do you want then zenobia asked if i tell you will you keep it a secret i cannot have what i desire but i can dream i will keep it secret i want a husband zenobia being a wife and a mother is what i am best suited for in this life i know it is not possible but still i dream why is it not possible you have been beloved of a king and should that king decide to reward your devotion by giving you to some worthy man as a wife who is to tell him nay if you wish it i will speak to odenathus myself when he returns you are still young enough to have more children you would do that for me deliciaes hopeful face brought zenobia close to tears what a fool i have been she thought i have been so wrapped up in my own happiness that i did not see how miserable poor deliciae has been i shall never be a worthy queen if i can only speak of the peoples needs but do not see to them i will speak to the king deliciae but once i have then you must be honest with him i do not believe that you ever loved each other but you have been friends when i have paved the way for you speak openly to odenathus of your feelings i am not sure i can zenobia you must deliciae in the end only you can gain your own happiness what will happen to my sons if i leave the palace i do not know deliciae however i believe it would be best if they went with you rather than remain at the palace they are as yet young and need their mother while they live here in the palace thought zenobia deliciaes sons are made to feel like royal princes which they most certainly are not and they also are old enough to be troublesome should anything happen to odenathus indeed for everyones sake linos and vermis would be better off elsewhere she focused upon deliciae again i will see that you are not separated from your sons deliciae i could not bear it if i were separated from mine and i understand a mothers feelings deliciae fell to her knees and kissed the hem of zenobias gown her blue eyes were wet with tears thank you majesty thank you do not thank me yet deliciae we have yet to speak to the king he will listen to you deliciae said i know he will come now zenobia said join me for the evening meal i must retire early for tomorrow my friend julia tullio is to be married and i have been invited for the augurs at dawn the next morning zenobia wore a queenly flamecolored stola cinched with a wide gold belt inlaid with rubies and pearls about her throat was a magnificent necklace of hundreds of small pearls and rubies that dangled from cobweb thin gold wires and glittered upon the palegold skin of her chest great barbaric ruby ovals hung from her ears on her upper right arm was a golden snake with ruby eyes and beneath it were a carved gold bangle and a smooth bangle of pink coral on her left arm were three goldwire bracelets two studded with freshwater pearls flanking one encrusted with small rubies her slender fingers were dressed with but three rings her wedding band a great pink pearl and a squarecut pink sapphire zenobias heavy black hair was parted in the center and wound into a thick coil at the base of her neck an exquisitely wrought diadem of filigreed gold vines and pinksapphire flowers was set upon her head on her feet she wore gilt leather sandals looking at herself in the polishedsilver mirror held up by a slave she was surprised at how regal she looked of course she thought my height is finally proving an advantage longinus shivering in the predawn cold but elegant in a finely spun long white wool tunic and a purplebordered toga trabea of white and red stripes awaited her in the courtyard of the palace his gray hair was beautifully curled and smelled of a fragrant pomade giving her a wan smile he helped her into the litter and climbed in to seat himself opposite her the slaves lifted them and moved off and out through the palace gate if you are not too cold longinus i should prefer to leave the curtains open the sky before dawn is particularly lovely he sighed and nodded as he huddled down into the pillows she smiled to herself and for a few minutes they rode in silence zenobia watching the starry sky now beginning to lighten faintly at theedgesofthehorizon name me an unmarried man of good family whom we might wish to honor she said her question brought instant interest in longinuss brown eyes he sat up and she could see his subtle brain mulling over the matter while at the same time wondering what she was up to this time finally he said the man who comes to mind is rufus acilius curius his father was a roman centurion who married the daughter of a wealthy palmyran merchant about thirty years ago i remember it because it caused a great scandal the family was at that time untainted by roman blood and the father a fanatic on the subject but the girl got pregnant by her lover and there was no choice but to marry the centurion however proved a good husband and when he retired from the army settled here in palmyra rufus curius is the third son and he chose to make the army his career he is the first palmyranborh commander of qasralhêr hes very loyal to odenathus qasralhêr the border fortress yes the gods it is perfect you are sure he has no wife what of a betrothal a mistress none that i have heard find out for certain longinus i must know immediately why no one else would have dared to ask the question but zenobia was not offended by longinus he had become her close confidant deliciae is odenathuss concubine in name only she is unhappy longinus odenathus does not need her frankly she bores him but he would not dismiss her for she and her sons would suffer great shame if he did she longs to be a wife and to have other children i have promised her that i would speak to odenathus she is young enough to begin a new life i thought if he gave her in marriage to someone he wished to honor it would solve the problem yes longinus mused and now that you tell me what you want to do i can tell you that rufus curius is indeed the right man i expect you want her sons to go with her and rufus curius would be an excellent foster father for them he will see they grow up to be loyal citizens and honest men he gave her a wicked look i know that your intentions toward the lady deliciae are good ones but i cannot help but think you will not be sorry to see linos and vermis go for their own sakes and for the sake of my son vaballathus it is better that deliciaes sons not grow up thinking that they are princes the litter arrived at the home of manlius tullio syrius longinus descended from the vehicle then reached back in to help her out manlius tullio syrius knelt and touched the hem of zenobias skirts to his forehead you do us incredible honor my queen the humble house of tullio is made great by your presence rise father of my dearest friend julia i should ill repay your daughters friendship of many years if i did not come to wish her and her betrothed good fortune the elder tullio rose and then each member of his family beginning with his wife filomena paid homage to zenobia it was a large family and afterward longinus murmured softly to zenobia if you had come a halfhour earlier i would have been frozen in my tracks by the time they all kissed your hem zenobia stifled a chuckle as the brides mother spoke julia would like you to serve as pronuba your majesty filomena said i should be honored aunt filomena was the reply zenobia was led to the place of honor and as the sun slipped over the horizon the public augur slit the throat of a young sheep catching its blood in a silver basin for some minutes the augur carefully viewed the young rams smoking innards and then he said the omens are most favorable now antonius porcius blandus and julia tullio both appeared in the atrium and the wedding began zenobia stepped forward smiling at her friend and before the many witnesses joined the hands of the bride and the groom shyly julia repeated the traditional words whenand whereyou are gaius i then and theream gaia the words of consent given the ceremony continued now led by the high priest of jupiter and his assistants for a moment zenobia let her mind wander back to the happy day when she married odenathus and she sighed softly she missed him so very much if the damned romans wanted the persians subdued why didnt they send their own generals instead of the king of palmyra the empire is too big murmured a little voice in her head and they can no longer control it all themselves she pushed away the thought and glanced about at the other guests marcus alexander britainus was staring at her and for some reason that she didnt understand she blushed she was instantly furious at herself and shot him a withering look but to her surprise he was no longer looking at her what on earth was the matter with her she wondered feliciterthe guests shouted and zenobia realized that the ceremony was over she watched as antonius porcius vigorously kissed his rosycheeked bride are you satisfied now asked marcus suddenly at her side it is obvious that he loves her yes zenobia answered slowly it will be a good marriage and i am glad for julia she took a goblet of wine offered by a slave as did marcus would i offend you majesty if i told you that you were the most beautiful woman in this room the most beautiful woman i have ever seen in my entire life in all my travels for a moment her heart beat so quickly that she could not catch her breath to speak finally she managed to say why do you say such a thing to me marcus britainus why should it embarrass you that i speak a truth he said are we not good enough friends after all these years that i may say what i feel to you offer a compliment you have never said such things to me marcus britainus i am merely surprised the wine makes me bold he teased gently and then he said softly so only she might hear zenobia look at me surprised she raised her eyes to him never before bad he dared to use her name his blue eyes seeming to devour her held her prisoner and she was mesmerized while a strange heat swept over her body rendering her almost helpless are you a sorcerer too marcus britainus she finally said very shaken only a man majesty was the reply i am only a man she thought about the incident later that night after all the festivities were over longinus who had observed the little encounter between his mistress and marcus britainus had not left her side for the rest of the day but he said nothing for he could see that she was disturbed she was restless that night each time she drifted off she would see his face with its high cheekbones strong jaw long nose and those blue eyes that caressed and blazed down at her until she awoke drenched in her own sweat her heart pounding i have been too long without my hawk she thought with strangely clear logic i seem to be a woman who cannot get along without a man it would have disturbed zenobia even more had she known that marcus also lay awake that night his passion for her had not abated but rather grown over the years often he questioned himself as to whether it was simply because he could not possess her but the answer was always the same he loved her he had chided himself even as he had said the provocative words that risked his entire relationship with her it had been a rash thing to do but for once he had longed for zenobia to look at him like a man and not a teacher when his eyes had held hers in thrall that morning he had yearned to sweep her into his arms to kiss her marvelous ripe mouth to caress her beautiful body until she swooned with rapture then he had seen her frightened eyes and he had released his hold upon her why had she feared him was it possible that she was finally realizing that there was more to him than just history lessons marcus stretched his long body as he sought to find a more comfortable position he smiled ruefully how unlike the bold and licentious women of rome zenobia was she was still an innocent and it was his misfortune to have fallen in love with her a man of less character might have attempted to seduce her but it was not in his nature to entrap or force a woman the men he knew in rome men who practiced their new morality with lustful gusto would have laughed at him for a fool zenobia did not see marcus for several days and then she was only momentarily uncomfortable he however seemed not to notice as he intently described roman britain to her she would never know the effort it took him to appear so totally impersonal odenathus returned home victorious over the persians who had fled back across their borders to lick their wounds it was autumn and the bedawi again left the oasis city to wander the desert while the great caravans traveled in and out of palmyra with their varied goods the king confirmed his wifes temporary appointment of cassius longinus as a member of the council the government ran smoothly i have long wanted to get rid of publius cato but there was simply no reason for me to dismiss him he chuckled the gossip tells me that publius cato had bragged that i would reappoint him when i returned to palmyra he will not thank you for making him a laughingstock my hawk it might be wise to offer him some harmless but seemingly important post he hugged her lovingly i shall take your suggestion zenobia the man who collects the taxes upon the silk from cathay has recently died we shall offer publius cato this post although i doubt that those who import the silk thread to dye will thank us i have a feeling that they will cope a great deal more easily with publius cato than the government has been able to do zenobia replied you have done so well while i was gone he complimented her marius gracchus himself told meand compliments from that old fox do not come easily or often although the council was fearful of my departure now they feel that i may meet my obligations as romes commander of the eastern legions without endangering palmyra he grimaced i am not sure that i should not be worried zenobia for if you prove a more adept ruler than i they could depose me i could do nothing if i did not know you were coming home to me my hawk she answered fervently there might come a time when you have to my flower oh i do not mean to frighten you but no man even a king is impervious to an opponents spear an enemys arrow if i should die before vaballathus is old enough to rule in his own right you would be regent of this city its ruler you will not die in battle it is not your fate i know it he kissed her slowly sorceress he murmured against her mouth what spells do you weave to keep me safe his hands slipped beneath her robes to caress her silky skin no hawk she protested i yet have something to discuss with you is it more important than our love he said fondling a ripe breast she squirmed away reluctantly it concerns our love my hawk i love you with all my heart and you i know love me still deliciae remains your concubine although you have not favored her in several years have you any idea how unhappy she is he looked curiously at her are you suggesting that i return to her bed if you do i shall scratch both your eyes out zenobia said with mock anger no my hawk that is not the answer while you were away deliciae and i were much together and one night she confided to me how unhappy she is she is grateful to you of course but she longs for what we have she wants a husband and she wants other children she has been loyal many years and she deserves to be rewarded deliciae really wants this he asked yes and have you chosen a candidate for her hand rufus curius the commander of qasralhêr how did you arrive at that choice his voice was somewhat strained it was longinuss suggestion he tells me that rufus curius is the first palmyranborn centurion to command our border fortress he says that rufus curius is a good man who will be a model husband for deliciae and a fine foster father for linos and vermis how can you ask me to relinquish my sons he demanded of her and zenobia was truly shocked by the anguish in his voice i know how you love linos and vermis she answered him but you do them no kindness by keeping them here in palmyra at the palace they have already begun asking why their halfbrother vaballathus is your heir instead of one of them your mother does not help either for she encourages this attitude in them reason cannot aid us for logic will not prevail over emotion i want no other man raising my sons odenathus said stubbornly zenobia lost her temper and what of my sons she demanded furiously if you were killed in battle what is to stop a dissident group from pressing a claim on linoss part no bastard has ever sat on palmyras throne but by keeping your sons by deliciae here in the palace you appear to favor them there are those who might even assume that you favor them over your legitimate sons you cannot control the situation if you are not here my lord king now it was he who was shocked never had he heard her voice drip so with scorn and venom she had always been truthful even to the point of bluntness but never had he heard her so fierce had her time as ruler of palmyra given her a taste of power that she was reluctant to relinquish now that he had returned the truth of the matter was that deliciaes presence had become something of a burden still he had never thought of sending his older sons away i must think on it my flower he said think well and do not think overlong she replied getting up and moving away from him do you threaten me my flower his voice held a dangerous note she was neither afraid nor impressed for although she loved him she was suddenly seeing him through different eyes i merely ask that you not delay in your decision my lord she replied coldly and walked from the room he felt strangely bereft for in their six years of marriage they had never had a serious quarrel odenathus sensed that things between himself and zenobia would never be the same he had somehow failed her failed her in an unforgivable way was she correct was it possible that his open affection for his two older sons might lead people to think that he favored his illegitimate children over his legitimate ones he loved all his boys still should he fall in battle before his sons were grown he shuddered at the thought of the civil war that could follow for zenobia would not sit quietly by and allow her own sons inheritance to be usurped and if rome involved itself his whole line could be wiped out he shouted for his secretary and was dictating almost before the unfortunate scribe could ink his pen and put it to parchment he ordered rufus acilius curius to report to him immediately no matter the time of day or night immediately he realized now that zenobia was right and he would brook no delay if rufus curius was not contracted or in love he was going to find himself married before weeks end it was a confused commander of qasralhêr who arrived at the palace several hours later rufus curius could not imagine why he had been summoned had he somehow offended the king was there to be a war he was justifiably nervous as he was hurriedly escorted before his lord and odenathuss piercing appraisal of his person did nothing to put him at his ease the king noted that rufus curius had his roman fathers height and a reddish cast to his curly hair but his eyes were brown and his features very much palmyran he stood properly at attention before his ruler odenathus grinned and the man before him relaxed somewhat rufus curius said the king his black eyes sparkling with amusement you are to be married i think tomorrow would be a good day rufus curiuss mouth gaped married married his king replied your bride is to be the lady deliciae who has for many years been in my favor she is a good and beautiful woman rufus curius she will bring to your house my two sons linos and vernus i entrust you with their care and upbringing for i am told that you are a loyal and virtuous man these children cannot remain in my house lest others believe i favor them over my heir prince vaballathus i know that you will be a good foster father to my natural sons sire i am not unmindful of the honor you would do me rufus curius said but i would have children of my own the lady deliciae is a good breeder and an excellent mother odenathus said yet she has only given you two children in all the years she has been with you it takes two people to breed rufus curius was the reply immediate understanding flooded the centurions face i am grateful for this opportunity to serve you further my lord clapping his hands the king commanded the summoned slave to fetch deliciae she arrived wearing a pale blue stola and her lovely milkwhite bosom rose rather provocatively above the low neckline her beautiful blond hair was braided and looped gracefully on either side of her head her only jewelry was a thin gold chain about her neck the whole effect was of purity and innocence rufus curius looked once his eyes glazing over and deliciae smiled sweetly the centurion was lost the wedding was set for two days later it was agreed that deliciaes sons would not go immediately with their mother but follow her a month later so she might have some private time with her new husband the day following their wedding deliciae and her new husband left for qasralhêr but in the royal palace of palmyra deliciaes sons found themselves in great trouble with typical eight and nineyearold logic linos and vernus had decided that if their younger halfbrothers were not around their father would not send them away they had taken their four and fiveyearold halfbrothers to the slave market and attempted to sell them to a merchant whose caravan was shortly traveling to cathay the merchant was enchanted by the two goldenskinned grayeyed little boys who spoke so well and were obviously quite intelligent but he was equally suspicious of linos and vermis they were a trifle young to be selling slaves it was fortunate that he was an honest man taking the two younger boys aside he asked them their names he didnt doubt the answers he received i am prince vaballathus lisped the older of the two my papa is the king this is my brother demi he is a prince too and who are the other boys asked the merchant they are linos and vernus their mamaher name is deliciaewas married yesterday and we were given sugared almonds vaba smiled up at the merchant i like sugared almonds dont you yes the merchant replied i like sugared almonds too i will give you some to eat while i take you and your bromer back to the palace no one in the palace had ever seen zenobia angry but that day her rage consumed everything in her path she had to be physically restrained from attacking linos and vermis get them out of my sight she shrieked if i ever see them again i will strangle them with my bare hands she ordered her sons nurses beheaded an order countermanded by odenathus you cannot blame them he attempted to reason with her the children have always played together how could the nurses know what linos and vermis planned weeping she heaped rewards upon the merchant invoking the gods blessings upon him odenathus absolved the stunned merchant of all future taxes for himself and his heirs unto the tenth generation zenobias rage would not abate this is all your mothers doing she accused you would not listen to me when i warned you that she was filling their headsshe could not bear even to say their nameswith ideas above their station my sons my beautiful babies could have been lost to us forever and it would have been your fault the shock and fear had made her unreasonable you would not have cared though would you if my sons had been lost to you then you could have simply done what that bitch from hades your mother has always wanted you could have made deliciaes brats your heirs i will never forgive you never there was no reasoning with her for several days although she did forgive the nurses for the sake of her children linos and vernus were confined to their apartment in deep disgrace they were not malicious children but the sudden change in their lives had made them unsure of their own future they very much needed to know who they were and where they belonged in this frightening world their father told them in no uncertain terms that although they were his sons he had not been married to their mother this meant that in the eyes of the law they could inherit nothing of his that privilege belonged to his wifes sons their halfbrothers whatever ideas their grandmother had given them they must forget for she was nothing but a foolish old woman alzena however was a changed woman as she desperately tried to explain to zenobia i did not mean them to harm vaba and demi she wept her proud face crumbled and suddenly old if they had i would have torn your throat out with my bare teeth zenobia snarled i love vaba and demi too zenobia alzena sobbed do you have never loved anyone or anything in your life was the cruel reply alzena mastered herself you have the intolerance of the very young zenobia she said i have loved oh yes i have loved sighing she began to pace and as she did she spoke when i was ten i fell in love and my whole life i have loved this man although he is dead almost twenty years now his name was ardashir and he was the king of persia his son shapur now reigns ah how i loved him and from the first he loved me though i was but a child it was he who sent me here to palmyra to be wife to odenathuss father i fought against leaving i begged him to let me be his concubine to be his slave anything but to leave him i might have swayed him but my older sister was ardashirs wife she did not object to ardashir having concubines as long as i was not one of them so despite my protests i was sent to palmyra and all might have been well if only odenathuss father had been understanding of my girlish heartbreak but all he wanted was an heir you have undoubtedly heard the story of how he raped me on our wedding night well it is true for he did and every night after that until he was sure i was pregnant when my son was bom he was taken immediately from me i was not even allowed to nurse him i remember begging my husband to let me have my baby back but he only laughed and said that he knew of ardashirs plan to make my son sympathetic to the persians and that i would never be allowed to taint him each day after that the child was brought to me for one hour but i was never left alone with him i begged my husband for another child that might be mine but he refused then too he said i was not to his taste i was too skinny and he preferred plump women i grew bitter zenobia and is it any wonder my son was growing up without knowing me i had a husband in name only and i was separated from the only man i had ever loved when odenathuss father died i tried to regain my sons love so i might have some small comfort in my old age but you came and odenathus had no time for me again do you blame me that i have hated you that i have tried to make your life the hell that mine has been why should you have been loved and i not believe me though i would never intentionally hurt my grandsons which ones zenobia asked harshly none of them neither linos nor vermis nor vaballathus nor demetrius i love them zenobia they are all i have and they love me i do not know if i can ever forgive you zenobia said i do not know if i can forgive myself was the sad reply in my bitterness and jealousy i may have done deliciaes sons great harm if you will let me i will try and undo it whatever i have said in the past i know that palmyra can have only one heir and it must be my sons legitimate heir your son vaballathus zenobia looked closely at her husbands mother what she saw convinced her that alzena was being honest i do not know if we will ever be friends alzena but whatever you can do to convince those two of the error of their ways i will appreciate and you will not take vaba and demi from me no and you will forgive my odenathus you cannot fault him for loving all his sons his love is not the cause of my anger i am angry with him because he refused to see the danger until it was almost too late you must forgive him zenobia you are his joy you have been surrounded your entire life by love and cannot know how terrible it is to be without it afterward as she sat alone zenobia began to question if she had ever really loved her husband she enjoyed his lovemaking and she certainly enjoyed his company he was her friend and companion and she respected him but was that love was that all that had bound her parents together she thought not yet she did not know for certain and wondered if she ever would for the first time her life was not simple and clearcut when she was a child her father and akbar had been her gods when she had married she had turned to odenathus it had never occurred to her that things would someday be different she could not erase all the good years with him simply because he had disappointed her but neither could she ever completely trust in him again she knew that she was being unreasonable yet the feeling was there and could not be denied men it seemed were fallible why had that thought never occurred to her before if odenathus had put her on a pedestal to be worshiped then so too had she put him on a pedestal majesty zenobia turned to see a slave girl yes marcus alexander is here for your lesson majesty zenobia nodded at the slave girl and hurried out into the garden of her little palace where lessons were held on pleasant days when he turned to greet her something within her quivered and for a moment she looked searchingly at him good morning majesty good day marcus britainus i have decided it is far too lovely a day for lessons will you ride with me are you certain you are not one of those women sent to lure hapless travelers to their doom he teased her and she chuckled as she remembered their first meeting in the desert you will have to take your chances roman she teased back feeling more lighthearted than she had in days marcus alexander rode a largeboned arab gelding gold in color with a creamy white mane and tail zenobia a big gray stallion she was dressed as he first remembered seeing her in a short white tunic and gold sandals although they were both recognized as they rode through the city they were not stopped by the queens adoring admirers and once through the gates of palmyra zenobia let her stallion have his head they rode without stopping and without speech for several miles marcus alexander was content to follow for although he had lived in the desert for some years now one sand dune looked the same as another to him it always amazed him that the nativeborn of palmyra seemed to know exactly where they were going zenobia watched him from beneath her lashes as they cantered along she was conscious of the long muscled legs that guided his mount so easily and suddenly zenobia was painfully aware of him as a male being there was an auburn down on his shapely legs and his feet were much longer than her husbands unexpectedly zenobias mount reared up and caught daydreaming she found herself pitched from his back into a small dune marcus instantly dismounted and was by her side gathering her into his arms and calling frantically to her she was momentarily stunned but as her vision cleared she became aware of his mouth but inches from hers zenobia stared momentarily frozen he wanted to kiss her and she knew it instinctively her lips softened and parted as she found to her shock that she wanted to kiss him zenobia he whispered hearing the hunger in his voice was enough to bring her back to her senses with a little sob she turned her head away from him and hot tears slid down her cheeks she didnt know why she was crying but she couldnt seem to stop with a deep sigh marcus held her close to his heart and crooned to her as he might have to an injured child are you all right majesty he asked forcing away any thought of what might have been her tears now controlled zenobia replied softly i think that i have only injured my pride marcus britainus i have never been thrown from my horse before i cannot understand what caused the beast to rear up like that her mount was now standing quietly although he quivered nervously i will see to the animal he seems yet agitated marcus rose and walked over to the queens gray stallion easy my beauty he said gently to the horse and took his bridle scanning the ground around the animal for a few minutes marcus finally found what he sought scorpion he said to zenobia and a huge one at that no wonder this big beauty of yours panicked zenobia rose to her feet is he all right she asked marcus ran a swift and knowledgeable hand over the horses legs and looking up said he appears to be perfect majesty he just needs the reassurance of you upon his back again help me up she commanded softly and he bent cupping his hands so she might have a mounting place zenobia vaulted lightly back onto the gray and then said come marcus britainus we have not finished our ride kicking the beast she started off again this time more careful to keep her mind on the horse and her surroundings later however in the privacy of her own rooms she began to think over the incident in the desert during her whole adult life her beauty and sensuality had been directed toward odenathus she had been taught that a woman cleaved unto her husband only but zenobia had always been honest with herself and she was being honest now when she admitted to herself that she had wanted to kiss marcus had very much wanted to feel his mouth possessing hers in a burning and passionate kiss did she really desire marcus or was it that she was still angry at odenathus what had made her turn away from the roman at the last moment with an angry sound she pushed the disturbing thoughts away she was a grown woman and the kings beloved wife not a silly young girl who gave in to her desires the roman emperor valerian came east from italy and engaged the persian king shapur in a pitched battle at the ancient city of edessa in mesopotamia just north of palmyra the romans were defeated and driven back while their emperor was led into a shameful captivity from which he would never escape no one could understand why valerian had come east especially when odenathus and his palmyran legions had successfully driven the persians out of the eastern empire the previous autumn shapur now felt invincible and taunted the romans with the imperial captive he used valerian as a human footstool when mounting his horse finally beheading the emperor he presented his tanned skin to the horrified roman delegation sent to negotiate valerians release valerians son was wild with grief and thoughts of revenge he was now emperor and in their outrage over their defeat his army never considered replacing him which was fortunate for gallienus faced usurpations almost immediately on three fronts while gallienus took on two of his own challengers odenathus defeated the third at emesa and was reconfirmed king by the grateful gallienus odenathus returned from his defense of the empire a changed man zenobia had greeted him coolly but he seemed not to notice the time is close he told her when we may throw off the chains that have bound us all these years what has changed she asked the government in rome is worse off than ever my flower every legion has a candidate for emperor although only a few have dared to rebel so far gallienus is beset by too many problems both internal and external he may be resolute but he cannot possibly solve the empires difficulties the silver coinage is being debased and he has already incurred the enmity of the senate he has taken away perquisites from the politicians and the majority of the senate is far more interested in its social position and its privileges than in good government so we will take advantage of their weaknesses zenobia mused we will attack them and free ourselves not quite yet my queen you must learn patience zenobia never make a move until you can be sure of success rome trusts us and having gained an alliance with us will not look often in our direction we will now begin to rebuild our armies and in a few years we will free ourselves as well as expand our own territories she smiled a smile of genuine delight as she finally fully understood his intentions in other words my husband we shall expand our own empire under the guise of keeping the roman peace it is brilliant exactly was his reply oh hawk i am so proud of you she cried kissing him with the first genuine affection she had shown him in months he returned her ardor wanting it to go on forever but knowing that he must clear the air between them gently he disengaged her and set her back from him zenobia he said in a serious tone do not make the mistake with me that you made before i could not bear it if you withdrew your love from me again you must understand that i am only a mortal man i am not invincible or infallible my flower reaching out he cupped her chin in his hand for a moment what a paradox you are you are intelligent enough to run a government yet emotionally you are still a child in many ways i erred zenobia and you must learn to forgive those who err am i so intolerant then she asked troubled only of those you love he said a hint of amusement in his voice then he drew her into his arms it was better between zenobia and odenathus then but the relationship that they had once had was gone forever perhaps if they had had the time they might have regained it but there was no time palmyras king moved to annex syria palestine mesopotamia and eastern asia minor finally breaking the back of the persian ruler king shapur retreated a final time over his own borders never to return in palmyra zenobia ruled wisely in her husbands frequent absences driving her golden chariot around the city she became a familiar sight to her people in an unruly world palmyra was a safe haven of green in the middle of a sandy sea each day zenobia drilled her own troops a special guard that had been formed in addition to her own camel corps at first the young men recruited for her guard would not believe that a woman could lead a command at their first meeting zenobia quickly disabused them of that notion fighting the largest of their group and beating him soundly with her broadsword she could throw a spear farther than any of them and she taught them to use a bow and arrow while moving at a full gallop they were quickly devoted to her for she was patient with their errors and generous with her praise the queens guard would have died for her and on one of his rare visits home odenathus teased her about it wondering if he should be jealous of all those strong young men who were so loyal to his wife marcus britainus waited for he knew not what zenobia had never mentioned or even vaguely referred to the incident in the desert when they had both come so close to indiscretion when they had returned to palmyra that day he had sought out the beautiful courtesan sadira and used her almost savagely it is obvious that you love a woman you cannot have marcus alexander sadira had said but i cannot suffer each time you visit me because i am not that woman do not return to me unless you exorcise the devils within you marcus might have bought himself a beautiful slave girl in palmyras famous slave markets but he wanted no woman if he could not have zenobia often his thoughts were black but these thoughts he kept to himself sometimes in the night he would awaken and wonder what would happen if odenathus were killed in battle then he would despise himself for having fallen so low in his desperate love for zenobia that he wished the king his friend dead with an eye to marriage he made a serious effort to look over the available women within his class but no one captured his heart he reconciled himself to bachelorhood he saw zenobia frequently for from the beginning he had always been included in her social life he and longinus were her frequent escorts whenever odenathus was away they would stand on either side of her at the games or at the theater or amuse her with witty conversation at dull state dinners it was not a great deal he thought somewhat sadly but at least he was with her despite his familys constant pleas from rome he could not marry true most marriages were things of convenience but marcus alexander britainus would not marry without love and there would never be anyone for him but zenobia of palmyra wife to odenathus the persians were finally beaten and odenathus would at last be home for good barring another war palmyra had never been so prosperous so strong so invincible it had a warrior king a wise and beautiful queen and two healthy princes vaballathus who would soon be twelve and his younger brother demetrius now almost eleven there was great celebration in honor of the royal family the city was filled to overflowing with dignitaries from as far east as cathay and the lands beyond the indus river there wasnt a family whose house didnt accommodate relatives and other guests antonius porcius and his wife julia were playing hosts to rufus curius deliciae and their children in addition to linos and vermis they had produced six children in the ten years of their marriage julia and deliciae had both become plump with age both were dedicated wives and mothers the pampered daughter of one of palmyras most distinguished families and the former concubine of nameless parentage found that they had a great deal in common and were fast friends rufus curius had been a good foster father to deliciaes two oldest sons he had never favored his own sons over them offering equal love and equal discipline to all the children in his family unfortunately alzena had rooted the bitter seed of discontent deep within their hearts and although they outwardly seemed to adjust to their new life linos and vermis never forgot that they were odenathuss older sons intelligent they eagerly learned the arts of warfare from their foster father and it was expected that they would join the army when they returned to qasralhêr the palmyran celebration was to last six days with all entertainments free and open to everyone food and drink were available to all courtesy of the royal council certain prisoners were released in honor of the kings victory over the persians others would have the opportunity to win their freedom in gladitorial combat in the great palmyran amphitheater the games held in palmyra were probably the most humane in the entire empire the palmyrans did not have the lust for blood that the citizens of rome did the gladitorial combat was therefore with blunt weapons and a man put down by his opponent was subject to the crowds judgment a thumb turned upward meant he was allowed to get up and continue a downward thumb meant the contest was immediately awarded to his opponent unlike rome palmyra did not allow man and animal to fight nor did women battle dwarfs palmyras openair theater which dated from before the roman occupation was offering comedies each morning and its ten thousand seats were always filled there were no women performers young boys whose voices were still high played the female parts zenobia in particular enjoyed the earthy ribald humor each night after the celebrations the rulers of palmyra held a banquet to which the rich and famous were invited but on the final day their banquet was limited to their family and close friends it was not as elaborate a meal as the previous nights beginning with silver platters of boiled peeled eggs with a piquant dipping sauce artichokes in wine vinegar and olive oil thin slices of onion and salted fish the second course offered baby lamb garnished with tiny onions which had been roasted with it and sprinkled with fresh mint antelope with asparagus and beets an enormous haunch of beef chickens roasted with lemon sauce bowls of beans peas and cabbage platters of cucumbers lettuce carrots and radishes black and green olives in glass bowls and round loaves of fine white bread mulsum a drink made of four parts wine and one part honey was drunk with the first course and meal wine a mixture of water and wine was served with the second course because straight wine was considered harmful to the stomach until it had been well filled the last course offered fresh fruits peaches apricots green and red grapes pomegranates cherries oranges figs and plums there were honey cakes rolled in poppy or sesame seeds in chopped almonds or pistachios there were large dates stuffed with walnuts and at last the goblets were filled with rich and heady dark red wine there was entertainments with the final course a jongleur who delighted the children by being able to handle six oranges at one time and a clever elderly man from cathay with a troupe of dancing dogs the older boys enjoyed the acrobats the gentlemen the dancing girls from egypt it was a warm and friendly gathering with cassius longinus and marcus britainus joining zenobia odenathus and their children alzena antonius porcius his julia and their children rufus curius deliciae and their children linos and vermis now elderly zabaai ben selim tamar zenobias favorite brodier akbar ben zabaai and even old bab odenathus stood raising a fresh goblet of wine to toast them all to palmyra he said to my beloved wife zenobia and to my sons to all of you he gestured with the goblet my family my friends then he spilled a portion of the goblet to the gods he toasted and quickly quaffed the wine down all stood and raised their own goblets to him in salute preparatory to drinking but suddenly a terrible look came over odenathuss face and he doubled over his voice barely a whisper but clearly heard by them all dont drink i have been poisoned then he fell back onto the couch alzena screamed in horror her hand going to her mouth as zenobia shot her a quelling look fetch the doctor hurry the queen cried to the servants a servant ran from the room as julia quickly gathered up the small children and herded them out along with the kings weeping mother fortunately they had seen little and understood nothing do not fear my hawk zenobia whispered the doctor is coming odenathus shook his head i am a dead man my flower and he grimaced as a burning pain tore through his guts you must rule palmyra until vaba is of age zenobia painfully he raised himself so they might all see him prince vaballathus is my choice my heir the next king of palmyra zenobia is to rule in his place until he is of age as he fell back he cried out promise me the men gathered about the king and said with one voice we will protect prince vaballathuss rights majesty where is the doctor zenobias voice was edged with hysteria zenobiahis voice was weaker now as if having settled the succession little was left for him give me your hand my flower she took his slender hand icy now with approaching death her eyes were filled with tears that she could not control ah he said softly how i have loved you and then he was dead for a moment silence then zenobia said in a strained voice i want to know who did this want to know the royal physician ran into the room saw odenathus and flung himself on the floor before the queen take my life majesty for what use am i to you by being too late he cried no apollodorus it is not your fault but take the other goblets of wine being careful to mark each one and tell me if they too were poisoned the physician stood and moving to the table quickly began lifting each goblet and sniffing carefully at it when he had checked every goblet in the room he looked at zenobia and said it is not necessary for me to make a further study my queen every goblet but two was poisoned all in this room but two would have died had they drunk zenobia looked to odenathuss oldest sons why she asked knowing they were the quiet ones it was linos who answered because i should be the next king i was the eldest son not vaba odenathus was going to formally invest vaba as his heir tomorrow but why everyone linos if you were all dead the people would have to accept me besides the emperor promised that he would support me gallienus zenobia was shocked he always secretly held my father responsible for valerians death at the hands of king shapur valerian was responsible for his own death the fool was the sharp reply then zenobia turned to rufus curius and said quietly take your wife from the room rufus curius the commander of qasralhêr led his numb and sobbing wife out whether deliciae wept for odenathus or her sons even she did not know zenobia drew her older son forward and longinus lifted the boy up onto the dining table the king is dead zenobia said in a strangely strong voice long live the king long life to king vaballathus the men in the room took up the cry nolinos shouted but it was his last word akbar ben zabaai moved quickly behind the young man and slit his throat vermis screamed but one wordmamathen the blade silenced him forever take them out into the desert and leave their bodies for carrion commanded the highpitched voice of the new king they have killed our father and do not deserve the honor of a burial his young voice was strong but he looked to his mother for corroboration her nod was barely perceptible i think that the king and his brother had best be taken to bed now majesty longinus said it is necessary that we call the council together immediately a check must be made to ascertain if anyone else was involved in the plot against the royal family the city must be secured against possible uprising or outside attack the people should be informed then assured that all is well zenobia nodded so be it see to finding the council and send my guard to me tell rufus curius to return immediately she turned to face the others in the room i must ask everyone here to please remain as she continued to give detailed instructions to longinus antonius porcius moved next to marcus britainus and said softly what do you know of this marcuss face was grim nothing he answered i have always avoided being involved in imperial politics i can only suppose that the weak fool gallienus made wild accusations in one of his drunken moods but how he managed to involve linos and vernus i do not know it is obvious that there is an imperial spy here in palmyra was the reply marcus looked at antonius porcius in surprise i am not an imperial spy he said alzena chose that moment to reenter the room she walked slowly over to the fallen body of her son and gently smoothed his brow odenathuss face was peaceful in death and although he was but thirtyeight he looked much younger sorrow had etched deep lines in his mothers once proud face and she who so valued her appearance was oblivious to the fact that her face was dirty with tears sadly she shook her head i had him such a little time she said zenobia moved over to her motherinlaw and in the first gesture of affection that she had ever shown the woman put her arm about her shoulders i do not understand it she said to alzena but surely it is the will of the gods why else would this man be taken from us gently she led the grieving woman back to the door calling to old bab who had been in the dining room all along take her to ala and stay if you are needed bab nodded and putting an arm around alzenas waist led the woman off down the corridor rufus curius reentered the room turning to him zenobia said rufus curius i am placing the king and his brother in your charge see to their safety you can trust me after what happened the centurions eyes misted i do not blame you rufus curius the damage was done to linos and vernus before you became their foster father i know you did your best and i thank the gods you have your own children that deliciae has something to live for despite this tragedy please now escort my sons to their quarters and arrange that some of the men of my guard watch over them then see to your wife for i know tonights events have left her devastated rufus curius saluted his queen and then bowed to the young king and his brother if your majesty will allow me i will escort you and prince demetrius to your apartments demi hurled himself into his mothers arms weeping and zenobia soothed him as best she could kissing away his tears and chiding him gently that his father would want him to be brave firmly she disengaged his hold about her neck and placed his small hand into the centurions big one young vaba bowed in a courtly way before his mother his face grave good night mother zenobia reached out and pulling him to her breast hugged him tightly good night my lord she said her voice strangely tight he drew away from her and nodding to rufus curius to go almost ran from the room watching him go she sighed he was so young to have this responsibility thrust upon him yet a boy tonight his childhood had endedor had it was it really necessary for vaba only twelve to be laden with such responsibility perhaps she could give him a year or two more before she must teach him how to be king he would be the better for it she knew the council began arriving staring at first in shocked fascination at the dead body of their king only when they had all come did zenobia give the order that her husbands body be removed and prepared for its funeral sit down she commanded and they quickly obeyed her seeking seats about the dining table i am appointing antonius porcius to the council of ten to replace the king and marcus britainus will have temporary command of palmyras legions are there are objections her gaze swept them antonius porcius has long been a resident of this city marius gracchus said although he was not bom here he chose to remain upon his retirement he has married into one of our most distinguished families i can find no fault with the queens choice in the matter of marcus britainus however i am confused as to why the queen has chosen him over a palmy ran officer the king trusted him was the reply and so do i he has had several years of military experience with the praetorian and it is precisely because he is a roman that i have chosen him rome trusted my husband and gave him great powers with his death i do not want them sending someone from rome to oversee our armies rome will not find any fault in my choice and we shall be left alone then it only waits for marcus britainus to accept your appointment marius gracchus replied he looked directly at the roman his glance searching and not entirely trusting marcus was totally surprised by zenobias decision and he could see the hostility in many on the council of ten he wasnt sure exactly what it was she was asking him to do vaba was far too young to take over his fathers command and rome was eventually going to send someone out obviously she wanted a little time to organize the government he could aid her without being disloyal to rome but more important he would have constant access to her marcus britainus her voice was soft as she fixed her wonderful gray eyes on him marcus britainus will you accept of course majesty i am honored at the faith you have in me it is settled then she said and only longinus who knew her best heard the relief in her voice now we must get to the succession those who were with us this evening heard my husband name our eldest son vaballathus septimius his heir the next king the council of ten must honor odenathuss dying request what of the kings elder sons zenobia froze her eyes darkening with anger and she looked at a council member named quintus urbicus do you refer to the kings two bastards her voice was icy they are both dead the council gasped the eldest linos zenobia continued was responsible for his fathers death the younger was guilty also they killed the king quintus urbicus and it was a miracle that they did not kill all of us there were five women and ten children here this night ten children including palmyras rightful heir prince vaballathus is only twelve my queen it is true that king vaballathus is yet young but he is of the true line of palmyra this is a dangerous situation said macro cursor another council member a child king is always vulnerable he cannot be allowed to rule until he is of age if the kings older sons are dead and unavailable to us then the council of ten must take over for our boy king he looked around the table for support but only quintus urbicus seemed in open agreement with him antonius porcius cleared his throat we cannot have ten people ruling palmyra it would lead to chaos and in the end rome would send another governor it only remains for us to choose a regent to rule in the kings place until he is of age what more natural choice can we make than to appoint the queen regent of palmyra the king wanted it so the queen the council looked to zenobia antonius porcius is correct the speaker was marius gracchus the queen is a perfect choice for regent rome will accept her for she is a known quantity to them and with a former praetorian officer in charge of the legion he allowed them all to absorb the obvious when you think on it my friends he continued the queen is the only logical choice she has an excellent grasp of government and has ruled well in our late kings many absences does anyone else wish to put forward another candidate for this post his gaze swept the table then i can assume there is no need for us to vote on this and that the matter is settled queen zenobia will rule in her sons stead until he is of age marius gracchus looked again to the queen and then sat down zenobia stood and faced them all i will rule alone for the next two years she said bluntly my son needs more time to grow he will attend council meetings only once a month but of course will be present on all state occasions my husbands body will lie in state tomorrow and be buried the following day it will be as the queen has said marius gracchus intoned i thank you all for coming zenobia said the council is now dismissed longinus and marcus britainus to remain for a moment good night no sooner had they gone than zenobias face crumbled and she began to cry longinus dismissed the guard and turning back to her was not surprised to see his queen held firmly in marcus britainuss strong arms for some minutes she sobbed her grief and longinus could hear the romans voice softly comforting the woman what a remarkable creature she was he thought never once in the few hours since odenathuss death had she allowed herself one moment of weakness she had been firm and resolute even ruthless taking charge of the very dangerous situation she was amazing as her pain abated zenobia was suddenly aware of the fact that warm arms encircled her beneath her cheek a hard chest cloaked a heart that beat steadily to her confused and numbed mind it felt right and she snuggled deeper into the embrace she was so tired so suddenly and terribly tired her legs gave way and as they did she felt herself being lifted up marcus britainus looked to longinus for aid follow me was the reply there is a guest bedroom nearby if we go to the queens apartments old bab and all the queens maidens will flutter and fuss i will stay with her the roman said if she awakens in a strange place it could frighten her longinus almost laughed aloud at this weakness being attributed to zenobia ah well let the roman have his dream he thought yes that would be best marcus britainus he answered ushering the man and his burden into a pleasant room reserved for state visitors i will leave you longinus said i want to see to the young king and his brother he hurried out marcus carefully laid zenobia on the bed drew up a chair and sat down for a long time he stared at zenobia she was so incredibly beautiful her skin by the gods it was flawless perfect venus herself could not have had more beautiful skin hesitantly he reached out and touched it finding it as he had suspected smooth and soft growing bolder he let his fingers trail down her face her neck her shoulder reverently he fondled the rounded shoulder admiring how marvelously proportioned she was his hand seemed to move of itself slipping lower and lower until it moved past the neckline of her violet stola and he cupped a warm full breast he almost cried aloud with the pleasurable pain of the act and then he snatched his hand away as if her skin had been a hot coal he looked at the hand with revulsion what kind of a man was he to take advantage of an unconscious woman a woman who had just lost the husband she loved had his own love rendered him mad burying his face in his hands he groaned with shame then her voice touched him marcus britainus what is it slowly he raised his head and then his deep blue eyes met her goldflecked gray ones for the longest time they stared each transfixed by the others eyes and then he lowered his head and his mouth found hers in a deep and burning kiss a kiss he had waited so long to give her into zenobias mind came the single and simple thought this is how it was meant to be and as his hungry lips moved over her own as her own lips returned the fire it came to her with startling clarity that this was the man she had been waiting for all of her life how could that be she thought wonderingly how the question brushed through her mind briefly and then she gave herself up to the wonder of his embrace the kiss deepened and she could feel him trembling with the depth of his emotion putting her arms up she drew him closer to her her graceful strong hands caressing the sensitive back of his neck her fingers entwining themselves in his thick chestnutcolored hair she could sense the natural wave of it as her fingers slipped through its soft silkiness she could feel his tongue against her lips gently encouraging her to allow him that first most intimate embrace and without hesitation she acquiesced velvet fire filled her mouth probing exploring caressing with infinite tenderness a first flush of heat poured over her body and she shuddered with delight finished with his exploration he kissed the comers of her mouth moving to the soft spot beneath her ear down her slim neck to the hollow between shoulder and neck there he buried his face for a moment inhaling the natural fragrance of her that mixed with the hyacinth scent of her perfume finally he sighed raised his head from its sanctuary and looked deeply into her eyes i want more he said simply leaving the decision to her zenobia said not a word but she swung her legs over the edge of the sleeping couch and stood up her eyes never left his as she loosened her stola and let it slip to the cool marble floor her camisa finely spun white linen that gave a glimpse of the glories to come followed reaching up she drew the jeweled pins from her midnight hair and it tumbled free her piercing look spoke as clearly as words would have he obeyed standing to disrobe quickly all the while filling his blue eyes with her golden beauty if venus came down to the world of mortals he thought she must surely look like this he was enchanted by her body which was the most beautiful he could ever remember seeing she was tall for a woman yet despite wide shoulders her bone structure was really quite delicate and the shoulders served to enhance the large breasts naked now he reached out to place a hand about her small waist because of his height most women were always too tiny against him but zenobia was just right her dark head almost to his shoulder he drew her nearer feeling the small round of her belly as it pressed against him reaching out she caressed his cheek there was neither shame nor shyness between them he tipped her face upward so he might look at her i love you he said quietly i have always loved you i have loved you from the beginnings of time and i shall love you long after our memories have faded from this earth then picking her up in his arms he returned her to the sleeping couch and lay down next to her for some minutes they lay together holding hands and then her voice soft with confusion said i do not understand this marcus and yet i desire you i want you to make love to me why you must find your own answers my beloved but i shall never force you to anything you do not want i will rise now and go if that be your wish no at that he drew her into his strong arms again and kissed her with such passion that she could not restrain herself from responding she matched him kiss for kiss tasting him scorching him with her own fire until a flame began to leap upward within him a flame born from the everburning embers of his love for her it burned and twisted within him and he grew warmer and warmer with his own desire to possess her straddling her he sat back upon his heels his big hand reached out to cup and admire her breasts they overflowed his hands again and again as he attempted to contain their beauty her eyes had closed and as he gazed down upon her purpleshadowed eyelids he wondered if she was even aware of him zenobia he said and her eyes opened and she smiled up at him i am here drawing him down she brushed her lips over his and once more they kissed with steadily building passion now he allowed his hands the freedom they had so longed for the freedom to caress her marvelous body he stroked her back revealing in its long line the curve of her buttocks turning her over so that she lay face down he began a worshipful adoration of her body and kissed slowly and hungrily along the same path that his hand had taken not stopping at her buttocks however but continuing down her legs to her slender feet zenobia sighed luxuriously for odenathus had never made love to her like this marcus was a tender lover considerate and passionate preparing her carefully why she did not feel guilt she did not understand perhaps it was because she had not sought this wonder this delight and to find it now on this night of great tragedy was a miracle a gift from the gods she would not question further turning her onto her back again he pressed feathery kisses up her legs to the soft insides of her thighs but going no farther for that was a special pleasure to reserve for another time his tongue teased her navel and she wriggled with pleasure as once more he found her breasts this time he sucked her honeycolored nipples until they were tight crests of pure sensation now his large body covered her their mouths warred together again and she felt him pressing against her with a sigh she opened her legs to him murmuring against his mouth oh yes my darling yes tenderly and with infinite care he entered her zenobia quickly realized that his lance must be enormous and she winced slightly he stopped giving her body time to stretch for him once more he thrust and to her amazement she began to feel the magic beginning it was too soon she thought frantically but she could not stop it with a gasp she cried out opening her eyes to find his blue eyes blazing down on her he saw her gray orbs glaze over as the first wave of pleasure washed over her no she sobbed it is too soon but he soothed her it is just the beginning beloved i will give you more joy than you ever believed possible he kept his word bringing her pleasure several times before he finally took his own his powerful seed overflowing her womb they fell asleep clutching each other their strong beautiful bodies intertwined but afraid for her reputation he slept lightly waking fully before dawn looking down on her he was filled with tenderness he wanted to waken her and make love to her again but she slept very very deeply her body healing itself from the shock of last nights events so he rose quietly and dressed himself she would be all right when she awoke and he had best leave lest some gossip see him a faint noise caused him to turn to the door where to his surprise longinus stood shocked how could you take advantage of her he whispered furiously she trusted you marcus i did not take advantage longinus it happened the simplicity of the explanation convinced cassius longinus of its truth although he found that he was still distressed in his own way he loved zenobia too come with me he said coolly i will take you to my own quarters for it will be necessary for you to be here this morning i would never hurt her longinus cassius longinus turned to the roman a look of sadness in his brown eyes i know that he sighed how long is it that you have loved her marcus i understand but you must be cautious her position is so very precarious right now we will be careful longinus love her if you will marcus but be warned that palmyra must come first if zenobia was given the choice between you and this city today palmyra would come before you never force her to that decision the roman was somewhat taken aback surely you make mock of me longinus zenobia is a woman who needs to be loved she cannot live without it cassius longinus shook his head because she melted into your arms last night in a moment of weakness do not be fooled zenobia is not a weakwilled woman who can be content keeping her husbands house and wiping the runny noses and wet bottoms of her children she was born for greatness the signs were all there at her birth and she has only just begun to fulfill her promise part two the warrior queen you behave like a girl having her first child instead of a woman who has already birthed two sons old bab snapped to zenobia zenobia gritted her teeth as another pain rippled across her belly and back vaba and demi were easy births she groaned this child seems not to want to be born poor little mite bab murmured it will never know its father it is almost as if the gods had gifted you after all these yearsto give you this last child of king odenathus but nine months after his death she shook her head again poor little mite she repeated it truly is a miracle said julia leaning over her old friend and wiping the perspiration from her forehead at least the succession is well served said zenobia breathing easier as the pain receded three sons is even better than two julia laughed it could be a daughter this time zenobia no came the certain reply odenathus and i spawned only sonsstrong sons for our palmyran dynasty well julia said i for one am delighted to have a son and a daughter gaius was for antonius but flavia is for me she certainly is zenobia chuckled not only is she your image but even her mannerisms are yours a spasm crossed her face ah mother juno she cried out push my baby push bab commanded zenobia did as her old nurse commanded but even though she worked hard at birthing this child it would still be several hours before she gained her goal outside in the queens antechamber cassius longinus and marcus britainus waited the two men had become quite good friends over the last months indeed marcus did not know what he would have done without the wisdom and friendship of zenobias trusted councillor he might have gone mad without it for fate had dealt him one more blow the gods having given him a glimpse of paradise had then as quickly snatched it away the morning following odenathuss death he had waited for zenobia to summon him but instead he had been summoned to a council meeting to receive his instructions her behavior toward him was as it had always been polite and pleasant ah well he had thought she is the queen and will wait until after the nine days of sorrow and the funeral are over it is only right the kings body had been washed and prepared he had been dressed in a finely woven tunica palmata which was a purple and gold embroidered ceremonial tunic reaching to the ankle and worn with a beautifully spun light wool toga picta of tyrian purple embroidered in goldthread figures representing the gods upon his feet were gold sandals and a victory wreath of beaten gold laurel leaves adorned his dark head he was placed on his funeral couch in the atrium of the palace his feet toward the door to lie in state until the time came for his funeral about the couch were masses of flowers and incense burned in silver braziers at the head and the foot of the couch were gold lamps burning scented oil before the doors of the palace were set branches of pine and cypress a warning that it was contaminated by death when all was in readiness the doors of the palace were opened to the public in order that they might enter in and mourn their king the people came in a steady stream for a full day and night and another morning before odenathuss body was carried to his tomb outside the city walls for it was forbidden for a cemetery to be within the gates of a city the funeral procession from the palace was followed by every citizen in the city who could walk men women and children alike at the head of the procession was a band of musicians and singers who played and sang mournful dirges in praise of odenathus septimius and the greatness of his reign because odenathus had been a great military leader memorials to his victories especially those over the persians were carried in triumphal procession next came the body upon its funeral couch the face uncovered the couch was borne by the council of ten the family followed the body zenobia garbed in deepest black which strangely suited her golden skin and only made her look more beautiful alzena proudly erect although the grief was etched openly in her face the young king and his brother vulnerable but as their mother and grandmother proud and straight at the end of the citys main avenue the procession exited palmyra passing beneath the great triumphal arch through which odenathus had so often entered when returning from his many victories a halfmile beyond was the cemetery and it was here at odenathuss family tomb a great marble construction that the procession came to a halt all grew silent as the young king stood before them and eulogized his father the priest of jupiter reconsecrated the tomb and the marble sarcophagus into which odenathuss remains would be put he then sprinkled purified waters three times over all the mourners and they departed leaving only the immediate family at the tomb an animal was sacrificed to make the burial ground sacred and upon its burial couch odenathuss body was finally lowered into the sarcophagus they left zenobia with him for a minute before the tomb was closed zenobia looked down upon the face of the man who had been her husband and her friend for the last thirteen years although he yet seemed familiar the life spark that had made him the man he was was long gone there was a finality about the body shell which was all that remained of odenathus septimius reaching out she touched his face but it felt waxlike now no longer like living skin oh my hawk she said sadly it should not have ended like this that your life force has been snuffed out by two bitter and useless boys your own seed is not to be borne and yet i must bear it she paused a moment considering her words carefully for a promise to the dead must not be given lightly finally she spoke again i will try to raise our sons as you would want them raised and i will govern palmyra as you wouldwith justice and strength bending she placed a kiss upon his icy lips farewell my husband may charon guide you across the styx to that place where all the great end then turning she hurried from the tomb alzena withdrew within herself and even her faithful slave woman ala could not reach her she blamed her sons death on herself if only she wept to zenobia i had not sought to make mischief by using linos and vermis odenathus would be alive today i have caused the death of my own son and two of my grandsons the gods have indeed punished me for my wicked meddling not even zenobia could reason with her she mourned deeply stopped eating and within the month was dead too she was buried with suitable pomp in the same tomb as odenathus returning once again from the cemetery zenobia burst out the gods i am so sick of death and then she fainted her female weakness was put down to the great pressures she had been under within the next few weeks however the queen found her appetite not at all as it had always been she grew queasy at the mere sight of her favorite foods and developed longings for fruits out of season finally old bab said to her tartly is it not obvious to you what your trouble is the queen shook her head in the negative you are with child the old woman said the king has given you a final gift the second the words were out zenobia knew them to be true she was pregnant strange she pondered i cannot remember being with odenathus recently but then she pushed the thought from her mind shock could do strange things to a person and there was no other explanation she was with child she liked the idea another baby ah how pleased he would have been with her three sons for of course it would be a son she had always been a mother of sons the next week made her certain her moon link had been broken for close to three phases now and it was time to publicly announce her condition she told longinus first and briefly wondered at the strange look that fleetingly passed over his sensitive face given his sexual preferences he probably didnt like pregnant women she thought cassius longinus had his suspicions and so he cornered old bab one day i need information lady he said quietly what could i possibly tell the queens favorite councillor and private secretary cassius longinus you must not misunderstand lady i have only the queens best interests at heart but i must know when the queens last show of blood was bab looked scandalized what kind of question is that for you to ask she had grown plump with age and good living her three chins bobbed indignantly and her ample bosom heaved with righteous outrage beneath the rich fabric of her dark gown well cassius longinus lady i know that you love the queen have been with her since birth i also know that what i tell you will remain with you alone he moved next to the old woman and lowered his voice the queen was with marcus britainus the night of odenathuss murder i saw them yet never since that night has the queen acknowledged marcus britainus as more than an old friend his heart is breaking for he loves her truly now the queen says she is to have a child he had expected old bab to fly at him in a rage but instead she shook her head back and forth aiiiiieee she intoned softly i knew something was wrong i knew it then she looked frightened does anyone else know no he said no one else knows and certainly given the queens reputation for chastity they do not suspect he looked closely at the woman this is not odenathuss child is it lady no bab replied it cannot be and yet i hoped she took longinuss arm and slowly they began to walk through the queens garden when the king came home for the celebrations she was unclean her link with the moon was in force i am certain he did not go to her they were quite strict about that then he was murdered and yet when the signs became obvious i still hoped oh cassius longinus will anyone guess is she in danger does anyone else know her personal habits as you do lady no i alone serve her those silly butterflies she calls her maidens do naught but sing and giggle they have not one intelligent mind between them a ghost of a smile flitted over longinuss lips no one will suspect lady but i am yet unsatisfied as to why the queen has not acknowledged the roman my baby has never been devious bab said she has made no mention of him to me and if there were something to tell she would share it with me no cassius longinus she has said nothing because she remembers nothing she honestly believes this child to be odenathuss child longinus nodded it is possible he said yes it is quite possible she was in shock that night while everyone about her mourned zenobia was forced to take charge cassius longinus what would you advise in this situation what shall we do nothing he said if the queen remembers what happened the night of odenathuss murder then i believe she will come to terms with herself what of the roman bab demanded he moons about her like a lovesick puppy i will explain to him what has happened and will you tell him that the child is his no it is unlikely the child in its infancy will bear any great resemblance to him it is better he not know bab peered closely at longinus why she said longinus sighed if he learns the child is his it will only bind them closer would that not be good for palmyra she demanded again longinus sighed lady i do not know but i cannot take the chance of his turning her from her obligations marcus britainus is an oldfashioned roman women are the homemakers no more until he can be taught differently i cannot allow him to seriously influence the queen in any way i understand your reasoning cassius longinus but i am not sure you are right yet i will abide by your decision they parted then and longinus found himself encouraged to have an ally in the queens old nurse now he had but to convince marcus britainus that the queen remembered nothing with regard to their brief relationship he grimaced the gods had given him an awesome task indeed when it fell to him to convince a virile man that the woman he adored and had made love with did not remember the occasion he wondered if marcus britainus had a sense of humor if he had expected outrage he was surprised and relieved to find concern instead will she be all right cassius longinus other than the fact her memory of your liaison is gone she is in perfect health he replied will she ever remember i am not a physician marcus i do not honestly know there is one thing however that you should know the queen is to bear odenathus a posthumous child he watched to see the romans reaction would he guess i shall have to begin again with her and perhaps it is better marcus replied absently a posthumous child you say poor baby not to know his father and that was all cassius longinus almost cried aloud his relief was so great now six months later he and the roman paced back and forth in the queens antechamber waiting for the birth of the child during those intervening months marcus had taken the opportunity to court the queen and she was beginning to respond how many times had he seen them walking in the palace gardens how many meals bad she shared with him he ate the final meal of the day with zenobia and her sons almost every night the young king and his brother were succumbing to the romans charms marcus was the most prominent male figure in their lives he thought with just a trace of jealousy they admired him and respected his views which longinus was forced to admit were practical and sound he could not help but wonder what would happen once zenobia had delivered the child and been purified would the passion that had enveloped them on that one night consume them again from within the queens bedchamber came the sounds of groaning and the roman paled it will be soon he said how do you know longinus asked i am the eldest of four a shriek came from the queens chamber followed by a lusty wail within the room zenobia pushed a final time expelling the afterbirth and demanded is my son all right is he perfect julia cleaning the baby with warmed olive oil looked up a moment from her task and said your daughter is perfect dear friend she is an adorable little beauty daughter i have birthed a daughter surely you are mistaken julia look again i cannot have birthed a daughter but you have zenobia it is not the end of the world zenobia lay back physically exhausted but mentally alert as bab faithful bab removed all traces of the birth from her mistresss body i shall enjoy having a little girl to take care of again she chortled you have two fine sons my baby a daughter will be a comfort to you in your old age she helped to support zenobia as two of her maidens changed the linen on the queens couch zenobia was restless and demanded of julia give me the baby i want to look at it she could not yet bring herself to say her but a moment bab protested and she sponged her mistress with perfumed water before placing a fresh linen chamber robe on her and helping her back into bed the covers were lightly tucked around her and then bab stood sternly by as zenobia was given a nourishing beverage the queen drank it down grimacing why does everything that is good for me have to taste so awful she demanded handing bab the empty goblet now bring me the baby julia approached cradling a swaddled bundle that made soft little mewling noises there you are she said placing the infant in zenobias arms zenobia turned her eyes to the child it looked nothing like either vaba or demi the baby whimpered and looked up at her mother zenobia stared in shock she had blue eyes her daughter had blue eyes and the expression in them was strangely familiar she clutched the infant to her as her head began to whirl and in the midst of a roiling reddish darkness she heard a voice love you i have always loved you i have loved you from the beginnings of time andi shall love you long after our memories have faded from this earth her head cleared as quickly as it had grown dizzy just seconds before take it away she almost shrieked holding out the bundle take it away the baby began to wail either from fright at the sound of her voice or out of some sense of her mothers rejection julia quickly took the child and looked strangely at zenobia what is it my baby bab hurried to the queens side what is the matter i dont want her i dont want her i birth sons for my hawk not daughters this child is the lord odenathuss last and surely most precious gift to you my baby bab said sternly what do you mean you dont want her of course you do your travail was long and it has addled your wits leave me zenobia cried and take it with you bab nodded to julia and together they hurried from the room leaving the queen alone zenobia lay very still but her mind was almost boiling with confusion the voice she had heard had been that of marcus britainus the halfimages of memory began to grow whole as she concentrated with all her might endeavoring to discover the key that would unlock this mystery the key however eluded her and coupled with the hard birth she fell into an exhausted sleep when she awoke several hours later it was deepest night the lamps had been trimmed and lowered and now cast flickering shadows on the walls ceiling and floor the earlyspring night was yet cool and she drew her covers about her she had remembered she remembered all of that hot hot july night that odenathus had died she remembered how she had willingly given herself to marcus britainus and how he had made tender passionate marvelous love to her i love you he had said i have always loved you i have loved you from the beginnings of time and i shall love you long after our memories have faded from this earth the power in that commitment was in itself overwhelming the child of course was his there was no way it could have been odenathuss daughter did he know more important who else knew adria she called to the slave girl who lay sleeping on the floor at the foot of her bed adria awake the girl scrambled to her feet rubbing the sleep from her eyes yes majesty what is your wish fetch old bab zenobia commanded and then fetch cassius longinus hurry girl the slave girl ran from the room zenobia willed her mind blank for the next few minutes then the door to her bedchamber opened and old bab hurried in demanding are you all right my baby what is it i have sent for cassius longinus zenobia replied we will talk when he arrives be sure no one lingers about my door to hear us do you understand bab nodded the door opened again and cassius longinus entered looking slightly disheveled majesty adria i would speak privately i will not need you again this night go to the womens quarters and sleep i obey majesty the girl replied as she backed from the room bab held the door to the bedchamber open to be sure the girl departed the anteroom and did not linger to eavesdrop the guards at the entry to the apartment would let no one else enter she turned back to zenobia the queen looked from cassius longinus to bab the child is not odenathuss she said watching for their reaction nevertheless was longinuss quick reply no one is likely to suspect the childs paternity majesty the little princess is not apt ever to inherit the throne and so the dynasty remains unsullied you knew from the beginning both of you zenobia said i knew bab suspected although she hoped her suspicions would come to naught once we had talked we both understood the truth of the matter does he know no longinus said i thought it best he did not you thought it best her voice was chilly but he was not intimidated what happened was the result of your shock over the kings death and then your mind blocked out the incident i could not tell you the truth of the matter for fear of endangering your health or that of the child you are queen of palmyra it is what you were born for your destiny i do not know if he can readily accept that if you become lovers it was not your decision to make zenobia said furiously you could not make it he countered i but sought to protect you and the young king would you really give this all up simply to lie beneath your lover i do not think so majesty you may love him but first and foremost you are zenobia queen of palmyra can i not have both her eyes were fast filling with tears that depends on marcus britainus majesty you i know can both love and rule it is he who must love you despite the fact you are the queen i do not think it will be easy for him majesty he must know that mavia is his daughter zenobia said mavia they both exclaimed my daughter was the queens reply i have decided to call her mavia is it really necessary to tell him cassius longinus looked distressed oh longinus you fret too much zenobia said softly i cannot keep such a thing from him and besides she looks like him her hair is reddish and her eyes quite blue all babies have blue eyes longinus said hopefully not this color blue mavias eyes are the same blue as her fathers even to the same expression he cannot publicly acknowledge her even now there are yet those who would discredit you and remove you from the regency i am sure that marcus will be as anxious as we all are to protect mavia longinus she turned to old bab is marcus britainus within the palace tonight aye my baby he is even now sleeping in his apartments fetch him secretly bab when he is safely here you must bring my daughter to me i will go the old woman said and hurried out what do you plan longinus asked he must acknowledge her as his child before you and bab if anything should ever happen to me then marcus britainus must see to his daughter in my stead surely you approve longinus nodded you are wise majesty longinus you are my best friend what should i do without you you will never have reason to wonder majesty he said fervently i will ever serve you the chamber door opened to admit marcus britainus it was obvious that he had come quickly for he wore only a short tunica interior his eyes sought hers and she said quietly leave us longinus wait outside with bab i shall call you when i want you longinus left without even a backward glance and hearing the door close behind him marcus slowly approached the bed where zenobia lay propped up by several pillows his eyes never left her face and his heart leapt with hope when he heard her say in a soft voice i remember marcus i remember all he didnt know what to say and so she patted the bed encouraging him to sit by her i remember she repeated and i regret nothing then my prayers are answered beloved he said the child is yours what his face was a dual mask of shocked surprise and incredulous delight how she bit her lip in amusement dont you know she teased him lightly i mean how can you be sure i had not been with odenathus in many months my darling mavia for that is what i have chosen to call our daughter was conceived on the night of odenathuss death you cannot of course publicly claim her marcus my enemies would use such knowledge to destroy my dynasty and i cannot nay i will not allow that to happen will you however in the presence of my faithful bab and my good longinus accept her as a true roman father would he heard both the queen and the woman in the request a daughter he was the father of a daughter i will acknowledge her beloved he said thank you marcus she answered him i know it will not be easy for you for everyone will believe her to be odenathuss child may i see her only if you will kiss me marcus britainus you see i am really a terrible woman for i will exact a penalty from you for what should be your right a slow smile lit his features crinkling the corners of his deep blue eyes a large hand cupped her head while the fingers of his other hand tenderly reexplored her face she sat very still as he moved over her eyelids down the bridge of her nose across her high cheekbones and gently touched her petalsoft lips as he did she kissed his fingertips then his head descended to cover her mouth with his own the sweetness that flowed between them brought tears to her eyes feeling the wetness on her cheeks he raised his head and gazed deeply into her eyes beloved why do you weep oh marcus havent you ever known a woman to weep from pure joy i am so happy do you love me zenobia yes she said simply and without hesitation i love you let me see our daughter he said and she called to old bab and to longinus who reentered the room in her arms bab carried the sleeping infant whom she laid at marcuss feet immediately he took the baby up into his arms and by that simple act acknowledged mavia as his own whatever happened now the baby girl was admitted to all the rights and privileges of membership in a roman family no one however should ever know this for mavia would be believed odenathuss posthumous daughter and princess of palmyra marcus britainus looked down at his child and his face softened she is beautiful he said softly so as not to awaken her he almost trembled so great was his emotion this tiny bit of humanity was his daughter created by the gods as proof of his love for zenobia he looked up from the child and at its mother marry me he said quietly your period of mourning is almost over we love each other i cannot she said quietly i am queen of palmyra and if we married then we should endanger vabas monarchy if i remained regent there would be those who would claim that youromeinfluenced me against palmyran interests more likely however would be my removal by the council of ten from the regency i cannot trust anyone else to guide the citys destiny for my son and when vaba is a man zenobia will you then release the reins of power to him and live for yourself do not quarrel with me my love she said avoiding his question are you not my husband in all but the formal sense you love me i love you and we have a child he looked at her and she could see the pain the hurt the anger the resentment and the resignation all swirling about in his eyes so i am to be known as the queens lover instead of the queens husband he said softly it matters not she answered him as softly if i am your legal wife for even if i were you should still be my lover marcus is it so terrible a thing longinus had been right marcus thought bitterly the woman he loved put her duty above all he could not have her to wife nor could he have his own child still he loved zenobia and if having her meant swallowing his own male pride then swallow it he would when he thought on it he realized that her attitude to duty was actually no different from his own am i your lover he asked you will be she said with certainty looking directly at him he felt a chill of desire sweep over him when he demanded the smile returning to his eyes and once more crinkling the corners you must give me time to recover from mavias birth my darling as if recognizing her name the infant opened her eyes and looked up at the great man who held her making small noises she instantly attracted his attention and looking down again on his daughter marcus was enchanted gently he touched her pink cheek and mavia turned her head her small bud of a mouth opening give her to me zenobia said she is already hungry longinus go back to bed we will speak in the morning bab do you mind waiting in the antechamber until mavia is ready to return to her cradle reaching out for her daughter zenobia put her to her plump breast not even seeing longinus and bab leaving at first the baby was not certain of what to do but the queen all mother now carefully forced her nipple into the babys mouth and pressed gently to expel some of the clear fluid already flowing from her breasts the second the baby tasted the nourishment instinct took over and she began to suck tentatively at first more vigorously as she met with continued success and became surer marcus watched fascinated he was enchanted by the sweetly maternal picture zenobia presented and yet at the same time he felt a strong tug of hot desire watching the child as she nursed in the months since the infants conception he had found himself unable to enjoy the beautiful and skilled whores for which palmyra was famous and finally had stopped trying now celibate for many months he watched as his daughter suckled on his beloveds plump golden breasts and he found himself consumed by a lust that had become highly visible beneath his short interior tunic transferring the baby from one breast to the other zenobia saw his state oh my darling she sympathized i will send a slave girl to your bed no he almost shouted through gritted teeth and the baby started giving a little hiccough before settling back down again to nurse i cannot i mean i dont want anyone else but you are you telling me that there has been no one since that night no one he said oh marcus the baby cradled in one arm she reached out the other to take his hand in hers and they stayed thus bound together until mavia sated at last fell asleep against her mothers breast if i were just a woman zenobia said quietly i should be so proud to be your wife i could not say that while longinus was in the room for he would fret so you know what he is like my darling we could wed in secret he suggested marcus there will come a day when i will marry you if you still want me when that day comes it will be done with much pomp and public show and you will escort me through the streets of palmyra to your house as befits an honest man i will be your wife for all the world to see and i shall not be ashamed until that time we will be lovers and i shall not be ashamed of that either for now my duty is to the memory of odenathus septimius his sonmy sonvaballathus boy king of this city and to palmyra itself i will not shirk my duties marcus it is not my way in an isolated part of the palace she set aside a private apartment where no one but old bab and himself were permitted to enter although he rarely saw the queens old nurse it was one large square bright and airy room that she transformed into a retreat of sensuality where they might play with each other and be safe from prying eyes the floor of the room was made of great blocks of palegold marble carefully fitted so that they appeared to be one piece near the entrance was a sunken black marble bathing pool filled with tepid scented water sprayed by the distended male organs of four mischievous gold cupids to the left was a large beautifully carved standing cabinet for storage and beyond that a round tablein fact the very one of african cedar that zenobia had bought from marcus many years beforewith two rounded backed chairs with carved arms and legs bright peacockblue silk cushions had been placed on each chair in the far left corner of the room was a large square sleeping platform that sat upon a dais set up two steps an enormous striped mattress made of coral and gold silk and filled with the finest purest white lambswool was placed upon the sleeping platform the dais and the platform had been overlaid with several layers of gold leaf upon the mattress were spread peacockand emeraldcolored silk pillows on the wall opposite the sleeping platform were seven marble pillars goldcolored veined in red and between them hung sheer silk curtains of palest gold shot through with gold thread which blew gently in the soft evening breezes on the coldest days the silk would be replaced by heavy woolen draperies of an earthy gold color the walls had been painted with colorful frescoes of the gods and goddesses as they played at love diana chaste goddess of the hunt and the moon was held in captive embrace by the sun god apollo who boldly fondled her unclad breasts while about them dianas equally chaste handmaidens were hunted by a band of rapacious satyrs a very voluptuous venus goddess of love reclined upon a couch her pink white gold and blueeyed beauty totally nude for all to see while two very handsome and extremely wellendowed young mortal males sought to please juno queen of those fortunates who resided upon mount olympus lay upon her back legs spread wide her face a mask of ecstasy while the blacksmith god vulcan labored mightily jupiter king of olympus was shown in both his guises as the swan seducing the beauteous leda wife to tyndareus the king of sparta and as the chestnutcolored bull who abducted and seduced the virgin europa daughter of agenor the phoenician king of tyre both ladies seemed quite pleased with the gods attentions however among the gods and goddesses nymphs and centaurs sported in various and some quite interesting attitudes of play carefully studying them during his first visit to the apartment marcus noted somewhat wryly i am not sure such a thing is possible when one has a body that is halfhuman halfequine he reclined in a chair along one of the walls the ladies seem content zenobia noted from the black marble pool where she was swimming in the crystal waters of the pool her own very voluptuous form was quite visible still i wonder he mused and then he turned to face her come to me beloved it has been more than three hundred nights since you have lain in my arms the gods know that i have always been a patient man but now i am no longer patient her gray eyes darkened with the remembered passion of that one night that they had had and a soft smile curved her lips for a moment then she swam over to the steps of the pool and stood up she slowly ascended the stairs as he watched with intense desire her lush golden body the water droplets glittering like diamonds as they ran down her lazily she dried herself off picked up an alabaster flask and walked across the room to him handing him the flask she purred will you rub me with this cream marcus and without waiting for him to answer continued on to the sleeping platform where she lay down upon her stomach standing he whipped the wrap of cloth from his loins and naked joined her the night was warm with early summer as he straddled her using her bottom as a seat and poured the fragrant pale mauvecolored cream into one big palm carefully he set the flask upon one of the platform steps and rubbing his hands together to spread the cream he began to massage her ummmmmm she murmured huskily as his large hands swept up the long length of her back and over her shoulders he continued this way for some minutes until all the cream had disappeared into her skin and then reversing his position he crouched over her facing her feet taking more of the mauve cream he began to massage her buttocks with expert fingers ohhhh zenobia gave a little shriek of pleasure and he smiled to himself she had thought to play this teasing game with him but when he had finished with her it would be she whose fires would rage uncontrolled finished with her buttocks he began to rub each leg in its turn and then her arms with the scented cream as he did so he was not averse to pressing teasing little kisses upon the back of her neck having first pushed aside her long black hair which had come free of its jeweled pins it gave him great satisfaction to note that her delicious body was unable to remain still marcus her voice was somewhat strained yes beloved his voice was smooth devoid of any emotion i think you can stop now he certainly could stop she thought frantically her skin was absolutely tingling in fact she was tingling all over now his voice had turned innocent and he slipped his hands beneath her to grasp her marvelous breasts teasingly he pinched the nipples very much enjoying her gasp of surprise covering her body with his own his weight crushed her into the mattress as he murmured into her ear my beloved goddess did you think to tease me to madness you have succeeded and he gently bit at the back of her neck she shuddered as the flames of desire began to lick at her in earnest marcus he heard the plea and lifted himself off her to turn her over onto her back her beautiful breasts rose and fell in quick rhythm his dark chestnut head lowered to capture a pert nipple which he then caressed with his tongue circling round and round it until she moaned a low keening sound that was halfpleasure halffrustration lifting his head he moved over to her other nipple while his hand kneaded the breast he had just left her breasts had been extremely sensitive since she had stopped nursing mavia and given that chore to a wetnurse he was going to drive her mad zenobia thought reaching down she grasped his thick hair and pulled him from her breast kiss me she demanded furiously and he laughed softly for a moment before his lips took fierce possession of hers his tongue filled her mouth skillfully doing battle with hers which would not be subdued but fought him with equal cunning bringing quick liquid fire into his hot loins mischievously she bit him and he swore softly while she laughed and moving provocatively murmured now my darling now no he told her by the gods she might be queen of palmyra but while she lay in his arms he would be the master not yet beloved you are too eager yes now she thrust her pelvis upward against him no there are pleasures yet to be savored my beauty and before she could stop him he shifted his body downward to push his head between her thighs his fingers pushed the yielding flesh apart and his mouth found the bud of her womanhood zenobia struggled frantically for breath her husband had never done what marcus now did to her such delights he was unleashing within her body they came quickly one after another in explosions of incredible rapture that left her close to swooning it was only when he heard the tone of her voice become distraught that he stopped and covered her body again with his own murmuring soft love words plunging deep into her burning flesh to soothe and comfort her her arms went about him and she held him tightly against herself her breasts flattening against the soft fur of his chest together they found the perfect rhythm and ascended an olympus of their own rising higher and higher until finally they gained a paradise far above that of mere gods together they clung to each other in that incredible world of instant immortality before descending again to the world of man neither remembered the return awakening much later wrapped within the others arms zenobia suddenly clearheaded could hear the strong beat of his heart through his ribs are you awake she whispered softly no he answered i cant possibly be for if i am then i am in paradise i love you she answered him no he said i love you pushing herself up onto one elbow she gazed down into his strongly chiseled face that first night she said i remember thinking that you were the one i had waited for all my life and i did not understand it how could i love my hawk and yet so quickly love you i still am not sure i understand did not your father arrange the marriage yes then you were expected to marry odenathus and there was an end to it as far as your family was concerned tell me if i am wrong he was the first man ever to come into your life other than your father and your brothers he was the first man to make love to you he was intelligent and sensitive and gentle he adored you above all women even to putting aside his concubine for you is all of this not so yes then how could a woman of sensitivity fail to respond to him did you know what love was beloved do you know now my love for my hawk was a childs love she said slowly very much the same as i feel for my father and my brothers he awakened my body it is true but never did i feel for him what i feel for you yet that too is confusing i remember that all my life until she died my mother always told me of how when she and my father met they fell instantly in love and knew without reason that they were meant to be together she did not hesitate to marry him even though his life as a bedawi chief was a great deal different from hers as a wealthy alexandrian gently she brushed a tousled lock of his chestnut hair back from his forehead catching her hand in his he kissed it and then pressed it to his heart when we met it was hardly love at first sight she continued oh yes marcus i remember it well although i have not until now spoken of it we met on the desert road at dawn and i was insufferably rude to you but oh my darling the pain of my mothers death still lived close to me tears sprang to her eyes as she remembered that terrible morning so long ago when her beautiful mother was savaged raped and murdered by roman mercenaries dont beloved he urged her sitting up and gathering her into his embrace i have never really spoken of it to anyone since that day marcus i told my father what had happened and after that i tried to put it from my mind but i have never forgotten they used her body then they slit her throat perhaps they did her a kindness for i do not think she could have lived with her shame blueeyed romans they were blueeyed romans when i met you the hate still boiled in my heart hate beloved is the opposite of love from the very first moment i saw you i was lost he chuckled you were such a little spitfire that i wanted to drag you from your horse and kiss that angry little mouth until it grew pliant and loving i knew however that you were shortly to be married to the prince of the city i wanted you then and having possessed you now i still want you her beautiful gray eyes filled with their tiny golden lights looked deeply into his sapphireblue ones you have loved me all these years marcus and i never knew it i have loved you but never did i dare face that love yet the night of odenathuss death you came willingly to me beloved it was as if your soul understood what your mind never dared to comprehend i ought to be ashamed she said quietly and yet i am not my husband lay dead and i gave myself to another man you were in shock beloved without the least thought or care for yourself you took immediate charge of the situation and thus saved palmyra from a civil war i did not even remember all those months while i carried mavia i believed her to be odenathuss child and when i first saw her and remembered i rejected her no zenobia you didnt reject our child at your first sight of her you were frightened and confused as your memory had begun to return what you were rejecting was the possibility of having behaved in a manner contrary to what you had always done she moved so that he held her but lightly and she might gaze into his face i love you marcus alexander britainus and for some reason i cannot fathom i am loved by you in return stay by my side my darling be my rock my fortress and refuge in this world be my love and never leave me i will never leave you zenobia he promised you are my wife my beloved one and as long as you want me i shall stay by your side then you must remain with me for eternity marcus eternity and beyond you do not set me a very harsh task beloved he said and bending his head he brushed her lips with his own her arms wound about him and she murmured against his marvelous mouth then i shall have to think of something my darling and do not fear i shall you will not be easy to live with he teased her will you no she said and then a smile lit her features but then i suspect neither will you my darling the soldier emperor gallienus considered the letter he had received from antonius porcius blandus hot upon the heels of the news of odenathuss murder he had thought about sending a military governor out to the east but old antonius porcius a loyal fellow as he remembered assured him that the young queen zenobia had all in hand and had already appointed a former praetorian prefect one marcus alexander britainus to be commander of the eastern legions the alexander family were well known here in rome and this was the eldest son there were those who thought it amusing that the alexanders kept to the old ways of loyalty honest industry and piety toward the gods but gallienus thanked jupiter himself for such rare servants the eastern frontier would be safe with marcus alexander and in a rare burst of goodwill even the senate confirmed his appointment feeling confident gallienus went off to subdue the goths who were once more overrunning roman territory unfortunately his departure encouraged his general aureolus who commanded the cavalry in milan to rebellion gallienus hurried to lay siege to milan once there he was murdered by a group of his dissatisfied generals who then put forth one of their own as the new emperor claudius ii quickly subdued aureolus put him to death and then went on to conduct a successful campaign against the german tribes the eastern empire was forgotten it was some weeks after gallienuss murder that word of it reached zenobia in palmyra it was obvious that claudius would pay no attention to their part of the world and looking at longinus zenobia said odenathus told me that the right moment would come someday the time is now just what is it you want majesty palmyras freedom from rome she laughed and he could hear a triumphant note in the sound once longinus freedom for palmyra was all i wanted but i was young and i lacked experience it is not enough that palmyra be free we need much territory about us to keep our near perimeters safe i want all of romes eastern empire for palmyra for my son and i shall have it she had said it and it was as he had suspected you must move very carefully majesty he said slowly in the beginning all must be done in the name of the roman empire after all you will be using the legion they left here in palmyra a legion of mercenaries longinus legionnaires from numidia mauretania and cyrene they can be bought it will take more than money majesty i know longinus it will take victories for these mercenaries love the taste of victory as well as the sound of gold first i must win their confidence and then i will buy them first with the victories so dear to their hearts and then with the gold they desire you are correct it will be done first for rome and only when i have romes legion in the palm of my hand will it be done for palmyra and marcus britainus majesty will he desert rome for palmyra i dont know she said honestly and will you give up your own happiness majesty for palmyra why should i have to longinus while romes legion and my own army fight together for rome there is no conflict rome is not competent to rule in the east for she is too far away to administer the governments properly marcus will be on our side after all it is not as if he were involved in the government of rome like me he springs from two peoplesfrom britain and from rome he has spent the last fifteen years here in palmyra and become more palmyran each day longinus shook his head where marcus britainus was concerned zenobia was blind in both eyes as always longinus you worry too much zenobia teased him this is not the time to make a decision and perhaps there never will come such a time for marcus we are friends as well as lovers when vaba is eighteen i will marry marcus and let my son rule alone i want children for marcus again longinus shook his head she was a brilliant ruler but where her lover was concerned she simply did not understand love was indeed blind in the case of palmyras queen stop frowning longinus you are beginning to resemble a thundercloud i think ahead majesty and you obviously do not like the conclusions you have reached she replied do not fear longinus everything is going to be all right tomorrow i begin to ready the army for syria will you go with them this time majesty yes she answered this time i will go with them you old friend will remain behind in palmyra to guide the king in my absence this will not be a long campaign but the syrians must be brought firmly under my control the syrians are used to being conquered longinus said drily they will give you no trouble majesty it was doubtful that zenobia even heard him for she was lost in thought at her map table her fingers wandered restlessly across the parchment touching the main cities of syria damascus antioch emesa beirut and above syria lay all of asia minor there was cilicia cappadocia bithynia and pontus galatia lycia and pamphylia lydia and paphilagonia mysia phrygia and commagene her fingers moved downward brushing across palestine arabia and finally into egypt a small smile played about the corners of her mouth yes egypt should be the outer boundary of her palmyran empire and the far west of asia minor her other boundary she gazed out the window toward the east she would need eastern boundaries perhaps armenia and parthia but right now her chief enemies lay to the west rome in persia king shapur was old and beaten holding his hollow court and speaking of past victories victories before odenathus victories before zenobia she could feel the power filling her soul and she knew that she would be victorious in her endeavors she did not understand how she knew it but she knew marcus of course was not happy at the prospect of her going on campaign you have made me commander of the legions he said do you not trust me to lead them well i am not questioning your competence my darling but i am the queen this time i must go with the armies when odenathus was alive it was not necessary for he as their king led them and i remained here in palmyra to rule in his name now however i am the power in palmyra and i must go with the legions vaba is still too young and he is important to our people until he is married and has a son we cannot take the chance of losing him therefore i must go with palmyras troops she moved provocatively into his arms and lightly kissed his lips will it really be so terrible to have me with you on this campaign my darling it is indeed a burden for me beloved he said honestly i cannot lead my armies if i am worried every minute that you may be in danger there are hardships on a military campaign you cannot possibly know zenobia we simply cannot carry along all the fripperies and slave girls necessary to a womans comfort cassius longinus sat back in his chair a wicked smile lighting up his aesthetic face this was going to be quite enjoyable zenobia sighed a long patient sigh walking across the room she stopped before a cabinet reached in and withdrew two broadswords turning about she tossed one to the very startled marcus prepare to defend yourself roman she said loosening her long stola and stepping out of it beneath it she wore only a thin white linen camise longinus muffled a deep chuckle reaching for his goblet he quaffed down the sweet red wine and then his brown eyes darting between the queen and marcus he watched to see what would happen zenobia have you gone mad no marcus i have not i was born and bred to be a warrior it is true that i have yet to taste battle but i am capable as any of my guard could tell you had you ever bothered to ask you however doubt my capability since you do i must obviously prove myself to you i am now prepared to do so so you had best defend yourself my darling lest i slice off an ear she punctuated her speech by whirling her sword in everwidening circles over her head marcus britainus was momentarily surprised but realizing that she was serious quickly stripped off his toga and his long tunic keeping only his short tunica interior to cover him he was somewhat annoyed by her actions she was a woman why could she not behave like one and remain home in palmyra while he took her armies out and subdued the eastern empire too late he realized that it was he who had brought about this confrontation if he had simply agreed to her accompanying them and let it go at thatbut no he had to behave like a great masculine brute he knew her competence he could not allow her a false victory for she would know wondering how good she really was with the broadsword he leapt forward his blade on the attack with a grin zenobia moved backward but a step and then rather than taking an attitude of defense which was what he had expected she rushed forward her sword cutting through the air with a loud whooshing noise and it was he who was forced to retreat he parried blow after blow and quickly discovered that she was not only adept with her sword but tireless with a leap he got behind her but she was equally quick and instantly turned to defend herself metal clanged as weapon met weapon and they were both soon dripping wet with their exertions longinus sat watching totally fascinated by the spectacle before him it did not even cross his mind that they might unwittingly hurt each other zenobias concentration was grim as she parried his blow staggering somewhat for he had put his entire weight behind it still she would not give him the victory for she was angry how could he love her the way he did and yet be so unaware of the warrior she was it infuriated her he was surprised at her skill and her stamina she was one of the finest swordsmen he had ever encountered but the battle was getting them nowhere eventually one of them was going to draw blood and that thought frightened him he could not bear to hurt her zenobia give over my darling i was wrong and i freely admit to it what she lowered her blade and looked at him her wonderful breasts were rising and falling with her exertion i was wrong he repeated you are a warrior a great warrior but i am terrified that i might hurt you please let us stop this battle if necessary i will concede you the victory you will concede me the victory her voice was filled with righteous indignation i win my victories he saw it coming and heedless of the danger he leapt swiftly forward and wrenched the broadsword from her hand no he shouted no you little savage i wont allow you to hurt either yourself or me and he flung both weapons across the room furiously she launched herself at him nails extended to rake his face but he caught her wrists and squeezed until he saw the pain leap into her eyes but she would not cry out instead her gray eyes darkened until they were almost black in her anger he was just as angry yanking her into his arms his mouth fiercely savaged hers stoking the fires of her body until the nipples of her breasts were as hard and as sharp as her swordpoint had been the desperate need to retaliate was deep within her and furiously she bit his lips bitch he murmured against her mouth and then his kisses grew soft and filled with such intense passion that she could feel the anger flowing from both their bodies as another sweeter need rose and took its place the arms that had been locked tightly about her loosened and she slipped her own arms up and around his neck molding her lush soft curves to his hard body how long they remained standing there kissing she never knew but suddenly he was drawing her camise off his big hands caressing her back cupping her buttocks drawing her tightly against him letting her feel his deep and hungry need longinus she managed to whisper wanting very much to satisfy his need and the equally deep need within her longinus is gone was the answer and quickly looking about the room she saw that marcus spoke the truth not here not now she whispered again somewhat shy that they might be discovered here and now he answered drawing her down onto a couch please marcus she pleaded i very much please he answered her and then she felt his hands beneath her bottom lifting her slightly felt the hot tip of his shaft rubbing against her womanhood felt herself encouraging him onward and knew that she was lost there was no subtlety for the need between them was too great again again and yet again he drove himself into her and it was he thought like plunging into boiling honey the sweetness flowed from her until he thought it could come no more but yet again it flowed and in the end it was she who weakened him and filled him with such delight that he cried out her hands reached down and raised his face from her shoulder she loved gazing into his eyes when they lay locked in passion kissing him with gentle little kisses she said once more the words he never tired of hearing from her lips i love you marcus i love you never leave me never his sapphireblue eyes bore into her and told her all that his lips could not say at this tender and yet fiery moment the deep and desperate loving began again and she felt him growing and filling her with such pleasure that she believed for a long moment that death was but an instant away nothing she reasoned could be quite that wonderful but he certainly was again and yet once more he led her down passions path until the rapture burst over her in a shower of tiny golden lights then she tumbled into a velvet abyss of warm loving darkness that enfolded her rocked her protected her when she came to herself once more he was looking at her with a bemused expression did all of this come about simply because i questioned your prowess with a broadsword he asked weakened by his loving she could only manage a soft chuckle unable to resist he bent and tenderly covered her face with kisses i adore you my queen he said quietly i adore you beloved then i have won this victory myself marcus and her voice held a teasingly triumphant note he laughed then he couldnt help it for she had so very neatly outmaneuvered him you have won the victory fairly beloved he admitted there came a discreet knocking at the library door and marcus rose from the couch snatching up his long tunic sliding it over his big frame reaffixing his toga he looked to zenobia who had as quickly redressed in her graceful long white stola with its wide belt of gold squares studded with turquoiseblue chunks of persian lapis she nodded and he said enter cassius longinus returned to the room saying i assume you have reconciled your differences now my children it seemed to me when i was forced to hurriedly depart that you were well on your way to doing so they both laughed and zenobia replied we have indeed reconciled our differences longinus and i have easily won the victory indeed the queen is invincible the smiling marcus agreed and it seemed as if his words were prophetic of the months to come palmyras legions moved across syria subduing all rebellion in the name of the roman empire asia minor was firmly cowed and only then did zenobia return to her oasis city there she found that in her absence her son the boy king had grown into a young man he was fully as tall as she was and so closely resembled his father odenathus that it almost hurt her to look at him is it that i have been away so long she marveled or have you really become a man i have become a man he answered her gone was the squeaky voice of change that had bid her farewell now his voice was deep and sure he has your knack for government longinus said quietly he has begun to rule and rule well only under your guidance and that of marius gracchus the sixteenyearold king replied graciously strange zenobia mused i had thought that you would prefer the military like your father i have not yet had the chance mother you and marcus have led the armies these many months you were too young to go she protested but i am no longer too young i will take the armies into egypt when they go this winter palmyras kings have always been good generals no she said quietly what do you love war so mother i can see now that only your body has grown vaba your mind is yet that of a child i am the king and i will lead the armies i am the queen and you are not yet of age until you are my word is supreme in palmyra there is danger all about you i will do everything in my power to protect you until you have a son of your own i will choose my wife he said and she knew in that instant that he already had she invoked the gods that the girl be suitable who is she my son you will approve mother it is flavia the daughter of your friends antonius porcius and his wife julia flavia porcius she is but a child vaba she is almost thirteen mother she has already begun her womans flow i dont want to know how you know that zenobia said shocked and behind her both longinus and marcus smiled the young king might look like his father but he was his mothers son in that he was determined to have his way nonetheless she is my choice for a wife and i will wager even you could not choose a more suitable girl she is palmyranborn of reputable family and ready to bear children more important to me however is the fact that she loves me and i love her then why do you want to rush off into battle i must prove myself worthy to rule palmyra to myself to my people and to flavia until i do i am only your son and that is simply not enough for me i must be a man in my own right zenobia turned away so he might not see her tears vaba was indeed becoming a man gently he put his arm about his mother you have given me the greatest gift any woman could give her child you gave me time to grow time to learn time to play but now the time has come for me to earn my place all your life you have been so good so loyal so generous do you not want a life of your own do you not want to marry marcus you are yet young enough to have children and i believe that like any man he wants a son she blushed at his words he her firstborn her baby was chiding her but when she turned to give him a sharp reply she saw how earnest he was and instead she said you are right you shall lead our armies into egypt this winter while i remain behind to rule this city in your stead it was going to be devastating she thought both vaba and marcus two of the three males she loved best in this world away from her this winter for of course marcus was still commander of the legions and would go to guide vaba in military matters then suddenly she thought that it was not so terrible after all egypt would be easily subdued and vaba would have his first taste of battle he would return to marry flavia porcius then she zenobia would be free to marry marcus britainus together they would guide the young king and his wife in their rule of the eastern empire zenobia smiled when vabas first child was born she would declare her son augustus supreme ruler of the eastern empire with all the lands from egypt to asia minor under their rule who would dare to dispute them certainly not rome weakening rome with its succession of soldieremperors and its northem and western borders constantly challenged by barbarian tribesmen later she sighed within the comfort of marcuss arms soon we shall be able to marry make this egyptian campaign a quick one my darling do i not always do my best to oblige you beloved he teased her his hot mouth finding a ready nipple slowly he sucked on her sweet flesh taunting her with his tongue while his fingers moved to torture her in yet another sensitive spot they loved almost without ceasing in that short period between military campaigns zenobia allowed her son and the council of ten almost complete freedom while she and marcus locked themselves within the love chamber she had created for them they could not be sated in their consuming desire for each other less than a month before palmyras legions were due to depart a trusted household slave of the alexander family arrived from rome bearing tidings from marcuss mother the slave had been admitted into the queens private apartment and stood staring in amazement at the colorful rather explicit frescoes that adorned the walls watching him zenobia thought that the alexander household in rome was sure to get quite a report is every all right she asked marcus no he paused in his reading my fattier is ill beloved he is seriously ill possibly dying my mother has sent to britain for my younger brother aulus to come home he turned to the slave how long ago did you leave rome leo this is the fiftieth day marcus britainus since my departure its thirtythree days to britain my brother is halfway to rome already zenobia i will lead the legions marcus you must answer your mothers plea if the worst is to happen i could not live with myself knowing that i had kept you from your father in the hour of his death go back to rome and then come home to palmyra and to me you will be able to manage she smiled at him a slightly wry smile i can manage my darling although i am not sure i should admit to that nor would i but i dont want you to worry perhaps it is better that i take my son the king and teach him the art of war do not fear for us marcus longinus shall remain here with demetrius the succession is safe go to rome leo and i will start at dawn for tripoli there will be a ship sailing for brindisi do not take just any vessel marcus she pleaded with him his blue eyes drove into her very soul i am coming back to you i promise beloved i cannot survive without you marcus he laughed gently zenobia queen of palmyra i do not believe that for a moment he wrapped his arms about her and felt her trembling against him small tears mattered her black eyelashes tears she fought to hold back tenderly he tasted of her mouth kissing at the corners of it nibbling at her upper lip affectionately oh queen of my heart do not make my going any harder how i wish that vaba ruled in his own right and that you were naught but my wife and might go with me he sighed and then said quietly i will take leo to my house severus must be informed so that he may assume the responsibilities that are mine while i am gone you will return to me tonight she brushed a tear that had dared to slip down her cheek yes when he was gone taking the slave leo with him she sat squarely in the middle of the sleeping platform legs crossed very much like the child she had once been it would be the first time that they had been separated thank the gods for the winter campaign against egypt she needed it to keep herself occupied rome was so far away across a vast sea that she hadnt ever seen there was a finality about marcuss trip that frightened her and set her imagination to playing tricks on her would he return to her if his father died he would then be the head of his family and it was not a responsibility he could pass on to his younger brother aulus after all had a life in britain and lands that needed his management there by the time marcus returned to the palace that evening zenobia was a bundle of nerves he had never seen her that way for that matter in her entire life she had never behaved that way she picked at her food but so did he even though she had ordered that his favorite dishes be prepared i dont like leaving you beloved he said i wish you could come with me i am beginning to see disadvantages in loving a queen then i shall come with you oh marcus yes i will come with you i know it will shock your family but i do not care if i may be with you no it is impossible zenobia you cannot come if you come then you must send vaba into egypt alone without your tactical skill he is sure to lose if your father dies you will not be able to return to palmyra she said admitting to what really concerned her i will return to palmyra beloved i promise you that and never have i broken a promise to you if you are head of your family how can you leave them i can leave them to return to palmyra to fetch my wife for you are my wife beloved zenobia marry me before i go be my wife legally before the gods we would have to wed secretly marcus and that i will not do as long as i am the reigning queen you know it we have spoken it before as always you put palmyra before all else he said his voice a trifle bitter and you she accused him are you not putting your family before our love you see your duty and you do it why then is it so different when i do the same suddenly she stood up from the table with its barely touched meal i will not quarrel with you my darling not tonight this is the last night we will have for so many months come she held out her hand to him let us bathe and then let us spend the hours we have left in making love to each other i dont want to leave you he said low youknow it beloved i know it marcus but we are two people who have been trained to duty and loyalty return to rome and receive your fathers final blessing i will be waiting when you come home to palmyra together they walked across the room to remove their garments by the side of the pool he stood watching as she descended the steps down into the tepid water and felt himself grow warm with longing at the sight of her golden body moving languorously in the black marble pool her dark hair streamed out behind her a feathery cloak turning she swam back toward him her gray eyes devouring his tall body his long legs were to her like the marble columns that lined the portico of the ancient temple of baal and she shivered in anticipation of feeling his hard thighs already his shaft was straight and firm thrusting from the dark forest of his groin their eyes locked and he moved down into the pool walking slowly toward her zenobia felt herself growing weak with desire as she floated her limbs losing their will his hands closed gently about her ankles and he drew her forward his sure grasp moving up her legs she ached for him a yearning clearly visible in her beautiful face as he tenderly entered into her body filling her with the fiery fullness she loved he stood in the waistdeep water his throbbing lance buried deep within her as she floated before him her legs wrapped lighdy about his body her marvelous hair billowing in the soft swell of the waters the fingers of both his hands began to rub the nipples of her breasts with delicate little touches she shivered and while he smiled a slow smile her eyes closed in rapture and small waves of pleasure began to lap over her her entire being was finely tuned to the pleasure of their lovemaking and she almost screamed aloud her bliss as she felt him throbbing and growing within her yet he remained perfectly still but for his fingers which continued to tease at her velvety nipples finally she could bear no more of such exquisite torture and her body began to shiver as the honied sweetness flowed from her crowning the ruby head of his manhood she heard his soft laughter oh beloved you are as ever an impatient and greedy creature then he withdrew from her gathered her up and carried her from the pool i hate it when you are so superior she murmured as she stood on trembling legs that threatened to give way beneath her at any minute one strong arm locked about her slender waist and with his other hand he carefully dried her off i am not superior i am only delighted that i can give you such pleasure he said as he toweled her long hair free of excess water but i want you to be pleasured too she protested i am he answered and even more so when i see the look on your face he picked her up again walked across the room and gently deposited her upon the sleeping platform lying down next to her he said in the lonely nights to come beloved i shall relive a thousand times each moment we have spent in this room each night i have lain by your side and loved you i have never loved anyone else and i swear to you that i never shall he took her into his arms then and they kissed until they were breathless now he was afire to possess her once again but zenobia squirmed away from his eager grasp turning her body she moved downward covering his flat and lightly furred torso with little kisses teasingly she nipped at him with her sharp little teeth and he groaned as the tip of his shaft tingled with her assault a warm soothing tongue followed and then she took him in her mouth for a few moments while he fought to retain control of himself just when he thought he would lose the love battle between them she moved again mounting him and plunging downward to envelope him deep within her hot sheath reaching up he crushed her beautiful breasts within his big hands aching with incredible pleasure through slitted sapphire eyes he watched her as she flung back her head in ecstasy the delicate veins in her smooth throat standing out as the blood pumped visibly through them she shuddered again in pure fulfillment and it was then that he regained control turning her over so that he now rode her slowly he withdrew from her chuckling at her soft cry of distress taking his shaft in his hand he softly rubbed it over her lower belly and she moaned seeking him with hot eager little hands no beloved he murmured bending to caress the inside of her ear with his tongue do not be too eager for there is time for us his tongue followed the intricate path of her other ear tickling it lightly for a moment beneath him she writhed her desire growing again with each touch each caress his hands moved with love over her trembling form as he committed to memory the line of her body the feel of her satin skin her wonderful breaststhose honeyed hills of softness that reminded him of the great mother goddess herself her long strong legs that could grip a man in passionate embrace as easily as the sides of the great gray stallion she rode the marble smooth twin moons of her bottom he adored her completely worshiping at the shrine of her his love his very soul oh my love he murmured into the damp tangle of her hair i do not know if i can bear the separation from you his voice throbbed with emotion and zenobia could feel the unbidden tears begin to straggle down her cheeks make us one my darling she begged him i shall die if you do not and she arched to receive him as he thrust vigorously into her aching body over and over again he drove himself into her willing flesh and zenobia wept as much with the joy of his possession as she did from the knowledge that in the morning he would be gone at last his passion peaked and his seed rushed into the warm darkness of her womb as he collapsed upon her breasts she wept silently as he shuddered with his own pleasure how would she manage to exist without him he was her very life oh mama she thought if this was how it was for you and my father then at last i can understand the love you bore each other for some minutes they lay locked in embrace not speaking he could hear her heart gradually growing quieter beneath his ear and he knew that his own heartbeat was slowing she was the most incredible woman he thought and he didnt intend spending any more time in rome than he had to if his father was truly ill to deathand his mother was not a woman to exaggeratethen he would have to accept his responsibilities as head of his family but first he would return to palmyra for zenobia then it occurred to him that there was no reason he should have to remain in rome he didnt like rome and he never really had his younger brother aulus was settled in britain his two sisters lucia and eusebia lived with their husbands away from romelucia in the north outside of ravenna and eusebia in the south at naples his mother would probably choose to return to britain with aulus he would be free to live in palmyra to make it his home their home he shared his thought with her and he could hear the joy in her voice when she answered him you mean you would really make palmyra your home you would desert rome i deserted rome fifteen years ago beloved what is there for me a house a business these i can sell they have no meaning hold no sentiment for me my home beloved is where you are my home is here in palmyra zenobia wept with joy her hot tears pouring down her cheeks to soak the pillows running into her ears now she said finally gaining control of herself now i can bear your going i will send six of my guard with you marcus the first will return from tripoli to tell me the ship on which you have sailed the second and third will bring me letters from your ports of call the fourth will come directly from brindisi to tell me that you have reached italy safely the fifth will bring me news from rome and the last man will stay with you until you are about to return to me he will bring me the gladdest tidings of all the news that you are coming home so be it my beloved he agreed and then his mouth found hers again drinking in the sweetness of her quickly seeking to possess her once more as she joyously opened her arms to him and received him again they loved almost without stopping that night with lips and tongues and hands and eyes they touched and caressed and tasted until they thought there were no more pleasures and then they were astounded to find that that was not sotheir bodies turned and twisted and molded themselves a hundred different ways and the rapture never ended but grew sweeter sharper better each time finally but an hour before the dawn they fell into a restful sleep when they awoke but a short time later they were both at peace their private goodbyes were said within their love chamber their lips clinging for a moment to each other their eyes locking in silent understanding nothing will keep me from returning to you beloved he said i will be waiting she answered their public farewell was said in the main courtyard of the palace surrounded by longinus the young king his brother and the other members of the council of ten please bring our loyal greetings to the emperor aurelian marcus the king said we hope his reign will be a long and prosperous one it is unfortunate that claudius died of plague marcus smiled i shall be happy to convey your majestys greetings to the emperor aurelian he is married to a distant cousin of mine and he is a fine general i suspect if the senate will cooperate rome will prosper under him the king nodded then said farewell marcus alexander britainus the gods go with you and keep you safe until you return to us here in palmyra marcus bowed to the young king and then nodded to the others before his eyes found zenobia again they gazed lovingly at each other farewell beloved he said softly and he heard her answer farewell my heart i will wait he did not look back again but mounted his white stallion and rode off through the main gates of the palace accompanied by his familys slave leo and six of zenobias personal guard he did not know that she went immediately to a tower in the palace that overlooked the main caravan road west and watched until he and his party became but specks upon the horizon several days later the first of her guards returned marcus britainus and his party had taken passage from tripoli upon a firstclass merchant vessel neptunes luck which would be stopping only at cyprus and crete before it reached brindisi the second messenger returned and shortly thereafter the third the voyage was progressing smoothly the seas calm the winds perfect he would shortly be in rome in two months time the fourth messenger returned back to palmyra the queens beloved had safely reached italy zenobia stopped fretting the appian way the empires most famous road ran directly from brindisi to rome and was eminently safe now zenobia turned her eyes toward egypt they departed palmyra on an early winters morning the queen and her handsome son both riding within the same magnificent gold chariot drawn by four coalblack horses the citizens of palmyra lining the way to the triumphal arch screamed themselves hoarse at the sight of their beloved queen and their king how they love you vaballathus marveled over the cries of the crowd how they love you she corrected him you are the king no he replied i have not yet earned their adulation it is you for whom they cry but when we return through this triumphal arch they shall cry my name and will deserve it dagian the wife of lucius alexander britainus hurried into the atrium of her home arms outstretched in joyous welcome marcus she flung her arms round her eldest son and then kissed him on both cheeks praise the gods you have arrived home safely he stood back and studied her she was nearing sixty and yet he could see little change in the fifteen years he had been away her wonderful once golden hair was gray but the blue eyes he had inherited were as clear and sharp as ever there were few lines in her beautiful face did aulus arrive safely she nodded in the affirmative and father he is still alive yes but only because he did not choose to depart for the underworld until he had seen you marcus he is sleeping now but i will take you to him when he awakens marcus a woman very like his mother but with redblond hair had come into the atrium lucia by the gods she had been but a slip of a girl when he last saw her i did not think it possible marcus but you have grown even handsomer with age lucia said coming up and kissing him as his mother had done and you my sister have also grown lovelier he answered no marcus she answered him wryly i have simply grown and she laughingly patted her matronly form the result of five children and too good a cook wait until you see your nieces and nephews marcus they are young men and women yes marcus dagian put in quietly lucias children are almost all grown and you the eldest of my children are not even married he might have put it off but suddenly he realized it was better to speak the truth now so they might get used to it rather than wait until after his father had died and then suddenly spring it on them i will not be making my home in rome mother i will be returning to palmyra marcus why i am afraid mother that my fifteen years in the east have made me prefer a dry and warm climate and what else you cannot fool me marcus warm weather is simply not a reason for deserting your home he laughed he was not going to escape her curiosity he had never been able to even as a child there is a lady whom i wish to marry she has consented and so i will return to palmyra who is she marcus i cannot tell you yet is she married she is a widow young enough to have children yes mother she is young enough to have children is she beautiful marcus lucia asked softly little sister if the goddess venus came to earth she would take my beloveds face and form you are in love dagian was amazed i am in love mother he admitted with a smile for a moment dagian stared in surprise at her son he had always kept his feelings in complete check never exhibiting undue emotion even as a little boy he had grown into a big elegant intelligent man who always appeared a bit severe to her he was not like her younger son aulus always laughing light of heart deeply involved in life unafraid of being hurt he was not like his sisters passionate and gentle women whose emotions were always quite visible no marcus had been the reserved one and now suddenly to see his face alight with love was somewhat startling marcus the cry was almost a shriek and came from a short plump young woman with her fathers dark hair and eyes who ran across the atrium and hurled herself into his arms he swung her high above him and she giggled with glee as he put her down eusebia my little bird you have not learned to curb your passion for sweets i see calvinus says a skinny woman is no use on a cold night came the prompt reply she eyed him frankly jupiter you have grown positively gorgeous perhaps i should move to palmyra it is love that has softened him eusebia teased her older sister love marcus is in love eusebias dark brown eyes were round with curiosity tell me tell me she begged her oldest brother there is nothing to tell i will marry the lady when i return to palmyra you arent going to stay in rome his oldest sister spoke there is nothing here for me lucia you live in ravenna eusebia in naples and aulus in britain father is the first of the alexanders to make rome his permanent home he likes it i do not i will return to palmyra which i have grown to love lucia do you plan to sell the business a man almost as tall as marcus entered the room welcome home brother thank you aulus marcus was amused at his brothers question i think we shall wait until the matter need be settled to settle it thats right replied aulus after all it will all be yours as the elder son wont it marcus marcus laughed pleasantly you havent changed aulus you are still spoilt aulus shook his head wearily the gods marcus how long has it been since we have seen each other and the second i lay eyes upon you i become the whiny little boy trying to compete forgive me brother i thought i had outgrown it marcus looked at his younger brother aulus was not quite as tall as he but they looked very much alike with their blue eyes and chestnutbrown hair he had been almost six when aulus was born and he had he recalled been totally unimpressed with the baby aulus from the moment of his birth had competed with his elder sibling imitated him followed him but alas the gap had been too great between the boys aulus had never been able to keep up and although totally charming with everyone else he eventually became embittered toward his brother finding himself only when his maternal grandfather left him his estates in britain and he could be his own man away from marcus we will make the decisions necessary together when the time comes aulus marcus said quietly and dagian was silently proud of her eldest child you have had a long journey my son she said i will show you to your room and then perhaps you will want to bathe the dust of the road away knowing that his mother wanted to be alone with him for a few moments he followed her from the atrium leaving his sisters and his brother behind to gossip they ascended to the second floor of the house and she led him into the simple bedchamber of his youth gone however were all the small things that had made the room his dagian seated herself in the rooms one chair and looked piercingly at her son now marcus she said i wish to know of this woman you propose to make my daughterinlaw her name is zenobia she is the queen of palmyra the gods my son you aim high how can you marry this woman if she is the queen of palmyra her late husband odenathus left her regent for their son the young king once the king is married her obligation is over and zenobia will be free to marry me but if her child is old enough to be king in his own right then this woman is far too old to bear your children dagian protested we have a child mother a daughter her name is mavia and she is the princess of palmyra what dagian gripped the arms of the chair and leaned forward her lovely face very white hear me mother before you speak again i had barely arrived in palmyra when i saw zenobia and fell in love with her regrettably she was about to marry odenathus who was then prince of palmyra she returned your feelings though she didnt even know mother she was young and very innocent for after her mothers death her father and her brothers all overprotected her you would like her mother she is very much like you in certain ways dagian looked like she might cry but she fought back the emotion that threatened to spill over and asked in a voice that was less than steady how is she like me marcus she is stubborn yet compassionate intelligent and kind she was a good wife to her husband and is a good mother to her children yet she has borne you a child marcus a child that you tell me is known as the princess of palmyra i do not understand the night that odenathus was killed zenobia collapsed with the shock and we made love mother in the morning i was gone and she remembered nothing she believed the child to be her husbands until she saw it and then she remembered we both thought it best that mavia believe she is odenathuss child to do otherwise could have compromised the rule of young king vaballathus for although the boy is his fathers image there are those who might say he was not odenathuss son dagian nodded understanding zenobias protective maternal instincts toward her children marcus spoke again now i wish to see my father receive his final blessing make his passage from this life to the next a happy one and then return to my beloved in palmyra zenobia is my very reason for living mother and i ache with the separation from her dagian was now unable to control herself and a flood of tears rushed down her face oh marcus you are my eldest child and although i would never admit it before even to myself you are my favorite child i want you to be happy but you cannot marry your zenobia your father has arranged a match for you he so wanted to see you married before he died you must not be angry with him marcus was astounded he arranged a match for me has his illness rendered him mad mother i am no boy for him to arrange a wife for me i am past forty could he not have waited until i got home and consulted with me on this matter marcus try to understand he is dying and he wants everything in his life in order before he must make that crossing from here to the underworld his eldest son a man these many years remains unmarried if you were a lover of boys he would have long since given you up but you are a real man and his only immortality aulus is married mother and he is also fathers son aulus is the father of several sons you are lucius alexanders eldest son marcus and he wanted you settled he wanted you happy as he and i have been all these years he did not seek to harm you besides why did you not write to us of your love for zenobia as always you have been secretive i could not write to you under the circumstances mother surely you must see that zenobias situation is far too politically sensitive and if such a message had fallen into the wrong hands it might have brought down her government and endangered the empires eastern boundaries that she and her late husband protected so well for rome no it is unfortunate but this betrothal will have to be broken it cannot be dagian almost whispered cannot his brow darkened with anger what do you mean cannot mother your father secured a great match for you marcus you are to be married to the emperors niece carissa the match will have to be broken emperors niece or no mother marcus you cannot offend aurelian do not fear mother i will go to aurelian myself and explain the situation zenobia is vital to the empires eastern defenses i know the emperor will approve my match with the queen and find another husband for his niece they walked from the room and back downstairs again into the atrium where marcus called for a chariot within moments the vehicle was at the front door of the house and with a quick smile to his mother he was gone through the door she stood listening as the chariot rumbled off down the quiet residential street an arm went about her shoulders and aulus said you look as if you have been crying what has my big brother done now mother he has done nothing aulus your father made a match between your older brother and the emperors niece carissa marcus however is in love with a woman in palmyra he has gone off to tell the emperor that the betrothal must be canceled aulus had paled at the mention of the emperors nieces name carissa mother you are sure of the name dagian nodded and then asked what is wrong aulus you look as if you have seen an evil spirit oh mother carissa is the most venal creature alive that sweetfaced child that is the paradox of carissa she looks like a vestal virgin yet is more corrupt than any woman in the empire marcus drove through the bustling streets of the city to the palatine hill where the emperor lived he could not help but notice the filth in the streets unusual for the rome he remembered had been clean and bright now however the great marble buildings were in need of repair and there was obvious vandalism to public places there were many shops closed and shuttered at the palace a slave ran to take his horses and he strode into the ancient building to encounter an old friend marcus alexander came the shout and he turned gaius cicero the two men gripped arms in the traditional roman greeting and then stepped back to view each other gaius cicero was a man of forty of medium height and stocky build with brown eyes and black hair i had heard you were coming home from the eastern frontier he said with a smile i am sorry so sad an event as your fathers dying brings you what do you here i must see the emperor so cries half of rome marcus alexander but aurelians time is limited this is an urgent matter gaius cicero it could have farreaching effects on the empire can you help me by chance yes hes in the baths now and if you dont mind seeing him there then i will take you i would see him in hades if necessary the praetorian officer smiled wryly i am sure there are those who would wish aurelian in the very place you mentioned follow me marcus alexander he made several turns into exquisitely decorated corridors that were lit with multilamped candelabra ah here we are he announced as they moved quickly through large double doors that were opened by two praetorian guards a slave hurried to aid them and gaius cicero said tell the emperor that gaius cicero has brought marcus alexander britainus to see him on a matter of urgent business we ask the emperors leave to come into the bath at once gaius cicero the slave replied and hurried off if he will see you marcus you will not need me i do not wish to intrude i thank you again for your help gaius cicero marcus replied perhaps we can have dinner together while you are in rome the praetorian said the emperor will see you marcus alexander britainus said the returning slave farewell marcus alexander gaius cicero said i will send a message to your parents home the slave quickly had marcus divested of his clothes the emperor is already in the caldarium he will speak with you when you reach the unctorium marcus alexander britainus marcus nodded and walked from the dressing room into the tepidarium where he sat down and waited for the perspiration to flow when his pores were open and he was dripping a slave began to scrape him free of dirt and sweat as he stood silently he moved quickly into the caldarium for a hot bath the emperor was already gone there were however several young beautiful nude slave girls who bathed him tenderly with scented soap before leading him to the bath where he soaked a short time he decided against a plunge in the frigidariums icy bath preferring a quick swim in the open courtyard pool which had been warmed by the sun now he might enter into the unctorium the emperor was waiting marcus alexander aurelian rose and came toward him smiling hail caesar marcus replied his right arm extended in salute put your arm down marcus aurelian said gesturing impatiently the gods i shall never get used to being greeted hail caesar the emperor was a tall man over six feet but marcus still topped him by a good two inches come and have a rubdown and well talk he invited the two men lay upon the massage benches and marcus studied the emperor from beneath apparently closed eyes he had known him briefly years ago and he remembered aurelian as fair but determined he wondered if the years had altered him any certainly not physically he was older than marcus and yet marcus noted the emperors body was yet that of a younger man firm and hard his blond hair was just faintly touched with silver as was his barbered beard but his light blue eyes were as clear and sharp as ever he had a nicely shaped head his eyes were well spaced his nose was long and surprisingly aquiline for a man with peasant roots his lips narrow almost scornful how is your wife ulpia he asked your cousin ulpia is well marcus but that is not what you came to see me about what is it you want release me from the betrothal my father made with you between myself and your niece carissa no i will not marry your niece caesar i came home for two reasons because my father was dying and to tell my parents that i was to marry at long last i am already betrothed when i return to palmyra i shall marry its queen zenobia her son will shortly rule in his own right and i shall then wed his mother is it not of more importance that i wed such a valuable ally to rome do you love the queen of palmyra i have loved her for many years caesar and she loves you yes it is unfortunate then that you must wed with my niece take her back with you to palmyra if you desire to live there marcus the queen will remain your mistress if she loves you marcus felt the anger welling up within him who was this peasant chosen emperor that he might control the life of a member of one of the empires oldest patrician families i will not marry this girl you have chosen for me caesar marcus said quietly attempting to mask his fury but you will my friend because if you dont i will destroy your family they are all here in rome now arent they how would you like to see aulus executed on the charge that his loyalty to britain is greater than his loyalty to rome it is you know i would then send word that his foreign wife and halfbreed children be expediently dispatched and that his wealth as well as that of your father be confiscated by the government your parents would be forced to beg for their very existence i wonder how long your beautiful mother would survive marcus as for your luscious sisters my friend a short stay in the whorehouse of the praetorian guard would make them welcome death as for you defy me in this and you will never see your beautiful mistress again marcus felt frustrated and helpless aulus might run the husbands of his sisters use their wealth and influence to protect them but who could protect his parents his father must be allowed to die in peace in his own home his mother must be comfortable in her old age why he asked because i am caesar and i command it you can force me to wed with your niece caesar but you will do her as great a disservice as you are doing me i will never touch her and she will be condemned to a life of total loneliness is this what you want for her aurelian smiled you have not seen carissa yet my friend she is exquisite there is nothing your niece can offer that i want i will marry her because you have given me no choice but i will not honor her or love her marcus arose from the massage bench and strode toward the door to the dressing room the wedding will be in two days the emperor called to him would you not like to meet carissa before then why was the acid reply and marcus disappeared from aurelians view i do not like him uncle said the beautiful nude girl who had been massaging the emperor you do not have to like him aurelian replied laughing i have most kindly supplied you with the son and heir of one of the most patrician families in the empire for a husband he is handsome he is wealthy what more can you want carissa he will not be manageable uncle nevertheless he is a roman of the old school and as his wife you will lack for nothing you speak of his returning to the east i do not want to go to the east then dont my pet many a roman wife has remained behind while her husband served a term in syria or palestine you are most fortunate carissa that lucius alexander chose this time to die else i had not gotten you such a prize but i dont want him uncle find me someone else the girl pouted aurelian smiled a slow and lazy smile as he turned over on the marble bench his staff was straight and hard you do not have a choice he said softly pulling her atop him and burying himself inside her you simply do not have the choice he repeated thrusting deeply sinking his teeth into her smooth shoulder then make him stay in rome uncle she murmured imitating his pelvic movements i will try my pet he said i will try and he crushed her in his embrace try hard uncle she said and then her mouth took his in a flaming kiss marcus had dressed and left the palace he was in a high fury for he could not think of a way to extricate himself from this situation that would not involve his entire family he did not doubt for one moment that aurelian would carry out his threats what was he to tell zenobia how could he possibly explain to her in a letter all that had transpired in two days he must marry the girl two days he had not yet seen his father but when he had obtained his blessing and the wedding was over marcus intended to return to palmyra alone there he would explain to zenobia what had happened then as soon as his father died his sisters had left rome and were safe with their husbands and his brother had taken their mother to safety in britainfor whatever aurelian might think there were places in britain that roman justice could not touchthen would he act to divorce this woman he was being forced to take to wife he would divorce her and marry his beloved if he left the day after the wedding he could reach palmyra before any letter could before any gossip could furiously he whipped his horses and as he raced through the streets took savage pleasure seeing the pedestrians scatter and scramble out of the way hurling curses at him that flowed off his shoulders like rainwater if they hated he hated right back his father was awake when he arrived home and he went quickly in to see him do not upset him dagian begged her son and marcus nodded he was shocked by his fathers withered and shrunken appearance marcus had long ago topped his father by several inches but the tiny frail man who lay in his bed was almost a stranger until he spoke you are growing older my son he said your mother has told me that she informed you of the fine match i have made for you i would that she had given me that pleasure but then and here he gazed affectionately at dagian your mother was never one to keep a happy secret we must have the wedding soon marcus charon already waits to ferry me across into the underworld i have already seen the emperor father he tells me that the wedding will be in two days good good the old man enthused i ask nothing more of the gods but to see you safely married he fell back upon his pillows and was soon snoring lightly oh marcus dagian whispered when i think of the strong and virile man he was and nownow he is so weak dagian took her son by the hand and led him from the room tell me what transpired between you and the emperor aurelian is adamant that i marry his niece he has threatened violence and destruction against this family if i do not however i shall leave the day after the wedding for palmyra i can stay no longer and father will die whether i am here or not this is hardly something that i can tell zenobia in a letter once father has passed on once my sisters are safe with their husbands once you and aulus are safely returned to britain then i shall divorce this carissa and marry zenobia dagian nodded slowly his plan was sound and although she could see that he was angry it was a contained anger she could not understand aurelians immovable intent why did he so fervently desire marcus for his niece surely there were other young men in rome who could be brought into line or even bought why marcus she wondered again two days later after her eldest son had been married to carissa because of her husbands illness the ceremony had been performed in her husbands bedchamber and for a brief time lucius alexander exuded the power and the charm that had once been his it was as if he had gathered all his strength for a final performance he greeted the emperor heartily and complimented the bride the bride dagian gazed upon aurelians niece and marveled that any woman could be that perfect carissa was a girl of medium height with an oval face and two adorable dimples on either side of her rosebud mouth her skin was milk white her cheeks were touched with rose her features were quite delicate for a girl of peasant background her small nose was straight her black eyes round and fringed with thick long gold eyelashes her forehead was not quite as high as one might have wished but her small square chin was also blessed with a dimple the lovely head was crowned with thistledown hair of the natural gold color that the women of rome so desperately sought in their wigs carissa had slim hands and feet a reedlike waist slender hips and firm high young breasts she moved with complete grace and her manners appeared excellent for her voice was soft but clear and she deferred to her uncle and her aunt ulpia she had chosen white and silver as her wedding colors and they suited her admirably marcus glanced at the girl his distaste obvious the augurs were taken and declared highly favorable dagian hid a smile the soothsayer could have opened a lamb that was filled with writhing snakes and he would have found it favorable to this match the ceremony was quickly over the emperor and the empress were quite jovial at the feast that followed they and their friends ate and drank liberally the bride was quite animated chatting with all the guests but not once did she speak to her husband nor he to her the rest of the wedding customs were forgotten and marcus was glad for this marriage was a mockery of everything he had ever been taught zenobia he almost cried her name aloud in his anguish and dagian seeing the spasm cross her sons face reached out and squeezed his hand when it was no longer possible to prolong the festivities the emperor and his wife stood and both bride and groom escorted them to the door bidding them a good night ulpia severina wept matronly tears as she kissed the beautiful girl she had raised be happy dear child she murmured and with a maidenly sigh carissa assured her aunt that she would be the emperor looked directly at marcus and said in a very public voice i know that you will make my niece happy marcus alexander marcus smiled broadly you may be certain caesar that i shall see that carissa has everything she deserves he replied the emperor and the empress departed and with them all of the other guests turning marcus looked at the beautiful girl who was now his wife we will sleep in the atrium tonight he said i see that the wedding couch is already there very well she replied coldly and walking over to it kicked off her sandals do you want me naked i dont want you at all carissa surely you know that i was forced into this marriage that i am betrothed to another woman whether you sleep with me or not i do not care was her answer the child will come anyway what he felt a throbbing begin in his head i am with child she said it will be born in four months a small smile played about the corners of her mouth you surely do not think i wished to marry you she laughed her tinkling irritating laugh whose bastard do you carry why did you not marry him or is he perhaps already married yes he is married unfortunately he could not divorce his dull wife to marry me for it is forbidden that an uncle marry his niece my child should be the next emperor of rome after aurelian his father but it cannot be therefore it was necessary that i have the most patrician of husbands to give my child a name aurelian will eventually name our child his heir for he has promised me that a worthless promise marcus replied aurelian will be emperor for a few years if we are lucky but eventually one of our powermad generals will assassinate him and declare himself augustus that is a possibility of course she answered coolly and that is why this child will be considered an alexander he will be safe if his real father should die before he is old enough to take command of the empire my child will be safe until his time comes since i have just arrived home carissa there is no one who will believe the child mine it makes no difference you are my husband now and therefore my child will be legally yours heir to this fine old patrician family you will never have a child of your own marcus alexander for i will never couple with you never nothing shall endanger my childs place in life it was then he slapped her his big hand flashing out to make contact with her smug beautiful face the red imprint of his long fingers crossed her smooth white cheek carissa screamed with outrage her high voice pealing throughout the entire house again and again until finally the room was filled with dagian aulus lucia and eusebia and numerous wideeyed slaves carissa the shoulder of her tunic suddenly shredded flung herself into dagians startled arms weeping wildly oh mother dagian he tried to make memake mmmeit was foul and unnatural nothing like what dearest aunt ulpia told me was expected of me on my wedding night then she sobbed again hiccoughing a few times for effect back to your quarters all of you commanded old castor the alexander majordomo in an attempt to herd the slaves away from what was obviously a family dispute oh no marcus said loudly since my wife has started this thing publicly we will finish it publicly you will all stay he turned to his mother dont bother attempting to comfort her mother she is a consummate liar and a skilled actress as well as an obviously competent whore my blushing bride has just told me that she is some months pregnant and was married off to me to supply the child with a good name aurelian will kill you for this carissa hissed suddenly in full control her beautiful face contorted with fury i would kill you marcus replied but instead i intend leaving rome tonight i will divorce you as soon as i reach palmyra you will never divorce me she screamed at him aurelian will not let you divorce me marcus looked to his two sisters take her out of my sight he commanded them lock her in some room far away from the rest of the household where she cannot cause any trouble i cannot bear the sight of the whore aided by two strong young slaves lucia and eusebia did as their brother bid them removing carissa from the atrium as she screamed threats and curses at them in high fury now marcus said turning to old castor you may send the slaves to bed you should have let me tell him aulus said to dagian tell me what marcus asked i knew of carissas reputation for though she and the emperor have been discreet they have not been that discreet it would have made no difference marcus replied i went to the emperor and was told if i did not marry her he would destroy our family i should not have allowed you to sacrifice yourself for us marcus return to palmyra this night we will weather the storm he sat down heavily and his head wearily dropped into his hands you are welcome to come to me mother but i somehow feel that you will want to return to britain with aulus go with him if that be your desire or live with lucia or eusebia but leave i beg you this sewer that has become rome when i ride through its gates i shall never return i swear it i shall never return oh marcus dagian replied brokenly i am so sorry i am so very sorry marcus is correct mother aulus spoke up rome is no longer a decent place to live why do you think i chose to settle in britain the immorality and corruption here is worse than ever each day the rich become stronger the powerful more powerful the simple citizen who would normally be honest and hardworking is being ground into the earth and the idle are being rewarded for their very laziness this is not the roman way yet mention the old ways of diligence hard work honesty manners and honoring the gods and the people mock you well the new ways are not my ways nor are they better ways and i will not abide by them aurelian chose to foist his whore off on marcus because of the very virtues we believe in mother he knew that marcus would not like so many of these new romans desert his family or his obligations mother lucia hurried into the room mother it is father i will come immediately dagian replied and she hurried from the room is he dying marcus questioned his sister i think so was the answer will you and aulus come now in a few minutes lucia where did you put carissa in nurses old room on the second floor in the far back of the house go now lucia we will come presently what are you going to do marcus aulus cocked his head to one side curiously if he is dying then he will want to see us all and that most certainly includes his new daughterinlaw i know i can rely on your aid younger brother you can older brother was the smiling assent as they went marcus said there will be time for us to talk before i return to palmyra aulus i intend selling the business here in rome but it will be to someone who will broker for us the goods you send from britain and those i send from the east agreed and i think i may know the man we can trust they reached lucius alexanders room and when they looked inside dagian left her husbands side and hurried toward her sons it is the end she said softly he will die before dawn the two brothers disappeared down the corridor of the upper floor and stopping before a heavy wooden door at the corridors end lifted the heavy bar that lay across it you bastard carissa was across the floor her nails extended to rake at him with a wolfish grimace he caught her wrists and brutally forced her arms down be silent you bitch or i swear i will throttle you emperors niece or no she glared at him furiously you are hurting me she said he ignored her complaint continuing to hold onto her wrists my father has chosen this moment to die carissa and he wishes his entire family about him you are going to come with me now and you are going to behave like a good roman wife would behave modestly quietly and reverently no im not i shall tell your father that i carry aurelians son and that my bastard will bear his proud patrician name let that be his last thought in the mortal world and let him know he is powerless even as you are powerless to do anything about it her beauty was suddenly marred by her hatred which made her look quite common marcuss voice was low but aulus could hear that it held a dangerous note no carissa you will behave as i have said modestly quietly and reverently if you do not i swear to you that i shall throw you from the roof of this house and tell the world that you committed suicide when i attempted to claim my conjugal rights he smiled but his eyes were pitiless i almost hope he said that you give me the chance to kill you looking into that hard and ruthless face carissa knew that marcus meant exactly what he said and she shivered suddenly afraid she didnt want to die nor did she want her unborn child killed i will do what you want she said and remember aulus said that i too shall be by your side carissa brushed her hair into a smooth coil and affixed it with silver pins then she quickly shed her torn tunic and replaced it with a fresh one they walked down the hallway to lucius alexanders death chamber where dagian and her daughters clustered about the old mans bed here are your sons and carissa to see you my dearest dagian said as they reached the bedside lucius alexander opened his dark eyes but for a moment he could not focus clearly then as the fog cleared from his eyes he struggled to speak you have both been sons to be proud of and i know you will keep the family and its traditions alive in the hearts of your own children kneel my sons and both men knelt by luciuss bedside the old man struggled to raise his hand to auluss head my blessing aulus may only good fortune smile upon you and your family throughout your lifetime aulus felt the sob rising in his throat but quickly forced it back marcus my son my heir upon you falls me responsibility for mis family will you honor mis responsibility yes father i will marcus felt his fathers bony hand upon his own head i am pleased with you pray that tonight you will plant the seed of life within this sweet childs womb it will be as the gods will father carissa my newest daughter i know you will be to marcus as my faithful dagian has been to me yes father lucius came the demure reply i promise to follow her example you are a good child lucius whispered i was right to pursue this match marcus will see i was right the dying man fell back upon his pillows his breaming a harsh rasp soon he slid into a halfconscious state as the minutes turned to an hour and then two and three lucius alexander seemed to shrink before their very eyes each bream he drew was a tortured struggle and it seemed as if his chest would split with the effort in the loneliest part of the night those hours just before the dawn lucius alexander opened his eyes a final time and stared at the woman who sat patiently by his side farewell my heart he said distinctly in the voice of his youth and then he died for dagian it was as if a spear had pierced her heart one minute he was there and then as quickly he was gone as she sat frozen with shock and grief her eldest son reached over and closed his fathers eyes conclamatum est he said as he closed them it is over mother marcus said quietly helping her to rise from her place by the bedside she looked helplessly at him unable to speak lucia eusebia take our mother to her room to rest and stay with her aulus return carissa to her place of confinement you cannot mean to lock me up again carissa protested do as you are told else i take a stick to you he thundered had lucius alexander britainus died but several days later his eldest son marcus would have been safely on his way back to palmyra as it was the old mans death and the settling of his estate took longer than marcus had anticipated lucius was buried the same day he died in the confusion the two young slaves appointed to carry the lifeless body of their master to the atrium mistakenly placed him upon the wedding couch that had been set up for marcus and carissa marcus laughed at the irony of it the marriage was dead before it was even celebrated he said bitterly at the hour appointed for the funeral the public crier gave notice according to ancient custom going about the city and saying the citizen lucius alexander britainus has been surrendered to death for those who find it convenient it is now time to attend the funeral he is being brought from his house lucius alexanders funeral was well attended for he had been a respected man he was escorted by many to the alexander family tomb which stood along the appian way on the road to tivoli afterward the family hosted the funeral dinner and their nine days of sorrow began the emperor and his wife had come of course and marcus had seen carissa deep in conversation with her uncle i can only hope he warned her later that you have done nothing foolish the nine days passed slowly within the house dagian and her daughters carefully packed up all of luciuss belongings until very little trace of the man remained except within their minds and hearts carissa no longer confined to her room spent most of her time lying about eating outrageous delicacies that she had ordered the kitchen to prepare for her alone and having her golden hair brushed did not bother to help marcus and aulus spent the time preparing their fathers trading house for sale the younger alexander son knew a man who would be more than delighted to have the business and would cooperate with the two brothers in marketing their goods from britain and from palmyra since they could not leave the house or conduct business during this time however they could do nothing concrete finally the nine days were over and julius rabirius was contacted as expected he wanted the alexander business interests offered a generous amount for them and agreed to deal with aulus alexander britainus exclusively in britain and marcus alexander britainus in palmyra eusebia and lucia assured that their mother would be well taken care of by her sons returned to their homes they had both been gone several months and their own families needed them lucia the sister nearest to marcus in age spoke the thoughts that had occurred to both sisters before they departed will we ever see you or aulus again in this life marcus i do not know he replied honestly i have given aulus permission to form his own family independent of mine you and eusebia belong now to your husbands families mother has decided to return to britain with aulus and will be a part of his family zenobia and i will found our own family in palmyra i think it unlikely that we will meet easily again lucia began to weep softly and marcus comforted her it is not easy for a family to part dear sister but it is the way of the world nothing ever remains the same the seasons change the years change often too quickly to suit me but none of us can hold back time any more than we can hold back a sunset or a dawn one moment we are carefree children the next we are grown and as suddenly we are old there is nothing for it my sister but to enjoy that which we have and not waste time bemoaning what we do not have give thanks to the gods that we are all happy and taken care of my sister so many are less fortunate than we of the alexander family you make it all sound so simple lucia sniffed that my dearest sister is the secret of life we spend so much time seeking the solution to it and what it all boils down to in the end is simplicity the sisters departed lucia north to ravenna eusebia south to naples now it was time for aulus and dagian to leave for britain what of your zenobia asked dagian have you written to her of your marriage and what you plan to do if i were to communicate with my beloved the message would certainly be intercepted by the emperor i have here with me one of the queens own personal guard who will go before me when i am ready to return to palmyra he will take my message then but i fear to send him before i am ready to leave myself when will you go aulus asked not until i receive word that you and mother are safe from imperial retribution it will be over two months before we can get word to you marcus dare you wait that long you have already been gone three months from palmyra i do not have a choice aulus only when my family is safe can i act he escorted them to the western gate of the city but there they were stopped i am sorry marcus alexander britainus said the centurion in charge of the gate your brother is free to return to his home in britain but neither you nor your mother may leave the city without the emperors permission realizing the futility in protest marcus turned to aulus go brother i will care for our mother and see that she eventually returns to the land of her birth make ready a place for her aulus dagian nodded her agreement give my love to eada and the children she said and then she hugged him tightly i will come soon i promise you aulus it is not meant for me to die in this foreign land the two brothers embraced both had tears in their eyes as a thousand memories assailed them memories of happier times when they had been one family we will meet again marcus aulus said softly perhaps was the quiet reply now go youngster never forget you are an alexander never allow your children or their children to forget it then dagian kissed her younger son tenderly i will come as soon as i can take my chariot aulus without mother it will help you go quicker marcus said aulus climbed down from the raeda which was a large heavy covered wagon with four wheels drawn by four horses used for family travel one of dagians slaves hurried to remove his scant baggage and store it in marcuss elegant chariot quickly aulus climbed aboard the chariot and with a quick smile at both his mother and his older brother he drove off down the via flaminia dagians eyes were wet with unshed tears as she watched him go they spoke little as the raeda rumbled back through the streets of the city and out into their suburb startled servants hurried to greet the wagon as it entered the grounds of the alexander house marcus helped his mother down and quickly gave orders that her baggage be returned to her rooms then together they hurried into marcuss study tenderly he settled his distressed mother pouring her some wine how did aurelian know that we were leaving dagian wondered aloud carissa was marcuss flat reply the bitch has an uncanny instinct for survival then why let any of us go you mother are the only hostage he needs and that is why you were forbidden exit from the city aurelian knows that as long as i must worry for your safety the safety of his whore and his bastard are assured what of your zenobia dagian asked i do not know he said helplessly how can i send her a letter explaining this what of her personal messenger my son the palmyran was found strangled in his quarters early this morning mother i did not tell you because i did not think you would need to know i expected that you would be on your way with aulus back home to britain there is more to this marcus than meets the eye dagian said thoughtfully i know that mother but what is it what is it that aurelian really wants you would do well to ask me that yourself marcus said the emperor striding into the room good day to you lady dagian how did you gain entrance to my home marcus demanded angrily i was visiting my dear niece marcus surely you dont object to a fond uncle visiting his favorite niece she is quite pettish as her pregnancy advances i find and suddenly my dear marcus she grows fat carissa should not allow herself to grow fat it coarsens her i do hope that after she has delivered the child you will insist she regain her divine form i will leave you dagian said rising no commanded the emperor waving her back into her chair i wish you to hear what i have to say to your son lady dagian it will save him the trouble of repeating it he turned back to marcus you wonder aloud at my purpose marcus it is really quite simple of course it was necessary that i supply carissa with a husband due to her state but it might have been any of a number of young patrician fops rather than you i chose you because you were the betrothed of palmyras queen it serves my purpose well you see marcus i know the history of zenobias youth i know how she has hated rome for the murder of her mother i know how as a child she watched her mothers murderers as they slowly died i know how after odenathuss death your love for each other grew and her hate subsided but that hate is still there marcus it exists just below the surface waiting to be rekindled i intend to rekindle zenobias hatred of rome her cooperation does not serve my purposes i do not want palmyra ruled by a client king i want it returned to a roman governorship as it was in the great days of the empire i want to return imperial rome to her glory and i have already begun with the resubjugation of gaul in the east zenobia has kindly subdued all and now i will subdue her she has shown no disloyalty caesar you have no just cause i will have aurelian smiled when palmyras queen hears that her lover the man she expected to marry has married another he chuckled and then said i expect that her fury will know no bounds she will want to revenge herself on rome once more and believe me marcus she will try when she does i will do what any roman emperor would do when faced with a threat to the empire your fair zenobia will walk in golden chains behind my victory chariot marcus a year two at the most if she is as good as they tell me she is in battle but she will crown my triumph and settle me firmly upon the throne sooner or later the empire will be preserved he paused looking at the stunned faces of his audience it is but an added bonus that she is beautiful i always enjoy making love to beautiful women especially if they are intelligent as well if you touch zenobia marcus suddenly had come to life again my dear marcus youre a married man with a pregnant wife for shame dear boy he chuckled indulgently oh you may have her back when i am through with her if she wants to go to you of course i imagine she will be quite piqued with you quite piqued indeed he looked to dagian i can trust you to look after my little carissa lady dagian a young woman having her first child needs the comfort of an older woman i assumed that was why you forbade me exit from rome caesar if you had but told me it would have saved me a great deal of packing and unpacking dagian said tartly i will allow you to return to britain when carissa is safely delivered and zenobia of palmyra is properly beaten you have my word on it lady dagian until then you must content yourself to remain with your eldest son as caesar wills it dagian replied acidly aurelian chuckled again then spoke once more to marcus i do not think the city is good for carissa right now you have two days in which to pack all you need and then you will depart for an imperial villa in tivoli you will be forbidden rome once you leave only when i have the eastern provinces firmly under imperial control again will you be allowed to return to the city my business requires i remain in rome caesar i will give you my word not to leave the city but you cannot exile me from it you have sold your fathers trading business to julius rabirius marcus i know that he has agreed to broker for both you and your brother you may communicate with him of course but be advised that every message you send will be read by me before it goes on its way i will allow you no chance to warn your queen of my plans for herand the eastern empire are we restricted to your villa caesar i think for the time being marcus that it would be wisest he rose from the chair in which he had been sitting and stopped before dagian who remained seated in a gesture of disrespect he did not miss aurelian smiled brightly and bowed to her good day to you lady dagian i hope i shall see you soon again come marcus walk out with me the two men left the study and moved into the atrium make no mistake marcus the emperor said quietly if you attempt to warn zenobia of my plans or plot against me or embarrass my family i will act swiftly do you understand marcus yes was the terse reply good aurelian said now i have a project for you to do i want a detailed map of palmyra and her border fort qasralhêr the gods curse you aurelian marcus swore angrily it is bad enough that you make it appear to zenobia that i have betrayed her must you also see that i do so in fact as well i wish to take palmyra with as little bloodshed as possible a blackened city with a dead populace is of no use to us your lovely queen will fight me to the last man if i let her it is her reputation to do so if i can prevent this i would prefer it so caesar i cannot betray palmyra any more than i could betray rome i understand the emperor replied and then with a quick nod he was gone with a deep sigh marcus returned to his study dagian was gone and he was alone wearily he sat down reached for the wine and poured himself a full goblet which he quickly drained and as quickly refilled he stared into the dark red liquid which mirrored his own face severe with sleeplessness and worry he was trapped if dagian had been allowed to leave rome perhaps he might have made a run for it but of course aurelian had had no intention of allowing it he drained the second goblet and felt its warmth beginning to suffuse his body the emperor was correct in all he said when zenobia learned of his marriage to carissa she would of course assume another roman betrayal if only longinus could hold her in check but in his heart he knew that longinus would not be able to do so hurt she would seek to hurt oh beloved he thought sadly aurelian will eventually crush you for never have i known such a determined man but then you are a determined woman perhaps you will prevail over him if the gods will but allow may they guard you and protect you now my beloved for i cannot marcus sipped at the wine sinking deeper into depression until suddenly he realized that to give in even in the face of such incredible odds was totally out of character for him never in his life had he allowed selfpity to gain the upper hand never in all the years that he had yearned for zenobia then another mans wife had he ever given up hope he would not give it up now not even now resolutely he stood up feeling the wine in his head and swaying youre drunk came the petulant voice from the door and you are fat carissa came the scathing reply your uncle is correct it coarsens you he moved to the door and with surprisingly firm hands pushed her out of his study this room is forbidden you carissa if you are to have the run of the house there must be one place where i may escape the sight and sound of you once we get to tivoli things will change she snarled at him i dont think so my dear was the acerbic reply i will still be the head of this household whom you must obey i hate you she screamed at him no more than i hate you carissa he laughingly replied no more than i hate you zenobia queen of palmyra stood looking out upon the mediterranean sea she could not get enough of the sight for she had discovered that it was very much like her desert a constantly changing pattern of color and movement it was close to sunset and the sea was very still at the moment a smooth and silken surface winecolored reflecting back at her the palace from which she watched it above her a flock of pink flamingos whirled their black underwings in stark contrast to their vividly colored upper bodies she turned to watch the beautiful birds as they flew over the palace to settle down along the shores of lake mareotis where they nested all was quiet now and she stood for some long minutes watching the beacon to the east harbor the pharos lighthouse it was a view seen many times by her ancestress cleopatra her gaze moved back to the sea and she could feel her eyes straining as if by only looking hard enough she might see rome across the water see romeand her false lover marcus alexander britainus there was still pain when she thought of him but it was not as sharp today as it had been yesterday nor would it be as sharp tomorrow as it was now she had always believed she could not live without love but now she knew that to be untrue hate was a magnificent substitute and she had vowed privately that she would never love a mortal man ever again death had taken odenathus from her and now an emperors niece had taken marcus why she wondered once more why had he married another woman when he had sworn to return to her she could find no explanation he had not even written to her are you all right majesty cassius longinus had come out on the long open portico yes longinus i am fine she replied but he could hear the sadness in her voice there has to be a logical explanation he burst out and she turned to look at him with haunted eyes why do you attempt to find excuses for him longinus you never really approved i know that there is no explanation other than the fact that the roman used me but i have always learned from my mistakes and i will never be used by any man again he did not argue but still longinus wondered he believed that he knew the roman very well and this sudden marriage to aurelians niece and his failure to communicate with zenobia were totally out of character for marcus britainus i intend declaring vaba augustus and myself queen of the east she said and he was quickly jolted from his thoughts you will bring rome down on you majesty rome is weak zenobia said scornfully one general after another declares himself emperor and the path to their empires throne is littered with the bodies of the assassinated none can hold power for very long the barbarian tribes to the west and the north of italy are constantly encroaching upon the empires territory can aurelian divert enough soldiers from europe to make war on me i do not think so longinus rome must face the fact that i now control the east and i will not let it go this i can do to insure vabas future and that of his sons and grandsons is it for vaba you do it majesty or is it to revenge yourself on marcus alexander britainus hate is a twoedged sword majesty it can injure those who wield it as well as an enemy you worry too much longinus did not the augurs at my birth say i should be fortunate at war and have i not been the augurs also said you would be fortunate in love majesty was the devastating reply and so i have been she argued was my hawk not the most wonderful of husbands but he is dead majesty and the man that you truly love with every fiber of your being has appeared to betray you i do not consider that fortunate longinuss logic was a sharp knife cutting away at her confidence zenobia tossed her head angrily and chose to ignore his remark i repeat longinus you worry too much longinus bowed his head in acceptance of her will will you make this announcement here in alexandria majesty yes was the reply by the time my announcement arrives to ruin aurelians digestion i shall be back in palmyra she laughed this could very well topple the latest of romes military rulers and who shall be next and for how long he wondered about her overconfidence and he worried yet all had gone well so far the armies of palmyra had passed easily and quickly through syria and palestine and across the egyptian desert they had crossed the nile river delta attracting only curious glances from the peasants and entered into alexandria with no resistance there zenobias uncles paulus and argus simon had been busy spreading her doctrine of an eastern empire free of foreigners free of rome alexandria never treated well by the romans had responded to that message by welcoming palmyras queen and taking her as their own after all was she not the child of a daughter of this city was she not a descendant of the last great ptolemaic queen cleopatra by the gods they would once again rise to the greatness that had been theirs before the romans the romans since the days of julius caesar they had been bad luck for alexandria the ptolemaic pharaohs and their queens had made alexandria the academic center of the ancient world the great alexandrian library and museum were worldfamous so were the many schools of rhetoric medicine mathematics philosophy art literature and poetry in the beginning of roman rule nothing had changed but then it became intolerable and various segments of the population began to chafe a revolt by the large jewish population resulted in their annihilation and the destruction of the jewish quarter fully a third of the city and with the jews went alexandrias commercial prosperity it was now merely a beautiful ancient city whose schools and great library attracted scholars there was a certain amount of commerce but nothing to compare with its days of glory the alexandrians had little love for the romans whom they rightly blamed for their plight the chance to strike back at them was irresistible and queen zenobia of palmyra appeared the very person for them to follow the pronouncement of king vaballathus and his mother zenobia was made from the main portico of alexandrias royal palace zenobia had sworn never again to wear roman garments and had taken to the opulent clothes that were a mixture of egyptian persian and parthian her dress that day was called a kalasiris a long sleeveless garment with a simple round neck that was totally accordionpleated to the anklelength hem its color was a pale nile green and the linen of the garment was so sheer that zenobias flawless body could be seen through it her firm and full breasts thrust the fabric boldly out beneath the great jeweled collar of gold inlaid with emerald lapis lazuli turquoise and amber upon her arms were beautifully carved gold armbands which were easily visible despite the floorlength cape that she wore the cape was an incredible piece of workmanship the lining clothofgold the exterior of male peacock feathers it was fastened to her shoulders by means of hidden gold clasps attached to her collar upon her feet were simple gold sandals her long black hair was entwined with lotus blossoms and the beautiful gold fillet she wore was decorated in front by egypts royal asp in contrast to his mothers barbaric beauty young vaba was dressed quite simply he wore the flowing white robes of his bedawi heritage but the hood of the garment was pushed back to reveal his strong handsome face the dark head topped with a magnificent gold crown standing next to his mother on the top steps of the portico he listened with impassive face as cassius longinus several steps down from them and dressed in an impressive white tunic intoned in a loud clear voice to the great mass of humanity who had crowded into the square before the palace behold egypt behold zenobia queen of the east and her son vaballathus augustus of the eastern empire three times the queens favorite councillor called out each time followed by a great trumpet fanfare the crowds cheered and shouted their approval of zenobia and her son longinus looked up at the queen and said so just she might hear rome will not fail to notice this demonstration majesty then let them be warned longinus was the icy reply aurelian was indeed warned and in far less time than zenobia had anticipated on the very day that zenobia had proclaimed herself queen of the east and her son augustus of the eastern empire a roman spy in alexandria let loose a pigeon the pigeon a small capsule attached to his leg flew to the city of cyrene where his message was transferred to the leg of another bird who flew to lepcis magna then to another who flew to carthage and yet another who traversed the length of sicily the last bird left sicily rested overnight at a cote in naples and within a week the message from alexandria had arrived in rome eagerly the emperor removed the message from the capsule carried by the last bird and a slow satisfied smile spread over his face as he read it it is good news caesar yes gaius cicero it is very good news praise the gods for creating women to be predictable the queen of palmyra has done exactly what i expected her to do and now we may march against her zenobia of palmyra sir but i thought she was our ally gaius cicero looked puzzled has she not kept the peace for us in the eastern provinces since her husband died why are we to march against her because my dear gaius the queen of palmyra has just seven days ago had the temerity to declare herself queen of the east and her son augustus of the eastern empire gaius cicero sought out his old friend marcus alexander at his new home in tivoli the queen of palmyra has revolted against rome and the legions will soon march he announced will rome prevail marcus rome must prevail gaius although i now question my own loyalty to a rotting empire gaius cicero shook his head it will take more than a war with palmyra to turn rome from the path of decay will you be going with the emperor of course then you will have an opportunity that i have not had gaius the queen of palmyra was to have been my wife tell her that i yet love her that my marriage is but a sham i was not able to communicate with zenobia after my return do this for me gaius for the sake of our long friendship i beg you gaius cicero saw the pain that lurked within his friends eyes he knew the cost to marcuss pride to have to ask even as old a friend as he to relay such a personal message i will gladly take your message marcus he said he was very surprised by his old friends revelation and for the briefest of moments gaius cicero had doubts about the emperors conduct in this matter then he thought of the good aurelian had accomplished in his short tenure as emperor what were the problems of two lovers in light of such greatness aurelian marched east his troops departing from brindisi then ferrying across the adriatic to apollonia in macedonia from there they marched into thrace crossing the water once again to dardanus in asia minor the emperor moved at a steady pace stopping to reassert imperial authority in major towns allowing the local officials to tell him that they could not be blamed for assuming that zenobia like her late husband odenathus spoke for imperial rome aurelian agreed nodding wisely laughing silently to himself at their quick defection from palmyras queen and levying token fines to impress upon them romes authority before the walls of antioch aurelian met in battle with zenobias general zabdas no one was more surprised than the palmyrans for they had not expected the romans for some time and yet suddenly here they were the force commanded by general zabdas was small the bulk of the army being with the queen in alexandria though they fought well and bravely against the legions they were overcome zabdas fell back to emesa leaving antioch to the romans but securing the city they quickly followed him and defeated him a second time at emesa his small force virtually wiped out zabdas fell on his sword ending his life but satisfying honor aurelian might then have crossed the hundred miles between emesa and palmyra securing palmyra in its king and queens absence and taking its regent prince demetrius prisoner that he did not he was to regret so far he had not lost many men to battle disease or fatigue and he was feeling invincible swiftly he moved his army down through palestine avoiding as many towns and villages as he could for surprise was to be his greatest weapon in emesa and antioch his authorities made very sure that no messenger escaped the city to warn palmyras queen they would meet in alexandria the emperor however was doomed to disappointment for in a quirk of fate the armies of rome and those of palmyra passed within a few miles of each other in the egyptian desert of gaza and neither saw the other zenobia having made her position clear in alexandria was hurrying home to await romes answer aurelian arrived in egypts premier city to find his quarry gone and what was worse the alexandrians were not one bit repentant of their support of palmyras queen in retaliation aurelian set fire to their famous library by the time the fire was contained many of its valuable books had been destroyed when zenobia reached her beloved city she found surprising news waiting for her the enemy was almost at her gates on the battlefield at emesa one palmyran had pretended to be among the casualties then waited until dark before making good his escape he had had no supplies or water to aid him but he was of bedawi parentage and tough it had taken him five days to reach the qasralhêr fortress where he told his story before collapsing rufus curius had immediately sent word to palmyra but how could aurelian have heard so quickly zenobia was puzzled the romans have been known to use pigeons to carry messages longinus said the message was most likely sent from alexandria majesty and aurelian has come himself she mused he will find that palmyras legions are not so easily beaten general zabdass defeat will have made the romans overconfident you dont propose to meet them in open battle majesty no we will withdraw within palmyra and then wait i am curious to see how long the romans can survive in our desert longinus send a message to rufus curius i want all civilians withdrawn from qasralhêr immediately and only a token force left at the fortress those who remain are to poison the wells and build upon the highest tower the makings of a bonfire at the first sign of aurelian they are to light the fire as a beacon to palmyra and men retreat it is easy to fight in the forests of gaul where the dew drips from the very branches of the trees but here in the desert how long will romes legions last without water with luck we will not lose one palmyran to aurelians armies the order was sent and soon the people who had made the qasralhêr fortress their home began arriving crowding the desert road from the west with their carts and livestock most had relatives within the city that they might stay with for those who did not the queen offered shelter within properties owned by the royal family word was sent along the desert road to the east that palmyra would soon be under siege and should be bypassed by those who did not seek to have their goods confiscated by the romans zenobia felt she owed this courtesy to those merchants in cathay and india who regularly did business with the city confident of their triumph the people of palmyra went about their business me city taking on a festive air for the wedding of the young king and flavia porcius after the festivities zenobia and longinus sat together getting companionably drunk on cyprian wine marcus has betrayed me the queen mourned why did he betray me longinus am i not beautiful intelligent rich a tear slid down her cheek what does aurelians niece have that i do not have then she giggled i shall ask him when i capture him longinus thats what i shall do i will say to him aurelian what does your niece have that lured marcus alexander from my side am i not clever longinus she was happily drunk her answer was a soft snore for cassius longinus had fallen asleep in his chair his goblet tipped from his hand drizzling sweet red wine across the marble floor zenobia watched the bloodcolored trickle of liquid as it ran slowly across the white floor she sighed again and standing uncertainly she reached for the decanter picked it up and wandered slowly down the corridor that led to her private apartments she awoke late the next morning and her head immediately regretted her actions of the previous night the bright sunlight streamed in across her bedchamber causing her to wince with genuine pain warned by her aching head and roiling stomach she did not dare to rise else she be sick she lay very still finding that the closest thing to comfort old bab hurried in her sandals slapping against the floor in a most aggravating manner so you are finally awake do not shout zenobia whispered my head pounds i am not surprised but there is something you must know the beacon from qasralhêr has just a few minutes ago been spotted burning the romans are coming the gods zenobia swore irritably today of all days aye they were ever a thoughtless bunch bab observed wryly come i will mix you a potion that will take the ache from your head and the sickness from your belly bab bustled out and zenobia could hear her giving orders to the slave girls in the outer room in a few minutes she was back again carrying a small goblet which she handed to zenobia drink it she commanded in a voice that brooked no nonsense and the queen obeyed within minutes the symptoms that had made her so uncomfortable were magically gone what was in that she demanded of bab it is a mixture of honey fruit juices and herbs was the reply let me help you up now my baby and it is off to the baths for you an hour later zenobia stood atop the highest tower of palmyra gazing west toward the qasralhêr fortress where the sentinel beacon blazed brightly even in the midafternoon sun on the westward road she could see in the distance faint puffs of dust made by the hooves of the approaching camels who carried rufus curius and his small patrol to safety in palmyra she stayed watching until she could make out the riders quite plainly and then she descended the tower and mounting her chariot drove through the city amid her cheering people to greet the riders they thundered through the gates which quickly closed behind them coming to a quick halt before the queens chariot the camels knelt and their riders swiftly dismounted and stood making their obeisance before zenobia it has been done as you commanded majesty rufus curius said the romans she asked at least two legions majesty possibly three zenobia turned to cassius longinus have them sound the alarm longinus so those outside the walls may enter before it is too late what of the bedawi majesty he asked they have disappeared into the desert she said with a small smile the better to watch for us he murmured with an answering smile and left to do her bidding zenobia returned her attention to rufus curius you have done well old friend and i thank you for your loyalty you and your men go now and spend the evening with deliciae and your children i do not expect the romans before our gates until tomorrow when they will attempt to frighten us with a show of force he saluted her and zenobia remounting her chariot drove quickly back to the palace throughout the city the echo of the warning trumpets sounded again and again as latecomers and stragglers from the unwalled suburbs hurried to safety within the gates arriving at her destination the queen hurried to the council chamber for a prearranged meeting with the council of ten she found them and both her sons waiting questions were fired at her with great rapidity and impatiently she held up her hands demanding that they stop so she might speak we do not expect the romans before dawn she said and then they will do one of two things morning will possibly show aurelian in full battle force before our gates often the legions sneak up upon a city in the night so that the dawn reveals their battle formation it can be a formidable sight the other possibility is that dawn will reveal an empty desert suddenly in the distance will come the faint sound of the war drums which will grow louder and closer as each minute passes as suddenly the romans marching in perfect ranks will begin to pour over the horizon until they are lined up before our gates both of these ploys are used to frighten a civilian population and so our people must be told in order that they not be afraid terror is the prime weapon used by the romans marius gracchus have foodstuffs been laid in as i commanded we have several months supply of grain oil olives figs and dates in government storehouses majesty we have spent the last few weeks buying livestock which will be slaughtered as needed and distributed when necessary practically every family in the city has some sort of poultry in its keeping palmyra is well prepared to withstand a siege of several months zenobia nodded the romans will not last that long marius gracchus she then looked to her younger son demetrius you have seen to the wells in the suburbs my men and i personally visited each house majesty and impressed upon the owners the importance of destroying the water supply so that the romans could not have it he said at seventeen demetrius was an extremely handsome young man far betterlooking than his older brother who favored their father demetrius was his mothers son with her dark hair a pair of languid gray eyes and a most sensuous mouth like his mother he was impetuous and passionate but zenobia suspected that like his father demetrius would not marry until he was considerably older there were too many delicious treats the prince wanted to taste before settling down she inclined her head in response to his reply and then she turned to vaba is there anything you wish to add my son the young king shook his head in the negative you seem to have thought of everything mother he said quietly zenobia threw him a sharp glance and then turned back to the entire council does anyone else have anything further to say she asked and the reply being in the negative she dismissed them stay vaba and he heard the command in her voice when the room was at last empty she turned on him furiously do not ever fence words with me again in open council she said why do you choose this time to quarrel with me you behave as if palmyra has no king mother everyone defers to you the council the people even the damned romans i am consulted on nothing vaba vaba she chided him the very life of this city is at stake tomorrow morning the romans will arrive they seek to destroy us do you really believe you are experienced enough to plan the defense of palmyra i am sorry that in all the tumult you have not been properly deferred to but there is no time i did not expect the romans for another three months and suddenly they are on my doorstep in other words mother they have already outmaneuvered you he said quietly yes vaba they have i am not ashamed to admit it i am human as are they and i learn from my errors if going to war against the romans is an error mother then all of palmyra shall learn he answered her rome has no business here in the east your father believed it and i believe it this war would not have happened if marcus had returned to you he accused i wish to the gods that he had for then you would have married him and i might have ruled in my own right you ungrateful little whelp she hissed at him you rule this city what a joke vaba my son what a fine joke when your father was murdered isecured the city for you for six years ihave ruled it for you and what have you learned from me my son you have learned nothing all you know of kingship is the bowing and scraping of your courtiers the romans are not to be trusted your grandfather was loyal to rome and what was the result his wife my own sweet mother raped and murdered by romans i loved marcus alexander more than i ever loved any man aye i even loved him more than your father but he betrayed me to marry an emperors niece i do not deny that i am bitter but i have not gone to war with rome out of that rejection for many years your father and i planned to consolidate the eastern empire and rule it ourselves now i have done just that i have but one piece of unfinished business and that is to defeat rome once and for all i shall do it vaba on your fathers memory i swear i shall do it when i have and there is once more stability in the region you may rule alone and to your hearts content i will have given you time to learn this business of kingship the way i have always given you time vaba do not be impatient with me or with yourself you will be a good king one day you loved marcus more than my father his face was a mask of shock disbelief and hurt she sighed and wondered if he had heard anything else that she had said to him other than that your father was the only man i knew until his death odenathus was chosen to be my husband he was a good man i loved him for he was good to me and he loved me in return but with marcus it was different i dont know if i will ever understand you he said softly rising from the council table and walking to the door at the entry he turned good night mother and then he was gone she sat for a few minutes longer but she would not allow herself to think she needed to free her mind mama startled zenobia looked up and saw her small daughter standing in the doorway to the council chamber her heart contracted at the sight for the little girl was so like her father tall for her age of five and a half mavia was slender with a heartshaped face marcuss startling blue eyes and long chestnut curls her skin was lighter than zenobias but still it held a golden tone what is it mavia she answered the child should you not be in your bed mama is it true the romans eat little children zenobia felt anger well up within her who had been frightening the child no mavia romans do not eat children who has told you such silliness titus says that the romans eat little children the little girl nervously twisted the side of her blue gown deliciaes son titus yes mavias eyes were very large and fearful come here to me mavia her mother commanded and the child ran across the floor on small bare feet to climb into her lap zenobia cuddled her close against her ample breasts and felt the little girl trembling titus is a silly little boy mavia boys his age like to tease younger children and you have made him very happy by being afraid if he should attempt to frighten you again with such nonsense then tell him that the romans particularly love to munch on nineyearold boys mavia giggled i love you mama she said and i love you my darling i love you best of all zenobia rose up her daughter still in her arms i am going to take you to your bed my chick she left the council room and carried her daughter through the palace corridors back to the childs own rooms you must not be afraid mavia she said as she walked the sound of battle is noisy and can sometimes be frightening but the romans cannot enter palmyra and they will not hurt you i promise mavia nodded and whispered yes mama reaching mavias rooms the queen handed her now sleepy child over to her nurse kissing mavias cheek she said to the nurse you will remain in the palace until further notice charmian mavia is only to be allowed to play in the inner gardens yes majesty the slave woman murmured zenobia hurried to her own apartments where bab was waiting i have dismissed your butterflies the old woman announced how well you know me old friend zenobia said i do want to be alone this night what can i bring you to eat my baby anything simple and something to drink wine the old woman inquired mischievously never again zenobia said fervently fruit juice will be quite nice thank you bab bab exited to return a few minutes later with a heavily laden tray which she placed on a low ebony table the gods grant you sweet repose and a clear mind my baby she said as she left the room the queen shrugged out of her kalasiris and crossed the room out into her private garden there a pool warmed by the lateafternoon sun beckoned invitingly diving in she swam for some minutes until her body grew tired and began to relax climbing out and taking a large linen towel she began to dry herself off as she did so zenobia carefully scrutinized her body and did not find it wanting her large breasts were as firm as when she had been a girl her belly flat despite three children her bottom rounded and not overly large there was nothing that should be displeasing to a man why then had he left her the gods she swore aloud how deeply he had hurt her he had probably returned to his own world and seeing about him all those proper roman wives had finally desired one of his own he had been ready to marry and unable to publicly claim mavia had longed for children of his own sitting by the pool she wondered once more why he had not written to her and then she laughed ruefully how could he possibly have explained his actions to her on dry parchment after all that had passed between them still to find out in the manner in which she had was cruel and she would not have thought him a cruel man dear longinus it was he who had first learned of marcuss betrayal in a letter from his former pupil porphyry who now studied in rome with plotinus longinus did not wait for the gossip to reach her but quickly joined her in alexandria leaving prince demetrius in the capable hands of marius gracchus longinus her dear and good friend her loyal councillor had known how devastated she would be longinus who had held her in his arms while she cried away the first hurt what would she ever do without longinus she would never have to wonder zenobia realized for longinus was the one man other than her father and her brothers upon whom she might rely the afternoon became desert twilight and then quickly night the dark skies sparkled with thousands of bright stars casting their lights upon palmyra as they had for all the centuries since time began she loved them for their beauty and she loved them because they were constant and neverchanging should not a relationship between lovers be a constant thing or was she simply idealizing love standing up she flung the towel aside and walked back into her chamber where she put on a simple long naturalcolored soft cotton gown she then began to examine the tray that bab had left her upon it were very thin slices of chicken breast and baby lamb alternating with equally thin slices of pomegranate a woven round basket a hot stone within its bottom held small flat loaves of bread there was a salad of lettuce and tiny fresh peas that had been dressed in olive oil and herbed vinegar and a footed silver bowl that held a small bunch of plump green grapes and half a dozen fat apricots a matching tall silver pitcher was filled with cool juice zenobias appetite had never been a poor one and she fell upon the meal devouring it thoroughly afterward she bathed her hands in rose water and went again out into her private garden where she once more began to think the moonless night was unnaturally quiet and she wondered if the romans were already before her gates or if they would choose to come by daylight she somehow thought the latter and knew that she would not have long to wait it was a strangely comforting thought she would be glad to begin this confrontationthe sooner to get it over with the queen retired to her empty bed to sleep a dreamless sleep for one night she was not haunted by his face with its deep blue eyes nor the sound of his voice promising to return to her in the hour just before the dawn old bab gently shook her mistress awake and offered a goblet of sweet pomegranate juice zenobia lay quietly allowing her spirit to return to her body after its long night of roaming within the shadow realm finally she asked are they here yet not a sign my baby she sipped at her juice is the city calm for the most part the old woman answered the people are like a virgin going to her wedding couch a little frightened but sure that all will be well it is natural the queen said she put the empty goblet down today i must dress like the queen i am bab it will hearten the people and the romans will expect it i will be on the walls awaiting them and afterward i shall roam the city to assure my people bab nodded i expected you would wear your finest feathers my baby all is in readiness for you this very minute i have personally chosen your wardrobe you have only to pick your jewels show me bab clapped her hands and instantly a slave girl appeared carefully holding out for zenobias approval a kalasiris made of a cobwebsheer linen cloth that had been interwoven with very thin strands of finely beaten gold the sleeveless gown had been skillfully constructed in narrow pleats from its round high neck to the anklelength hem zenobia nodded her approval and after bathing her face and hands in a basin held by a slave girl she rose from her bed holding out her arms swiftly bab removed her simple sleeping gown and taking the kalasiris from the slave dropped it over the queens head zenobia walked across her bedchamber to stand before the enormous fulllength polished silver mirror adria she commanded the slave bring my jewel caskets the girl scurried off and the queen said to bab your choice is a perfect one old woman bab smiled broadly adria returned balancing several jewel caskets in her arms fetch me the soft gold leather belt for this zenobia asked bab as she began opening the jewel boxes carefully she studied the contents of each box removing the upper trays in order to see what lay beneath swiftly she closed several lids down and said to adria remove these boxes i do not choose to wear silver today here is the belt you desire bab said carefully fastening it about zenobias slender waist the wide belt was made of soft kidskin overlaid with twelve layers of gold leaf over which were sewn tiny beads of fine gold and palepink rock quartz the front of the belt rose up to a narrow peak that ended just below her breasts the queen now began to choose her jewelry from one jewel box came two wide gold armbands with raised designs which bab fastened about each of zenobias upper arms around her wrists the queen slipped on several gold bangles some plain some with blue persian lapis some with rose quartz into her earlobes she fastened enormous diamonds pale pink in color which had come to her from mines located far to the south they dangled sparkling from their thin gold wires rings bab asked no was the reply they will not be close enough to see them she thought a moment as bab made to close the ring casket wait perhaps just a ruby on this hand and the matching pink diamond on the other if i use my hands to punctuate a point they will sparkle and add effect necklaces bab inquired no but i think one of those marvelous jeweled collars adria majesty do we not have a gold collar inlaid with rubies and rose quartz and small diamonds yes majesty shall i fetch it zenobia nodded and adria quickly complied returning to fasten the exquisite collar about the queens neck it lay flat upon her chest the alternating jewels just above her full breasts zenobia smiled with satisfaction brush my hair out bab and then let us place upon my head that elegant small circlet of beaten gold vine leaves that has the long gold ribbons sewn with brilliants bab nodded vigorously and instructed adria where the circlet might be found when zenobias long black hair had been brushed silken smooth bab placed the wreath of golden vine leaves atop her mistresss head and carefully arranged the ribbons out behind her then she stepped back and nodded again it is perfect my baby you are a queen come now old woman i must hurry i would be on the walls to greet our visitors giving her old nurse a quick hug zenobia hurried from her apartments and through the palace to its main courtyard where her magnificent gold chariot with its four coalblack horses waited she could see vaba and flavia coming down the path from the tiny palace within the larger palace gardens she had given them the house that odenathus had given her as a wedding gift those long years ago since his death she had been unable to live in it again and she believed that the newly married couple would enjoy their privacy as she and hawk had enjoyed theirs flavia of course had accepted the gift in the spirit in which zenobia had intended it but vaba had sarcastically asked if she was attempting to keep him from his palace only sweet flavias quick intervention had saved the bridegroom from his furious mother good morning aunt zenobia flavia said going to the queen and giving her a loving kiss on the cheek zenobia couldnt help but smile her new daughterinlaw the child of her two friends antonius porcius and his julia was a dear girl and she had to admit the perfect wife for vaba good morning my dearest she answered flavia good morning vaba good morning mother have the romans been sighted yet if they have i have not been told vaba come my son let us hurry to the walls and be prepared to greet our guests unwelcome though they may be flavia would you come with us may i of course child you are palmyras queen oh no aunt zenobia you are palmyras queen i am only vabas wife and it is all i seek to be zenobia threw her son an arch look and then put a loving arm about flavia we are both palmyras queens let us go if we are going vaba said impatiently very well his mother replied climbing without any help up into her chariot i will drive vaba your hand is too heavy on my horses mouths besides i think flavia would enjoy being held by her husband rather than clinging to the handhold for dear life for once vaba did not disagree with his mother and flavia colored becomingly zenobia smiled to herself remembering how it had been to ride with odenathuss arm tight about her she looked over at the pair as she started the horses off and thought how pretty flavia was she was a small girl her delicate build belying her great strength of character her eyes were a clear amber in color her hair a lovely golden brown her skin tones peachlike all of her featuresa round face with wellspaced eyes a turnedup nose and a coralcolored generous mouth had combined to form a most pleasing appearance her neck was slender and graceful and she had a way of holding her head that gave her a presence usually associated with taller people she was intelligent and had a kind heart both of which zenobia thanked the gods for because had vaba chosen simply a pretty but vapid girl the results would have been disastrous as it was still early the broad streets of palmyra were empty and it was but comfortably mild in temperature a light wind teased at both zenobias gold kalasiris and flavias paleblue tunic dress as they reached the walls of the city the activity increased the military in control of the streets leading to the walls the populace cheered zenobia and her family as the chariot thundered by them and a faint proud smile touched the queens lips reaching the walls of the city zenobia brought her vehicle to a halt and leapt out without waiting for vaba and flavia striding to the narrow steps built into the thick walls she began climbing at the top she was greeted by a captain in her personal guard and her younger son prince demetrius good morning demi captain tigranes she said any sign not yet mother longinus is here over there mother the king had reached the ramparts with his young wife zenobia moved down the ramparts to stand with longinus here i am again rousing you early in the morning the queen teased her chief councillor one of the hazards of being in your employ majesty he chuckled together they stood looking out across the desert that surrounded the oasis city of palmyra the wind had blown the sands into small wavelike ripples so that the city appeared to be an island amid a vast golden sea behind them the sky flung out dawn streamers of scarlet and coral mauve and pink burnished copper and narrow bands of dark purple edged in palest green to the west it was yet dark with one lone and cold star gleaming ominously down upon all there was no wind all was very still looking about her zenobia saw that the ramparts along the walls were now crowded not only with soldiers but with palmyras citizens who had come to see the arrival of their unwelcome guests the sun began to spill over the horizon and suddenly very faintly from the distance came the sound of drums and marching feet zenobia turned to longinus and her sons did i not tell you she said they are exactly on timesunrisewith their booming drums and stamping feet all calculated to put abject fear into the hearts of the citizenry you cannot blame them for lack of originality longinus said wryly this has always worked for them and the romans are not a people easily persuaded to try something new all along the walls the citizens chattered busily not at all impressed by the distant noise for had they not been told that this was how it would be now they watched curiously to catch the first glimpse of the enemy it was like some vast show presented in the arena the queen strained her eyes upon the horizon she could see the sun reflecting off a veritable sea of spear tips fascinated she was unable to tear her eyes away as the spear tips became soldiers marching soldiers soldiers dragging great war machines and battering rams across the shifting sands of the western road thousands of infantry urged on by officers mounted upon a variety of prancing horses how many legions do you think there are longinus asked i cannot tell yet was the reply closer and closer the romans came to the city walls until at last they stopped and zenobia breathed softly i count four full legions longinus aurelian wants us very badly but he shall not have my city boldly she stared down upon the army amassed below and suddenly the ranks opened to allow a war chariot through in the chariot was a driver and one man the vehicle stopped before the walls and in the great silence that followed the man in the chariot began to speak people of palmyra i am aurelian emperor of the romans i believe the archers can get him from this distance mother said demetrius no zenobia said let him speak i wish to hear what he has to say i come in peace i have no quarrel with the people of palmyra it is the woman who calls herself your queen who has rebelled against the empire give her over to me accept my governor and we will live in peace as we always have from the ramparts of palmyra came shouts of outrage and almost at once the spectators began hurling the remains of their morning meal at the romans the emperors chariot was forced to move backward the queen nodded to her trumpeter and a clarion call rang in the still air silencing everyone zenobia stepped up on the walls so that she might be visible to the roman army and its emperor behind her the sun blazed and with the blue sky above her as a background her golden garments and jewelry sparkled and gleamed impressively below the roman soldiers murmured superstitiously at the sudden appearance of this golden woman there were murmurs of the goddess athena venus no fools tis juno herself i am zenobia of palmyra queen of the east aurelian of the romans you are unwelcome here go while you still have the opportunity else the desert become your final stop on the road to hades woman you have rebelled against rome give yourself over to me for judgment and i will spare your city the answer to aurelians impertinence was a spear that sang swiftly through the air to bury itself in the ground before his chariot startled the horses reared but were quickly brought under firm control by their driver no one even the queen had seen who threw the spear but its message was far more eloquent than words you have the answer aurelian of the romans my people have spoken and as always i am an obedient servant of my people a small smile played upon his lips and he nodded almost companionably at her as am i zenobia of palmyra he said then it is war between us she answered it is war was the reply we have the advantage roman safe here behind our walls we are prepared to hold out for months are you we are without water aurelian you have no water i would have no innocent lives on my conscience so i give you fair warning that the wells serving the suburbs surrounding this city have been poisoned can you be sure zenobia was the mocking reply do you really think that those who expect to return shortly to their homes have poisoned their own wells what would they use for water then upon their return unlike romans palmyrans are loyal aurelian and they follow orders palmyrans are people like any other zenobia perhaps most of your people have obeyed but there will be some who have not and we need only one well to survive do you really think you can water four legions and all your livestock on one well aurelian do not be a fool you will have not enough water and without water you will die go while you still have the opportunity were not all the wells at qasralhêr destroyed they were indeed does that not tell you something she demanded he smiled up at her looking a long moment uponher incredible beauty before he spoke again and then he said quietly remember masada part three imperial captive zenobia looked down the table at palmyras council of ten assembled five to a side at the opposite end sat her son the king it has been four months since the romans appeared before our gates she said and what i have learned this day has told me that if we do not get aid from another quarter we shall not be able to rid ourselves of them before our stores run out before one palmyran life is sacrificed i must get aid what is it majesty marius gracchus asked what have you learned aurelian was correct when he said that all the wells within our suburbs would not be destroyed less than half of our people obeyed and of the other half most simply filled their wells with debris that the roman soldiers have been carefully removing they have more than enough water and their lines of communications and supply are totally unfettered they can hold out forever we cannot what must we do then majesty the venerable old councillor asked i must ride for persia when my late husband beat shapur their king in battle it was for rome perhaps shapur will aid us if he does and attacks the romans from the rear and we attack them from the front we can destroy them between us surely you do not propose to go yourself majesty i must our need is great and i believe that only i can convince shapur to join us who will you appoint regent in your absence majesty he asked zenobia looked directly at her son who sat unsmiling in his chair there is no need for a regent marius gracchus palmyra has a king and it is past time that he ruled in his own right i have been fearful that perhaps my son was not mature enough to assume his full responsibilities but his conduct during these months of siege has proved that he is more than ready vaballathus has my loyalty and my full confidence she smiled at him and then bowing her head said i beg your majestys leave to ride to king shapur of persia you have my permission queen of palmyra vaba said and then he stood and looked at them all i am your king but she is the queen remember it afterward when they had all been dismissed he chided her you might have at least warned me what you were going to do mother i wanted it to be a surprise she answered do you really mean it or will you take over when you return again he asked no vaba palmyra is yours but at least listen to my advice and let us work together until the enemy has been driven from our lands how will you reach persia he demanded the bedawi she said is that how you found out about the wells yes your uncle akbar and his sons have been camped just over the dunes playing the desert nomads for the romans they sell them goats milk cheese dates and women indeed they have become quite friendly with aurelian himself where is grandfather zabaai with the main part of the tribe several days to the east when will you go mother tonight there is no moon and i can safely slip out of the city without being caught i must not delay vaba we have barely three months supplies left even with strict rationing will any of your men go with you only rufus curius i would prefer to go alone to meet akbar but he insisted that someone come with me and rufus curius asked to accompany me she shrugged irritably they are a pair of old women both of them they were afraid if a stray roman caught me i might be assaulted i am not so feeble that i cannot put a knife between some romans ribs he smiled at her i have no doubt that you could knife a roman with ease and butcher him without a sound but i agree with them it is better this way she laughed a fine opinion you have of your mother vaba have you any suggestions for me while you are gone several she answered mischievously and then she grew serious rely on longinus first and then marius gracchus they are the best of the council the others have a tendency to be too cautious even my good antonius porcius my absence must be kept secret for as long as possible for once the romans know they will come after me i must reach the euphrates river and cross it before they can catch up with me we will offer the information that you have a mild fever vaba said and that you are keeping to your couch for a few days i will need three days you will have them mother she stepped forward and embraced him if i do not return vaba remember that i have always loved you remember that and remember the dream that your father and i always had for palmyra we wanted her free of rome i will remember he said and kissed her affectionately i do love you mother she laughed i know vaba and i also know that it has not always been easy to love me he gestured helplessly and laughing again she left him in the darkest part of the night zenobia left the city with rufus curius together they had mounted the walls on the eastern side of the city and been lowered down in the darkness by two of zenobias personal guard in silence they had skirted the city carefully avoiding the roman camp and their pickets to walk quickly to the encampment of akbar ben zabaai with a skill that amazed rufus curius zenobia managed even to evade the bedawis who guarded that campsite and enter her brothers tent unseen akbar ben zabaai came forward smiling broadly you have not lost your touch all those years in the city he said chuckling with pride this is rufus curius zenobia said he was commander of qasralhêr he is to accompany me are the camels ready they are my sister i am sending five of my men with you also no yes zenobia my sister you must be protected do not think you can keep this from the romans they have spies everywhere and will know of your departure quickly i only need three days akbar three days you will be lucky to get twelve hours then may the gods make your camels swift for they will be after you the bedawi can make up a rear guard should the romans get too close they can slay your pursuers your brother is right majesty i for one am grateful for the extra protection rufus curius said very well zenobia replied i agree let us go now without another word akbar led them out of the tent and to the edge of the encampment where his men and the camels awaited this is my sister he said and her aide rufus curius obey her for she is far wiser in the ways of the desert than any of you should you be pursued protect her with your lives her mission is to get to shapur of persia and gain his aid without it the romans will again control this region and we do not want that my friends zenobia mounted her camel and leaning back in her saddle kicked it into a standing position thank you akbar she said the gods go with you my sister the other men had mounted their beasts and the little party left the bedawi camp traveling east toward the euphrates river once they had crossed it they would be in persia although the palmyrans had beaten persia in battle there had been peace between the two lands for several years now zenobia thought that despite their past differences shapur would aid them for he hated the romans besides there were several valuable trade concessions she would give him in return for his aid the night began to give way to a gray dawn and dawn in its turn to a rainbowcolored sunrise and a magnificent day the sun slowly climbed up into the cloudless blue sky while across the seemingly endless desert the seven camels plodded onward finally at two hours past noon they stopped in the shelter of some tall dunes the sun beat mercilessly down upon them as the camels knelt to allow their riders to dismount it had been a long time since zenobia had ridden across the desert under a midday sun she longed to throw off her enveloping cloak but to do so would be to risk severe sunburn and dehydration instead she made a small hollow for herself in the sand within the shadow of one of the dunes and settled down to rest after a bit she accepted some lukewarm water offered her by rufus curius and digging her hand into a leather pouch hanging from her belt she drew out some dates and two figs which she began to slowly eat her hunger and thirst both satisfied the queen of palmyra slept for the next several hours it is time to go my queen rufus curiuss voice penetrated her wild and formless dreams zenobia opened her eyes suddenly aware of where she was i hear you rufus give me but a moment and i will be ready he offered her another drink which she accepted and then she rose and mounted the kneeling camel irritably the beast stood swung his head around and attempted to bite her foot quickly she escaped him administering a smart slap to the camels nose with her reins at the same time they are the most irascible creatures she muttered to rufus curius who then warily mounted his own camel it was late afternoon and still quite hot but quickly night descended upon the desert and zenobia was glad for her long black wool cloak during the long night they made but one short stop to rest the camels and to relieve themselves the second day was an imitation of the first but when they prepared to travel on the third night one of the bedawi announced we are being followed how do you know demanded rufus curius anxiously scanning the horizon and seeing nothing i know was the reply rufus curius nodded how far behind us several hours was the answer can we make the river before they catch up to us zenobia spoke with the gods blessing majesty the bedawi said let us go then hussein and pray that the gods are not fickle toward me now at the crucial moment she clambered up onto her camel throughout the night they rode relentlessly on toward the euphrates eventually exiting the desert and riding along through the lush farmland that was the great rivers heritage ahead of them the skies began to grow gray with light spreading slowly westward until they found themselves riding in a dovecolored gloom that allowed them to see the green of the land and the black outlines of occasional farmsteads and small villages the horizon was soon edged in gold and slashes of crimson also spread westward as the great round of the blazing sun pulled itself slowly over the edge of the world and began to rise upward into the sky the camels were tiring but ahead of them they could just begin to make out the wide greenishbrown ribbon of the euphrates as it wound through the great and ancient plain of sumer and akkad safety thought zenobia heaving a sigh once they had crossed the river they were safe for the romans would not cross into persia closer and closer they came to the river and then suddenly hussein turned and shouted behind us the romans zenobia turned in her saddle and saw with horror a troop of mounted men gaining on them she glanced over at rufus curius and heard him say too many for us can we reach the river she shouted to him possibly came the reply stay with me she commanded him i will majesty zenobia leaned forward and kicked her reluctant camel into a gallop the poor beast was exhausted after the nights travel and she had intended to rest him on the other side of the river for several long hours now the tired beast was forced to expend what little energies he had left bred for toughness however he responded and the river came even closer behind her the bedawi warriors dropped back to cover her flight and soon she could hear the fierce sounds of a short battle she knew me five tribesmen who had accompanied her would die in that battle they were pledged to defend her and mere would be neither surrender nor quarter given the few minutes that they would give her though could mean the difference between escape and capture then they were at the river bank and flinging themselves from their mounts the euphrates stretched wide and in midstream a small boat with a fisherman floated rufus curius called to the boatman a gold piece if you will ferry us across hurry man we are pursued by the romans he held the shiny coin up so the fisherman might see it and know he told the truth the man began to pole quickly toward the shore wade out as far as you can go majesty rufus curius commanded we cant waste time you arent coming with me i must cover your retreat majesty now even the moments count i will come if i can she looked searchingly at him rufus curius i thank you it has never been hard to serve you or to serve palmyra my queen zenobia hoisted her cloak up and tied it about her middle before she began to wade out into the river the water was sunwarmed the bottom at first sandy then muddy squishing through her toes she looked toward the fisherman shading her eyes with her hand and saw that he was getting closer suddenly behind her on the bank she heard shouts and rufus curiuss voice cried out swim majesty swim turning she saw him surrounded by almost a dozen men and then she saw him no more frantically zenobia flung herself into the water and began swimming toward the fishing boat behind her she heard splashing and knew she was being pursued venus mars jupiter for whom i was named help me now help me to escape them she prayed silently her arms moving rhythmically as she swam as quickly as she could ahead of her she could see the fisherman had stopped poling and was watching curiously then suddenly a hand grasped her ankle furiously she struggled to escape kicking out but she quickly found herself surrounded by roman legionnaires and weighed down by her heavy wet cloak she was powerless they hauled her none too gently back toward the shore and when it was possible to stand again they closed in about her their hands moving roughly over her body in a search for weapons but their real intent was quite clear the sodden cloak was pulled away and her short tunic was torn from her she was weaponless powerless one of the men shoved her backward onto the sandy beach loosening his own clothing in that terrible and short moment zenobia remembered her mother i will not beg she thought i will not beg halt you men the centurion of the unit came hurrying forward and taking off his long red cloak put it around zenobia who had quickly struggled to her feet i offer my apologies majesty he said quietly and then swung around to the men who had captured zenobia this woman is the queen of palmyra and a great warrior she is entitled to the same respect as any male adversary of equal rank she is not to be touched by any of you those are the emperors orders do you understand grumbling the soldiers nodded and the centurion spoke again to zenobia i am gaius cicero majesty personal aide to the emperor aurelian you are now a prisoner of the state she wrapped the cloak tightly around her and lifted her head proudly she would not beg where are my men she demanded in a voice that required a reply i regret majesty that it was necessary to kill them they were all valiant fighters i want to bury them she said tonelessly i will not leave them to be picked clean by the vultures and the jackals they were brave men and deserve that courtesy we cannot take the time majesty you cannot begin your return immediately gaius cicero you too have been traveling all night and need to rest your mounts this place is far more hospitable than the desert which we must cross again ask your men to bring me the bodies of my people and give me a digging tool i will bury them myself you cannot he began canshe replied fiercely and he saw that she was not a woman to be dissuaded she was correct they needed to rest after the threeday pursuit and the fertile river bank was most pleasant lucillus he called to one of his men bring the bodies of the slain tribesmen here for burial and send several men to that nearby village to buy food thank you zenobia said i will have my men help you he said no those who protected me are my responsibility gaius cicero it is my duty as queen of palmyra to help them to their final resting place never have i shirked my duty i will not do so now he understood and he admired her for such strength of character now more than ever he understood marcus alexanders great love for this woman he didnt think that this was a particularly good moment to deliver her a message from him and so he simply found a spade among their equipment and gave it to her wordlessly zenobia began digging heedless of the long cloak that opened with her efforts displaying her nudity to all desperately gaius cicero looked for the queens tunic but upon finding it saw that it was ripped beyond repair there had to be an extra one among his hundred legionnaires that would fit her he set off to find it posting a guard near the queen forbidding all others to come near her methodically zenobia dug one grave after another in the soft earth she was tired but worked on despite the blisters now swelling up on her hands at first the legionnaires watching from a distance had been scornful and even amused by her efforts but now as she completed the fifth grave their admiration was open the last grave was dug and zenobia stood over the bodies of her slain companions suddenly she looked up and her gaze was fierce who among you robbed these men she demanded furiously come forth now and return them their property they will have little enough to take with them into the underworld after a moment the shamefaced culprits came slowly forward and checking the bodies themselves returned what they had taken from the dead again zenobia spoke tell gaius cicero i want six coppers charon will not ferry them across the styx without payment a legionnaire detached himself from the crowd and ran to find gaius cicero returning a few moments later he bowed politely to zenobia and gave her the coins taking them she placed one between the teeth of each corpse suddenly a legionnaire was at her side i would consider it a privilege if you would let me help you to lower the bodies into their graves and cover them majesty he said their eyes met and she was touched to see in his honest sympathy not for her plight but for the sorrow he knew she must be feeling over her fallen comrades she graciously accepted his help at last the task was done and zenobia stood just a moment offering her silent prayers to the gods for rufus curius and the bedawi who had fallen in her defense suddenly gaius cicero was at her side gently taking her arm and drawing her away to a secluded spot without speaking he handed her a linen tunic turning his back as she removed his long cloak and put it on i lost my sandals in the river she said quietly i will see if i can find you a pair he promised are you hungry she shook her head in the negative no just very tired gaius cicero i am suddenly very tired we will camp here until nightfall majesty you may sleep in safety no harm will come to you while you are in my charge where do you want me she asked him tonelessly here would be satisfactory he replied but before you rest i would speak to you i bear a message to you from an old friend in rome i have no friends in rome she answered i speak of marcus alexander britainus gaius cicero said dont was her sharp reply i do not want to hear even the mention of his name centurion he did not betray you majesty zenobia looked directly at gaius cicero romans always betray those who trust them i am your prisoner but i do not believe i must listen to the pretty lies you have been told to tell me i will never forgive marcus never now speak no more to me of it her voice had been strong and even but he could hear a ragged edge to it and he saw in her eyes the most terrible pain she was close to tears which she valiantly fought back and ashamed he lowered his own gaze it will be as you wish majesty he said then he left her to rest zenobia pulled the long red cloak about her and lay down upon the ground curling herself into a ball her mind began to sort out all that had happened she had failed in her attempt to escape the romans and gain help from the persians she had been so close to succeeding through hooded lids she looked to the river bank weighing the possibility of escape the fisherman was long gone and the river was broad here but possibly she could swim it if not then at least the romans would not have a hostage to hold over vaba and the city to her vast annoyance however gaius cicero had placed pickets at intervals of three feet for one hundred and fifty feet along the river bank she smothered a particularly ripe curse and unable to think of another way sighed and put her mind to falling asleep when she awoke the sky above her was streaked in gold and peach and lavender the narrow ruffled clouds were pale pink edged in dark purple she could hear the soft sounds of the river as it lapped against the shore and for a brief minute she experienced a feeling of incredible peace then reality quickly surfaced and she remembered all that had passed there was a faint breeze and upon that breeze wafted the scent of lamb her stomach rumbled appreciatively and with a small smile of amusement at herself she realized that she was hungry except for some figs and dates she had not after all eaten in several days slowly standing up she stretched spreading her arms wide and tensing her muscles for a moment then relaxing again shaking the sand from the long cloak she set off down the beach seeking the cook fire she did not have to go far she regally accepted a tin plate with two smokinghot portions of lamb kabob from the legionnaire who was designated cook the chunks of lamb had been skewered on peeled sticks and interspersed with small onions and pieces of sweet green pepper would you like some wine majesty the privileges of rank gaius cicero a small smile lifted the corners of his mouth perhaps he answered her holding out a tin cup she hesitated for a moment then took it from him with a nod of thanks do you wish company he pursued her no she said shortly not even bothering to turn around as she made her way back down the beach he sighed what a pity he thought he would have enjoyed her company she was a beautiful woman and her reputation was that of an intelligent and witty woman he could understand though this was hardly a comfortable situation for her zenobia of palmyra had never been beaten before and defeat was never a pleasant thing at least her capture would serve one good purpose the palmyrans would certainly surrender once they learned that their queen was in the hands of the emperor a frown crossed gaius ciceros face he did not have to wonder what aurelian would do with zenobia the emperor had been like a young boy from the day of their arrival before the gates of palmyra he could not stop talking of her it was obvious that he had been quite smitten and aurelian had never been one to deny himself a woman who took his fancy shortly after sunset they departed the shores of the river euphrates retracing their steps of the last three days as they traveled westward back toward palmyra zenobia sat her camel stoically never complaining at the brisk pace set by gaius cicero who was determined to bring his prisoner before the emperor as quickly as possible there was always the chance that the bedawi would learn of her capture and seek to rescue her as they moved across the desert the shock of what had happened finally began to sink into her very soul why had the gods deserted her so cruelly in her hour of deepest need how was she to tell deliciae and her children of rufus curiuss death and what of the families of the bedawi how many widows and orphans had been made curse the romans curse them all yes even marcus who had betrayed her how she hated them and the hate was the first thing that she felt as she began to rise phoenixlike from the ashes of her first defeat i will not be beaten again nor will i beg she thought fiercely even if they take me to rome i will escape them somehow and return to palmyra to rebuild my empire odenathuss empire as the banners of the roman army came into view and their enormous encampment became visible as she saw the walls of the city once more she sat proudly upon her camel her head held high looking straight ahead finally they stopped before a large tent set upon a platform deep within the encampment gaius cicero was quickly at her side helping her to dismount and then escorting her into the tent as her eyes grew used to the gloom she saw a tall man with blond hair and a long elegant bearded face standing in profile by a map stand hail caesar was gaius ciceros greeting the man turned ah gaius you are back his glance flicked to zenobia swiftly taking her in i assume this is our rebellious queen yes caesar you may leave us gaius but wait outside i will have further need of your services aurelian now turned back to look at zenobia again and their eyes instantly locked in a battle of wills he felt his heart quicken at the sight of her for close up he realized that she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen she was filthy from her travels and her dark hair was dusty and matted but still she was beautiful she stared boldly at him making him a little uncomfortable although he would not show it finally he said you need a bath queen of palmyra you stink of camel she never even blinked instead her sultry voice replied i have always hated blueeyed romans and you do nothing to change my opinion emperor of the romans his narrow lips twitched faintly as he suppressed a smile she was not beaten and he was glad he wanted to tame this wild creature himself and by the gods he would you are now my prisoner zenobia he answered you speak the obvious was her quick retort i am your prisoner but it will do you no good aurelian palmyra will not surrender no why did you flee to persia i wanted shapurs help she said irritably as if he were an idiot child i needed an ally to attack you from the rear in a pincer movement you disturb the economy of this entire region in fact the entire world by this stupid attempt at war on us i want you and your puny army gone back to where you belong so the trade routes may once more be open you wanted to end this war because you are running low on provisions in palmyra was his answer palmyra is more than well stocked with provisions for a long siege aurelian but i do not choose to play with you any longer had i reached persia i might have ended this madness quickly now it is not to be very well and she shrugged i bow to the wisdom and the will of the gods without you your son will collapse once he knows that i possess the queen of palmyra he will open the gates of the city and we will march triumphantly in the king will never give in i am ready to die for palmyra aurelian and vaballathus knows it for me there can be no greater honor than to give my life for my city into his eyes crept an admiring look he could not suppress and he said quietly you are too intelligent and too beautiful to die so needlessly zenobia of palmyra i will not allow it you will not allow it her mocking laughter startled him what i will aurelian you cannot prevent how can you understand you are a peasant who has clawed his way up the ladder of the roman military i descend from the great queen cleopatra who was beaten by the romans he reminded her you will have another masada on your hands before you take palmyra from my son she threatened we won at masada too he said quietly a victory over a fortress of corpses she replied scornfully a victory nevertheless zenobia but enough of this gaius he called and instantly gaius cicero reentered the tent gaius take the queen to my sleeping tent and see that she has a bath his bold look told her what would come later zenobia drew her breath in sharply a slow smile lit his features and his light blue eyes danced with amusement for a moment come majesty gaius was at her elbow leading her away she followed him down the line of tents her mind quickly working aurelian lusted after her she shuddered he would have her she knew but if she must take the emperor as a lover then it would be on her terms not his he would expect resistance she knew and instinctively she realized that resistance would give him pleasure therefore she would not fight him physically but with her mind she would yield her body but nothing more aurelian might be a peasant but he was an uncommonly intelligent one he would want all of her he would not get it and it would drive him mad this was one roman who would not betray her because he would not control any part of her mind and heart rather she would control him gaius cicero stopped before a large tent and ushered her into it i will send some men with water and a tub for you he said and he flushed with embarrassment be sure the water is heated she said calmly i dislike cold baths and i will need warm water and soft soap to clean the desert from my hair and skin i assume that you have soap in your encampment gaius cicero of course you do the camp followers would bathe at least occasionally wouldnt they i will see what i can find he muttered turning his flushed face away from her thank you was her polite reply and he was quickly gone zenobia sighed and gazed around the tent it was divided into two sections the larger section in which she stood was simply furnished with a low round table where she assumed the emperor must eat there were several large seating pillows strewn carelessly about it there were two chairs set up in another part of the tent and some trunks but nothing more the wooden floor was well worn from many campaigns and spread with several sheepskins there were a few brass oil lamps nothing opulent all in all it was quite plain a soldiers tent without a doubt walking across the floor she pulled aside the woven woolen divider behind it was a rather large and comfortable sleeping couch but other than that the smaller section was empty it certainly lacks the amenities zenobia observed softly to herself she heard the sound of feet coming in and out of the main section of the tent and turned to see a procession of straining legionnaires lugging large containers of water into the tent and emptying them into a round wooden tub is there a respectable woman in this camp she demanded loudly the legionnaires stopped startled at the sound of her voice they stared openmouthed at her for a moment and then one braver than the others replied there are several good women majesty have one sent to me then she said i will need help washing my hair yes majesty the brave legionnaire answered i will fetch a woman immediately and he hurried from the tent zenobia hid a smile as she stood watching her water bearers the last of them gone she saw a woman standing in the entry of the tent zenobia waved her into the room what is your name she asked i am called keleos majesty what do you do among the romans your speech is of palmyra i am palmyran majesty then why are you not safely within the gates of the city keleos i am a widow majesty i live with my aged father and my son who is a cripple just outside the walls neither my father nor my child could be moved and so i was forced to remain in my home despite the romans could your neighbors not help you keleos majesty they were terrified and could not get themselves and their valuables into the city quickly enough they had no time for us i have a small bake shop normally i baked for my neighborhood but now i am forced to sell my wares to the romans i still have my father and son to support please forgive me majesty and keleos fell on her knees her hands outstretched in supplication you are forgiven keleos zenobia replied you did what was necessary to survive to insure the survival of your family the woman crawled the short distance between herself and the queen and prostrating herself further kissed zenobias feet may the gods bless you my queen she sobbed get up keleos zenobia commanded and when the woman had scrambled to her feet the queen said i would like you to help me wash my hair gladly majesty within minutes keleos had everything prepared and was washing zenobias hair with some of the soap that had been brought for the queens bath they used one of the extra wooden buckets filled with warmed water that had been left zenobia could feel the sandy grit of the desert as keleos soaped it free and with another bucket of water rinsed it away it took three latherings but eventually zenobias hair was clean keleos wrung the queens long mane of excess water and then taking a towel rubbed and rubbed the hair was quickly dry in the hot desert air thanking the woman for her aid zenobia dismissed her quickly she stripped her filthy clothes off and kicking them aside sat down in the round wooden tub laving warmish water over her shoulders taking a bit of soap she washed herself and then settled back a moment to enjoy a small soak and the solitude she wondered how soon he would come and demand her surrender it would take everything strong within her character to give him her body without flinching she hated the very thought of his touch for instinctively she knew he would demand far more than she was ever going to give and the ensuing battle would be exhausting finally she stood up and with a little smile realized that she faced a predicament of sorts she could not redress in her dirty garments and there was no large and dry towel with which to dry and wrap herself the small towel that had been used for her hair now lay in a sodden lump upon the floor stepping from the tub she reached for the towel and mopped herself damp the air would quickly dry the rest of her but there still remained the problem of what to wear she looked about the room there was nothing she made a sound of annoyance which was answered by a soft laugh furious and quite heedless of her own nudity she whirled about to face aurelian how dare you spy on me it is my tent he answered you ordered me placed here she snapped i should as soon have had my own tent he walked across the floor to where she stood and catching her face between his two hands looked down into her angry eyes the wishes of a captive are never considered zenobia then to her surprise he released her slowly he walked around her studying her from every angle but not yet touching her finally he said you were once described to me as the goddess incarnate but seeing you now i must say with apologies to the beauteous venus that the gentleman was not generous enough in his praise if i put you on the block there is not enough gold in the entire world to secure your purchase zenobia then i may assume you will not put me on the block she answered him coldly he laughed only because i cannot gain enough for you he teased i did not think you were a procurer aurelian your reputation is that of a warrior he laughed again you can fight like a guttersnipe goddess but it will avail you nothing i am aurelian and i never lose a battle you may have me roman for i cannot hope to overcome your physical strength but palmyras gates will still be closed to you she stood tall glaring icily at him totally unconcerned by her total nudity and aurelian was further intrigued and inflamed by zenobia this is a woman he thought admiringly you are a brave creature goddess he said quietly but you are still just a woman as i am just a man my spies tell me that there has been no man in your life since marcus alexander britainus left you to return to rome he was pleased to see her grow pale at the mention of marcuss name and he continued he was your lover and i do not doubt that he was a magnificent one my niece is already with child zenobias eyes closed for a moment and she clutched at the hanging divider to keep from swaying you are a bastard she managed to hiss at him he laughed pleasantly you are beautiful and i desire you goddess now he reached out with gentle fingers to caress her creamy shoulder stroking with a delicate touch watching while she fought down the urge to shudder which finally she was unable to suppress are you beginning to understand what it means to be an imperial captive goddess he asked her i am not afraid she said low i know that was his answer but you have caused me no end of trouble goddess and you must be punished for it so you will force me to be your mistress yes aurelian that will indeed be punishment she replied i am accustomed to choosing my own lovers again he laughed what a defiant goddess you are zenobia you were a virgin when you married odenathus at fifteen marcus alexander britainus has been your only lover you are an appallingly moral woman goddess half nay most of the women in rome have had half a dozen lovers before they marry you have known two men and it shall be for me as if you were a virgin take me then she cried half angrily half fearfully i will neither yield nor give you anything of myself his light blue eyes glittered with anticipation the tiny flecks of black and copper within them dancing wildly his fingers closed about her shoulder and he drew her to him she stood perfectly still neither resisting him nor accepting him as his arm went tightly about her waist molding her hard against him the hand that had been on her shoulder took her face between thumb and forefinger tipping it upward as his head came slowly down to claim her mouth with his with frightening expertise he forced her lips apart invading her mouth with a velvety tongue exploring taunting demanding i will show no emotion she thought but it took every bit of control not to struggle not to tear herself away from this man whose mouth was so insistent she wanted to run to hide from him for he frightened her although she would never admit it there was a look about him that said he would not be denied and in her entire life she had never known that a man could be like this she had always been loved gently as a woman first by odenathus and then by marcus this man did not seek her love he sought her very soul she had to stop him but without his knowing the terrible effect he was having on her pulling her mouth away from his she said coldly enough if you wish to couple with me then let us get on with it if she had hit him the effect would not have been any more jolting but then he began to chuckle and the chuckle grew into a rumble of pleased laughter brava goddess magnificent and it almost worked but almost is not good enough he set her back from him and studied her once more zenobia was shocked she had expected to cool his ardor by her disdain and she had instead aroused his admiration the next move was up to him so she stood silently sneaking a careful look at him from beneath her thick black lashes while she waited she had to admit that he was a very handsome man in a virile rugged sort of way he was at least an inch over six feet in height with a powerfully built body he had a surprisingly elegant head for one of low birth she thought it was oval in shape with high wellsculpted cheekbones a straight patrician nose almost classic in its perfection extremely sensuous lips a square chin with a deep cleft that was fairly well hidden by his wellcropped short beard the beard like his closeclipped curly hair had only faint touches of silver to mar its beautiful goldenblond color the wellspaced round eyes were sky blue with their oddcolored flecks and edged in short sandy lashes they were eyes that pierced but never divulged what they thought he began to undress help me with this chest armor he said briskly as he undid the buckles that held his protective plating call a slave she said i am at a loss for what to do with you he said slowly pulling off the beautifully decorated breastplate and then undoing the belt that held the strips of armor that hung from his waist warrior that he was he carefully placed the armor in a small chest for safekeeping then turned back to her his muscular arms pulled the shortsleeved kneelength red tunic off and this garment was followed by a naturalcolored linen tunica interior he was nude except for his sandals and leg shields sitting down he held out a foot will you undo my sandals i am not your servant aurelian you highborn wenches arent good for very much at all you refuse to help me undress and you kiss like a child i wonder if you will be worth all the trouble i am going to have to take with you then return me to palmyra she spat at him return me and then fight me like a man roman he looked up at her now free of his sandals and leg shields i am going to fight you like a man goddess and for probably the first time in your life you are going to have to fight like a woman she gasped outraged by his words but he continued therewill be no emperors or queens in this tent tonight zenobia just a man and a woman waging the ageold battle between men and women his eyes blazed blue fire at her and startled she stepped backward it was all the advantage he needed stepping swiftly forward he lifted her and tossed her over his shoulder he had made no attempt to be gentle leaving her helpless to struggle for she was too busy trying to catch her breath walking across the tent into his sleeping chamber he unceremoniously dumped her upon his bed and then flung himself down atop her trapping her face between his two hands i have nothing to give you she hissed you will before this night is finished he promised and then yanked her head back to his his lips claimed hers again this time zenobia struggled against aurelian as his mouth ground down upon her an unreasoning fear welled up within her destroying her intent to remain cool increasing her panic as her heartbeat accelerated violently he quickly felt her terror and suddenly his lips were gentle barely brushing hers as he murmured against them no goddess dont be afraid shhh shhh i will not hurt you she was unable to prevent the shudder that ripped through her this was worse she thought she didnt want him to be gentle she wanted him to assault her with violence so she might hate him even more with an angry cry she raised her hands and clawed at him forcing her arms above her head he held them there with one hand while the other sought to gentle her no goddess he chided her and then what are you afraid of zenobia give me some of the sweetness of your mouth beloved there cannot be great harm in that she almost wept then beloved he had called her beloved until now only marcus marcus who had betrayed her and left her to this man had called her beloved aurelian sensed the weakness and in that instant he descended on her again his mouth tenderly taking hers in a kiss so passionate and yet at the same time so gentle that she was unable to resist any longer her lips softened beneath the insistent pressure of his finding her tongue he sucked a long minute upon the tempting morsel then released her from the kiss zenobia was stunned by the sense of loss she felt why did she feel this way she detested this man and had a weapon been available she would have used it on him opening her eyes she found him looking down on her unsmiling his free hand came up to caress her face your skin is like silk he said softly and then his hand began a lengthy exploration of her body shifting his weight off her he released her hands and put the arm that had imprisoned her about her shoulders pinioning her as effectively as he had before but allowing him the freedom he needed to caress her a warm hand moved down her throat a hand she thought that could as easily strangle her as make love to her he read the thought in her gray eyes he dallied a moment in the soft hollow of her neck and she could feel the blood coursing beneath his fingers his hand next moved down to stroke the high swell of her breasts trailing leisurely downward between her cleavage a single finger teasingly encircled each nipple shocking them despite her best efforts to resist to tight and tingling peaks which he bent his head to kiss she could feel the cry welling up in her throat and with a supreme surge of willpower she forced it back he must not knowshe would not let him know that his hungry mouth now sucking on her breasts was beginning to elicit a tiny response deep inside her she could not understand it and it not only puzzled her it frightened her she began to tremble and tried to draw away from that insistent mouth slowly he raised his head his eyes were glazed with passion and something else she could not fathom she turned her head away from him so he might not see her fear you will not deny me goddess he said softly i will possess you no she managed to whisper my body but nothing else i will possess all he answered her you will belong to me alone goddess for never have i been beaten in battle and i will not be beaten in this one scalding slow tears began to course down her cheeks but no sound came from her throat this was what it had been like for her mother those long years ago pinned beneath a roman who demanded everything of her and took it without a care for her soul they had destroyed her mother but whatever happened between zenobia and this roman she would not allow him to destroy her no goddess and his voice was deceptively soft dont weep i will not hurt you i will only love you and he raised himself up so he might kiss the wetness on her face it was too much for zenobia with a wild cry she fought to escape him but could not fight her way free for his strength was too great aurelian laughed her confused and terrified resistance seeming to give him great pleasure he shifted his body once more this time to cover hers she could feel his muscular thighs with their soft blond down pressing down upon hers and to her horror she felt a great flash of heat suffuse her body his broad chest crushed her full breasts his mouth again captured hers in a kiss of such blazing passion that she could feel her strength ebbing away against the inside of her thigh she felt his staff lengthening and growing hard with his desire for her he caught at her tongue and began to suck upon the velvet of it again sending shock waves of desiredear venus it was desirethroughout her feverish body with that admission to herself it was as if a dam had burst within her unwillingly her arms went about him and she felt him seeking entrance to her unwilling yet willing body he thrust deep and she cried out her breath coming in quick pants her long golden legs wrapping themselves about him again and again he plunged himself into her burning and wet sheath making her cry with pleasure in spite of herself and then with a pitiful sob she whimpered low do not understand i do not understand he stopped in his rutting and with a roar of laughter he caught her frightened face in his hands it is lust zenobia sweet hot lust how is it that you have never before experienced lust he drove again into her and bending murmured against her ear i will teach you to enjoy lust my goddess to revel in it to yield to it his hands moved beneath her to cup her buttocks and he squeezed them possessively do you feel it zenobia do you feel the fire coursing through you lust it is lust and you have no choice but to give in to it give in to me the victory will be mine goddess as i warned you the victory will be mine shocked zenobia realized that what he was saying was true she had no control over her body at that moment ripple after ripple of pure sensuous pleasure was starting to wash over her and she had not the strength to resist it a tension was beginning to build deep within her and the force of it was so great that it threatened either to consume or destroy her she would either give in to it or die from it and as shameful as she found her situation she did not want to die the victory would be his whatever way she chose but she would find a way to revenge herself upon him this was only the opening battle in the war between them with a soft cry her nails dug into the muscled skin of his upper back and his laughter was triumphant with slow deliberate thrusts of his pelvis he began to move upon her again and this time zenobia pushed her own body up to meet him i hate you she snarled at him through gritted teeth but your delicious body wants mine he murmured she caught his head between her two hands and kissed him fiercely then finding his left ear she provocatively ran her pointed tongue around it pushing it into the cavity insinuatingly blowing softly laughing low when he groaned he countered by sliding his hands beneath her rounded buttocks and caressing them leaning forward his mouth began to play with her taut nipples licking and nipping at them until her breath began to come again in short quick gasps she tried to push him away so she might counterattack but grasping her bottom he drove hard into her pinioning her once more beneath him subduing her cruelly soon zenobia writhed mindless beneath aurelian while he brought her to the brink of pleasure once twice three times until at last she cursed him damn you roman give me release and he did climaxing with her with a sound somewhere between laughter and a groan afterward they lay sandwiched together for some minutes before he rolled off her and shortly she heard him snoring only then did zenobia pull herself into a tight little ball and weep softly into the pillows until at last she fell into a deep healing sleep when she awoke she found that she was lying upon her stomach caught beneath his hard arm she debated the wisdom of moving for she feared that if he was awake too he might want her again and zenobia was not yet ready to undergo another such battle you are awake aurelians voice decided the matter for her i am awake roman deliberately she made her voice flat and emotionless are you all right he demanded why should you care she countered rolling over then sitting up and dragging the coverlet over her chilled body you have had your victory havent you you won the battle between us roman what more do you want you he made the word sharp and clear you had me her voice trembled slightly and she silently cursed herself for the weakness i possessed the body zenobia but i did not possess you you never will roman no man ever has nor ever will she lied not even marcus alexander britainus he asked damn you aurelian damn you a thousand times over she said in a tight voice and she forced back the tears that threatened to begin again what do you want of me perhaps the truth will silence you once and for all very well then i loved marcus as i have loved no other man when he married your niece i ached not only with the loss of him but for his betrayal for i thought i knew him yes i gave myself wholly to him and i shall not make that mistake again each time you desire me you will have to force me and perhaps you will again make me cry out a surrender of sorts but you will never really have me and you will never be able to use marcus as a weapon in your war with me you cannot hurt me she felt drained by the speech but incredibly she also felt strong again he had lain on his belly throughout this exchange and now he rolled over and looked up at her how strangely naive you are goddess his blue eyes regarded her with a funny mixture of compassion and determination then quickly the look was gone and his glance was once again unreadable calmly he arose from the bed and turning said to her get up goddess i sent a message to your son last night and this morning i will present you to the city of palmyra as my prisoner they will have the space of one day in which to decide their fates they will not surrender she insisted then i will destroy the city about their ears was the reply they glared at each other each immovable in intent each sure of lightness finally zenobia said sulkily i have nothing to wear roman surely you arent going to make me stand naked before my own city walls a wicked grin creased his mouth a delectable thought goddess but no i rarely share with others what belongs to me late last night before i joined you there came into camp a querulous old woman who claims to be your servant your son sent her with garments and other things that a woman needs poor gaius cicero had a terrible time with her only when one of the bedawi women spoke to her could she be calmed i will send for them now aurelian dressed quickly and left the tent without another word to her shortly afterward he returned with two women the gods be praised you are unharmed cried bab tears running down her weathered old face as she fell on zenobias neck the beds coverlet wrapped around her zenobia soothed her nursemaid hush old woman as always you fret too much over me am i not the beloved of the gods aurelian however noted the concern on the queens face so he thought her heart is not entirely cold zenobia she looked curiously toward the other woman who threw back the hood of her robe tamar oh tamar is it really you it is me child tamar eyed zenobias garb is all well with you zenobia nodded quietly it is as expected she answered who are these women the emperor demanded she looked at him my old nursemaid who has always cared for me her name is bab and this she drew tamar forward is tamar bat hammid my fathers wife then you are in good hands and i may safely leave you he answered he turned to the two older women prepare the queen in her finest garments he raised zenobias hand to his lips and turning it kissed the inside of her wrist until later goddess and he was quickly gone from the tent for a moment the three women stood in silence and then tamar said quietly bab show zenobia what you have brought so we may choose from among her garments for something suitable bab shuffled to the entry of the tent and bending dragged a small trunk inside opening it she brought forth a diaphanous dark garment with a ghost of a smile she held it up saying i have chosen this for you my baby zenobias own lips twitched with delight are you becoming a rebel in your old age bab the old woman cackled i thought it fitting under the circumstances have you gone mad tamar demanded black is for mourning should i not be in mourning zenobia shot back i mourn for my virtue torn from me last night and i mourn for palmyra my beloved city i sense that this battle with rome will be to the death can we not win tamars voice had dropped to a whisper if i were in the city instead of here yes but i am not within the city and palmyras king my son is not as skilled in the art of ruling as i would wish i fear that aurelian will outwit vaba for he is a clever man then why did you turn over the full responsibility for palmyra to vaba before you rode for persia tamar was curious if i were not to return i wanted no misunderstanding among the council as to who the king was i can only pray that vaba will be the king his father was that he will hold firm even though aurelian holds me prisoner i shall pray to the gods if they have not deserted me entirely that he will be strong outside they heard the trumpets call and bab said we must dress you my baby soon they will come for you and you must be ready a few moments later gaius cicero arrived with a sixman escort that he left outside to await their prisoner zenobia greeted him pleasantly enough and unable to conceal the admiration he felt his eyes widened at the sight of her are you ready majesty he inquired politely i am ready gaius cicero was her calm reply tamar and bab stood at the entry to the tent and watched as the roman centurion and his men marched zenobia from their sight they brought her to the edge of the camp that faced the main gates of palmyra and there she saw a raised platform with a small tent upon it they led her up a small flight of steps behind the little tent and then into it leaving her there within the little enclosure aurelian awaited her he raised one blond eyebrow at the sight of her and then he chuckled thought you to irritate me by wearing mourning goddess i believe your gown an excellent choice for it implies defeat defeat for palmyra her heart sank he was right but she had not thought of it that way and neither had old bab she had indeed sought to annoy him by wearing a plain black kalasiris and no jewelry other than her royal circlet of golden vine leaves atop her unbound black hair will you allow me nothing roman she said low it is dangerous to allow you anything goddess we gave you a city and you took an empire you are known to bite the hand that feeds you zenobia her hand flashed out catching him off guard as it slapped his face instantly rage suffused his features and grasping her arm he brutally forced it behind her were it not necessary for me to present you publicly to your people and your son in a few moments he said through gritted teeth i should beat you never raise your hand to me again goddess you are hurting me roman she spat back not daring to struggle for fear the movement would break her arm the anger drained from his face and he released his hold on her i give only one warning goddess he said coldly stay here and do not move you will know when i want you he exited the tent and she was left alone to listen to the sounds whose sources she could not see she could hear the movement of many feet the undertone of voices and then suddenly silence followed by the flourish of trumpets which was answered by palmyran trumpets from atop sie city walls zenobias heart quickened she heard aurelians voice in the clear air people of palmyra i am aurelian hear me well i have now in my possession your rebel queen zenobia surrender to me and i will spare not only her but all of you and your city as well i will not impose fines upon you for the fault has not been yours but that of your overproud queen you have until this time tomorrow to make your decision zenobia felt her anger rise the cheek of the roman overproud indeed then she heard the voice of cassius longinus you say you will spare the queen emperor of the romans but surely you will not leave her here to rule in her city what say you who is that man zenobia heard aurelian demand of gaius cicero his name is cassius longinus he is the queens chief councillor not the kings i do not know he came to palmyra from athens many years ago to serve zenobia possibly he also advises the young king i can see the boy standing near him you could answer him without losing your dignity caesar your queen cassius longinus aurelian said will not be allowed to rule palmyra ever again she is now a prisoner of the empire she will go to rome to be marched in my triumph afterward i do not know it will be up to the senate but if the citizens of palmyra are once again loyal citizens of rome the senate could be merciful and who will rule palmyra roman was longinuss next query will our king be allowed to keep his place if we surrender to you possibly aurelian replied king vaballathus has never shown disloyalty to rome only his mother has liar zenobia thought furiously i know exactly what you mean to do oh jupiter father hear my prayer do not let my people be swayed by the silken tongue of this roman minerva great wise one grant my son the wisdom to see the truth you claim to have our queen aurelian came longinuss voice once more but how do we know that you speak the truth show us zenobia of palmyra so we may know for certain suddenly the tent top above her was pulled away and the body of the small enclosure fell away to reveal zenobia to all those who stood upon palmyras walls here is your queen aurelian declared dramatically zenobia knew that she would have but one chance and so at the top of her lungs she cried out for all to hear do not surrender my son i die gladly for palmyra at aurelians signal a legionnaire leapt forward to silence her by placing one arm about her waist while a hand was clamped firmly over her mouth zenobia did not bother to struggle she had said what she had to say and it had had its effect upon the walls of the great oasis city the populace began to chant her name softly at first and then louder and louder until it became a roar of defiance zenobia zenobia zenobia zenobia zenobia zenobia take her back to my tent the roman emperor commanded angrily zenobia pulled away from the offending hand over her mouth and laughed mockingly at aurelian we are even now roman you won last nights battle by brute force but i have won this mornings by better tactics then she easily shook off the legionnaires grip let go of me pig i am capable of returning to my quarters without your aid to prove her point she walked swiftly away gaius cicero looked at the emperor will they surrender i wonder he said quietly you see how she holds the populace within the palm of her hand the decision isnt theirs but rather the young kings the emperor returned irritably he will surrender if for no other reason than his mother told him not to my spies tell me that he resents the queen and very much wants to be his own man he will open the gates tomorrow wait and see if i am not right gaius the men are restless caesar what will your orders be for today i think it best that they drill for several hours beneath this charming sun it will take the meanness from them afterward they will return to their quarters where they will spend the rest of the day polishing their gear for tomorrows triumphal entry into palmyra only when they have completed these tasks may they have some time to themselves encourage them to visit the whores for i want no rape tomorrow when we enter palmyra a city of resentful rebels is not to our best interests i want to remove the government and replace it with our own people but other than that it will be business as usual in palmyra gaius cicero saluted the emperor it will be as caesar commands he said and turning hurried off to give the order aurelian sat down his legs swinging over the platforms edge the hot sun felt good on his body which might be lean and hard but was nonetheless the body of a man in his latemiddle years he chuckled to himself remembering the old men in his illyrian village sitting and gossiping together in the winter sunshine was he getting to be like them he wondered in his lifetime neither generals nor emperors were particularly noted for long lives and so perhaps he would not have the time to find out he chuckled again what strange thoughts he was having today it was truly a sign of old age here he was on the day before his greatest triumph and he sat like an old turtle atop a rock in midpond philosophizing in the sunshine he looked up at the walls of palmyra but the whitemarble barriers told him nothing of the beauties that lay hidden behind them it was said to be the rome of the east and there were some who said it was lovelier well tomorrow he would find out a wolfish smile lit his features zenobia was going to be very angry at the boy now the young king of palmyra would be making his first serious royal decision and that decision was going to cost him his throne yes zenobia was going to be very angry and he could not blame her for as a ruler himself he understood she and her late husband had worked hard to rebuild the eastern empire and now he would take it aurelian pushed himself off the platform and walked back into the heart of the encampment noting as he went that the centurions were already drilling smartly it was not to his sleeping tent that he returned rather aurelian hurried to his main tent where the business of the empire awaited him durantis his secretary was already hard at work opening the dispatches and separating them into piles according to their importance good morning durantis any emergencies no caesar nothing serious anything personal a letter from the empress ulpia she writes that although she is well your niece carissa is not the late months of the young ladys pregnancy do not seem to agree with her any mention of my nieces husband marcus alexander no caesar well let us get to work then on the correspondence the emperor said i have plans for the afternoon hours he settled himself in a chair and began to dictate rapidly to the wheezing scribe who sat at a side table while durantis murmured small asides and reminders into his ear in aurelians sleeping tent zenobia was busily talking to bab and tamar what was his state of mind when you left him bab she demanded of her old nursemaid he was very distressed by your capture majesty and quite worried as to what he should do the lady flavia never left his side good for flavia zenobia remarked she is stronger than her sweet appearance would tell he must not surrender he is not you my dear tamar said with an air of finality and he is not odenathus either if he does not surrender your life could be forfeit palmyrans would follow you anywhere zenobia they would starve themselves to death and murder their children to please you but you have not the right to ask them my dear you cannot repay their loyalty with death and destruction you have lost this war do not drag palmyra and all its peoples into the war you wage within yourself old bab drew her breath in sharply tamars words had been a truth that no one else had ever spoken to zenobia but the beautiful queen tossed her dark head angrily and replied my only war is with rome from the day that they killed my mother rome has been my enemy if vaba opens the gates to them he is no son of mine i will fight the romans till my death is there no reasoning with you zenobia since you learned of marcuss marriage this hatred of yours has been a burning spur to drive you onward toward your own destruction no do not glower at me everyone but you sees it i am here with bab because your father asked it of me he will not live much longer zenobia and his greatest fear is that you will ruin all that odenathus worked so hard for and by your own impetuous and stubborn acts steal vabas heritage from him you are his favorite child my dear and all zabaai ever wanted for his daughter was that she be happy happiness zenobias laugh was harsh there is no such thing tamar there is survival which goes to the victorious to the wisest the wealthy the clever the strong with survival one may gain a measure of peace but that is all do not be cynical with me tamar snapped her good nature and patience coming to an end you are a disciplined woman use that selfdiscipline now if not for your own sake men for the sake of those who love and care for you she put a loving arm about zenobia and for a brief moment it was as it had been so long ago in that other time when everything had been so simple and there was no marcus alexander britainus then zenobia shook tamars arm from her shoulders and said i can promise nothing tamar go back to my father and tell him that i love him it is the best i can offer with a sigh tamar kissed zenobia upon the forehead and with bab to escort her safely through the encampment back to the tents of her son akbar she left the queen to her solitude furious zenobia looked for something to throw but aurelians spare quarters offered nothing frustrating her further and she burst into tears she was horrified at her own actions but she could not stop the copious flow that poured from her eyes and down her cheeks streaking them with hot salt it was as if all the sorrow the pain and the disappointment of the last months was finally purging itself in the heat of the afternoon aurelian returned to his own quarters with the idea of pleasuring himself once again with his beautiful captive he was hardly prepared for the sight that greeted him zenobia lay upon her back on the couch her exquisite golden body gleaming temptingly through the sheer black silk of her kalasiris one arm flung protectively over her eyes the other by her side the hand curled into a fist one leg was up the other stretched straight the evidence of weeping was plain upon her face and for the briefest moment aurelian felt pity for the brave queen she had been but this was a woman as he liked them pliant and helpless he sat beside her she opened her silvery eyes with their black and gold flecks and the hatred leapt forth to scald him what do you want she hissed venomously in an instant aurelians compassion vanished and reaching forward to hook his fingers into the neck of her gown he ripped it in two with a swift motion i wouldnt think after last night goddess that you would have to ask me that question he replied mockingly and when she attempted to rise he held her down a cruel arm across her throat effectively pinning her while his other hand began a leisurely exploration of her magnificent breasts she lay mutinous her fury quite evident while he played with the full silken orbs zenobias nipples had always been sensitive and now she quivered as he rolled first one and then the other between his thumb and his forefinger you will soon bore me if you are so quick to passion goddess he mocked her and then he laughed for if looks could slay men he knew he should lie this minute cold and lifeless upon the floor of his tent pig of a peasant she snarled at him is force the only way you can have a woman you were quick enough to beg for release last night he countered looking down into her angry eyes did you not teach me that it was lust roman he chuckled lust may generate your desire goddess but the results are the same as if you loved me you yield with a shriek of outrage she began a struggle against him quickly he removed his arm from across her throat and catching her hands yanked them above her head as he bent to kiss her she tried to bite him but he only laughed and bent again to kiss her passionately his warm lips pressing hungrily upon hers and forcing them apart so that he could run his tongue across her clenched teeth and murmur against her mouth soft entreaties all the while seductively fondling her breasts she fought desperately trying to avoid the tingle deep within her that now began to fight its way to the surface of her consciousness regardless of her struggle to avoid it she fought desperate to avoid this strange emotion that he called lust an emotion that seemed to control her very thoughts he was enjoying their battle for he understood the war that she now fought within herself he knew that he had simply to persevere for she was by nature an extremely passionate woman and she would not give up at the first breach in her defenses she would fight on until he plunged deep within her warm wet body until she climaxed beneath him a curse upon her lips for him and strangely the prospect excited him more than if she had yielded to him without a struggle he would never really tame her he knew now but eventually she would stop resisting him beneath him zenobia fought to free one of her hands if she could just get one arm loose she might use it in her defense his big hard body pressed down upon her forcing the breath from her until tearing her head from him she gasped for precious air he used the opportunity to release her arms and catch her face between his two hands look at me he demanded of her in a voice she found she was powerless to resist her angerblackened eyes confronted his skyblue ones his knee forced itself none too gently between her thighs and then he was slowly deliberately entering her with a gasp of shock and a terrible fear she could not explain rising up almost to suffocate her she attempted to turn away no his voice whipcracked sharply i want you to look into my eyes when i enter into your body noher voice had become a desperate whisper yeshis hands held her head so tightly that she thought he might easily crush her skull she trembled mesmerized like a small bird caught before a snake unable to look away as he slowly pushed himself into her helpless body with deliberate and provocative movement he took her his blue eyes bore deep into her soul and the last thought zenobia had before she fainted dead away was that he was somehow taking over her entire being and she had not even the strength to protest instead she gave way to the rich warm darkness that enfolded her and took away all need for thought zenobia zenobia through the mists she could hear someone calling her name and with a small protest she struggled to return to the sweet darkness but the voice persisted zenobia open your eyes goddess open them still protesting she finally opened her eyes although the effort was a mighty one for her eyelids felt heavy before her foggy gaze aurelians face loomed and to her surprise he appeared worried now as she focused and he became clearer she could see relief etched upon his handsome face even tenderness i hate you she managed to say weakly and he laughed elated i thought i had killed you he said and a dead queen is of no value to me she struck at him futilely and with a growl of delight he gathered her into his arms and held her close be quiet goddess im not going to hurt you just be quiet now because she was too ravaged to do anything more she lay quiet within his embrace then reluctantly she began to relax soon she was dozing against his chest and a lovely warmth began to penetrate her chilled frame when she awoke she knew that several hours had passed for she could tell through a loose place in the tent that it was night carefully she eased herself out of his embrace her body ached in every joint more than anything else in the world she longed for a hot bath sweetscented and soothing to ease her tired and sore mucles with a sigh she knew that it would have to wait she looked over at aurelian he lay quiet his breathing soft and even zenobia studied the emperor carefully her first brief impression of rugged handsomeness still held he was surprisingly youthfullooking despite the fact that she knew him to be in late midlife about his eyes and very gently etched into the skin on his upper cheekbones were the telltale signs of aging still she thought a touch bitterly he was a damned satyr below the waist he hadnt bothered to remove his short red military tunic during this last assault upon her so she could see little of his body but where the tunic rode high she could see the beginnings of a scar along his left thigh from the width of it she suspected it was probably a spear wound there were several other smaller scars upon his legs and arms enough to show he had done his battle time but not enough to say he was careless even in sleep the line of his mouth indicated that he was a tough stubborn man rarely given to softness or compassion she shuddered remembering their battle of that afternoon never had she felt so so possessed or less in control of her own body and mind when he had forced her to look at him she had come totally under his control and she knew that he had reveled in her weakness zenobia vowed that she would not let that happen again the next time he demanded she look into his eyes she would appear to give her complete concentration but in reality she would unfocus her eyes quietly she rose from the bed and stretched slowly easing some of the tension from her battered body she was unaware that he watched her through slitted eyes for not once had his breathing altered to warn her that he was awake she had a fine body he thought despite the fact that she was over thirty he liked her long legs sleek flanks barely rounded belly and particularly her full but firm breasts he liked women with big breasts but often with age those fine breasts sagged ulpias certainly had as he watched zenobia raise the lid on her small trunk and pull forth a robe in which to clothe herself he wondered about carissa she would have had her child by now was it the male child she had been so sure she carried he also wondered whose child it actually was oh there was always the possibility that he had finally fathered a child but he seriously doubted it people liked to believe that his lack of sons was poor ulpias fault but he knew that it was not before his marriage he had occasionally kept a mistress and none had ever presented him with a bastard child since his marriage he had kept a steady stream of minor courtesans and certainly none of them had borne him children only carissa had ever claimed that he had fathered her child he was dubious but since he had never intended divorcing ulpia to marry his venal little niece he did not argue with her possibly the child was his he had to admit that he was curious aurelian opened his blue eyes and watched zenobia as a cat watches its prey he certainly felt sorry for marcus alexander but then to the victor belonged the spoils and he aurelian was the victor please carissa please help yourself and let us be done with this birth ulpia severina empress of the romans leaned over her niece and tried to encourage the girl it hurts carissa whined petulantly i know dearest but you must push the babe out how could you know you are barren aunt was the cruel reply carissa turned her head away from ulpia and groaned come ulpia said dagians soothing voice and her strong kindly hands gently pulled the empress away from the bedside come and have some wine with me the midwife will care for carissa quite well dumbly ulpia nodded and allowed herself to be led from carissas bedchamber and back into the sunny atrium two slaves hurried forward bearing comfortable chairs which they placed by the pool a third slave placed a tray with a decanter of wine and two chased silver goblets upon a low round table dagian waved her servants away then poured out the sweet golden wine and handed ulpia a gobletful marcus should be with her the empress murmured this is her first child ulpia you cannot keep up the pretense any longer theirs was not a love match if you do not know the truth then i will tell it to you now the emperor forced this marriage upon my son he was contracted to a lady in palmyra with whom he is deeply in love i know that however much you may love carissa you do not for a moment believe the baby she is about to birth is my sons they have been married four months and he has been back in rome just over that time she thinks her child is aurelians the empress whispered low and dagians eyes widened slightly she does not know ulpia continued softly that my husband is sterile never once in all the years we have been married have i conceived nor have any of his women her faded brown eyes grew wet with tears i had a baby once dagian he was a beautiful little boy they took him away from me that is why i was married to aurelian he knew my shame and threatened to expose it if my father did not allow the marriage she sighed and wiped the tears that had strayed to her cheeks you must not think badly of him he has always been a good husband to me respectful and kind he is a weak man where women are concerned though and carissa is ambitious i doubt even she knows the childs father does the emperor know you know all this dagian asked of course not in the tradition of this family i have all these years been the perfect roman wife i have ignored his women as beneath my notice but your own niece dagian was somewhat taken aback i am well into my middle years dagian i did not want to lose my husband and by keeping silent i have kept him all this time dagian smiled in spite of herself there were those who thought ulpia severina stupid but she was really quite clever but how can you love your niece when you know that she has betrayed you so disgracefully i cannot stand the little bitch was the reply but i will never give carissa the pleasure of knowing she has hurt me a terrible shriek rent the stillness of the house and the two women rose and hurried back to carissas bedchamber they were joined by marcus who had come from the study where he now spent most of his time within the room was a sweet unpleasant smell and the two women wrinkled their noses slightly marcus strode to the windows and flung open the shutters allowing in some fresh warm air upon the bed carissa writhed moaning and praying for release help me mother juno help your daughter to birth an emperor the pretensions of the vixen ulpia murmured the midwife took the three aside for a moment while her assistant aided the straining woman there is something wrong noble master and ladies the child was not positioned properly but i turned it still it did not feel right and the mother will not help herself the longer the birth takes the harder on both her and the baby she has lost too much blood already and i am truly worried can i be of help marcus asked sit by your wife and encourage her the midwife looked apologetic she is not an easy patient sir she explained i dont imagine she is he answered carissa likes things easy and instantly it must have come as quite a shock to her that the child has not leapt fully clothed from her womb marcus dagian was scandalized but ulpia put a gentle hand upon marcuss arm we have all suffered by carissas actions marcus she said he looked long at her and then with a sigh he sat down next to his wife you are going to have to push carissa he said quietly the longer you delay doing your part the harder it is on your child she turned her face to him but seeing concern in place of his usual mockery she relaxed will you stay with me yes i will stay until the child is born and you will accept the child as your own no he said i will not you must no one in rome believes for an instant that i fathered your child carissa i will support you both but that is all my uncle will punish you she whined and then she cried out again with her labor push he commanded her and she obeyed him for the child was precious to her it would guarantee her wealth and power for her lifetime it was the beginning of a new line of imperial roman caesars gritting her teeth she bore down she would be the mother of a race of kings rome would be at her feet and even this proud patrician who was her husband would eventually desire her but when he finally did she would scorn him soon soon she would hold her baby in her arms another pain clawed at her and she bore down elated to hear the midwifes cry i can see the childs head carissa was greatly encouraged now and from that moment on she strove to deliver her baby through the mists of pain she could hear them all driving her onward to her ultimate victory the pain was becoming worse as the child pushed itself forth with her help finally with a mighty effort she expelled the infant with a shriek and then she panted eagerly give me my son give him to me now they were silent why were they so silent despite her devastating weakness she struggled into a sitting position give me my baby she demanded why wasnt her son crying marcus alexander sighed and there was a look of pity upon his handsome face the baby is dead carissa he said quietly i am sorry no they were lying to her the baby couldnt be dead give me my son she screamed marcus nodded to the midwifes assistant and the woman handed a swaddled bundle to carissa eagerly she unwrapped the white linen stained brown with birthing blood to revealher watery blue eyes bugged in horror this isnt my baby she whispered in a tight little voice a voice that quickly rose to an hysterical scream what have you done with my child you are holding your child he said tonelessly carissa looked down for several long moments at the thing in her lap it had a head a head with a flatfish top and a face with a grotesquely twisted mouth at the base of the neck the things body divided itself into two sets of shoulders which sprouted between them three arms three legs and two sets of fully developed genitals the umbilical cord was wrapped tightly about the unfortunate infants neck and its whole body had a bluish cast with a horrified shriek carissa flung the thing from her lap and screamed at marcus it is your fault you cursed me you cursed me then she gasped twice and suddenly a stream of rich red blood began to pour from her mouth while at the same time she began to bleed heavily from between her legs it was over so quickly that the spectators hardly had time to realize what was happening carissa fell back she was quite obviously dead and with an oath marcus rushed from the room ulpia severina stepped forward and closed her nieces eyes before turning to the midwife and her assistant to say you must disregard my poor nieces ravings she was not herself in these last days of her pregnancy marcus alexander was a fine husband to her and she was fortunate to have him the midwife and her assistant nodded we have seen it happen before lady the sweetestnatured girls become totally deranged when told a child is dead poor girl but twas the will of the gods she began gathering up her instruments we will leave you to prepare her for burial lady the empress smiled graciously you will of course be paid double your fee for your trouble and we may rely upon your discretion with regard to the matter of my nieces unfortunate infant of course lady was the smooth reply the midwife bowed respectfully and then departed the room with her assistant lady ulpia said quietly call your slaves and let us prepare my nieces body as quickly as possible with your permission i should like to put her in our familys tomb rather than yours dagian nodded gratefully it would be better she said and i thank you ulpia call the slaves the empress repeated and then go to marcus now perhaps he may marry his true love aurelian will soon have palmyra safely back within the fold he is totally dedicated to reuniting the empire once palmyra is subdued your son may travel east and wed with his lady i do not know if that will now be possible dagian said the woman to whom my son was betrothed is zenobia the queen of palmyra oh dear ulpia murmured that does put a different complexion upon the matter doesnt it aurelian would be very angry with me if under those circumstances i allowed marcus to leave italy she sighed perplexed and then her face brightened well marcus will simply have to wait for his queen to come to him i know that aurelian plans to march her in his triumph when he returns to rome the queen will of course be an imperial captive but i shall see that my husband gives her to marcus aurelian is always very generous with me for i ask little of him and i have always been discreet she smiled at dagian go to your son and tell him that everything will be settled soon i will help to prepare carissa for her last journey dagian left carissas bedchamber she wondered if zenobia would survive her war with rome was she already defeated or had she surprised imperial rome once again by defeating them news took so long to get to italy from syria marcuss mother said a quick prayer to the gods that they protect zenobia of palmyra the gods however had chosen to be fickle toward the mortal who until recently had always been their favorite she had spent another night of unrelenting combat in aurelians bed and she wondered why venus had left him so long upon the earth the man was insatiable and apparently inexhaustible but then zenobia thought with the barest hint of a smile even the goddess had to rest it was a pity she could not the dawn had barely broken when they were engaged in battle of another kind you will walk behind my chariot he had announced to her as they rose from the bed shocked she had taken a moment to comprehend him and then she had spun about shouting never or i can drag you behind my chariot was the choice offered next then you will drag me she declared dramatically i will never enter my city in defeat you have not defeated me aurelian yes i have he mocked her his skyblue eyes crinkling at the corners with amusement what a stubborn goddess you are zenobia i have defeated you honestly both in the field and in my bed if you do not play your part today in my triumph then i shall not allow you ever again to set foot within your city how will you then spin your webs my adorable spider more important how will you guide your son her teeth bared at him and her fists clenched angrily she realized how securely she was entrapped she knew that he would not relent once his decision was made you will come meekly he demanded i will come he chuckled at the fine disjunction between his question and her answer a slave brought them breakfast and he noted with some amusement that her irritation had not affected her appetite she neatly peeled and sectioned a small orange which she then placed in a little bowl and covered with yogurt a thick slice of freshly baked bread was lavishly spread with honey and set upon the red arrentine pottery plate with two hardboiled eggs and a handful of plump ripe black olives totally ignoring him she proceeded to consume this bounty washing it down with a goblet of pomegranate juice then without so much as a word to him she rose up and left the tent he wanted to laugh but zenobias dignity was already worn thin and the emperor needed her cooperation to drag her shrieking into palmyra would not win the citys sympathy and even the young king might think differently about cooperating with rome under those circumstances he was after all her son for all her usurpation of his office he wanted her walking under her own power behind him in a gesture that all of palmyra would understand seeing her acceptance of rome the citizenry would then bow their own necks to the imperial yoke let her walk off her bad temper and come to terms with herself before his triumph had their positions been reversed she would he knew have treated him no differently let her be aware of that having settled it in his own mind aurelian proceeded to eat his own breakfast when he had finished he called for gaius cicero you are responsible for the queen he said quietly i do not believe you will have any difficulty with her we have spoken this morning and she understands my wishes completely you will see that she is in her place behind my chariot as i enter into palmyra yes caesar came the dutiful answer at the appointed hour the roman army was drawn up in full formation before the main gates of palmyra at their front was aurelian in his battle chariot looking eminently powerful and regal his gold breastplate with its raised design of mars the god of war in various victories gleamed in the morning sunlight his long red military cloak blew gently in the faint breeze but his elegant helmet could not hide the stern features of his face he stood tall erect quiet behind him his waiting legions shuffled nervously the emperor turned to see zenobia in her place behind his chariot turning away from his gaze the gods he silently cursed just to look at her aroused his desire she wore no mourning this day but rather was dressed as she had been the first day his army had arrived at palmyras gates those months back in her golden kalasiris she looked no more like a beaten adversary than a bird of paradise her collar of rubies rose quartz and diamonds glittered brightly its brilliance echoed by her golden circlet of vine leaves with their ribboned brilliants she was in truth a golden goddess incarnate and she had managed by her dress to change the lesson he had intended to teach the people of palmyra a tiny smile twitched his lips softening for a moment his stern features she had somehow turned another defeat into a victory for herself he would remember that he had once accused her of being overproud and by the gods she could give lessons in it he turned back to face the gates of palmyra and as if his look were a signal they began to slowly open aurelian felt tense he wondered if they would choose to fight at the last minute usually the walls of the city were crowded with spectators but this morning not one person was to be seen upon them he could plainly hear the creak of protest from the gates hinges as it yawned wider and wider once open the entry to palmyra resembled a gaping mouth void of teeth then from out of the entry came a man in a simple white linen tunic and a redandwhitestriped toga bordered in purple in his hands he carried the symbolic gold keys to the city with great dignity the man made his way forward to stand before aurelians chariot hail caesar he said in a loud voice i am cassius longinus the kings chief advisor on his majestys instructions i present to you the keys to palmyra where is the king demanded the emperor his majesty awaits you at the palace caesar the young queen was ill this day and as they are recently wed the king would not leave her side aurelian raised an eyebrow no wonder zenobia was loath to let the boy rule a king who put his woman before his position was certainly doomed walk beside your queen cassius longinus as i enter the city i assume your main avenue leads to the royal palace it does caesar longinus moved behind the chariot to where zenobia stood majesty he said low thank the gods you are safe by rights longinus i should be dead now but that my son has forgotten his duty he put a comforting hand upon her we will talk later he said and then they moved forward the roman legionnaires jogged along nervously facing straight ahead their eyes shifting from right to left the streets were quiet and empty the shops closed the people seemingly nonexistent an unnatural silence hung over the city as aurelian and his army made their way down the main avenue it was a wide avenue fully able to accommodate four large chariots the avenue was paved with interlocking blocks of black and white marble and lined with magnificent white marble pillars that supported the roofs over the walkways in front of the shops and houses driving his chariot at a sedate pace aurelian was able to take it all in he was impressed by the citys cleanliness and its graffitifree statues quite unlike romes behind him zenobia spoke quietly to longinus where are the people longinus at the councils suggestion majesty they decided it would be better not to show themselves when the romans entered the city not the kings suggestion he hesitated and that hesitation told her all she need know the king fears for the citys safety longinus attempted to excuse vaballathus please thank the council for me longinus i must assume that i will be kept from them has he said what he means to do about the government majesty government has not been the main focus of our discussions zenobia said somewhat wryly cassius longinus flushed majesty he gestured helplessly i know longinus it is the way of war and for all my rank i am nought but a woman in the eyes of the victorious general from rome he has not hurt you longinus looked concerned only my pride old friend and that as you are well aware is great i expect i can spare a small piece for aurelian to play with she chuckled despite my status as the defeated queen i seem to continue winning small battles she gestured gracefully and he smiled back at her the city would have died for you majesty i know that longinus perhaps however i have been wrong i have been told that i have not the right to ask that of my people in the end what is important that palmyra survive i took my chance with rome and i lost she sighed sadly and had he not known her better he would have sworn that he saw a tear in her eye they will probably exile you majesty i know longinus but if vaba can remain here to rule then odenathuss dynasty continues there will come another time another age another palmyran king and we will finally be free do you really think that the emperor will leave vaba here vaba is hardly a threat to rome his ploy of not coming to give aurelian the keys to the city because of the young queens indisposition was a brilliant stroke he has made himself look like a lovesick young fool who puts a woman above duty that should give rome a solid feeling of security ahead of them aurelian suddenly stopped his chariot and turning about called to zenobia come goddess and ride with me we both know it does no good for you to walk behind me in defeat if no one is looking to see your defeat you too cassius longinus perhaps you can enlighten me as to why palmyra appears so deserted he reached down to her and taking her outstretched arm pulled her up sliding an arm about her waist as she reached the chariot floor longinus was left to draw himself up by means of the handhold once they were all safely within the chariot aurelian let the reins loosen a bit and his cloudwhite horses pranced forward again the emperor turned his blue eyes upon cassius longinus well he said why is the city in hiding palmyra loves its queen caesar we will not be party to her shame aurelian smiled coldly palmyra has no queen he said and felt zenobia shiver in his tight grasp but when he looked over at her she was staring straight ahead seemingly unperturbed leaning over he murmured against her ear and the heady hyacinth fragrance she always wore battered his senses what sorcery is this goddess that you can arouse me without even seeming to try to arouse me you imagine it roman was her cold reply he laughed low and his laugh was intimate and insinuating implying things she didnt even want to think about or consider you are the most intriguing captive i have ever taken he said fight me all you wish goddess i know how to defeat you zenobia laughed scornfully you know how to overcome me physically roman which is not surprising considering your height and girth aurelian pressed his lips together making his face appear even more severe she had stung him successfully the royal residence came into view and aurelian had to admit to himself that the beautiful marble buildings easily rivaled his own official palace on the palatine hill in rome the entry stood open and the emperors chariot swept through into the courtyard the men of his own legion positioning themselves about the palace in prearranged order not all of the army had entered the city although part of each of the four legions had come and as they had marched through me city toward the palace centurias maniples and even full cohorts had dropped from each legion taking control of government buildings the great merchant houses the university rome was quickly in control in the courtyard of the palace the first signs of life were visible as slaves rushed forward to catch the heads of the emperors horses then upon the portico of the palace the council of ten appeared surrounding the young king almost protectively cassius longinus leapt from the rear of the chariot as soon as it had stopped and reached up to lift zenobia down without so much as a backward glance at aurelian she walked swiftly toward her son the council of ten the attending soldiers and the slaves all bowed before the queen parting to allow her a path to the king mother and son looked at each other and then vaba said with honest emotion praise be to the gods that you are safe mother for a moment zenobia closed her eyes and then a deep sigh rent her slender frame i would have given my life for the city vaba she said quietly it would have been a needless sacrifice mother we both know that dont we how can i be angry with him she wondered quickly he has done his duty toward palmyra as he has seen it and i was the one who gave him the kings power it is not my way but he is as steadfast as i am zenobia held out her arms to her son and he quickly stepped into her embrace i know that you are angry with me he whispered but they would have had the city no matter the cost i could not let you die mother i could not without warning the tears appeared and spilled down her cheeks perhaps they will let you rule still she whispered back hugging him tightly i shall take all the blame vaba i will not allow you to be punished for me and i will have no more gallantry from you she stepped back from him her beautiful face serious in her intent gently vaballathus brushed the stray tears from his mothers cheeks for my fathers sake he gently teased her yes she smiled at him and then suspiciously why are you suddenly so amenable flavia has indeed wrought a miracle if she has matured you in six short months of marriage i am beginning to realize what it is not only to be a king but a parent as well mother was the quiet answer flavia is with child then she really was indisposed zenobia was pleased but at the same time a tiny voice said that she was too young too beautiful too sensual to be a grandmother she was but thirtyfour then a sharp voice destroyed her reverie if this is your son goddess i should like to be presented aurelian was at her side zenobia looked up faintly annoyed vaballathus my son here is the mighty roman conqueror aurelian her gaze flicked insolently to the emperor my son the king of palmyra she said the two men stared coldly at each other and men aurelian said mockingly will you not bid me welcome to palmyra vaballathus i did not think it necessary was the quick reply you romans seem not to mind if a city welcomes you or not aurelian looked carefully at the young man there is a lot of your mother in you boy he replied thank you sir vaba was totally unruffled and zenobia was quite proud of him we will talk inside the emperor snapped all of you he continued including the nervously waiting council of ten with a wave of his hand cassius longinus lead the way gaius cicero attend me at the door of the main council chamber aurelian stopped and said to zenobia not you goddess this is mens work longinus saw the furious retort rising to her lips but before he might intervene the king spoke the queen is a member of the council caesar without her we cannot legally meet and we will not put in the whitehaired elderly marius gracchus if you would treat with us antonius porcius contributed then the queen must be with us caesar we mean you no disrespect but these are our ways we know that understanding them you will be fair aurelian looked at the council and seeing that they were adamant relented he had hoped to humiliate her with the government but by the gods she certainly commanded loyalty he felt almost envious of such devotion if it is your custom he said casually then the queen may partake of this meeting he entered into the council chamber and seated himself at one end of the long table you sit at the other end mother vaba said softly and zenobia knew that her son was giving his permission for her to take a leading role in the negotiations to come regally she settled herself nodding as she did so to vaba and the council to sit down aurelian noted all of this it seemed almost a shame to break her but as much as he admired her she was a dangerous enemy an enemy rome could not afford she wanted the entire eastern empire and she had taken it left in palmyra she would rise again he looked down the table at the faces turned to his and said palmyra is no longer a client kingdom it will return to province status effective immediately then the emperor sat back expecting the uproar that followed the council of ten was speaking all at once their voices raised in strong protest against what seemed to them an arbitrary decision they had expected negotiations the removal of zenobia even trade sanctions and heavy fines but not this they had opened their gates allowing the roman emperor inside their city and this is the way he responded be silent zenobias voice stilled the cacophony she looked down the table at the emperor you are overly harsh caesar he noted with amusement that it was the first time she had used his proper title and without sarcasm it is i who am at fault not palmyra do not punish the city nor my son rather punish me vaballathus will serve you well he is his fathers son before he is mine and my husband was always loyal to rome it was he who kept the eastern boundaries secure for the empire against the persians surely you will bear this in mind before you make a final decision it was as close to begging as she was going to come and aurelian knew it why should i heed your words queen of palmyra your son has not proven himself as did his father and he is young besides give me one good reason why i should listen to you zenobia stood up and gave the emperor a long slow look because i am palmyra she said quietly he was frankly astounded by her words but a quick look at the others confirmed that she had spoken from truth not vanity i will think on it he said this was a far more dangerous woman than he had realized better he spend a little time assessing the situation before making a final decision the council is dismissed aurelian concluded then he rose and walked from the room go with him antonius porcius zenobia begged you were the last imperial governor before we were freed of roman control plead for my son for your daughter the young queen for our unborn grandchild who will be palmyras rightful heir antonius porcius arose dutifully and followed after the emperor he had not changed a great deal over the years but zenobia noticed that he moved more slowly than she remembered and that silver was beginning to streak his remaining hair what are we to do majesty marius gracchus asked wait was the reply he is not an easy man i suspect that he truly wants palmyra to return to province status but we must prevent that at all costs vaba must be allowed to remain king perhaps not in his lifetime but one day we will again rise and the inheritors of odenathuss dynasty must be ruling the city when the time comes to this end i expect you to all work and if the people really love me then they will work toward this goal too but what will happen to you majesty i shall go to rome marius gracchus aurelian has already told me that much he will not i fear trust me out of his sight and he is wise not to she smiled at the elderly councillor given the chance i should do it again old friend marius gracchus chuckled with you will go our greatness he replied do not say that was her quick answer vaballathus is a young man now who knows what miracles he will accomplish in his time and what of those who come after him this city has stood since the days of the hebrew king solomon its founder and it has seen its share of greatness it will again she stood up i am tired she announced i have not slept well these last months but now i think i might she looked over her council i do not know if we will be allowed to meet again she said i thank you for your loyalty to palmyra to me and to my late husband i know you will give that same loyalty to my son the king long live palmyra then she was swiftly gone from the council chamber there was not one member of the council of ten who did not unashamedly wipe the tears from his eyes and then slowly each one of them moved forward kneeling before vaballathus to pledge fealty to him as they had done upon his fathers death those long years ago then each departed to his own section of the city to do the queens bidding it was not an easy task for the romans were everywhere and public gatherings had already been forbidden but slowly the council members moved in some cases from house to house spreading zenobias words the city must rise behind their young king in order to preserve the dynasty the queens day was done but the roman emperor must feel the weight of public opinion behind the house of odenathus zenobia had retired to her own apartments where she had a long leisurely soak in a hot bath scented with oil of hyacinth the queens long hair was washed and brushed dry so that it floated about her like a veil a soft egyptian cotton robe was slipped over her head and then she lay down upon her couch to sleep sleep came quickly the last thing she remembered was the bright sunlight of midday streaming in a blazing shaft across the marble floor of her room when she awoke a single lamp burned in the darkness of the room and in the gardens outside she could hear the crickets singing their evening song slowly she stretched herself one leg one arm then her entire body feeling the tension entirely gone she sighed deeply and then started at the sound of aurelians voice you have slept long goddess are you feeling better what are you doing here roman but her voice lacked any anger watching you he replied i like watching you in sleep it is one of the few times you are not spitting and snarling at me like a wild thing we cannot be friends roman she said quietly perhaps not right now goddess but i enjoy looking at you you are extravagantly beautiful like the ladies of rome great jupiter no you are exotic they are he thought a moment and then he said they are not exotic goddess as you are you are as fair as a dawn and as elusive as a soft desert wind why roman you are quite poetic aurelian arose came across the room and seated himself on the edge of zenobias sleeping couch she tensed and he said you are not afraid of me and yet he looked piercingly at her what is it goddess why do you grow stiff when i but sit by your side because i know what your sitting by me portends roman you will force yourself upon me once again to impress once more the imperial victory upon my body and soul her voice was bitter almost raw in its tone you still love marcus alexander dont you goddess she said nothing and so he continued he is my nieces husband and already they are parents it is a futile love you hug to your heart goddess let me love you her eyes widened in surprise you the scorn in her voice was fierce i shall never give myself into the keeping of any man ever again roman but you you love me what madness is this what of your poor wife who waits for your return i am a queen no matter i am a defeated queen i am still a queen i am not some poor innocent to be honored by the position of mistress you insult me your illustrious ancestress cleopatra was honored to be the mistress of two romans he said it cost her her life was the cold reply she put herself into the keeping of romans and in the end it destroyed her i will not be destroyed by youor any other roman i cannot destroy you zenobiaonly your own bitterness can do that was his reply you will be my mistress because i make that decision and not you he reached out for her but zenobia drew back and now she said angrily now you will once again rape me to prove the truth of your words i have not once raped you goddess each time i have made love to you you have wanted me to do so the only one you have been fighting is yourself i despise you she whispered half fearfully i hate you how can i want your lovemaking when i detest you so lust zenobia did i not tell you that first night you may not want me but your beautiful body does you are a woman you have known a mans love and you have known a mans passion neither of these things have frightened you why then should a mans honest lust cause such a turmoil within you goddess it is wrong she said firmly lovemaking without affection or caring is wrong who has told you these things goddess you are young yet and certainly your small experience with but two men cannot qualify you to make such a judgment he reached out for her again and this time his arm slid about her waist and drew her resisting body close to his i have never experienced love and yet i enjoy lying with a beautiful and passionate woman none have ever complained to me before goddess this foolishness is but in your mind if you would simply enjoy the feelings i can engender within your body you would see that i am right you are a wicked man she said softly i will not allow you to destroy me i will not destroy you goddess he murmured and his breath was warm against her ear the little puffs of his words causing her to shiver slightly let me love you zenobia dont fight me a hand began a slow gentle caressing of her breasts ah goddess my beautiful goddess aurelian whispered his lips moving against her soft fragrant hair zenobia felt his hands and his lips tenderly questing she heard the restrained passion in his voice and her soul seemed to draw back deep within her where she might watch him in safety she was despite her long nap still so very weary and she had no strength left to fight him opening the delicate silver filigree fastenings of her sleeping robe he pushed it back and off her shoulders he was being very careful very gentle for several long moments he simply sat and stared at her firm golden breasts as they rose and fell with her breathing then he tenderly pressed her back among her pillows and began to place delicate kisses upon her chest and breasts his lips touched lightly quickly moving here and there never lingering very long in one place i am a soldier goddess he said low a rough soldier and i have never had the time to make proper love to a beautiful woman but here in your perfumed palace i shall linger and adore you until it is time for us to depart for rome then his lips returned to her flesh this time moving slowly and sensuously coaxing alive within her tiny flames of pure desire she did not fight himwhether from simple exhaustion or because she was admitting her surrender to rome even zenobia did not know what she did know was that his lips his hands his seductive words all combined to vanquish her she had lost palmyra to him and whatever she said or did he would take her body for as he had said he was the victor perhaps by yielding she might regain some measure of control over the situation briefly she thought of deliciae was this what it had been like for her in the days before odenathus had given her in marriage to rufus curius forced to barter her body in order to survive how scornful zenobia had been but then she had not known still she had sworn to herself that she would survive and if to survive she must use her body then by the gods she would do so zenobia focused her silvery eyes upon aurelian and said simply love me startled he looked up at her and when she repeated those two words he groaned like a starving man being offered a fine feast she would have sworn that his hands trembled as he bared her completely gazing at her passionately he ran his hands over her silken skin moving upward to cup her large breasts then sliding down across her thighs his fingers hesitant at first then surer probing tenderly between the plump lips of her venus mount she wasnt really quite prepared when his blond head dipped quickly and his tongue touched the tiny secret sensitive flower of her womanhood she gasped but then his fingers were gently spreading her nether lips and his tongue was caressing her expertly forcing the liquid fire to flow and she realized she didnt care there would be no escape from this man and so uncaring zenobia allowed herself to be swept up in the whirlwind of pleasurable sensations that aurelian aroused within her body he was a lover of incredible stamina and having suffered these last nights from his brutality she was quite surprised that he was capable of such sensitivity and gentleness his hungry mouth was beginning to wreak havoc with her senses as he sucked sensuously upon that tiny morsel of tender flesh yet she was unready when the first starburst exploded within her and she cried out still fearful of the feelings that this man could arouse within her aurelian understood and pulling himself back level with her he smoothed the tangled hair from her forehead and placed a kiss upon it you are so beautiful in your passion he said softly hold me she whispered in a shaking voice and turning clung to him her whole frame trembling he was instantly protective of her enfolding her within his strong arms here he said quietly within the privacy of your chamber i am with you as i have never been with any woman i know that i stir your senses goddess but do you know how much you stir mine it is with me as it has never been before i do not think that i shall ever get enough of you his voice was thick with his emotion and she felt his staff hard and eager against her thigh yet he made no move to force her this time suddenly zenobia realized that if cleopatras roman lovers had destroyed her it was surely because her ancestress had loved and trusted them i will never love or trust this man she thought but if i can please him and obviously i can then perhaps i shall yet save my sons inheritance she shifted her body so she might see his stern face and freeing her hands from her sides she reached up drew his head down and kissed him sweetly her soft lips moving against his almost shyly you are right roman she said low lust is a powerful thing and not altogether unpleasant would you be very much shocked if i said i wanted you looking down upon her his blue eyes searched her face for signs of mockery but finding none he said no i should not be shocked goddess love me she answered him her lush body beginning to move provocatively beneath his aurelian needed no further encouragement for his manhood felt close to bursting with his desire feeling her long legs parting to encourage him he pushed his aching weapon deep within her warm wonderfully willing body a groan of pleasure escaping his tightly clamped lips the long and lovely legs wrapped themselves about him and he had the fleeting thought that she was really the goddess venus herself come to earth to give sweet pleasure to him her hands ran smoothly down his back then caressed his taut buttocks her touch was more exciting than anything he had ever known she was making love to him zenobia quickly realized the effect that her boldness was having upon aurelian it roused him more than anything she could have done and his excitement communicated itself to her together they fanned the flames of their desire their bodies writhing passionately both seemingly inexhaustible as he drove again and again and again into the lush and lovely woman panting beneath him her movements encouraged him onward never had he felt so strong so manly so immortal as within the throbbing sheath of this magnificent creature then suddenly zenobia cried out ah sweet venus i die and aurelian with a low growl of triumph waited but a moment to assure himself that she had attained olympus before releasing his own boiling offering to the goddess of love he was shaken to the core of his being and he could see that palmyras queen lay in a deep swoon her beautiful body covered in a faint silvery sheen of dampness that highlighted the palegolden color of her skin he would have believed her dead but for the pulse that fluttered in a tiny provocative hollow at the base of her throat she soared upward floating free and happy seeing below her the mountainous home of the gods and then as suddenly she plunged downward into a whirling lightfilled abyss that battered both her body and her soul something was wrong but she could not understand what it was with a low moan she tried to escape the sinking feeling slowly almost painfully she fought her way back to consciousness her first realization of returning feeling being the firm kisses being placed upon her lips zenobia opened her eyes and aurelian smiled down at her before his lips took charge of hers once again his mouth demanded and she acquiesced kissing him back with equal fervor opening her mouth to receive his questing tongue the tongue touched the sensitive roof of her mouth and she shivered it rubbed against her tongue in a sensual gesture then sucked attempting to draw her very spirit from between her lips she eluded him and attempted to imitate his actions she was pleased when he shuddered against her and then he drew away from her goddess you will destroy me yet he murmured against her ear and for the first time in months zenobia felt genuine amusement bubbling up within her her laughter sounded warm and mischievous in his ear and he was forced to chuckle himself they lay together for some time and then she realized that he had fallen asleep and so zenobia slept too in the morning he made no attempt to hide from her servants the fact that he had slept with her and zenobia wisely refrained from comment she desperately wanted to ask him what if anything he had decided for palmyra but she believed to ask such a sensitive question after their extraordinary night together would make it appear as if she had deliberately set out to use her body to influence him she had of course but although she was willing to be totally honest with herself she would not could not be with romes emperor he would ever be her enemy though she be his mistress he would tell her when he was ready to tell her and then if necessary she would try to soften his terms and see that vaba remained palmyras ruling king she helped to bathe him and then bathed herself when young adria babs assistant attempted to brush zenobias long hair aurelian took the brush from her hand and did it himself reveling in the silken swath that fell to the middle of her back his big hand smoothed it after each passage of the brush and when bab scandalized clucked her disapproval he mildly ordered her to be silent then on reflection he said bring your mistress a kalasiris the color of flame i want to see her gowned in the bridal color then he bent and whispered in zenobias ear for you are my bride goddess you are the only woman who has ever made me feel i believe that i am falling in love with you is this how you treat all your captives she halfteased him do not jest with me goddess i mean what i say zenobia sighed do not fall in love with me roman i have warned you that i shall never again give myself into any mans keeping you are my enemy yet in this i cannot hurt you i am being honest with you you have been hurt he answered her in time you will come to trust me goddess will you call the council of ten into session today she asked him attempting to change the subject the meeting is already arranged for the midday hour goddess while you slept yesterday afternoon i gave orders that gaius cicero see to it she turned her head to look at him and could not resist asking what have you decided caesar as you come to know me zenobia he said slowly you will learn that the secret of my success is always to keep my private life and my public duty separate we will never discuss the business of the empire within the walls of our bedchamber he then bent and kissed her mouth lightly i am ravenous goddess do you think we can persuade that disapproving old crone who serves you into bringing us something to break our fast the reproof had been a gentle one but nonetheless zenobia felt a chill of premonition forcing it down she called to bab the emperor is hungry why have we not been fed can i do several things at once bab snapped first there was the bath then the overseeing of this useless wench that you insist aid me though the gods know she is more trouble than help then he commands that i fetch a flamecolored gown for you when am i supposed to have the time to get your breakfast with a snort she turned upon the hapless adria you girl go and fetch breakfast for the queenand him i must remain and see to flamecolored garments humph still grumbling under her breath bab waddled off into the queens wardrobe while the flushed adria hurried off to see to the food how can you put up with that sour old woman the emperor asked she raised both my mother and me zenobia said she is very dear to me even if in her old age she becomes impatient and frequently oversteps her place i love her roman and she loves me he smiled i had an old grandmother like that she was fierce and gruff but somehow she always had a sweetmeat for you he reached out and pulled her into his arms for a long moment they stood together their nude bodies touching his warmth and male scent suddenly familiar and almost comforting in her nostrils they broke guiltily apart as bab bustled back into the room still grumbling beneath her breath about flamecolored draperies here she almost flung the naturalcolored chamber robes at them that foolish girl adria is deeply shocked by your immodesty and for once i am in total agreement with her are you athletes to run about in public as naked as the day your mothers birthed you put these on at once your meal will be here shortly and unless you wish to display each others charms to the slaves you will clothe yourselves immediately meekly they obeyed her but zenobias lips twitched her suppressed amusement especially as she could see that romes mighty emperor was completely chagrined by the severe tonguelashing he had just received is she a slave he demanded no zenobia whispered she was a freedwoman of alexandria when my grandfather employed her to nurse my orphaned mother she has always been a part of my life she always will be she is elderly goddess i wonder if she can make the trip to rome it is a long way i cannot leave her behind roman the arrival of their morning meal forestalled further conversation adria had brought a tray containing a pitcher of freshly squeezed juice a mixture of oranges lemons and limes a round red arrantine bowl with hardboiled eggs freshly baked bread a honeycomb and another bowl filled with ripe apricots they sat facing each other across a round table eating together as if it had been a habit of long standing between them zenobia reached for an apricot and pulling it apart removed the pit and popped half of it into her mouth chewing it she changed the subject asking what will you do until it is time for the council to meet i will have to ride through the city checking upon my men goddess i want no friction between your people and mine we want a return to business as usual here in palmyra she stifled the angry retort that sprang to her lips it would do no good and if she were to convince him to allow vaba to remain as palmyras king she must remain pleasant they finished their meal with a modicum of small talk then aurelian quickly dressed and made to leave her stopping as he went to place a passionate kiss upon her mouth i should rather remain with you goddess than attend to this dull business he smiled down at her and then he was gone alone at last she was alone again if only for a few minutes she would go out in her garden and walk among the calming flowers and fountains it was not yet too hot to do so she did not know how long she wandered amid the fragrant blooms but suddenly bab was there fussing at her about changing from her chamber robe into what she scornfully called those flamecolored draperies that he wants zenobias amusement eased some of her apprehension and she dutifully followed her elderly servant back into her bedchamber standing quietly she allowed bab and adria to dress her in the crimson gown but seeing her reflection in her large oval silver mirror zenobia suddenly tore the garment off with an oath no i will not wear this romes emperor will not dictate to me in even so small a matter as my clothing today i expect will be the last time my council meetsat least with me i shall therefore be their queen this last time and i shall dress like a queennot like the emperors favorite whore ha a smile split old babs face now you speak like palmyras queen all this morning you have sounded like the romans pet bird all soft and cooing what shall i bring you my baby i will wear tyrian purple the royal color adria fetch me the proper kalasiris sleeveless please and a matching cape and bab get the jewel cases it is zenobia queen of palmyra who will head this council of ten meeting not aurelians mistress for a few minutes zenobia stood amid the shredded wreckage of her torn gown while her two servants hurried back and forth doing her bidding when the jewel cases were brought the queen opened them all staring down at their contents already upon her bed lay a gossamer spun kalasiris of tyrian purple its embroidered and fitted bodice replete with golden stars that tumbled down amid the narrow pleats of the skirt glittering and twinkling like the very stars in the night sky carefully she considered her jewelry a jeweled collar would have been a simple choice but she closed the cases containing these pieces and waved them away the collars were neat and she wanted to be opulently magnificent finally her eye lit upon a necklace of irregularly shaped amethysts some set within yellowgold settings others hanging from their settings by webthin yellowgold wires smiling zenobia lifted it out of its case and handed it to bab this one was all she said and then she pulled a rather barbaric pair of matching earrings from the jewel case and these the box was closed and adria proffered another leather case this one filled with bracelets zenobia selected two armbands fashioned like snakes each golden scale perfect their flashing eyes of small but choice purple sapphires the last box offered contained rings rings of every size and shape with gemstones of every sort known to the world zenobia chose but one a huge purple scarab beetle into whose back was carved the seal of palmyra the door to zenobias apartments opened and vaba and flavia entered the queen turned to her son and his wife holding her arms out to flavia dear child i should indeed scold you i am far too young to become a grandmother she hugged vabas wife and then inquired anxiously you are well now i tend to be sick in the early afternoons and sometimes in the mornings flavia smiled with a little shrug both quite normal my mother assures me then the girls face grew worried what is to happen to us with the romans in the citv aunt zenobia will they kill us will my child be safe so many questions flavia dear child i do not know what will happen but i am certain that aurelian means this family no harm i believe what he wants is to restore roman rule to this city again but that we shall try to prevent for vabas sake flavias face became less fearful you have always been a favorite of the gods my lady of late murmured zenobia wryly i have begun to wonder she motioned to a chair sit down flavia you must not tax yourself then she sat down herself vaba however remained standing what is happening in the city he demanded we do not know zenobia replied each district in the city has been cut off from all the others so the people may not mix freely it is impossible to get from one area to another without a pass and precious few are being issued then we must wait for the council meeting vaba said quietly yes his mother answered and then where is demi i have not seen him since the romans entered the city vaba frowned my brother disagreed quite violently with my decision to surrender to the romans he left the palace two nights ago and i have no idea where he is i do know however that he has banded together a group of young patrician hotheads like himself and they are considering a guerrillatype warfare upon the romans no zenobias voice was sharp we must find him vaba such behavior could endanger your position i will not allow him to do that i have people out looking but if the city is as tightly closed as you say then it will be more difficult for them the gods take the young fool zenobia muttered he is your son mother vaba could not resist saying if you mean he is impetuous was the calm reply then you are right it was not just the surrender put in flavia we had only just told him about the baby he was jealous vaba said no vaba flavia defended her brotherinlaw it is not easy for demi to be the younger son it is never easy for a younger son now demi is to be upstaged by our child and he had not the time to adjust he will come around what flavia said is true vaba zenobia spoke i know that for some time demi has chafed from having little to do he is a natural soldier like your father and a good leader i had planned to send him to alexandria to act as our governor his thirst for power is not overly great and that would have satisfied him well i am not angry at him mother vaba replied believe it or not i understood how he felt but now he endangers not only me but flavia and our unborn child as well he endangers palmyra zenobia said he must be found we are doing our best can you not speak to aurelian what are you mad what should i say should i tell aurelian that i cannot control my family please will the romans help to find my bad boy they would execute him on the spot as a troublemaker do you want demis death on your hands vaballathus there have been no executions mother that is no guarantee that there wont be zenobia said ominously oh they both turned to see flavia white and swaying in her chair darling what is it vaba was kneeling at his wifes side what if they kill you vaba flavia began to sob piteously zenobia could have bitten her tongue do not fret flavia the romans will not kill this family i am sure they will execute a few unimportant people in order to impress their rule upon the masses there will be messy affairs in the public squares but we will not be involved they will go after potential troublemakers accusing them of things like hoarding and profiteering do not fear vaba will not be harmed you are sure quite sure zenobia said with far more certainty than she was feeling then she said vaba take flavia to your apartments and stay with her until the council meeting if i get any word before then i shall send to you the king stood up nodding in agreement with his mother and then he escorted his trembling young wife from the room now zenobia said i am ready to dress bab and adria quickly aided the queen pulling the exquisite kalasiris over her head fastening her jewelry about her neck and in her ears and about her upper arms zenobia slipped the ring upon her fingers while adria helped her into delicate golden sandals the queen then sat at her dressing table and adria brushed her dark hair until it shone then taking a section of hair from each side of zenobias head adria braided it and drew the thin braids back to fasten them high on the back of the queens head with a jeweled enamel pin the rest of zenobias black hair flowed free down her back and bab dusted it with gold powder before placing the vineleaf crown upon her mistresss head the queen stood and walked to her polished silver mirror smiling in satisfaction at what she saw bab find me cassius longinus longinus came quickly sprawling into the chair lately vacated by romes emperor helping himself to an egg he dipped it into the salt and took a healthy bite your secret garden gate is unguarded majesty the council advises you and your family escape while there is yet time to what purpose longinus you would be a rallying point for our people there is no point in it longinus rome is already in full possession of the city the army is as trapped as i am there is no help for us the king made the decision to open palmyras gates to rome that the city and her people might be saved he was right and i can only hope aurelian will let my son remain this citys ruler to that end alone i will work longinus longinus bowed his head in acceptance of her judgment then standing he said i will go with you to rome majesty it is time bab said it is midday you have seen to my guard need you ask my baby they await you outside the door without another word zenobia walked through her bedroom through her antechamber and out into the hallway through doors opened swiftly by her slaves instantly the one hundred men in her guard came to attention and cried out hail zenobia hail queen of palmyra a small smile touched zenobias lips as she said good afternoon captain urbicinus majesty the captain saluted smartly the queen seated herself in her waiting litter an opulent affair of solid silver its raised designs all of a botanical nature the cushions of the litter were of purple velvet immediately the four coalblack slaves in their clothofsilver breechcloths lifted the litter and began moving down the corridor before them behind them and on either side of them inarched the queens guard it was not a long trip to the council chamber and with much ceremonythe wide double doors to the chamber were flung wide the waiting trumpeteers played a flourishthe queens guard marched into the room with the litter the litter was carried to the head of the table where the emperor and the young king were already waiting as was the entire council dismounting the litter with captain urbicinuss aid zenobia caught longinuss eye and saw secret amusement in it as she seated herself opposite romes emperor the royal guard once more shouted hail zenobia hail queen of palmyra then they positioned themselves along two of the walls of the room facing some of the men of aurelians own legion who lined the other two walls the council is called to order zenobia said she looked to the emperor by the gods aurelian thought admiringly she yet has the courage to defy me even now in the hour of her defeat he almost regretted the decisions he had made regarding the city almost the emperor stood and looked around the table at all the upturned and expectant faces before facing zenobia then he said you are banished queen of palmyra from this citystate that you led to rebellion against your masters the imperial romans the room was deathly silent no ones face showed any emotion for it was as they expected as zenobia had led them to expect what they waited for was his decision concerning odenathuss dynasty vaballathus king of palmyra roman law demands the death of a client king who rebels against rome but you were a child when you came into your inheritance your mother has ruled for you and so in fairnessand contrary to what you have been raised to believe we romans are fairi cannot hold you responsible for this rebellion i therefore grant you your life but you and your wife and whatever family you have are banished to the city of cyrene no zenobias voice was ragged for how long asked vaba for life was the reply no a low and desperate cry be quiet aurelian said almost gently i have not finished she was amazing he thought she cared only for her husbands life if she might transfer that loyalty to him roman law will be served in the case of palmyras rebellion continued the emperor your king was scarcely a child your regent a woman a woman who was advised in all her plans by you the council of ten i have spared both your boy king and your queen regent i will not however spare you i must hold this council responsible for zenobia of palmyras acts you are men you could have prevented all that has happened between rome and palmyra but you did not you allowed a woman total control and her emotional and unbridled ways her fierce pride her ambition have led you to your own destruction accordingly i must mete out punishment to all you are sentenced to death in the name of the senate of rome and the peoples it represents the council of ten will not be allowed to reform rome will rule palmyra henceforth by means of a military governor you have six hours in which to put your affairs in order you will be executed just before sunset rest assured that your families will not be harmed nor will your possessions be confiscated there was not a sound in the room the members of the council of ten could not believe what they had heard zenobia sat wideeyed clutching at the tables edge she pulled herself up to a standing position mercy caesar she rasped for her throat was tight kill me make me your example but in the name of all the gods spare these good men her voice grew stronger my day is over i will die willingly for palmyra it is not fair that the council be killed they are not responsible for my actions i alone am responsible i willingly nay gladly accept my responsibilities a woman could not have accomplished what you have accomplished zenobia without the cooperation of her council the boy was too young to rule i grant you but had this council not gone along with your precipitous behavior you could not have come so close to succeeding in your foolish rebellion my sentence is just i will kill you she said clearly and the men of the emperors legion put their hands to their swords someday i will find a way to repay you for this terrible roman injustice you have placed the burden of guilt for the murder of ten good men upon my conscience and i shall never forgive you for it this council is disbanded aurelian said coldly and quickly the men of his legion surrounded the unfortunate members of the council of ten each of you the emperor said may return under guard to your homes you will be escorted back to the palace before sunset then he turned on his heel to leave the room wait zenobias voice resounded throughout the council chamber aurelian turned give me leave caesar to bid these faithful friends farewell she spoke carefully in a toneless voice he nodded curtly without their guards she pleaded again he nodded thank you she said simply when the room had emptied and only zenobia vaballathus and the council of ten remained she spoke i will try when i am alone with him to get him to reconsider but he is a harsh man i know not with what i may bargain now i have nothing left marius gracchus spoke he means to separate palmyra entirely from her past majesty he believes that once this is done the people will be easy to manage and in truth they will be whatever their loyalties to the house of odenathus rome has not penalized them for this war nor i suspect will rome penalize them the royal family will be gone the council will be gone and there will be but one authority rome the peoples loyalty will not be torn and the city will remain as rome wants productive and calm i admire this emperor for all he has condemned me to my death because he is clever and ruthless do not grieve majesty we of the council of ten are mostly old and the gods know that we have lived good lives we are proud to die for palmyra there were murmurs of assent from the others and zenobia knew that there was nothing left to say they were all powerless and they had all bravely faced that fact i will try she said i must try we all know that you could not have stopped me even if you had desired to do so aurelian knows it too it is not fair cassius longinus chuckled you are correct majesty he said with a twinkle although it embarrasses us to admit it even now we could not have stopped you at any time nonetheless the emperor needs a blood sacrifice we are that sacrifice let it be do not humble yourself before aurelian again you may not realize it now but your lot is far harder than ours he can kill us only once but you majesty must live on to take part in the emperors triumph and then afterwardwho knows you are palmyra you will show the alien roman world palmyran courage and loyalty and by doing that all we have done in our battle for liberty will live on and we shall never really be dead zenobia felt the tears well up and then unashamedly she let them roll down her face there were no arguments left i will bid you farewell now she said quietly attempting to gather her dignity about her each of the council came forward placing his hands first in hers and then moving on to their young king to bid him farewell zenobia said only their names for there were no words with which she might thank them now for this ultimate sacrifice antonius porcius i fear for flavia when she learns of your fate my daughter is stronger than she appears my queen my main concerns are for julia and our son gaius i will do everything i can old friend perhaps they will want to go to cyrene with vaba and flavia my future is so uncertain cyrene antonius porcius made a face the armpit of the empire he said scornfully a decaying city on the sea with the desert on the other three sides and nothing else for hundreds of miles aurelian chose vabas place of exile well the gods help them they will be bored to death within a year zenobia was forced to laugh even in the midst of such tragedy and the sound of her laughter heartened everyone in the room she and antonius porcius romes former governor and palmyras loyal servant these many years embraced and then he was moving on and speaking in low urgent tones to vaba cassius longinus stood before her and for a very long moment they looked at each other you zenobia said you i will miss more than the others even my children you are my friend quick tears sprang to her silvery eyes and she amended my best friend longinus smiled a strangely sweet smile at her and took her hand in his you think that your life is over he said quietly but dearest majesty it has barely begun palmyra is just your beginning i am sixty years old majesty and if i have any regrets it is that i was not with you from the very beginning it is the will of the gods that your life be spared as it is their will that we ten die remember us majesty but do not grieve he drew her close to him and gently kissed her forehead you are my best friend also he said and then he moved away from her to speak with vaba zenobia stood quietly tears streaming down her beautiful face finally the room was empty and vaba came over to put a comforting arm about his mother i do not think i can bear it zenobia said i cannot believe that aurelian means to go through with tins slaughter it is so unfair when were the romans ever fair he replied bitterly it is as longinus said their honor can only be satisfied by a blood sacrifice oh vaba she halfwhispered i am responsible for this it is my fault that the council of ten is to die if i had not declared you augustus and myself queen of the east aurelian would not have descended upon us in the short time i have known this emperor mother i have reached the conclusion that he never does anything precipitously each move he makes is well thought out in advance i believe that in his quest to reunite his roman empire he sought to regain full control of palmyra again he did not want palmyra to be ruled by its own king he would have found some excuse however flimsy to conquer us you cannotmust nothold yourself responsible for the fate of the council his words were comforting but zenobia was not sure that she entirely believed them after all had not shehad not they all said that she was palmyra as queen a queen who ruled for her son they had all been her sole responsibility she had failed in that trust vaba escorted her litter back to her apartments and left her slowly zenobia entered her rooms her mind deep in thought she suddenly felt very tired and decided that she would rest until sunset it would be necessary for her to attend the execution of her council members they had always supported her and she owed them this final courtesy no matter how painful it would be for her why did you not wear the flamecolored gown i wanted aurelians voice cut into her concentration red is the color of joy she said dully i did not expect i should be joyful this day and so i chose to be who i am the queen of palmyra tyrian purple is a royal color you are no longer queen of palmyra goddess she turned to look directly at him and then she said in a quiet voice i will always be the queen of palmyra aurelian your words the edicts of your seriate they cannot alter who i am perhaps i shall never see my homeland again but i will always be the queen of palmyra seeing her standing there he understood for the first time in his life the word regal he knew that he should never possess such presence such dignity she almost made him feel ashamed and it angered him why should this beautiful rebel make him feel guilty for doing his duty may i go with vaba and flavia she asked may i take my other children with me you will come to rome with me he said in a voice that suggested she not argue you have two sons but i have only seen one where is the other i do not know where my son demetrius is caesar perhaps he is with his grandfather and perhaps he is sneaking about the city like a jackal with a group of his angry young patrician friends causing trouble the emperor said his eyes narrowing what have you heard she tried to keep the fright from her voice it is reliably reported that they have been inciting the people to riot and other such seditious acts i would suggest that you find him and warn him that any further such nonsense could incur my displeasure she nodded too tired to argue with him now he looked at her and felt a surge of pure desire suppressing it he realized she was not beaten simply in shock over his harsh judgments go and rest goddess he said in a kinder tone of voice it will not be necessary for you to be at this evenings sad event i will be there caesar she replied in a fierce voice cassius longinus said that you must have your blood sacrifice but i shall never forgive you for the guilt you have placed upon me never he replied is a long time goddess when you are in rome with me you will forget i will never forget go and rest he repeated zenobia brushed past him and entered her bedchamber there bab and adria sat awaiting her return they quickly rose to their feet at her entry and hurrying toward her wordlessly began to remove her jewelry and clothes although she did not believe that she could sleep she did shock had taken its toll and she could have easily slept for hours but bab gently shook her awake in the hour before sunset and helped her to dress again in royal purple her numbed mind began to function again she was alive her children were alive and they would remain so unless demi did something foolish as long as they lived there was hope hope of returning one day to palmyra how long would aurelian last emperors came and went in these days with remarkable rapidity in a few years what had transpired between rome and palmyra would be forgotten and if she was in favor with a future emperor in rome she could possibly regain vabas inheritance you are ready said bab who recognized her mistresss mood and had been silent all during the dressing come with me old woman zenobia said did you think i would not came the quick reply you are strong my baby but no one is strong enough to bear alone what you must now face i will always be with you as long as these tired old legs can move i would come too majesty quiet adria said and zenobia turned in surprise to see the firm resolute look in the slave girls brown eyes yes adria she answered her you may come together the three women left the queens rooms and walked slowly along the corridor leading to the main courtyard of the palace zenobia silently noted that her own personal guard had been replaced by roman legionnaires though she felt sure that her men had not been harmed she resolved to inquire of aurelian what had happened to them the roman legionnaires guarding the entry to the central courtyard snapped smartly to attention as zenobia passed through with her women the sight greeting her outside almost made her falter but old bab hissed softly courage queen of palmyra zenobia moved regally forward to mount with her women the raised platform that had been erected at one end of the courtyard aurelian already sat sprawled in a chair i told you that you did not have to come he said i told you she replied half angrily that these men you slaughter have served me faithfully and i would come aurelian signaled to one of his men bring a chair for the queen he said i will stand in respect she quickly replied he ignored her whether you stand or sit goddess is your choice but the chair is there should you need it zenobia looked out over the courtyard the day had been a hot one but now with sunset fast approaching the courtyard was in shadow zenobia turned to romes emperor will it be quick yes was the short reply she wanted to cry but she forced the tears back and swallowed down the lump in her throat there were ten baskets lined neatly up in a long row at the center of the open courtyard realizing their significance she shuddered with revulsion then froze as the condemned men came from a side door of the palace each was flanked by two roman guards one of whom would act as headsman in the execution the council members had chosen to wear pure white tunics that came to their ankles and somber black togae pullae mourning garments they walked proudly their heads held high as they turned to face the raised dais where zenobia stood rooted they raised their right arms in salute and cried out loudly hail zenobia hail queen of palmyra she drew herself up proudly then and said in a voice for all to hear the gods speed your journey my friends for you are surely palmyras greatest patriots all hail to you council of ten enough aurelian snapped and he signaled with his hand each member of the council was forced to kneel before a hateful reed basket his bare neck bowed easily accessible to his executioner each headsman raised his sword and as they did zenobia called out longinus farewell my friend farewell majesty came his dear voice and then the executioners struck with welldrilled precision and the ten severed heads fell with a distinct thump into their waiting containers she swayed and aurelian stood up and reached out to put a strong arm about her i do not need your help roman she snarled at him death to the roman tyrants the cry suddenly echoed about the courtyard and in a hail of arrows the legionnaires in the open courtyard fell some dead instantly some mortally wounded by the poisontipped arrows unleashed at them by the kneeling archers upon the palace roof a tall young man stood up and looked scornfully down upon the stunned dignitaries on the platform hail caesar he said mockingly and welcome to palmyra were the queen not in your grasp at this moment you and the other roman dogs with you would now be as dead as your execution squad the people of palmyra do not like what you have done it was our craven king who opened the citys gates to you not the people nevertheless we prefer king vaballathus to a roman governor reinstate him or this will be just the beginning of our war with you then without waiting for an answer he and his archers disappeared from the rooftops gaius cicero leapt from the platform but aurelians voice was knifesharp dont bother gaius they are long gone back into their rodent holes and we will never find them he turned to zenobia the youth who spoke was your younger son i presume she pushed his offending arm from her waist then giving him a long look smiled with her women trailing behind her she walked from the platform and disappeared into the palace once safe within her rooms she said furiously find demi bab there must be someone who knows where he is hiding the doors to her bedchamber opened and vaba rushed in his face dark with anger he is your son mother your son he is also your brother she snapped back at him i have ordered bab to seek demi out for i do not agree with his methods any more than you do vaba you might know where he is who are his special friends now we must find him why countered vaba so you may save his miserable life i hope to the gods that the romans catch him and kill him zenobias hand shot out and made firm contact with the cheek of her older son dont ever say such a thing again i want demi found because i do not want him to throw away his life needlessly i want demi found so that he does not ruin your future and that of your children what future he demanded scornfully there is no future for me in cyrene there is no future for my descendants best flavia miscarry of the unfortunate babe she now carries better we never have any children at all you fool zenobia almost shouted you only see what is in front of you why can you never see ahead almost absently she reached out and rubbed at the red imprint of her hand on his cheek vaba listen to me aurelian will fall like all of romes emperors in these past years and the emperor to follow him will fall i will be in rome making friends building my connections always supporting the right faction in five years ten at the most you will return to palmyra as its rightful king i promise you this my son i swear it have i ever broken a promise to you vaba he looked at her wonderingly and shook his head then he said do you never stop scheming mother will you trust me vaba i have always trusted you mother good now think where can demi be hiding it has to be at cassius longinuss house in the city longinuss little friend oppian has been giving demi and his friends occasional shelter although i doubt that longinus was aware of it he left the boy alone as he did not want him here at the palace and oppian was lonely for the company of other young men i am sure that longinus willed the house to him and equally sure you will find demi there or at least oppian will know where he is zenobia turned to speak to bab but the old woman forestalled her raising up her hand and said i am already gone i shall bring him back when i find him zenobia sent a message to aurelian asking that she be allowed the traditional mourning period to her surprise he sent back an immediate reply by his personal secretary durantis agreeing to her request but stipulating that she keep to her own apartments and own garden she assented she knew that he acquiesced because it suited him not her he probably needed the time to consolidate his victory with vaballathus deposed the council of ten dead and the queen out of sight palmyra would naturally turn to roman authority it was late that night when old bab returned and she was alone he is mere she said but he will not come to the palace he fears a trap he said that zenobia was furious he does not distrust you bab quickly assured her but he fears a roman trap there is no one left you may rely upon he says now that the council is dead did you use the secret gate in the garden zenobia asked bab i did and i was seen by no one i am not so old that my eyes and ears cannot see or hear properly then if you can get out so can i zenobia said that is just what prince demetrius said bab replied he said that you must come tonight however for after tonight the roman is sure to put a watch on you tonight he will assume you too devastated to take any kind of action we will have to walk my baby but at this very minute two of prince demis men are waiting for us outside the palace to escort us in safety adria zenobia called and the young slave girl came instantly majesty you heard yes majesty i want you and bab to remain here you will sit outside my bedchamber door as if keeping watch bab will sit inside my chamber by my bed a bed that will appear to have a sleeping woman in it should the emperor come you will do your best to prevent his entering my room but should he ignore you then bab will handle it do you understand yes majesty adria smiled it will be a pleasure to deceive the roman dogs zenobia looked with new eyes upon her young servant until recently she had not given the girl a great deal of attention but of late adria had shown intelligence and loyalty more worthy of a freed woman than a slave from this moment on adria you are no longer a slave zenobia said quietly tomorrow i shall have the papers drawn up freeing you majesty adrias usually plain round face was suddenly pretty with her joy and her brown eyes were filled with tears of happiness dropping to her knees she caught at the hem of zenobias gown raising it to her lips she kissed it fervently and said i will never leave you majesty i would not want to leave you for you are goodness itself thank you thank you zenobia gently touched the girls strangely beautiful browngold hair and said get up adria i must go i do not like you going alone bab fretted zenobia did not argue with her she simply said i can move far quicker without you and bab was forced to agree without another word she swaddled zenobia in a long totally enveloping hooded black cape and watched with worried old eyes as her mistress went swiftly through the bedchamber door out into the darkness zenobia picked her way through the blackness of her garden for there was no moon this night she could not be quite sure where the little hidden door lay and so she carefully felt her way along the vined wall until her hands made contact with the smooth ancient wood reaching up she found the key upon its hook she unlocked the door slipped through and relocked it from the other side before returning the key to her robes turning she stood very still and listened her sharp ears attuned to the desert night to her right she could hear faint breathing turning she followed the small sound majesty tame the voice in the darkness lead on she commanded softly and then followed the two retreating shadows down the street together the three moved swiftly through the back streets of the city carefully avoiding the watchful roman patrols they did not speak until at last they stood before a garden wall we will have to scale it majesty one of the shadows whispered very well she agreed and the first young man leapt upon the shoulders of the second and reaching down slightly pulled zenobia upward until she was even with him then he carefully placed her on the top of the wall joined her and leaning down again pulled the second man up i can get down myself the queen said and leapt down into the garden of cassius longinuss house landing in from the smell of it a bed of tangy herbs the two shadows upon the wall joined her quickly then led her through the garden and into the darkened house once inside the house she was taken down a flight of stone steps into the catacombs beneath it there in a torchlit underground room she found herself among a large group of young men many of whom she recognized as coming from the citys greatest patrician and commercial families seeing her they instantly came to attention their right arms raised in salute as they cried out hail zenobia hail queen of palmyra she graciously acknowledged them and then the group parted and demetrius came forward to embrace his mother she was amazed by the difference in his appearance from when she had left palmyra several weeks back his face was suddenly more mature his stature positively regal welcome my mother welcome to the brotherhood of the palm zenobia did not choose to mince words if you think to please me or the king by your futile rebellion you do not what demi demanded imperiously have you become the romans champion as well as his lover my queen a hundred pairs of young eyes swung to look upon zenobia you are as impetuous as your brother demi zenobia said in an amused tone though she was feeling far from amused she turned to allow her gaze to encompass them all surely you do not really believe you can force the romans from palmyra what is it you hope to accomplish we want vaba reinstated demi said in a loud voice he may not be the best of kings but he is a palmyran king we want no roman governor mother the young men in the room nodded and murmured their agreement i want vaba reinstated too demi but the romans cannot be forced from palmyra and the city is going to have to endure a military governor for the next several years in time i will return vaba to palmyra as its king it cannot be done overnight but i will get it done trust me all of you the queen held out her hands in appeal and the young men in the torchlit room looked as if they might waver then demis voice sounded fierce and angry no i will not have you prostitute yourself to the romans mother vaba must be reinstated now if he leaves palmyra they will never let him back and this city will not endure foreign rule what do you know of foreign rule zenobia demanded furiously since before your birth the city has been free but before you and vaba the romans ruled here for over a hundred years and palmyra survived as did our family do you think this city suffered under antonius porcius demi we will bide our time again and in the end we will win again but you cannot drive the romans away they will go we will fight them in the streets unto the last man but we shall not let them have the city your actions will destroy vabas chances but perhaps that is your real motive perhaps you believe that if you cannot have the city then your brother will not either is this how i have raised you to be a betrayer of your family of palmyra the room was deathly silent now and zenobia looked upon the eager faces before her i appeal to you my sons she said her look sweeping them all have patience and palmyra will be ours again they slaughtered the council of ten a voice said and the crowd parted to reveal young gaius porcius my father lies dead this night my queen my mother might as well be for she has not spoken a word since sunset she stares into space and there is no feeling or expression in her eyes how can we simply sit back and accept this injustice your father would have agreed with me gaius porcius was zenobias reply though he was born a roman he was a loyal palmyran he would want what is best for palmyra and he trusted me to make that decision there is a time for quick action and there is a time for patience now is the time for patience sending vaba into exile taking me to rome destroying our council these were all planned by the emperor as object lessons to our people he will do no more there are to be no fines no new taxes nothing it will be business as usual in palmyra under a roman governor but in the end we will win how can you be so sure demi persisted has your roman lover assured you of it you are a fool zenobia snapped at her son i thought that you had more sense than vaba but you are just as bad aurelian forced me but i realized quickly i might turn that experience into an advantage for palmyra you may scorn me for it if you choose but what i do i do for palmyra when vaba is restored how many of you will be here to help him you will all be dead of your own foolishness do not rebel any further i beg you palmyra needs her strong and intelligent young men go back to your roman lover my queen demetrius said coldly to his mother if you are suddenly weary of defending our homeland we are not palmyra will rise up against these tyrants will you not be satisfied until you have destroyed the city my son zenobia demanded take her back demi commanded the two young men who had accompanied zenobia to the meeting and before she might speak further they hustled her quickly up the stairs through the quiet house and back into the garden zenobia sighed sadly demetrius had become a fanatic she silently prayed that demis followers would fall away and that he would come to his senses she could only hope that he was not caught for aurelian would not be kind he would want to make an example of demi and that would mean his death she sighed again before she once more scaled the garden wall and dropped into the street below there were times in her life when she felt terribly alone slowly the tears began to slide down her face and zenobia was glad for the darkness that allowed her her privacy she was not one for weeping in public then they were back at the royal palace and zenobia turned to thank her escorts but they had quickly melted into the night slowly she opened her secret door and stepped back through into her private enclave she blessed whomever it was that kept the hinges of the little door well oiled for it made not a sound as it swung wide relocking it she hurried through the garden and back into her bedchamber old bab nodded by a bed in which it appeared a sleeping woman lay zenobia tiptoed across the floor and gently shook the elderly servant awake whwhat bab opened her eyes and zenobia saw the relief in them praise the gods you are back safe she slowly rose to her feet will the prince cease his rebellion no zenobia said he prefers to think of himself as a great patriot and he has enough of a following to cause trouble i do not doubt that when they do they will obtain additional followers perhaps however i have swayed some of those fiercely loyal young palmyrans this night if i have and they desert demi with his ideas of violence then maybe he will come to his senses this roman emperor will kill him without a drought if he continues bab noted zenobia nodded her agreement and then said we had best get some rest bab help me to undress and then you and adria go to bed bab quickly helped zenobia undress then offered her a meloncolored sheer cotton chamber robe slowly zenobia put the garment on and then walking to a table she poured herself a goblet of pale rosecolored wine and sat down in a carved wooden chair go along old woman it has been a long night she heard the door close behind her and knew that she was alone again she was worried why could demi not see reason then she laughed softly at herself he was exactly like she had been at his age but she had had odenathuss loving and kindly influence to temper her rashness the difference was that she had listened to her husband why would their son not listen to her because you are a woman said the little voice in her head it matters not that you are the greatest queen upon the earth in many centuries you are still a woman and your son barely a man thinks that his sex gives him greater knowledge of what is right and what is wrong i am failing you hawk she thought sadly i have failed bom our sons i simply could not do it all alone i needed you i needed marcus ah if only marcus and i had been married things would have been different the wine was beginning to make her maudlin why did i not marry him when he first asked me instead of insisting we wait she drained her goblet but did not refill it instead she rose up walked over to her bed and lay down getting drunk was not going to help her and she did not need a headache she was needed her sons needed her even if they might not admit it flavia would need her for she would be terribly grieved by her fathers death with antonius gone and young gaius behaving like a fool juliaflavias mother and zenobias oldest friend would need her doubly she was awakened at midmorning by adria who brought her a large goblet of fresh fruit juice between sips zenobia gave her orders i am supposed to be in mourning but i want you to fetch the lady julia and her son gaius porcius here to me as soon as they can come also i will need a scribe so that your papers may be drawn up go to the emperors secretary durantis and say that i have need of his services at once majesty adria said where is bab with the lady flavia she is most distraught and begged that bab come to her zenobia nodded run along adria but who will dress you majesty it should not detract from my dignity as queen of palmyra if i dress myself zenobia said with a smile a small smile turned adrias lips up and bowing to the queen she hurried off on her errands zenobia sat in bed sipping at the juice for a few moments then rose to bathe and dress she did not dally in the bath for she had much to do but the steam the scraping the perfumed water and soap and lastly the massage with the fragrant oil made her feel a new woman reentering her bedroom she was somewhat surprised to find aurelian awaiting her his eyes widened with appreciation at her nudity but choosing to ignore it zenobia asked what do you here roman you granted me the nine days of mourning surely you do not mean to break your word why do you want the use of my secretary he asked ignoring her questions because i am setting my slave girl adria free my own scribe will draw up the papers of manumission but i wish your good durantis to read them and be certain that everything is correct according to roman law why are you freeing a valuable slave he persisted because she is loyal to me because she is far too intelligent to be a slave and because she deserves it fear not roman i do not plan to do away with myself i am not setting my house in order prior to my death there are too many people who need me my ancestress cleopatra took a cowards way out i shall not i will outlive you i suspect she finished mockingly and her eyes caught his and held them he wanted her she almost laughed aloud there was simply no subtlety in the man he took a step toward her and her look challenged him i am in mourning roman she said softly you promised aurelian visibly gritted his teeth and said in a tight voice you may have the use of durantis caesar is gracious was the reply he flushed a dull red and turning almost ran from the room he had recognized the scorn in her voice and somehow he felt powerless in light of his desire for her to reciprocate in kind he was falling in love with her the gods forbid better his old friend pure lust zenobia felt the thrill of triumph run through her as she watched him go for the first time since she had set eyes upon the roman she felt good suddenly she realized it was because she had the upper hand that might not be entirely to her advantage she thought as she opened a trunk and began to take out a garment to wear she chose a deepblue kalasiris of silk that had been woven here in palmyra the dress had a wide belt of silvered kid that fastened about her waist with a silver buckle that had a large blue topaz set within it zenobia slipped her feet into matching sandals and sitting down at her dressing table set about brushing her long blueblack hair when she had freed it of its tangles she carefully twisted it into a single thick braid that hung down her back a knock on her door roused her and she called come in the emperors secretary entered good morning my lady he said you will address me as majesty durantis zenobia said quietly he nodded politely i stand corrected majesty how may i serve you i will have my scribe draw up papers of manumission for my slave girl adria today i want you to see that these papers are correct according to roman law so that there will never be any doubt about adrias status i will be glad to serve you thus majesty durantis said thank you you may go now he bowed politely and then backed correctly from the room zenobia stood up walked out into her antechamber and instructed the waiting scribe as to her desires then she began to pace slowly about the room as she waited for adria to return with julia and gaius as she walked her mind went back to the thread of thought she had been spinning when durantis had interrupted her to enjoy an open triumph over aurelian could anger him embarrass him even turn him from her to pretend great passion for him was an equal danger for he might grow tired of her if she appeared suddenly docile she would have to tread a very fine line she would gradually begin to pretend affection for him while resisting him still that should keep him interested for she knew that he desperately wanted to conquer her completely body and soul if she could make him believe long enough that victory over her might yet be possible then she would win the door to the antechamber opened and adria entered leading julia tullio the wife of the late antonius porcius young gaius looking rebellious yet a little frightened followed his mother zenobia was shocked by julias appearance her hair was snowwhite her cryingreddened eyes were blank of expression her slender shoulders were stooped as if from pain julia zenobia held out her arms and the woman walked into them but the queen realized that her friend did not know her anyone might have offered the distraught woman sympathy and she would have accepted it zenobias arms closed around her friend and held her close over julias shoulder she looked incredulously at julias hair and then questioningly at gaius it had turned white when i went in to her this morning he said quietly she has still not spoken the queen loosened her embrace then led her friend into the bedchamber and sat her down in a chair julia she said raising up the womans face and looking down into it julia i know that you hear me antonius is dead and you grieve when odenathus died i grieved too but i had my children to live for and you have yours suddenly julias eyes focused my children are grown she said they do not need me flavia needs you zenobia persisted did you not need your mother when you were first with child gaius needs you he is involved in a group led by my younger son demi who would continue to fight the romans would antonius porcius approve of this you know he would not the father is dead but the children need their mother julia you cannot desert them flavia could miscarry of palmyras future heir should you destroy yourself gaius will most certainly be killed if he persists in following my son then antonius porciuss family will be gone from this earth and it will be your fault for not accepting the responsibilities your husband left you antonius porcius never shirked his duty in his entire life he understood duty and so do you julia you are a hard woman zenobia julia said her voice quavering she began to weep bitter tears never in his life did he harm anyone or anything intentionally why did the emperor order him executed why it is not right julia cried angrily and zenobia was glad to see color coming back into her friends pale face no julia it is not right but it is a fact do not let the romans have a further victory my friend you and your children must live for in living you keep alive a great mans memory you keep alive his line julia brushed the tears from her face you are right zenobia the gods damn you for it but you are right it would be so easy to give up but i will not give up will notshe drew a deep breath then turned her face to her sons i forbid you io have anything further to do with prince demetrius and his band of rebels do you understand me gaius i have lost your father and almost died from the pain of that loss your death will surely kill me there will be another way to avenge your father and together we will find it but do not carelessly throw your life away i will not allow it the boy flushed and protested but what other way is there i am the man in this family now and the decision should be mine it was however a feeble protest gaius needed to save face and so julia said quietly you are only fifteen my son under palmyran law you are not yet of age and if you go against my wishes i will be forced to act in a way you will not like she held out a hand to him and when he took it she drew him near there is no shame in youth gaius but your judgment is not yet fully developed and you must yet rely upon your only parent zenobia came and stood next to the boy even my own demi she said lacks judgment gaius and he is eighteen this year what you all did following the execution of the council was magnificent and a great victory for you all your group killed twentyseven legionnaires not only that but you took the romans completely off guard we did gaius was quite surprised and zenobia could see rather pleased you did the queen returned with a smile be satisfied for now gaius and do as your mother asks you have been so wrapped up in your own loss that you have given no thought to your mother or your sister if you would be a man then you must be strong and let them lean on you how can they if you are running about with demi and his foolish friends she had made it appear as if the choice were actually his and that was a wise tactic gaius responded as she had expected you are right aunt zenobia he said i have great responsibilities now as the eldest male in the porcius family i cannot afford to jeopardize my inheritance and i promise you and my mother that i shall no longer involve myself with demi and his brotherhood of the palm julia heaved an audible sigh of relief and said thank the gods that underneath your youthful exuberance you have your fathers common sense the bedchamber door opened without warning and aurelian strode into the room you say you are in mourning goddess and yet here i find you merrily entertaining your friends he accused zenobias first urge was to hit him but she quickly controlled herself and said sweetly i do mourn caesar i mourn the murder of my good friend and loyal councillor antonius porcius i mourn with his wife julia who is my oldest friend i mourn with his only son young gaius julia is my daughterinlaws mother we fear for the young queens health we are but two grieving mothers caesar i think you plot at mischief goddess no caesar i prevent it though you say i am no longer palmyras queen i am and i fear for my people the city is quiet he said for now she warned then added i did not give you permission to enter my chambers at will caesar again i remind you goddess that you are a captive i do not need your permission julia looked between the two amazed the emperor was obviously not only taken with zenobia but in love with her and jealous of anyone else in her life zenobia however was playing with him as a cat with a mouse i would be afraid of him julia thought shaken she reached out and pulled her son closer go to flavia julia you also gaius your sister will be much reassured by your visit zenobia commanded regally the two rose without a word to the emperor and quickly left the room has that youngster been involved with your younger son aurelian demanded i do not know what you mean zenobia countered i have no idea if my son demetrius is with those young men who rebel against your rule i dont know why you bother to protect the boy the emperor said he is making no secret of his identity aurelian reached into his tunic and drew forth a small parchment which he handed to her these are appearing all over the city today he said drily zenobia took the proffered parchment and began to read people of palmyra the battle with the roman tyrant is not over they have deposed our queen exiled our king and slaughtered the council of ten yet we will fight on join us in our resistance to these tyrants prince demetrius and the brotherhood of the palm anyone might use his name in order to gain followers she said with more conviction than she was feeling then where is he goddess it is no secret that your elder son and your younger son quarreled violently the night before i entered this city prince demetrius left the palace in a rage he has not been seen in public since that night aurelian took her by the shoulders and looked down into her face zenobia i cannot protect the boy if he persists in his behavior yesterday i will forgive what your son and his friends did is understandable to me but now they must cease this very futile rebellion find the boy and reason with him he will not listen she said you have seen him she nodded last night he chooses to be a martyr he thinks it is what his father would want of him aurelian smiled a rueful smile your sons have a great deal of their mother in them he said they are both as stubborn as you are although in different ways try again goddess try to reach him before he steps over the line between the accceptable and the unacceptable you understand me dont you she nodded dumbly he was being unbelievably kind and she wondered why obviously he was trying to win her over but when he bent to brush her lips with his she turned her head away refusing for a moment to give any quarter he could have easily forced her but instead he laughed softly and released her then turned and left the room without another word in her confinement zenobia ate slept and lived without worry for nine days and nights at the end of that time she felt renewed more certain of herself than she had in many years the city remained quiet she had not sought to see her younger son again for she had said what she had to say to him he would either come to his senses or he wouldnt she prayed daily that he would and should he not she prayed he might escape aurelian one thing she did know he could not possibly succeed the important thing now was vaba his wife and the expected child their exile and their eventual return to palmyra she was almost anxious for the trip to rome to begin on the morning of the tenth day after the councils death zenobia found aurelian waiting for her when she came from her bath the sight of her after his voluntary absence made his heart quicken her golden skin was rosy and dewy and she seemed to be enfolded in a cloud of hyacinth herkalasiris was a delicious bright crimson her first gay color in many days how fair you are he said almost without thinking and she smiled good morning roman have you given orders to free me now you are free to roam the palace and have guests he answered but you may not leave the grounds why not because i want to keep the peace i need no demonstrations goddess when do we leave for rome she asked him are you anxious to go yes why i want to get on with my life roman and you tell me that my life is no longer here how coolly logical you are goddess he smiled amused well you should be happy to learn that we leave here in just a few more days first your eldest son must leave with his wife for cyrene i am sending an entire legion with him as escort his young brotherinlaw and motherinlaw will go with them it is their choiceat least until little flavia delivers her child is it safe for flavia to travel now zenobia asked please do not endanger her or my grandchild her own physician has examined her goddess and has pronounced her most healthy and fit to travel and how is my son to live in cyrene caesar he will be given a most generous allowance zenobia and after they are gone we shall go yes you and your younger son if we can find him and your little daughter she is a most charming child goddess i like her but she certainly does not resemble either you or your sons she resembles my mothers people zenobia said quickly mama was quite blond and fair but tell me roman you have been seeing my child she was quite worried about you goddess and needed reassurrance i was able to offer that reassurance iam very good with little girls you must remember that i raised my niece carissa you might have allowed mavia to be with me zenobia said sharply no goddess i felt you needed the nine days of mourning to reflect upon your situation the child would have distracted you he was telling her once more that it was he who controlled her life as always caesar you are most kind and thoughtful zenobia murmured aurelian laughed why is it that even when you are thanking me goddess i get the feeling that you are slinging missiles at me zenobia looked at him eyes wide her whole expression one of innocence i do not understand she said i thought i was being most polite to you caesar the hell you did he muttered thickly reaching out and pulling her against him you continue to fascinate me and defy me at every opportunity goddess a hard arm was tight about her slender waist and now his free hand cradled her head as his mouth came down on hers in a brief but burning kiss i am tired of sleeping alone he said your mourning is over zenobia and tonight i intend returning to your bed have you missed me goddess no she said smiling up at him her gray eyes looking directly into his blue ones he laughed but she could see the anger hidden deep in his eyes one day you will regret your defiance goddess one day i will grow bored with it and find a more comfortable mistress i did not choose to be your mistress caesar it is not up to you to choose he said cruelly remember that when i grow tired of you i may pass you on to anyone it pleases me to goddess perhaps i shall give you to some gaulish or germanic chieftain i wonder how long you would last in the wet cold dark forests of the north he bent once more and plundered her lips savagely bruising them this time forcing his tongue into her mouth where it darted about first stroking the sensitive roof of her mouth then sensuously caressing the sides of her tongue how i hate him zenobia thought but by venus and cupid he can rouse my senses she shivered as she felt a large warm hand upon her breast and struggled to get away from him but aurelian lifted his head saying i desire you now goddess and i shall have you then he swiftly kicked her legs out from beneath her and together they fell to the thick rugs strewn upon the floor she gasped for breath as his greater weight knocked the wind from her maddened by his own passion now aurelian hurriedly pushed her gown up and yanked it over her head flinging it across the room his hands caressed her possessively slipping over her smooth cool body setting her to quivering as the strings of a lyre might vibrate with a sensitive touch closing her eyes for a moment she allowed the sensations to sweep over her she hated him she absolutely hated him but the gods he knew how to pleasure a woman seated upon her hips aurelian watched the passion creep slowly into zenobias expression a cynical look swept into his eyes and etched smile lines at the comers of his mouth she was using him and he was tempted to get up and walk away unfortunately he desired her far too much at this moment to salvage his pride why could he not make her love him he was kind and thoughtful of her and her family and close friends he was even willing to forgive her rebellious younger son yet she still scorned him his one satisfaction was that she did not scorn his body as much as she might want to angry now he pulled her thighs none too gently apart then drove immediately into her body which was already honeyed and awaiting him she gasped and her eyes flew open with surprise for of late he had been gentle with her in and out in and out in and out he moved with increasing rapidity and zenobia cried a soft protest i only use you as you use me goddess he said mocking her i cant love you she whispered brokenly then at least give me some kindness zenobia he said softly his anger draining away at the tone in her voice i have tried to be kind to you at least give me that bending now he began to murmur softly into her ear you are like a wild rose my sweet and vulnerable goddess you are the first star of evening glittering and alone in the night sky you are as elusive as the south wind as beautiful as palmyra itself and i am forced to admit that i adore you totally but i will not be ruled by you zenobia gently he began to move within her again and she moaned softly with open pleasure tell me he whispered to her tell me what you feel beloved she shook her head in the negative but he persisted and at last she was forced to speak i feel possessed and i do not like it i feel consumed and it frightens me why can you not satisfy yourself with a woman who wants you you have never given yourself totally to any man goddess and if you are afraid it is because you are closer than you have ever been in your entire life to complete and sweet surrender give me that surrender goddess give it to me no unable to wait any longer the emperor poured his loving libation into her resisting womb and zenobia shuddered beneath him suddenly lost in her own passion they lay together upon the rugs for several long minutes neither willing to be first to break the silence then zenobia said in a shaky voice someone may come and struggled to her feet picking up her kalasiris from where it lay she put it back on careful to keep her head averted from his gaze perhaps you will never love me goddess he said quietly but i do desire you you too desire me although you will not admit to it let us at least be kind to each other i am not ready to let you go and perhaps i never shall be he rose and pulled down his tunic then moved across to where she stood and put gentle hands on her shoulders be kind to me goddess and let me be kind to you i will try she promised but it is all i can do try he sighed knowing that for the moment it was the best he might expect from her we will eat together from now on zenobia i dislike eating alone almost as much as i dislike sleeping alone is there anything that you particularly like she asked him in an effort to be amenable i will leave the choices to you he said and then he turned and left the room she sat down and staring at the shadows in the rug where they had but recently lain shivered there was something unwholesome about making love without love and yet though it repelled her it also fascinated her aurelian she thought was a strange man he had a peasants shrewdness and he was harsh but he could also be kind she suspected that he fancied himself a latterday julius caesar and she was to be his cleopatra well zenobia considered somewhat wryly cleopatra had survived her caesar and she supposed that she might survive aurelian he wanted her to be kind to him interesting she mused would a pleasant and even relationship keep him content perhaps it would he was a man who liked his personal life smooth and calm in contrast to his turbulent military and political careers it was possible he would not be bored with her if she became more domesticated a creature after all even if demi would not come to his senses she had her little mavia to consider mavia mavia her daughter who was halfroman and now it appeared was to be raised in rome would they see marcus could she bear it if they did marcus had recognized his child at her birth and even if it had been done in secret she and bab lived to testify to it would he still accept mavia as his own will he provide for her should anything happen to me zenobia wondered mavia the little girls name rang again and again in her head she must see that mavia was safe whatever happened on reflection she decided that the child would not go to her father in fact no one should ever know that mavia was not the posthumous daughter of odenathus septimius zenobia decided to make her will and testament before she left palmyra and she would ask durantis to write it for her she would leave her daughter princess mavia of palmyra in the keeping of her elder brother should anything happen to her her personal wealth would all belong to mavia thereby assuring her of a respectable marriage it was the best that the queen could do why should marcus have her had he not deserted them he did not deserve mavia preparations for the departure of palmyras king and young queen moved quickly forward aurelian was determined to stop prince demetrius and his brotherhood of the palm by removing vaballathus and flavia as swiftly as possible as long as the young monarch and his wife remained in the city there lived the possibility of rebellion gone they offered no hope the people of palmyra were not going to rise up and retrieve their ruler from distant cyrene zenobia knew that the journey for her eldest son and his family would begin at night for aurelian wanted no one to see their departure lest someone try to take them from roman custody he dreaded that a popular demonstration would be started by the sight of the young couple the lovely girlish queen pregnant with palmyras heir at dawn their departure would be a cold hard fact the queen sent adria for demetrius the servant girl slipped through the secret gate in the wall and hurried through the busy streets to the house of the late cassius longinus the haughty servant who opened the door sought to shoo her away hardly giving her time to state her business fool adria hissed i am the queens messenger you the man looked down his long nose then again attempted to shut the door in her face very well adria said i shall return to queen zenobia and tell her that i was sent from the house of oppian longinus without even being allowed to state my business to the master my mistress does not suffer fools at all and you are a fool oh come in come in the majordomo sniffed but if i find youve lied to gain entry to this noble house i shall beat you through the streets myself what is all this noise how can i compose my poetry when a constant cacophony reigns within my own house oppian longinus came forth from his garden his long palepeach silk robes swaying greetings oppian adopted son of cassius longinus adria said politely i am adria second waiting woman to queen zenobia i have a message for prince demetrius instantly a wary look came into oppians eyes i cannot imagine why you have come here then he said nervously i have no idea where prince demetrius is i am sorry he turned to go but adrias voice stopped him no one accuses you of anything oppian longinus the queen having met here with her younger son several weeks ago believes that you might be able to pass along a message it is very urgent well oppian longinus reconsidered there is a faint possibility that i might see the prince tonight give me the message adria smiled the queen wishes prince demetrius to know that his brother vaballathus and his wife will shortly be leaving forcyrene if prince demetrius wishes to bid the king and the young queen farewell he is to come to the secret gate in the queens garden at midnight tonight they and the queen will be waiting for him he must not be late for the emperor will be returning from a dinner shortly after midnight and expects queen zenobias company when he does please tell the prince oppian longinus i will tell him oppian longinus said and then with a rather incautious curiosity he asked is it true that the queen sleeps with romes emperor adria laughed scornfully for a man with the instinct for survival that you possess oppian longinus you are bold to question the queens actions i shall tell my mistress that you will pass her message on to the prince and with a swish of her skirts adria left the house of oppian longinus they could not be sure that he would come but a few minutes before midnight zenobia vaba and flavia all waited in the darkness by the queens secret gate it was flavia who first heard the soft scratching and unlocked the little door to admit prince demetrius brother she said softly kissing him on the cheek flavia you bloom was his answer in the faint light from the garden torches they looked at each other and then demi said mother vaba how are you both we are all well my brother but we fear for your safety i feel fortunate that we are all still alive i wonder if you will feel glad to be alive after a year in cyrene demi said as long as i am alive as long as flavia lives and our children beginning with this baby there is hope demi mother is right why can you not be patient my brother go with mother and mavia to rome i need you there to look after them look after mother his voice was bitter mother does not need looking after she does quite well by herself and as long as she does mavia is safe i will need someone in rome who can travel back and forth between mother and me vaballathus entreated who better can i trust but you demi i remain in palmyra at least there will be one of king odenathuss sons here if the romans capture you demi you will be killed zenobia said aurelian will allow you your life if you come with us there is no one in palmyra who will betray me was the proud reply there is always someone who will betray you you young fool said zenobia impatiently if it is not for gold then it will be for roman favor but mark my words demi someone will betray you and it will be he whom you least expect there was a rustle among the bushes and adria appeared the emperor is just returning majesty he is already in the outer courtyard demetrius zenobias voice was impassioned and pleading i beg of you please my son come with us she pulled him so that he faced her in the dim light for a brief moment demi softened mother i must stay he said quietly as long as i remain in palmyra our people have hope they will know we have not deserted them if i am your son then i am my fathers son too please try to understand you will throw your life away needlessly she said brokenly where was her power now this was but one more thing she had to thank the romans for she huddled in her sons arms for a long minute alternating between anger and despair and then she stood straight demetrius prince of palmyra may the gods go with you my son and keep you safe until we meet again pulling his head down she kissed him on the forehead farewell my son farewell my mother he answered her she looked at him a long minute committing his face to memory then she turned and hurried back to the palace you have hurt her terribly vaba said quietly she will survive my brother vaba realized that there was to be no reasoning with his younger brother the king knew that every minute they now remained in zenobias garden brought them closer to discovery and so he said we must go demi you have mothers blessing and i give you mine also i think that you are wrong but your sacrifice is a great one the gods go with you brother he embraced his sibling a final time flavia hugged him also saying in her gentle voice mars protect you dearest brother and athena give you wisdom the gods go with you both also demi said softly he kissed her tenderly upon her lips then saluting his older brother a final time slipped through the little wall door and into the darkness of the sleeping city slowly they closed the door locked it and carefully replaced the key then together vaba and flavia returned to the palace in zenobias bedchamber the emperor lay back looking up at her you are sad tonight goddess have you seen your younger son yes she said he persists in his foolishness she nodded you will have to kill him zenobia said low and a single bright tear rolled down her cheek gently he brushed it away with one finger and reaching up gathered her into his arms perhaps we shall catch him before he does something too unforgivable goddess i will give orders i promise you how can you be so kind on one hand so cruel on the other she asked i dont want to make you any sadder than you are already beloved and i know the wrench it is for you to leave palmyra be parted from your family i understand these things and i can afford to be generous under the circumstances she almost wept then and there but instead she pulled away and looked him in the eye saying i thank you roman for your kindness what a little fraud you are goddess he chuckled all right dont weep upon my neck as you really want to do at this moment i understand pride he pulled her back into his arms and covered her lips with his in an almost tender kiss pressing gently nibbling teasingly you silvereyed sorceress he murmured against her mouth one day you will yield fully to me wisely the queen refrained from an angry retort closing her eyes in seeming surrender the following evening after a busy day of packingfor the royal palmyran couple were to be allowed to take all their furniture and personal possessions with them to cyrenezenobia found herself bidding most of her family farewell in the main courtyard of the palace where only a short few weeks ago the council had been executed a fairsized caravan prepared to leave there were over two hundred laden camels each with one of the kings slaves walking by its side all the royal slaves and free servants would walk with the caravan as would the legionnaires of rome only the young king gaius porcius and the military officers would be mounted julia and young queen flavia would ride in their own litters each big enough for sleeping we will write you mother as often as possible promised vaba wait until you have reached cyrene to send me your message zenobia replied the emperor is leaving to return to rome in another day or two vaba there will be no place you can send the message to me until i reach their capital will you too be hastened from the city under cover of darkness i wonder mother no aurelian sends you from palmyra this way in order to keep his roman peace he will march me from the city in plain view of all our people a captive queen a lesson to any foolish enough to reconsider rebellion mother the worry showed plain upon his face and she was touched by his caring vaba my son and she put a hand on his shoulder do not be afraid for me save your caring for flavia and your unborn child aurelian is nothing more to me than a lustful man with whom i can contend quite successfully she laughed softly at the shock in his eyes he knew of her relationship with the emperor of course but he did not like to admit to a truth that embarrassed him it is never easy to be a woman vaba zenobia said soothingly even a woman who is a reigning queen as i have been what the gods give with one hand they take back with the other remember that always my son i am a king and yet i was unable to aid you mother i will never forget that and it will haunt me always vaba declared no no dear one zenobia protested the roman had more power that is all and that is what i tried to gain for you my sonpower that and wealth will always protect you when will i see you again he demanded when the emperor tires of me enough to allow me to travel to cyrene from rome not until then my son she took his face in her hands and kissed him on both cheeks then quickly upon the lips farewell my son farewell son of odenathus farewell rightful king of palmyra until we meet again may the gods watch over you and care for your safety quick tears sprang into his eyes but he forced them away farewell my mother he said in a tremulous voice then his voice grew stronger no man has ever had a mother as wonderful as you zenobia of palmyra may the gods watch over you until we meet again i love you mother he quickly returned her kiss and then as quickly turned away leaving her to say her goodbyes to flavia and julia i will look after him as if he were my own julia quickly said seeing her old friends face begin to quiver she lowered her voice for goodness sake zenobia do not give way to tears now the children have all they can do not to cry themselves zenobia breathed deeply and replied im all right now julia its just that i cannot remember the last time that vaba told me that he loved me julia laughed you are a sentimental woman for all you deny it zenobia i will write to you and i shall tell you all zenobia nodded thank you julia i know i may rely upon you you are so fortunate you shall see the baby long before i do be sure that he knows of his great heritage and of me i will zenobia i most asuredly will julia hugged her friend and then gave way to her daughter oh majesty flavia said openly teary and clung to the queen flavia zenobia admonished her daughterinlaw gently i am relying upon you to watch over vaba and see that he does nothing foolish dear girl what a joy you are to my son and i am so grateful to you for that take good care of yourself and of the child zenobia kissed the girl then stepped away from her the gods protect you and my grandchild the queen turned and walked from the courtyard and back into the palace she would not stand mere painfully watching until me vast caravan was out of sight instead she returned to her gardens and walked amid the torchlit paths beyond the high garden walls she could hear the soft plod of the camels hooves and me tinkle of their harness bells as they wended their way down me back streets toward the gate to the western road the sound beat itself into her consciousness until suddenly she was aware that it was gone and the night was silent only then did zenobia sit down on a little marble bench in the most secluded part of me garden and weep bitterly unaware that aurelian hidden in the shadows observed her when she returned to her apartments he awaited her greeting her as if nothing unusual had happened making passionate love to her in the deepest part of the night holding her until she slept exhausted with the emotion of her sons departure the next day was a busy one for bab and adria had begun to pack all me queens belongings for the trip to rome zenobia was anxious to leave now palmyra was no longer hers and the pain of that knowledge was too great she was granted permission by aurelian to leave the palace and visit her father she was carried through the streets in a closed litter so that the people might not see her aurelian had no fear that she would try to escape where would she go besides he had zenobias daughter with him at the palace zenobia was conducted to her fathers bedchamber by tamar zabaai ben selim was close to eighty now and seeing him propped up in his bed zenobia realized that her father did not have much more time to live yet he was sharp and fierce in mind even if his body now failed him in his time he had fathered forty sons and a daughter he had one hundred fiftytwo grandsons and fortythree granddaughters over three hundred greatgrandchildren and ten greatgreat grandchildren his own people often likened him to the hebrew patriarch father abraham it is zenobia zabaai his elderly wife said tamar was seventyfive i can see her the old man snapped come closer my daughter come closer so i may feast my tired eyes upon your fresh beauty zenobia bent to kiss her father as always you spoil me with flattery father i hear stories about the roman about you are they true would you have me plunge a dagger into my breast in remorse father the old man cackled by the gods my daughter you are a survivor good for you follow your own instincts and do not be led by the opinions of others do you love him i detest him but if i can outlast him then perhaps i may get vaba restored to his rightful place father hmm the old man said you are wise zenobia when do you leave for rome tomorrow father mavia goes with me but demetrius will not come instead he skulks through the alleys of the city with a group of young men who call themselves the brotherhood of the palm they claim to work for vabas restoration and the total annihilation of the romans he is a foolish boy zabaai remarked but then at his age you were as stubborn if odenathus had not been your husband who knows what mischief you would have gotten into my daughter well do not fear the bedawi will keep an eye upon the boy we will try to save him from himself thank you father the old man looked closely at his only daughter i am near death he said bluntly i know she answered he nodded soon i shall be reunited with my beloved iris do you think she will have forgiven me for the manner of her death zenobia the memories rushed back in as they had not in so many years they rose up to batter and assail her and she felt the tears starting reaching out she put a reassuring hand on his gnarled old one you were never responsible father if anyone was it was i her voice shook with remembrance when you again meet with my mother tell her it is i who need her forgiveness i have never forgotten and i do not believe that i ever will i grow tired the old man said kneel my daughter kneel and let me give you my blessing she knelt and felt his hand heavy upon her head as he intoned the ancient words of blessing of their tribe when he had finished zenobia rose and bending kissed her father a final time he smiled up at her reassuringly another door closing my daughter he said with complete understanding but another door will open go through it do not be afraid always go forward and never look back those words are your heritage from me farewell child of my heart zenobia looked the old man full in the face and said i love you father farewell then she turned and never looking back went from the room zabaai ben selim died late that afternoon as the blazing sun slid below the horizon zenobias oldest brother akbar was formally and quickly proclaimed patriarch of the tribe and all came to pay him tribute even as old zabaai ben selim was placed upon his funeral pyre a pyre that burned all night while his children held vigil around the flames at dawns first light the old mans ashes were carefully gathered and formally placed in the familys tomb along the eastern caravan road for the bedawi a new era had begun zenobia bid her brothers farewell then entered her litter to be carried back to her palace for a final time aurelian awaited her a little angry you have delayed our departure he said but give me time to bathe a last time and i will be ready she promised no he said you are exhausted you have been up all night you need rest as well as a bath we will leave tomorrow before she might protest further he picked her up and carried her into her bath where he personally undressed her and helped to bathe her then he carried her back into her bedchamber and tucked her into her bed i am glad you have had the good sense not to argue with me he noted as he bent and kissed her goodnight i am somewhat stunned by your behavior zenobia said weakly i just want you full of fight when i parade you through the streets tomorrow as we leave palmyra he said a slightly wicked grin on his face she threw the thing nearest to hand at him a small statue of the little love god cupid with a harsh laugh aurelian turned and left the room feeling somewhat satisfied even if she had missed him zenobia lay back upon the soft pillows and fell asleep she slept almost around the clock awakening in the gray light of early dawn the following day slowly she stretched out feeling a delicious sense of contentment beside her the emperor appeared to slumber still he had obviously joined her in the night he was she considered becoming positively doting then aurelian destroyed her fantasy reaching out and pulling her close running his hands across her breasts to her fury she felt her body respond her breasts tightening the nipples rising up to push against the soft cotton of her chamber robe good morning goddess he breathed against her ear running his tongue around the curve of it she kept very still and said in a detached voice should we not be rising roman and preparing to leave surely we do not have much time he chuckled indulgently there is time and besides i have an unquenchable yen for you this morning when i came to bed last night you were sleeping as peacefully as a babe your pretty bottom a most tempting sight i want you goddess and i dont have to beg what i want i take then he buried his face between her breasts and breathed deeply of her the faint scent of hyacinth still clung to her warm body making her all the more enticing to him impatiently he ripped her sleeping garment away and dipping his head took a nipple in his eager mouth that is the second piece of my clothing you have torn she protested trying not to admit to the excitement he was stirring up in her body damn the man she could feel the heat beginning knew that her heartbeat was quickening then stop wearing these silly gowns to bed he said lifting his head but a moment from the sweet fruit oh the gods how i hate you she protested feeling her control beginning to go but you want me he countered yes she whispered i want you take me in your hand goddess he ordered her see how much i want you how ready i am for you she never even hesitated reaching out to grasp his mighty weapon in her hand he was warm and throbbing and so very eager for her it is yours goddess he said softly when you are ready for it it is yours then he began a sweet assault kissing her lips her breasts her belly all the while aching with his want for her as she caressed him finally zenobia could no longer bear the passion that was building within her she actually hurt with her desire please roman please now and she took his bigness in her two hands again and guided him home the pleasure the relief was incredible her body exploded with starburst after starburst of passion as he thrust again and again and again into her eager body finally the release came and with a sigh she clung to him you are magnificent he breathed with pleasure dont you care she said dont you care that i dont love you he hesitated long enough to tell her he was lying when he said no i dont care goddess i enjoy your lovely body it is enough she squirmed from his embrace and rose i must have another bath roman it will be a long time before we reach rome and i have traveled enough with the army to know there will be few amenities no mourning today zenobia i want you to wear the golden garments i will not wear mourning roman but i prefer to choose my own clothing i shall not disappoint you remember it is the last time my people shall see me and i would have them remember zenobia the queen with pride i will trust you goddess he answered at the hour appointed for their departure zenobia walked slowly through her apartments a final time although the military governor was to live in the palace he was a bachelor and there would be few rooms open in fact she suspected that he would take up actual residence in the small house that odenathus had built for her rather than in the main buildings the closed rooms would lie in lonely waiting for the return of odenathuss dynasty aurelian found her in the garden just leaving a room whose entry was overgrown with a flowering vine what is this room he asked her pushing past her to look inside it his blue eyes widened at the magnificent but very graphic paintings he saw upon the walls why have i never seen this room goddess he demanded it is a room for lovemaking i had it walled up last year she replied in a stony voice in the palace corridor its door lies beneath the fine fresco of fruits upon the wall i do not know why i did not have this entry walled over too perhaps you wanted to remember after all goddess he said with unusual insight zenobia stepped out into the sunlight of the garden once more do you approve of my costume roman she demanded quite obviously changing the subject following her he eyed her approvingly you are every inch the queen goddess you do not mind that i wear the palmyran crown i do not mind was his answer then let us go roman she said impatiently i no longer belong in palmyra and i certainly do not belong in your rome i am anxious to find out where i do belong you belong with me goddess he said and taking her arm he led her off to the main courtyard where the procession was forming she was to walk behind aurelians chariot and this time the streets of palmyra would be full to overflowing with its citizens bidding their beloved queen farewell she had been dressed in a clothofsilver kalasiris with its round neck and very short sleeves the kalasiris was smooth and molded her body making it appear as if she had been dipped in silver she wore a magnificent necklace of deeppurple topazes with equally gorgeous earrings both set in bright yellow gold a cape lined in cloth of gold its outer layer done in alternating strips of gold and silver was fastened to each shoulder of her gown by a carved purple scarab beetle set in gold her sandals were a mix of silver and gold with a polite apology gaius cicero fastened a pair of gold manacles about her delicate wrists the manacles were fastened together by a length of gold chain between them and in the chains center another length of chain stretched forth a final link attached to a special ring on the emperors own belt the emperor has promised to release you when we are clear of the city gaius cicero said caesar is too kind zenobia said sarcastically where is my daughter she is already outside the city with your servants awaiting us the emperor did not want her involved in this procession zenobia nodded but remarked bitterly he also did not want my daughters people to see her a final time the king he sent from the city like a thief in the night and now my little girl you have another son gaius cicero reminded and he it appears will remain behind to remind palmyra of odenathuss dynasty demetrius is impetuous his impetuosity will cost the boy his life you have not caught him yet gaius cicero zenobia turned her head away from the emperors aide and said nothing further the procession began and there was no more time to think if she did not keep up with the pace of aurelians horses she was in danger of being injured she looked back at her palace only once as they passed through its main gates and she remembered the first time she had entered into its courtyard it had been almost twenty years ago and she was barely more than a child she remembered alzenas frosty welcome and the lovely deliciae of whom she had been so fearful and jealous poor deliciae now widowed with her six children to care for although between odenathus and rufus curius she would certainly have no financial problems the queen stumbled then quickly brought herself back to where she was and what she was doing they were just entering palmyras great main avenue and the colonnaded streets were a sea of spectators the emperors own illyrian legion led the procession its mounted officers coming first followed by a vast sea of legionnaires all marching smartly their short red military capes flowing in the gentle breeze the sun gleaming off their polished breastplates behind them came aurelian in his chariot followed by zenobia the captive queen of palmyra and behind her representatives of the other three legions there were no slaves nor booty carts for romes emperor had been merciful to the people of palmyra only their government had suffered his wrath at the sight of their beautiful queen manacled and chained to the roman emperor the people of palmyra began to sing patriotic songs of freedom and hymns to palmyras past triumphs they flung white flowers before and upon their queen some of the delicate blossoms catching in her long flowing black hair and in the delicate golden wreath of vine leaves that crowned her finally the populace began to chant their beloved queens name and the emperors horses danced nervously as the rhythmic sound rose in volume until the entire city echoed with one word zenobia the queen felt her heart swell with pride at her peoples tribute and unbidden tears slid down her face proudly she walked behind aurelians chariot her beautiful head held high she had given most of her life to this city this great and wonderful city and she regretted nothing but the fact she had lost the final battle with rome someday she thought to herself someday as the great gods mars and venus are witness will right this wrong finally the triumphal arch of odenathus loomed before her zenobia passed beneath it and out of the city of palmyra onto the western road after they had gone a mile or so along the highway and the people were no more aurelian stopped his chariot stepped down from it and came over to his captive queen freeing her wrists wordlessly he rubbed them for the manacles had chafed her skin i apologize goddess i will have these manacles lined in lambs wool before my roman triumph i did not mean that you should be injured i never even noticed she said wonderingly he nodded your peoples farewell was indeed impressive i wish that i were capable of commanding such loyalty and love i do not understand why with so much you risked all to rebel against us had you not i might never have deposed you it is quite simple roman she answered him we were tired of answering to foreigners across a sea who knew nothing of us but our wealth we believed that we could rule the eastern empire a place that we knew far better than you romans could we could have too but alas you were stronger we will always be stronger goddess he answered her and then he fitted her up to his chariot and climbing up beside her drove off once more in three weeks they had reached antioch and here aurelian decided to pause for a few days to enjoy the pleasures of the city before moving onward antioch would be the last truly great city they saw before reaching rome several months hence strangely zenobia was more relaxed now with aurelian than she had ever been away from her city with all its familiar sights and memories and plunged into this new and fascinating environment her natural curiosity reared its head and to his amusement she kept romes emperor quite busy sightseeing the night before their departure however all that changed at dinner with the citys roman governor they were suddenly interrupted by the arrival of a messenger from palmyra the legionnaire dried blood still evident upon his body even after several days exhausted and blearyeyed stumbled into the room and croaked hail caesar zenobia felt a frightening chill of premonition speak aurelian commanded palmyra has revolted the legionnaire said the governor and the entire garrison massacred when aurelians voice was a whipcrack nine days ago caesar the governor saw at once we were outnumbered toward the end my tribune chose me from among the survivors and i made my way from the city stole a horse and followed you nooo zenobias voice was anguished who led the revolt the emperor asked but they both knew the answer prince demetrius aurelian turned to zenobia and bis eyes were icy with his anger better the boy had died in your womb he said he rose from the table and left the room zenobia quickly followed him i am coming with you she said i have no time for women and their fripperies do not speak to me as if i am only some sort of decoration for your pleasure roman she snapped at him i am zenobia the queen of palmyra i have led my armies into battle enough times to be worthy of your respect remember you captured me as i sought help for my beleaguered city you never defeated me never he swung around to face her and his stern face was terrible to behold hear me goddess whether you come with me or not will be your decision but be warned i show no further mercy to palmyra what will you do her face was pale with anguish i will destroy the city and all in it zenobia your foolish son has left me no choice i forgave palmyra its sins once because of you i will not forgive it now please she held out her hands to him in a gesture of supplication no i cannot overlook this if i allow palmyra to escape imperial wrath this time how many other cities will rebel and slaughter their roman masters i swore to rebuild the empire and by the gods i will keep that vow i would still go with you she whispered we leave in half an hour and you will have to fend for yourself there will be no servants she nodded her understanding and hurried to change her clothes during the next few days zenobia understood why the roman army had gained its fame the disciplined soldiers moved out of antioch and quickly back across the desert in less than a third of the time it had taken them to reach the city once more romes mighty military forces stood before palmyras closed gates but this time there were no negotiations when they had rested on their journey the emperor had never once come near zenobia only now when they were outside of the citys walls and preparing to give siege did she attempt to reason with him imploring him to offer her people mercy to spare the great and ancient city no he said coldly and you know my reasoning is sound i will discuss it with you no further i will give you whatever you want of me she pleaded aurelian grasped her cruelly by the arms and almost snarled through clenched teeth listen to me you silvereyed sorceress there is only one thing i want from you but i shall never have it i want your love zenobia i will give it to you she promised rashly you cannot he answered bitterly you have already given your heart goddess you have given it to marcus alexander britainus and whatever happens you will never stop loving him though you will not admit it to yourself no i will love you roman if you will but let me just spare my palmyra spare my people oh goddess he said in a more gentle tone if for one minute i believed you could give me your heart i should relent i would for i love you deeply i would overlook my duty to rome for your honest love but you cannot give it your body i can take your wit and intellect i can enjoy but you have already given your heart to another man i am sorry goddess you have not doomed palmyra palmyra has doomed itself the siege of palmyra began with enormous battering rams their heads carved like huge bulls pounding against every gate of the city until one by one the gates began to crack and give at last falling open to the tremendous onslaught romes legions poured in before long black smoke began to rise from the city as it was cruelly torched palmyras armies were terribly outnumbered although they fought valiantly soon however they fell to the vast numbers of the enemy and then the romans began their terrible slaughter of the population there were to be no prisoners no quarter was to be given children torn from their screaming mothers arms were tossed upon swords and spears women and girls as young as five were brutally and multiply raped before being murdered the men and boys of palmyra were tortured and killed the priests protesting violation of their temples sanctuary were callously disemboweled on their pristine marble floors and left to die in agony amid their own smoking entrails the horror went on for three long days and nights as the romans satisfied their fierce blood lust and avenged their slain comrades the sweetish smell of death hung over the city as the carrion birds formed black clouds in the hazy yellowed skies above onceproud palmyra when not a single living thing remained within the city the armies of rome began the final destruction systematically they worked at leveling every building that still stood every statue and monument until palmyra lay broken and battered a testimony to romes efficiency at devastation had they been able to haul away the ruins and rake the ground clean and smooth the emperor would have ordered it instead the demolished city lay as a warning to all those who would even consider rebellion against the mighty roman empire throughout it all zenobia had stood before the roman encampment watching with eyes that grew gradually duller as she saw the results of demetriuss folly she wondered absently if her younger son were dead or if he had somehow escaped the destruction there was no evidence of the bedawi anywhere and she suspected that her wise halfbrother akbar had removed the tribe when he saw what demetrius was doing no her second son was dead as were deliciae and all her family as were all of her people zenobia suddenly felt hollow and sick still she stood outside in the burning sun watching as the legionnaires carefully wrecked palmyra when it was over at last and aurelian gave the orders to depart she crept unnoticed from the encampment and into the ruins to pick up a small piece of marble from the great temple of jupiter it was the last thing she remembered for many days missing her aurelian took several men and sought zenobia he found her wandering aimlessly amid the destruction a piece of white marble that she would not be parted from clenched in her fist her eyes were sightless she did not speak although she did appear to hear him obedient to his voice she followed him back to his tent and then she collapsed into a stupor so deep that the army physicians feared not only for her sanity but for her life as well the slow trek back to antioch began the booty carts rumbling along with the army for this time palmyras treasures had been looted zenobia lay unconscious in one vehicle never moving from one hour to the next aurelian visibly worried rode by her side tending her when his other duties permitted his soldiers had never seen him this way and were amazed when they finally reached antioch zenobia was carried into the governors palace old bab and adria came running to tend their ill mistress and the queen opened her eyes for the first time in days am i dead she asked weakly no goddess aurelian said openly relieved she sighed sadly once again the gods have chosen to ignore my prayers zenobia whispered and then she fell into a deep and natural sleep she will recover the head military physician pronounced i wonder if she really will romes emperor mused and old bab looked sharply at him suddenly aware of aurelians deep feeling for her mistress she might have even felt sorry for him had she not known what he had done all of antioch already buzzed with the story of palmyras destruction the news had seemingly preceded the army upon the hot desert winds my baby has always been strong she told the emperor she should not have come he said you allowed it old bab accused like all the men who have loved her you allowed her too much freedom and perhaps this time it destroyed her perhaps but then again perhaps not will she live now he asked anxiously give me a week caesar and then ask me again came the reply aurelian nodded you may have your week old woman but do your job well i will do it as well as you did yours caesar bab snapped and aurelian laughed for the first time in many weeks appreciating the jest at his expense see that you do old woman see that you do marcus alexander did not publicly mourn carissa as his wife for she had never been a wife to him he did mourn for carissa herself however realizing that she was as much a victim of aurelians ambition as he had been upon learning of marcuss connection with zenobia the empress had not permitted him to leave the tivolirome region she was not sure what he might do if she let him go yes it was best that he be kept confined where he could cause aurelian no difficulty she felt somewhat guilty about her decision though marcus was such a decent man her own kin a roman of the old school and the gods knew that there were precious few of those available today she sighed and to salve her conscience saw that her distant cousin received all the latest war communiqués before even the senate got them thus marcus alexander britainus knew when aurelian had reached palmyra he knew when zenobia was captured he knew when vaballathus opened the citys gates to the emperor and he knew when his many friends on the council of ten were executed he knew of the young kings exile to cyrene and he knew of palmyras revolt and total destruction he lived in helpless agony as each communiqué was given him the word if grew larger in his mind with each message if only he had not left her it had never occurred to him that such tragedy would happen in his absence he shook his head at the reckless bravery that had caused zenobia to try and reach persia how like her she would not have sent her younger son or a ranking officer in her army no she would go because she felt it her duty her duty to palmyra as he had obeyed his duty to his family he had no illusions as to her fate at aurelians hands how could the emperor not desire her she was the most beautiful the most seductive the most intelligent and interesting of women he wondered if zenobia had resisted aurelian or if she now enjoyed the emperor as a bed partner the pictures that this thought raised in his mind provoked such pure fury that he could have killed but he could not decide whether it would be aurelian or zenobia or both who would fall victim to his righteous wrath dagian might have returned to britain but she now chose not to do so marcus she believed needed her far more than aulus and his family there would be time to go back but now was not the time with palmyra destroyed and gone his eastern mercantile base was gone too although marcus was not impoverished his faithful severus had seen the handwriting on the wall and taken it upon himself to sell everything marcus possessed in palmyra to another palmyran house of commerce he had left the city for rome marcuss fortune transferred safely to rome shortly before palmyras demise marcus had greeted him with pleasure when he arrived at the tivoli villa he was extremely relieved that the faithful severus had escaped palmyras fate i have saved your fortune marcus alexander the now elderly severus said proudly oh i might have gotten more for you had i stayed longer and haggled but i could see we were in for serious trouble prince demetrius would not cease his rebellion marcus nodded his head thank the gods for your instincts severus or i should have been ruined palmyra was totally destroyed yes came the reply i heard that news a sad look came into his eyes it is so terribly tragic marcus alexander i shall miss that beautiful city the queen severus what of the queen she was well the last i heard came the evasive reply you know what i am asking of you old friend marcus said low marcus alexander you know the grist from which rumors are ground i put no faith in rumors but if you would hear the chief rumor of palmyra when i left regarding the queen it was that aurelian had taken her for his woman why do you ask me you expected no less marcus had sighed and left the room we are relieved that you escaped palmyra and have come home to us safely severus dagian said you must forgive my son he is a very unhappy man i can understand that my lady came severuss understanding reply aurelian and his army drew closer and closer to rome with every passing day and with each day marcus grew more grim finally when the emperor was expected momentarily he told his mother i want my daughter i dont give a damn what that palmyran whore does but i want my daughter i recognized her as mine when she was born and now i shall claim her i will not have her raised in any house where aurelian either lives or is a frequent visitor look what he did to carissa i wont allow him to do that to my child mavia is all that i have you cannot take the child from her mother marcus dagian protested she is your grandchild mother knowing aurelians influence on carissa do you want mavia to suffer the same fate mavia has a mother marcus a very strong and wise mother aurelian will never harm the child as long as zenobia lives besides do you really believe that the queen will hand over her child to you i somehow suspect that you are not in her good graces she has no right to judge me he said pompously and you have no right to judge her my son it was you who left her and then did not even bother to send an explanation of your marriage how could i communicate with her mother you know that the emperor had me watched and every letter going from this house was intercepted and read marcus you should have sent her a message as soon as you saw the emperor was adamant in his desire that you wed carissa but you did not i am not blaming you for you were distraught not only with your fate and your sudden inability to control it but with your fathers impending death zenobia however does not know these things think of how she must have felt if she loved you as you say she did she should have known better than to believe that i would betray that love marcus muttered dagian laughed i am willing to admit that your zenobia is a paragon my son but even a paragon could not be expected to keep faith with a betrothed who marries another woman be reasonable marcus i want my daughter would you place the strain of bastardy upon mavia if you claim to be her father and insist on having the child that is what you will do you will mark her as surely as if you placed a burning brand upon her forehead even if you adopt her formally into this family she will still be remembered as the illegitimate daughter of palmyras queen and one of her roman lovers what kind of a marriage can we make for this child with that stain upon her innocent reputation have you become so callous in your own misery that you would mark your daughter in order to satisfy your own wishes he looked terribly unhappy and dagian pitied him greatly but she knew that she was right what am i to do mother he asked let us just watch the situation with zenobia marcus perhaps by the time they reach rome aurelian will have grown tired of her we dont even know what the senate plans to do with her he grew pale you do not think that they would condemn her to death do you who can predict the capricious whims of politicians dagian demanded once they have won their place in the senate they behave as if the gods themselves had placed them there only if the public outcry is dangerously great do they heed the people they serve only their own interests however if aurelian has any personal interest in the lady she may be saved serious consequences you are telling me mother that if zenobia survives imperial judgment i must regain my lost ground with her and only then can i hope to have any part in my daughters life yes marcus i am you will gain nothing i suspect by anger what if she no longer cares for me you will have to begin at the beginning with zenobia dagian said quietly you sound as if you are on her side he complained somewhat irritably dagian smiled her mouth quirking upward with her genuine amusement her lovely blue eyes twinkling let us say marcus that even having never met the lady i like the sound of her i believe she is going to make me a fine daughterinlaw stunned he gaped at her what makes you think that i will marry her now after she has been the emperors mistress dagian chuckled you men are so vain when it comes to your prowess are you afraid to be compared to aurelian my son since you conceived a daughter by zenobia i am sure the comparison is already made perhaps though you do not wish to know the results mother he was visibly embarrassed by her frankness i am sure marcus that if you forgive zenobia for being aurelians captive she will forgive you aurelians niece i never touched carissa he protested in zenobias mind it will not matter if you did or not you married her that is far worse marcus sighed with exasperation and dagian quietly left him to his thoughts he was a good man her son and she knew that he was intelligent in many matters in the matter of man and woman however dagian decided that marcus was a dunce he would learn though and providing that the senate did not condemn palmyras queen to an unfair death dagian decided that she wouldnt miss what was going to transpire between zenobia and marcus for all the world two days later aurelian and his army arrived outside of romes walls the emperor went immediately to the senate and was hailed a returning hero a triumph complete with a holiday was ordered to celebrate his victory over palmyra one rather pompous senator valerian hostilius suggested that the highlight of the day might be the public execution of the queen of palmyra in the colosseum her reputation is that of a warrior he cried in his rather flutelike voice let us dress this barbarian queen in lionskins give her a golden spear and have her fight to the death a pack of wild beasts what a spectacle it will make for the people caesar aurelian yawned then looked about the senate what a perfumed bunch he thought a fascinating suggestion valerian hostilius he said but the queen of palmyra has already suffered for her rashness in rebelling against us and once she realized her mistake she strove to give us aid once more yet you were forced to destroy the city caesar why was that this time the speaker was marcus claudius tacitus an elderly but extremely competent senator tacituss opinion would carry much weight in the senates decision i had already sent palmyras young king vaballathus into exile in the city of cyrene the queen and i had left palmyra for antioch en route back to rome unfortunately the queens younger son prince demetrius could not accept defeat and with some young friends inspired a second rebellion the queen was not responsible she returned with me to palmyra and we took our revenge she tried very hard before we originally left the city to stop her younger sons foolishness you do not think she deserves to die tacitus questioned no i do not she is a woman aurelian said scornfully it was up to her council to control her as her son the king was just a boy i executed the council for not doing their duty but palmyras queen does not deserve death tacitus turned and looked on his fellow senators the noble senator hostilius has suggested we make a death spectacle of palmyras queen i disagree with him and i agree with the emperor this woman has been a noble enemy to rome but she is now beaten her homeland destroyed her younger son dead she has paid the price of her folly now let us show the world romes beneficence after the emperors triumph is completed let us retire her to one of the states villas at tivoli she will live out her days there a forgotten woman and what greater punishment can there be for one who was once so powerful but the people love a good spectacle hostilius protested tacitus raised a bushy white eyebrow the people he said a rumble of laughter echoed around the chamber for once all the senate was in agreement hostilius sank back onto the bench feeling foolish and wishing that hed never opened his mouth it is decided then aurelian said palmyras queen will be pensioned and retired to tivoli it is agreed the senate said with one voice and a smiling aurelian left them the emperor hurried to his home upon the palatine hill he was anxious to see ulpia and to hear about carissas baby his wife however was not at the door to greet him she was it seemed ill and in her bed aurelian entered ulpias bedchamber and was shocked by her appearance she who had always been of such robust constitution was thin and wan my dear he said his voice full of concern how are you ulpia smiled joyfully at his entrance and held out her arms to him i have not been well husband but now that you are here i will feel better i know it has carissa been to see you how is she is the child a boy or a girl a shadow passed over ulpia severinas pale face carissa is dead she said bluntly she died in childbirth despite the fact that everything was done that could be done for her she had the best of care the child the child was born dead and thank the gods it was it was a monster of incredible ugliness my lord poor carissa aurelian mused but it was marcus alexander britainus that he was thinking about marcus and zenobia by the gods marcus would not have her she was his and he had no intention of letting her go he was in love he was in love for the first and only time in his entire life and the feeling was one of both heaven and hades suddenly he realized that ulpia was staring at him and you my dear he said solicitously you have obviously not been well have you seen a physician she nodded and then tears came to her eyes i have seen three they all say the same thing i have a canker in my breast and i shall die from it how long have you been ill he demanded why did you not write to me i grew ill shortly after carissas death i did not write you about it for the same reason i did not write you about carissa carissa was dead and there was nothing that you or anyone else could have done to prevent her death i am to die and there is nothing that can prevent my death the physicians did however assure me that i should live until you returned home and so i saw no need to worry you by the gods ulpia you are a perfect wife you have always been i have been most fortunate in you ulpia beamed with pleasure he could not have said anything more calculated to delight her she always had tried to please him and now with death staring her in the face the knowledge that she had sent a joyful wave of warmth coursing through her ravaged frame aurelian bent and placed a fond kiss upon ulpias brow i will leave you to rest my dear he said my triumph is just two days hence there is much to do how i wish i might see it ulpia said sadly i wish you could too but alas our house is not near the route of march and i do not think you strong enough to go ulpia sank back amid her pillows now she was truly curious as to what the queen of palmyra looked like aurelian did not seem particularly anxious for her to see his triumph and it could only be because he did not want her to see zenobia nonetheless ulpia vowed that she would she would find out who among romes patrician families had a home along the line of march and she would use her imperial prerogative and invite herself there she called for her secretary and told him what she wanted after that it was simple fabius buteo she was told had a fine home where she might watch her husbands triumph and he was overwhelmed at the honor being done him by the empresss presence on the day of aurelians triumph she was settled quite comfortably on a secondfloor balcony with the pleasant women and girls of the buteo family who chatted quite companionably with her she was offered the finest wines to keep her strength up and the choicest of delicacies the warm sun beat down there was a faint flowery breeze and in general ulpia severina felt quite well after all aurelian had not forbidden her to watch his triumph he had merely lamented that she was not strong enough to do so but she was strong enough below them the streets were crowded on both sides by the citizenry jostling with one another for a good place the vendors were busy hawking cheap wines sausages and sweetmeats to the excited population then in the distance came the sound of marching feet the rhythm of the drums that beat out the measure of the military step leading the triumph was the ninth illyrian legion aurelians own the ninth consisted of ten cohorts of six hundred men each and was led by six tribunes each riding before his own unit of cavalry the legionnaires marched with perfect precision the sun gleaming off their spotless weapons and helmets following them came the plundered wealth of palmyra in flowerbedecked carts the gold and silver booty sparkling in the clear roman light the crowds ohhed and ahhed following this came the third african legion its tribunes and centurions wearing leopardskins and a toothed leopards head to cover their own almost appearing as if they were being devoured by the beast itself their men wore the simple skin of the leopard thrown across their left shoulders without its fierce head following the third african came enormously tall black warriors their heads capped by wavy grass headpieces that swung with the rhythm of their dancing the blacks were oiled so that the sunlight made them appear even darker and about their loins they wore a covering made from the blackandwhitestriped skin of some exotic animal they brandished their carved spears in mock ferocity much to the delight of the watching children along the route now came what all of the citizenry had awaited so eagerly the emperor who had given rome such a great victory aurelian himself drove the magnificent triumphal chariot an incredible piece of workmanship the vehicle was all overlaid in gold leaf over the raised figures of mars the god of war in a scene of an olympian triumph the chariot was drawn by four magnificent white stallions each more vicious than the next but kept well in hand by the emperor who was acknowledged to be one of the empires finest drivers aurelian was dressed as befitted a triumphant soldieremperor he wore a purpleandgoldembroidered tunica palmata that reached to his ankles and over that the official robe of the emperor a toga picta also of tyrian purple and embroidered with gold both garments were of the finest silk upon his feet the emperor wore a highsoled strapped shoe of gilt leather laced with hooks and decorated with a bejeweled crescentshaped buckle behind him stood his personal body slave of many years dressed simply in a naturalcolored tunic and holding the laurel wreath of victory over the emperors blond head remember the slave intoned with regularity thou art but a man remember thou art but a man this ancient custom of the triumph was supposed to keep the victorious general humble with the constant reminder of his mortality ulpia looked with pride upon her husband as he came into view then she along with the other ladies of the buteo family let out a collective gasp of shock behind aurelians magnificent chariot came the queen of palmyrastark naked ulpia felt sick with shame that her husband would do such a thing to any woman let alone the gallant captive queen of palmyra how could he have been so cruel so brutal look at the hussy the wife of fabius buteo snipped she does not even lower her eyes in shame but stares straight ahead her arrogant head held high she is incredibly beautiful mother said the eldest buteo daughter a gentle matron how awful for her then she turned apologetically to the empress i mean no disrespect my lady i only her soft voice died away i agree with you my dear the empress said quietly how awful for her still the women watching zenobia were envious of her they could not help it here was a woman who had borne her late husband three children and yet her body was that of a young girl her breasts firm globes of perfection thrust boldly forth her wellshaped arms and legs were in perfect proportion to her tall height she had only a faintly rounded belly and her buttocks were round and firm around her slender neck she wore a magnificent necklace of pigeons blood rubies that set off her palegolden skin and her flowing blueblack hair her higharched feet were shod in the faintest wisps of red leather sandals she held her arms before her as her slender wrists were imprisoned by the golden manacles she had worn when she left palmyra true to his word aurelian had had them lined in soft lambs wool so they would not chafe her tender skin aurelian she wanted to kill him as she walked so bravely along neither looking to the right or the left hearing none of the lewd comments sent her way by the populace of rome that they hadnt rushed out to fondle her was only due to the fact that she was well guarded by a maniple of sixty men aurelian didnt mind showing off his new possession to all of rome but they might not touch that which was the emperors toy she had almost begun to like him but thank the gods he had reverted to type so she might hate him again and plot his downfall with a clear conscience no matter how kind he had been before this damnable triumph no matter how kind he would be afterward for he would be kind again they had quarreled that morning because he had wanted her small daughter mavia to walk with her behind his chariot she had screamed and railed at him for the suggestion forbidding him to even come near the child threatening mayhem if he so much as touched her little daughter what kind of a monster was he she had demanded to attempt such brutality upon an innocent baby the trauma could destroy mavia who had lived through the first siege of palmyra and still had bad dreams in the end the emperor had relented and mavia was taken on ahead to the villa in tivoli that would be her new home aurelian however was furious for zenobias anger had come not in private but before his officers when she had appeared for his triumph dressed in her gold and silver garments he had furiously torn them from her beautiful body in front of all of his officers stating that it was his wish she walk in his triumph nude wearing only her ruby necklace and her sandals she had been shocked by his actions but had looked him straight in the eye and said in her mocking voice as caesar commands he had looked as if he wanted to hit her then and there but instead he had replied as mockingly yes goddess as caesar commands for you it will always be as caesar commands and should caesar order you to couple with his entire ninth illyrian you would have to do so because caesar would command remember that his triumph was the hardest thing she had ever done in her entire life but he would never know it for her face and carriage were proud and defiant gaius cicero had been visibly embarrassed as he had fastened the golden manacles around her wrists she had come close to giggling hysterically at him because he was in such a quandary as to where to look next and his eyes kept coming fascinated back to her marvelous breasts with their dark honeycolored nipples when he had led her from the emperors tent however all mirth left her four entire legions had gaped at her beauty and she saw many glances of lustful envy its a wonder one of his men doesnt assassinate him just to possess that woman one tribune muttered softly to another but she heard for a moment she thought she might be sick for her stomach churned violently bile rising up to the base of her throat before she was able to gain control of herself and swallow it back down again despite the warm day she was cold a coldness only intensified by the gentle breeze that brushed against her body faintly damp with a sheen of perspiration briefly her legs were weak and she was unable to move for the shame and then she slowly lifted her head and saw him staring at her his lips curled in a faint smile of triumph zenobia took a deep breath as the sweet air filled her lungs strength filled her soul and her silvery eyes mocked him back the queen closed her ears to everything about her and looking straight ahead took her place behind the emperors chariot that was the trick she realized with sudden clarity to notice nothing to hear nothing as she walked she sang songs in her head and focused her eyes upon the chariot ahead of her never looking either to the right or the left she did not see the mob with its envious lustful pitying vengeful and cruel glances she did not hear the ribald even filthy comments hurled her way she was zenobia the queen of palmyra and could not be humbled by mere romans marcus alexander stood amid the front rank of the crowd near the senate and when he saw her his heart leapt within his chest then realizing that she had been forced to walk naked before plebes and patricians alike his anger toward the emperor burned hot almost consuming him where he stood zenobia beloved aching with her shame he called to her with his heart there was much he owed aurelian for what the emperor had done to their lives and he intended to repay him in full measure for measure marcus alexander britainus could no longer fool himself he loved zenobia he would love her always once he had told her that he had loved her from the beginnings of time and that he should love her until long after their memories had faded from the earth in his disappointment and his anger he had believed that that had changed but nothing had changed he loved her he wanted her for his wife still and by the gods he would have her if he had to strangle aurelian with his bare hands turning he pushed his way through the crowds and walked back to his chariot grimly he drove back along the via flaminia to tivoli and to his waiting mother did you see her were dagians first words as he entered the villa garden all of rome saw her marcus said furiously aurelian made her walk nude the bastard dagians usually pale skin lightened even more the poor thing she said poor he laughed harshly praise the gods that zenobia is prouder than venus herself she walked like the queen she is her head held high her eyes straight ahead if aurelian meant to humble her he only forced her to build her defenses higher she wont forgive him the insult mother and you marcus do you forgive her he had to laugh yes mother but i beg you in the name of all the gods i know and those that i dont never to tell her that you were right there is nothing to forgive and ive been a fool whatever aurelian thinks zenobia is not his she is not yours either my son i know that mother i am the one who must ask the forgiveness of zenobia dagian smiled at last you grow wise marcus she said do you think i have a chance to regain her mother who can predict a womans heart marcus dagian said wisely we must remember all the suffering that she has undergone at romes hands i sense that zenobia will not forgive that easily had dagian however seen zenobia at the very moment she spoke she would have been astonished having reached the senate buildings and the end of aurelians formal triumph palmyras queen was wrapped in a cloak by the emperor himself and led inside to hear the senates judgment on her the senate recognizing their captives bravery applauded her wildly as she entered their chamber and with a soft smile upon her lips zenobia accepted their tribute with all the graciousness she possessed it had been a far better show than if they had pitted her in the arena against the beasts and they were all now quite pleased with their decision to grant her life and pension her off she would be an interesting addition to their jaded social life now after she thanked them for their mercy a faint smile of amusement upon her lips the emperor bundled her off then returned to escort the senate to the public games that he was sponsoring this day to honor his triumph in the east taking senator tacitus by the arm the emperor led them forth from the senate since the distance between the forum and the colosseum was not great they walked and the populace gave way to them as they came forward cheering aurelian who had given them this day off and free food and entertainment zenobia awaited aurelian at the colosseum and together they entered the imperial box seeing them all rome rose to its feet and cheered the handsome emperor in his purple and gold robes his beautiful captive queen an exquisite vision now in a simple white silk kalasiris a jeweled collar of silver set with rich turquoiseblue persian lapis resting upon her chest she had dressed to please the roman crowds with carved silver snake bracelets on her arms and chunks of persian lapis hanging from her ears they would never forget her nude beauty of this morning but her magnificent attire equally pleased them her fantastic clothofsilver cape blew in the afternoon breeze and once she and aurelian had finished acknowledging the crowds she removed it suddenly at the back of the box a small commotion arose and zenobia turned to see a woman being helped into the box by senator tacitus she was of medium height and had a faded prettiness about her who is that woman she asked the emperor he turned and swore softly beneath his breath then he rose and assisted the woman forward to seat her at the front of the box majesty he said to zenobia may i present my wife the empress ulpia severina before zenobia could speak ulpia said welcome to rome queen of palmyra thank you zenobia replied you should not have come my dear aurelian scolded gently she has not been well he said then to zenobia i saw your triumph ulpia said ignoring aurelians concern i requested that the buteo family who have a large home along the triumphal way allow me access to see the procession i was shocked my lord at the way in which you displayed this captive queen all decent people were had not queen zenobia the dignity she has it would have been far worse zenobia instantly felt a liking for the empress and reaching out she put a hand upon the womans arm it is over now ulpia severina and i would not have you distressed on my account ulpias sad brown eyes met those of zenobia and instantly the two women understood one another poor soul zenobia thought she loves aurelian and although he may respect her and be kind to her he does not care for her one way or the other how hard it is to live without love zenobia found the games boring and the blood lust of the roman population quite disgusting she had never been afraid in battle but watching the colosseum audience leaning forward in their seats so as not to miss any of the gore was revolting there they were for the most part a useless lazy bunch living off the dole almost salivating with delight as they condemned the losers in the games to death turning from the games she spoke for some time with the elderly tacitus until finally she demanded of aurelian must i remain through this whole thing you are part of the spectacle goddess he said forgetting about ulpia who sat listening i would have thought that i had provided enough of a spectacle for your romans today she snapped at him i find your games tedious and appalling roman let me go to wherever it is you are sending me i far prefer the quiet of the country to this pesthole of a city aurelian looked annoyed but he realized that zenobia had taken as much as she was going to this day to further impress his will upon her was going to result in a scene and when zenobia chose to make a scene he invariably ended up looking the fool this morning burned yet in his memory he turned to the empress you prepared a pleasant villa in tivoli for the queen my dear i have seen to it my lord ulpia replied smoothly although i could not oversee the preparation personally she turned to zenobia i trust you will be happy there majesty it is not palmyra zenobia said softly but i shall never go home so i suppose that i will be happy in your tivoli i thank you for all your kindness ulpia severina ulpia smiled at zenobia and the queen rose discreetly saying to the emperor there is no need for you to leave your games roman gaius cicero can easily escort me can you not gaius with pleasure majesty the emperors aide said i bid you good day marcus claudius tacitus i have enjoyed your company greatly and if i am permitted visitors i hope that you will visit me often at my villa in tivoli the elderly senator rose and bowed in a courtly fashion to zenobia my time with you has been far too short today majesty i will come and visit you whether you are allowed visitors or not i have a villa in tivoli myself and the heat in rome will soon be too much to bear i will see you soon i promise you when zenobia had left the emperors box the senator turned to aurelian and said you are right caesar she is too lovely and too intelligent to die what a waste had we followed valerian hostiliuss obscene suggestion ulpia turned to tacitus and just what did senator hostilius suggest she asked his suggestion was that we dress queen zenobia in animal skins give her a spear and have her fight a pack of wild beasts in the arena hostilius was ever a fool the empress snapped in a rare show of irritation then you are glad that the senate spared the queens life my dear aurelian asked ulpia looked directly at her husband and said yes my lord i am glad that they spared her life her level gaze told the emperor what he wanted to know that she was giving him permission to amuse himself with zenobia dearest ulpia aurelian mused in a generous burst of fondness she was so thoughtful so discreet he regretted that she was dying but then perhaps he would take zenobia for his second wife he was certainly not going to let anyone else have her he saw the envy in the eyes of the men who looked upon her he knew that they hoped he would toss her aside as he had done with so many others and when he did then they would vie for her until she chose another protector it would not happen though he would marry zenobia when ulpia died there was no need to divorce his wife for she would be dead soon enough and zenobia was going nowhere she was his imperial captive and would be safe in tivoli the imperial captive could hardly wait to leave the city she found rome overwhelmingly dirty and noisy she would be happy to live in a quieter setting one much better suited to raising mavia how long will it take us to reach tivoli she asked gaius cicero it will take several hours majesty he answered her it is almost twenty miles from the city and the litter bearers can only go so quickly what about a chariot gaius cicero a chariot majesty yes a chariot i drove my own war chariot in palmyra and if i might have a chariot now we could get there in half the time or less couldnt we he thought a moment and then said indeed we could majesty the emperor only ordered that i escort you he did not say what sort of vehicle we should use gaius cicero drove as they left the city but once they were safely on the via flaminia he let zenobia have the reins the horses however almost drove themselves as the road was straight and well paved zenobia was fascinated by the landscape around her it was so very very different from what she had known all her life the desert was endless but here the land was broken up by hills and rivers the desert landscape was golden and blue but here the land was lushly green with summer as well as gold and blue here and there were patches of brightred roof tiles or black earth in newly tilled fields where second crops were already being planted even the air was different the desert air was dry but this had a soft moistness to it that felt good on her skin they drove in silence for what seemed a very short time and then gaius cicero was taking the reins from her we will soon be entering tivoli he said loudly over the wind that rushed past their ears with the speed they were making she nodded the road now wound up into the mountains the sabines he told her and below them stretched the campagna di roma a vast and undulating plain filled with many jewellike little lakes most within the craters of extinct volcanoes zenobia caught her breath at the beauty of it all then they were entering the town of tivoli perched on a slope of the sabines with a magnificent view of the campagna and beyond it rome itself zenobia was delighted for tivoli was exquisite a whitemarble town surrounded by olive groves tivoli gaius cicero told her was famous for its vast deposits of travertine marble the quarries were located in the mountains just behind the town and although the marble was exported to the rest of italy the entire town had been built of it zenobia was pleased to see that it was a busy place with several attractive openair markets an arena and a theater located along the river anio which edged one side of the town your villa is located just outside the town majesty gaius cicero told her it is on the river itself all the imperial villas are they were shortly there as zenobia was dismounting the chariot bab and adria appeared and mavia who came running with her arms outstretched to her mother oh mama it is so beautiful here the little girl exclaimed mavia was now six it is not at all like palmyra can you be happy here my pigeon zenobia asked hugging her daughter oh yes mama then we will have to stay zenobia teased taking the childs hand and entering into the house gaius cicero you will take some refreshment with us and if i may i will offer you hospitality for the night the wine i will accept majesty gaius cicero said but your hospitality i must decline the emperor said i might go home after i did my duty by you i have not seen my wife and children in over a year majesty i understand gaius cicero zenobia said politely and then she nodded to bab to see that the emperors aide had refreshment he quaffed it down with almost indecent haste and quickly took his leave zenobia chuckled she did not doubt that he wished to be with his wife tonight gaius cicero was one of the few imperial officers who did not indulge himself with the camp whores neither had he kept a mistress then too she could imagine his position if he should spend the night under the same roof as her and aurelian found out his military career would be destroyed not to mention the danger to his personal safety well she said to her servants little mavia having been taken off by her nurse charmian is it livable it is not the palace in palmyra bab said but we are lucky not to be in prison or in our funeral urns is it habitable zenobia said looking about for it certainly appeared a pleasant place it is somewhat smaller than we are used to majesty adria said there are two stories to the house she continued on this level is the atrium where we stand and there is a nice interior garden beyond it should be a pleasant place on winter days there is also a fine large garden out back that goes down to the river there is a kitchen a dining room and a small library on the second level there is a bath and two bedchambers what of the servants quarters zenobia asked they are separate from the house majesty it will not do zenobia said you and bab cannot live in slave quarters there is a nice room off the kitchen majesty but the cook tells me that the slaves use that room to eat and rest when they are not going about their chores more than likely they use that room to hide from their duties zenobia noted just what i thought old bab said theyre a lazy lot from what ive observed so far my baby then we shall have the emperor replace them zenobia said with a laugh that room off the kitchen sounds just perfect for you and adria i hope you will not mind sharing a room but we are obviously cramped and i want you both here with me shall i give orders to have the room cleared and beds brought for adria and me bab asked send the majordomo to me the queen said and a few minutes later when the man stood before her zenobia gave the orders to remove whatever furniture was in the room by the kitchen and bring sleeping couches for her two serving women why can your women not sleep in the slave quarters like everyone else the majordomo demanded because zenobia said they are not slaves and i want them here in the house with me hear me well crispus if you should ever question my orders again i will punish you my orders will be obeyed without question go now and do my bidding will the emperor be coming tonight bab asked i do not know old woman but if he does not i shall send him a message tomorrow demanding that all the slaves in this villa be replaced i will not suffer rudeness from a slave come out into the garden majesty adria said and see how fair it is it will cool your anger zenobia smiled at the girl let us go adria and see this garden that so delights you the three women walked through the villas interior garden and out into the rear of the building zenobia gasped with delight at the foot of the garden the blue river flowed merrily by and across it the mountains rose green and fair upstream a magnificent waterfall ran white and frothing over the high rocks and plunged in a wide crystal ribbon into the river below the garden itself was neatly laid out in colorful flower beds all accessible by the crushed white marble paths zenobia saw roses and lilies in profusion along with sweet herbs and small fruit trees there were violets both purple and white and sweet pink stock and brightly colored wall flowers within the beautiful garden it would be a lovely place for mavia to play there were several large shade trees nearer the river and some marble benches for sitting you are right adria it is lovely you will see majesty that we are separated from the neighboring villas by a low wall and although we can see our neighbors no one may intrude unless we invite them good day to you came the voice from across the wall and the three women turned startled there stood a tall and very beautiful woman i am dagian the empresss friend it was my pleasure to prepare the villa for you queen zenobia i hope it is satisfactory she walked over to the waisthigh wall zenobia moved over to the wall and smiled at the woman i thank you lady dagian the villa is a bit small but it will be most comfortable i am sure i do however wish to remove the slaves there and replace them with my own people i am sure dagian said that all you need do is inform the emperor of your wishes and he will give his permission zenobia looked closely at the woman to see if her remark was merely a statement or a sly innuendo but dagians face was as smooth as a mill pond will you join us lady dagian in a cup of wine the queen asked politely i should like that the older woman replied and walking to a small gate that was set within the wall she opened it and came through bab adria see to the wine and have a table brought i have an urge to sit in the garden the two servants hurried off to do their mistresss bidding zenobia indicated with her hand a nearby marble bench and invited dagian to sit are you also an imperial captive she asked of sorts was the reply i come from a land to the west and for many years i was married quite happily to a wealthy roman when my husband died almost two years ago the emperor forced me to remain here in rome in order to blackmail my eldest son into doing something he did not want to do thats aurelian zenobia replied bitterly you do not like the emperor i despise him she said oh i know lady dagian you have heard that i am the emperors mistress and it is true but like you i have been blackmailed my eldest son and his family live now in cyrene under imperial protection my little daughter and i have been brought here under the emperors personal care like you i have no choice mothers are vulnerable creatures dagian nodded fully understanding zenobias position but wondering how well marcus would for all his assurances to her obviously palmyras lovely queen did not realize that she was the mother of marcus alexander britainus and dagian thought that perhaps that fact was better left unknown for the present then she caught her breath as a small child emerged from the villa followed by a nursemaid the little girl ran across the garden and up to zenobia with a smile the queen caught the child to her and kissed her and the affection between the two caught at dagians heart it was as she had suspected zenobia was a good and loving mother if marcus wanted his daughter back he would have to win her mother over first zenobia looked up and said this is my daughter the princess mavia mavia this is the lady dagian the little girl looked up and dagian felt her heart contract the look was marcuss could not zenobia see that look was that of her new acquaintance also how do you do princess mavia dagian said softly lady dagian the little girl replied i am pleased to meet you you have blue eyes as i do i have met few people with eyes the color of mine marcus had blue eyes like mine but he went away mavia zenobia sharply reproved her daughter it is not polite to mention peoples personal appearances dagian longed to take the precious child upon her lap and kiss her not only did she have marcuss deepblue eyes but she had his chestnutcolored hair as well it was a wonder that aurelian hadnt made the connection but perhaps he had she shivered the slaves arrived with a small table which they placed in front of the marble bench and bab came carrying the wine and adria behind her the goblets the old womans mouth was set in disapproval as she set down the wine in palmyra she said we would not have given our slaves wine like this i do not understand dagian said distressed i gave orders that the finest falernian be bought for you i ordered it myself in the town at the wine merchants shop bab held out a goblet into which she had already poured some of the beverage taste my lady dagian is this what you purchased dagian sipped the wine and her face was a study in quick anger her mouth made a little moue and she spat the wine she had taken onto the grass this is awful she said furiously either the wine merchant tried to cheat me or the slaves have stolen what i bought and replaced it with inferior wine hoping you would not notice across the garden hurried the majordomo full of importance as puffed up as a frog the emperor comes he announced crispus dagian said severely this is not the wine that i bought from the shop of veritus pomponio i suspect that you and your cohorts have stolen that wine now the emperor comes and how can the queen serve him such swill the majordomo blanched and fell to his knees help us lady dagian we can return the wine you bought but not now you deserve to be flayed alive but the queen must not be embarrassed she rose and smiling at zenobia murmured i shall send one of my slaves over with some good vintage for aurelian and i will see you tomorrow if it pleases you yes zenobia said it will please me if you comeand thank you she too rose and escorted her new friend to the garden gate that separated their villas goodbye lady dagian little mavia piped up dagian turned and bending kissed the child on the top of her head goodbye little princess she said before hurrying through the gate into her own garden when she turned back zenobia and mavia were already hurrying hand in hand across the garden toward the villa dagian paused beneath a tall shade tree and breathed deeply she had not dreamed that she should see her granddaughter so soon she remembered marcus that was good perhaps the child would be the bridge that joined her two proud and stubborn parents how beautiful palmyras queen was dagian thought she was quite different from both roman and british women yet the golden skin the blueblack hair and the stormgray eyes combined with her marvelously aristocratic features to make her fairer than any female dagian could ever remember seeing she was intelligent dagian realized and that would have attracted marcus as well zenobia before reentering her own villa had looked back across the gardens dagian seemed a pleasant woman the queen mused but was she someone whom she might trust i need a friend zenobia said to herself she was so alone here hail caesar mavia lisped and zenobia turned to see aurelian standing within the entry of the house go to charmian child zenobia ordered yes mama was the obedient reply and mavia was gone you never give me a chance to really know her goddess are you afraid i will corrupt her i never know what you will do roman zenobia said coldly you are angry about the triumph he said i was paraded the length of rome naked for all to see yet i have not humbled you have i proud bitch he reached out for her but zenobia skillfully evaded him and brushing past him gained the inner garden do not touch me roman not now not ever jupiter she wanted to get away from him but she didnt know where to go it was an infuriating situation oh goddess are we to fight again i thought we had done with fighting his voice was very patient hear me roman i will be your whore because there is no other choice for me but i will never forget your actions toward me today so you will be my whore he said softly but his narrowed glittering eyes belied the gentleness of his voice you will be my whore because you have no other choice if it is choice you desire my beautiful goddess let me assure you that every patrician with a pair of balls between his legs would like me to pass you on to him when i am tired of you i am not tired of you but if it would please you i can do as the emperor caligula once did and indeed make a whore of you how would you like to spend your nights servicing every rich and randy cock in rome she looked into his eyes and was suddenly afraid because she saw in them a terrible determination he would make her whore with every man in rome if in the end she returned to him pliant and obedient his woman and his woman alone no she said low no i should not like it roman oh how she hated him for making her feel so helpless she who had ruled an empire he delighted in it the bastard where is your room he demanded zenobia looked at him and then began to laugh i do not know she said the tears rolling down her cheeks at the absurdity of the situation he was ready to assert his rights in reality to rape her and she had absolutely no idea of where her bed was havent you inspected the house yet he was looking outraged there was no time she said i arrived and there was difficulty with the slaves i want to replace them tomorrow roman then i went to see the gardens and the woman in the next villa a friend of the empresss came from next door zenobia shrugged helplessly i have not seen the house at all i did not realize that you would arrive so quickly i left the games shortly after you did goddess without you they were boring i had to see the empress safely to the palatine palace you should have stayed with her roman she is ill even i can see she does not have a great deal of time left to live and she loves you how can you leave her ulpia is a soldiers wife she is used to being without me because she is a soldiers wife makes it no easier to be without the man she loves she has accepted her lot but how it must hurt her roman how cruel you are he moved close to her and his hands gripped her upper arms i would not be cruel to you goddess all i want to do is love you why will you not love me beloved beloved she turned her head to hide the quick tears that damped her eyes i have told you before roman that i shall never put myself into the keeping of any man again be satisfied that you have my body it is all i can ever give you butyou never give zenobia aurelian said i must always take even now you steel yourself for the assault you assume is about to come he pulled her chin about so that she was forced to look at him just once goddess i would like your kiss to be a willing one not sparked by lust but rather caring never it was said quietly then i must take what i can get from you goddess he said and his mouth covered hers in a fierce possessive kiss she shuddered wildly and then to the amazement of them both zenobia began to cry great wracking sobs of pure anguish every agony of the last months shook her slender frame the terrible destruction of palmyra her separation from vaba and flavia longinuss death the loss of demetrius all of it welled up within her and poured forth and she was unable to stop it she was tired of fighting tired of responsibility plain bone tired for the first time in zenobias life she wanted to be free of it all she wanted to be taken care of he saw it in her face in her eyes and knew that now if he were clever he might have her as he had always wanted her she was more vulnerable than he had ever seen her than she had ever been in her entire life he suspected aurelian held her gently and stroked her shining dark hair there beloved he soothed her there my beautiful goddess do not weep my love do not weep he caught her face between his hands and bending kissed her mouth again but with tenderness this time he kissed her shut eyelids her cheeks her nose and her chin before returning to her mouth once more but this time his lips were more demanding and to his pleasure she returned his kiss not from lust but from need he gathered her up into his arms and she nestled against his shoulder still sobbing with firm steps he walked through the interior garden and into the atrium of the house seeing them bab threw up her hands in distress but the emperors stern look warned her to be silent as he made his way up the stairs to the second floor and into her bedroom at the end of the hall gently he laid her upon the bed then sat down next to her i cannot bear to see you weep he said low tell me what you want of me zenobia i will do anything to make you happy but she only wept on softer now yet still she wept reaching out he ran his hand down her trembling body and she murmured with an almost shy pleasure that intrigued him he carefully removed her jeweled collar the snake bracelets and her earrings next he slowly undid and drew off her sandals massaging her feet until she almost purred with a smooth almost lingering movement he pushed the white silk kalasiris upward revealing long golden legs smooth thighs sweetly rounded belly tempting breasts the kalasiris slipped easily over zenobias head and arms and the emperor then dropped it carelessly by the bedside he bent and kissed each breast causing her nipples to stand tall as he raised his head he found that she was looking at him her eyes wide and wet the lashes stuck together her mouth quivered and then she said so low that he had to bend to hear her love me roman please love me and make it all better i can no longer bear the pain and will you love me goddess or will you simply take from me he demanded softly of her i will give she replied only take the pain away he stood and slowly removed his own clothing his passionate eyes never leaving hers he might have fallen on her like a beast upon a helpless lamb for his own desire was great and he feared that she might suddenly come to her senses instead he exerted his great willpower and moved slowly and quietly returning to the bed he lay next to her and held her hand i have adored you from the moment i first saw you zenobia i love you my fair goddess and never have i made that statement to any woman when ulpia has left this world for the next you will marry me and i shall make you queen of the mighty roman empire not just a small piece of it but all of it stretching from persia to the farthest outposts of wild britain you are a rare and perfect jewel my beloved and now you are mine alone i will make you happy zenobia i swear by all the gods if you will but let me i shall make you the happiest woman alive he raised himself up on one elbow and looked down upon her her eyes were shut but he knew that she heard him i want you to make love to me goddess he said quietly and then he lay back waiting for a few very long minutes they lay side by side then she raised herself up and bent to touch his mouth with a sweet kiss he reached out and lifted her up so that she found herself sitting upon his loins zenobia blushed the blood rushing up to stain her palegold cheeks a soft apricot pink she was long past girlhood and yet she felt untutored and shy she wasnt quite sure what he expected of her aurelian chuckled with amusement at her obvious chagrin what goddess you never made love to your husband or your lover touch me zenobia dont you like it when i touch you hesitantly she reached out and put her hand upon his chest he held his breath slowly she explored the muscles beneath her fingertips the softness of his skin she sighed her touch inflamed him wildly yet he held himself in check w atching her through slitted eyes she was not yet roused herself but she was curious and perhaps a little frightened reaching out he caressed one of her marvelous breasts taking a finger and running it sensuously around the nipple to encourage her you are so beautiful he crooned so very very beautiful zenobia he felt her relax a bit more and she shifted her weight leaning forward to brush her breasts against his chest matching her hardening nipples with his and rubbing against him in a provocative movement stretching his arms out he gently seized the cheeks of her bottom and drew her closer fondling her caressing her beginning to stir the embers of her desire oh yes goddess he murmured against her ear and she shivered as his warm breath touched her he was being so gentle she thought so kind all he wanted was to love her for her to love him in return it didnt mean that she had to trust him she could never really trust any man again but he was willing to take the pain away in exchange for her devotion she didnt really love him but she could pretend all she had to do was stop fighting him to relax and enjoy making love to him to make him believe that she cared her stubborn pride had brought her to this she mused and she was tired of hurting she felt his staff hard and pushing against her as if it had a separate life of its own zenobia moved back and raising herself carefully caught him in her hand and guided him into her softness surprised by her sudden action he could only gasp with delight as she gently rode him then he put his arms about her rolled her over and rode her slowly he pushed himself into her sheath slowly he withdrew himself repeating the movement until her relaxed body began to shudder with the splendor of her orgasm each movement of his weapon seemed to drive deeper and she moaned with undiluted pleasure straining to reach greater heights finally falling away in a shower of stars while his body joined hers in fulfillment the terrible tension and ache gone from her frame zenobia fell into a peaceful sleep at her side the emperor considered the events of the last few minutes she had been so sweet so totally and incredibly sweet in her surrender this was how he had always dreamed she would be with him and at last the gods had answered his prayers she was not broken he knew but he believed that she was at last his he need have no fear of any man even marcus alexander britainus aurelian slept secure for the first time since he had taken zenobia for his own they slept for several long hours and zenobia awoke first she lay quietly remembering her mood of several hours ago remembering what had passed between herself and aurelian she had not really promised him anything and yet she had but could she love him no the word slammed into her brain she could not he had taken from her almost everything that she held dear and sacred still she must survive to be revenged and mavia must be protected if she suddenly scorned romes emperor after he opened himself to her he would surely kill her what are you thinking of zenobia he asked her his voice tearing at the silence of how kind you were to me last night she replied i love you he said simply i know she replied and he did not push her further than that the dawn was not even beginning to stain the east yet he said let us bathe the slaves are not yet up she protested we will wake them he returned no she said we will bathe each other roman and she arose naked from the bed turning slightly she glanced over her shoulder at him her look provocative and she held out her hand to him well are you coming he could feel his need for her stirring already but he fought his urges back down and taking her hand stood up and followed her the bath which was located next door to zenobias chamber was eerily silent its oil lamps flickering and casting shadows upon the frescoed walls depicting scenes of nymphs being pursued by the usual satyrs and centaurs she chuckled and pleased by the warmth of the sound aurelian asked what amuses you my love the walls roman they are so typical one may not expect originality in a stateowned villa he teased her must i remain in this villa perhaps at a later date we can discuss a larger home for you goddess but for now you will stay here as you will she answered him and then reaching for the porcelain jar of soft soap she scooped some out with three fingers and began to spread it over him she worked slowly her hands smoothing the soap into a rich cream as they moved in everwidening circles over his hard body he began to feel a delicious contentment at her touch and almost fell back asleep standing in the bath she roused him from his reverie rinsing him off with several jars of warmed water and the command go and soak in the hot tub now roman do i not get to wash you goddess he asked you will catch a chill standing here she protested i will wash you he said ending the matter and then he took the soap from the jar and began to imitate her motions of a few moments earlier turning her so that her back was to him he rubbed soap over her belly and upward to her breasts cupping those sweet fruits in his palms his thumbs gently rubbing around her erect nipples she stood very still barely breathing as his hands moved with familiarity over her graceful form finally he rinsed her and together they entered the hot tub what will you do here in rome he asked perhaps you should have thought of that before you brought me here she smiled i imagine however that i shall do what all new residents of the city do i shall sightsee and i shall try to make friends there will be many only too eager to make friends with you zenobia he answered beware of becoming involved in any political factions goddess there will be those who will seek to use you for rome is a sewer of intrigue she looked at him somewhat amused i did not rule palmyra all those years by not being aware of what went on around me rome has ever been a hotbed of conspiracy you change emperors with the regularity of a popular courtesan changing lovers until now he said i am the new rome zenobia i am leading my people back to the old ways the right ways thanks to me the empire is strong again and it will grow stronger with each passing day my heirs will be the new caesars your heirs you have no children roman of course there is your nieces child isnt there suddenly zenobia wondered if it had been ambition that had caused marcus to betray her my nieces child for a brief moment he was puzzled and then he realized that she had meant carissa by the gods she must not know that both carissa and her infant had perished and that marcus alexander britainus was a free man suddenly aurelians old insecurities rose up to haunt him and he quickly said yes there is that child but perhaps goddess we might have a child because ulpia has been barren all these years does not mean i might not have a son by you he leaned over and placed a kiss upon her wet shoulder cleopatra had had children by her roman lovers zenobia thought and those children had all met unfortunate ends at the hands of the empire for they stood in the way of those who wanted power aurelian sank his strong white teeth into her golden shoulder and muttered think of it goddess what a child i could get from your loins he would rule the world he was actually beginning to believe he might sire a child on this woman suddenly irritated zenobia shook him off and climbed from the heated tub i do not know if i want any more children she said it is not your decision to make goddess he said almost smugly when ulpia dies i shall make you my empress until then i will continue to pump my seed into your belly and i will make offerings to the gods praying for a son to come forth from your womb zenobia laughed the sound a bitterly amused one that echoed about the tiled and frescoed walls of the bath the gods have deserted me and mine roman your prayers will be in vain then she walked from the caldarium of the bath and he heard her splashing in the frigidarium next door aurelian now stood up and came from the hot tub himself looking down he saw that his lance was hard straight and very ready he longed to move quickly into the next room and take her then and there upon the cold tiles of the bath floor but instead he stood quietly breathing deeply willing his desire away he wanted her as he had had her last night warm and willing and pleading with him he was tired of the virago she could be and he preferred her sweetness she was gone from the frigidarium when he entered it and so he quickly plunged into the cool waters of the pool and refreshed himself returning to their bedchamber he found her still nude but dry creaming herself with a marvelously rich lotion that was scented with hyacinths wordlessly he took the palegreen glass bottle from her hand poured some of the liquid into his own hands and rubbed them together then began to massage her slowly she was still stiff with her anger and he said softly persuasively would it be such a terrible thing to give me a child goddess i love you so very much but i do not love you roman i am trying to please you but i cannot will my emotions and i will not lie to you the child will bring us closer together he said as if it was already a certainty when you hold our son in your arms when you put him to your milkfilled breasts as did proper roman matrons of old then zenobia will your heart be filled with love for me i know it he turned her about and kissed her passionately willing her to respond and suddenly zenobia was filled with compassion for him pulling her head away she looked up into his blue eyes and said oh aurelian even you have a weakness i had not believed it until now yes zenobia i have a weakness i crave immortality and only through my descendants may i have that immortality give me a son goddess give me a sonhe swept her up then and laid her upon their bed sprawling near her pushing his way between her legs to moisten with his tongue that soft and most secret of places to prepare her for his entry when he entered her she enfolded him within her arms and was tender she was tired of hurting of being hurt and afterward he fell asleep upon her breasts for another few hours zenobia however lay awake emperor of me romans she thought you have made me feel sorry for you but i will still be revenged revenged for palmyra for my sons for myself you have taken almost everything that is dear from me but i will have mine again her eyes strayed to the small piece of white marble set so carefully upon a nearby table it was the piece she had taken from amid the ruins of the great palmyran temple of jupiter it was all she had left of her city except for her memories which would never die she felt the tears sliding down her face but there was no sound i will be revenged she whispered softly and he stirred restlessly upon her breasts she murmured soothingly as she might have to an infant and he quieted in the weeks that followed zenobia visited the city of rome many times for there were enough wealthy patricians anxious to entertain her that she need never worry about returning the miles to tivoli come night never however would she stay at the emperors residence on the palatine hill i will not flaunt our relationship before your unfortunate dying wife she told aurelian the queen of palmyra was impressed with rome but her discerning eye saw the difference between what it had been and what it was now she saw the great marble public buildings and temples free of graffiti and the parks cleared of garbage she was shocked however by the thousands of healthy people who loitered and lingered about the streets unemployed though able to work for they were provided with food and entertainment in fact zenobia suspected that romes famous bread and circuses would be the eventual death of the empire whatever aurelian said the people used to their slothful ways for several generations now would not tolerate being returned to the old ways of hard work and honest industry patricians she found were a great bore on the whole there was one exception however and that was the elderly senator tacitus whom she had met at aurelians games following the triumph he was a witty old gentleman and for some reason she felt comfortable with him there was also her nextdoor neighbor the lady dagian here too was someone with whom she felt at ease and daily she walked with her in the garden mavia running ahead of them around them lingering behind to watch a butterfly zenobia was touched by the way the lady dagian had taken to her small daughter and mavia now adored dagian with a singular devotion it was dagian who now sewed little tunic dresses for mavia and sat in the grass with her weaving daisy chains and listening to her many confidences as they sat thus one late summers afternoon with the sunlight upon their bowed heads zenobia suddenly looked at dagian and her daughter and a cry escaped her lips the older woman looked up and seeing zenobias obvious distress rose quickly and hurried over to her zenobia my dear what is it she asked zenobia looked into unexpectedly familiar blue eyes deepblue eyes and cried who are you i am dagian was the gentle answer i am your friend dagian who it was then that dagian understood what had happened and closing her eyes a moment she sighed softly before saying i am dagian wife to the late lucius alexander you are the mother of marcus alexander britainus zenobias voice was accusing i am came the quiet reply how could you practice such a deception on me zenobia demanded and then turning to her daughter said mavia my darling run and find charmian the child looked up to protest but seeing the angry look upon her mothers face she rose and ran off the queen of palmyra turned back to the older woman is not your sons child enough for you must you steal my daughter away too marcus has had no children here in rome dagian replied no children the emperor says differently tell me dagian did your traitorous offspring spawn a son or a daughter upon aurelians niece carissa died in childbirth and her infant with her surely the emperor has other nieces zenobia said sarcastically if i did not know how badly my fool of a son had hurt you zenobia i should slap you dagian said vehemently sit down now and i will tell you the truth of the matterunless of course you prefer to clutch your outrage to your bosom for the rest of your life dagian gestured impatiently toward a marble bench in a small secluded grotto in the garden and suddenly wordless zenobia sat her companion settled herself next to her when marcus arrived home his father was dying now knowing that marcus had already betrothed himself to you lucius had arranged with the emperor that our eldest son marry carissa my husband very much wanted to see his heir safely married before he died marcus of course told me that he could not marry the emperors niece that he was betrothed to you that he loved you he went immediately to aurelian but aurelian refused to allow marcus to break the contract made by my husband he insisted that my son marry his niece he threatened terrible things against our family if marcus refused to marry carissa marcus had no choice at that point he had to wed carissa immediately after they were married she told him she was pregnant with the emperors child she mocked him with the knowledge carissa was a terrible creature zenobia my son despised her for she was evil incarnate zenobia was stonefaced could he not have written to me dagian when he left palmyra i sent with him an escort of my personal guard who were to bring back messages from marcus at each port the last of those messengers never returned because he was murdered zenobia after the wedding my husband died marcus had planned that i should go back to britain with my younger son aulus and then he planned to leave carissa and return to you in palmyra the emperor however knew every move we tried to make and stopped us at the gates of rome aurelian wanted a hostage to insure marcuss good behavior and what better hostage than a mans mother as a last resort marcus decided to send the final messenger back to palmyra he should have done it earlier i agree but he was afraid of compromising the family when he sent for your man our majordomo found him dead in his quarters his throat slit while he slept my son was trapped unable to communicate with you a sob escaped dagians lips and she brushed away the tears of remembrance that were beginning to fall instinctively zenobia reached out and patted dagians arm dagian caught the younger womans hand and clutched it my son was so terribly unhappy she continued then before aurelian left for the east he told marcus that he might have had carissa marry any one of a number of eligible patrician men but that he had chosen marcus deliberately because he was your betrothed he knew of your hatred for rome because of your mothers murder years back and he sought to rekindle that hatred so that you would rebel the emperor wanted palmyra back not as a client kingdom but as a province as the enormity of the betrayal slammed into her zenobia asked in a low tight voice are you telling me that aurelian deliberately separated me from marcus in order to take palmyra from me dagian nodded then he is a bigger fool than i anticipated zenobia said coldly i fully intended declaring my son augustus of the east long before marcus left me i did not however plan to do it until after marcus and i were married the news of your sons marriage to the emperors niece left me with no reason for delay and so i made my declaration in alexandria she laughed bitterly no dagian i must accept full responsibility for my actions but i will have my revenge upon aurelian already because i am his mistress he grows to trust me he will find in the end that that was a mistake marcus has never stopped loving you zenobia dagian said quietly i am no longer the woman that marcus loved zenobia said somewhat sadly marcus loved a queen a woman with pride and spirit i am no longer a queen and i have eaten the ashes of my pride in order to survive in order to save my children i can never forget that nor can i forget the things that i must do in order to continue to survive as long as aurelian lives there is no hope for marcus and me i have not yet the friends nor the power to destroy him but eventually i will dagian looked upon zenobia with wondering eyes my child you will destroy yourself she said if i can destroy aurelian in the process then it will be worth it zenobia replied what of mavia she has you zenobia said and she has her brother in cyrene she has her father too was dagians answer but she needs both her mother and her father my dear it is impossible was the adamant reply no it is not dagian declared see marcus see my son are you mad dagian where where will we not be seen and spied upon aurelian lives in terror that marcus will reclaim me when i first came to the villa he even lied to me about his nieces child pretending that it was alive and well he is beginning to trust me he has even offered me marriage upon poor ulpia severinas death you would not marry him dagian was shocked i will do what i must to be revenged zenobia cried passionately and dagian closed her eyes in agony once she said my sons failure to act quickly caused a separation that has brought you both great pain you have been given a second chance zenobia do not let your lust for revenge wantonly destroy what the gods have so generously given you both the gods zenobia laughed harshly do you know what i was called by my people dagian i was called the beloved of the gods beloved of my people and of the two men who loved me she laughed again and the bitterness in the sound scalded the older woman i honored the gods all my life but they deserted me if it appears that they have given me a second chance it is only so they may take it away the tears sprang again to dagians eyes in zenobias fierce and defiant words she could hear all the pain and hurt that the beautiful queen had suffered dagian wanted to reach out and clasp the younger woman to her bosom she wanted to soothe her and be a mother to her and reassure her that everything would be all right but she could not for dagian was not sure herself that everything was going to be all right suddenly the silence of the grotto was broken by a mans voice mother ah there you are i wondered where you had gotten to marcus alexander britainus stood within the entry of the little green hideaway both women leapt from the marble bench dagians hands flying to her heart zenobia turning pale at the sound of his voice there was no escape she tried to turn away but marcuss eyes were now used to the dimness and filling themselves with her nohis voice was hoarse with shock and his hand reached out to rum her about no beloved dont turn away from me slowly he entered into the grotto brushing past his mother as if she were not there stunned dagian could but watch them as they devoured each other with their eyes marcus gently grasped zenobia by her upper arms and looking down into her face now tearstreaked spoke in a low but audible voice i love you he said i have always loved you i have loved you from the beginnings of time and i shall love you long after our memories have faded from this earth i have never stopped loving you she said but our time is past it would have been better if you had not seen me this day do not say it he almost cried i belong to aurelian marcus do you understand i am aurelians imperial captive you cannot give yourself to him willingly beloved i understand i truly do but i do give myself willingly i must for the sake of my children and aurelian is not a fool in the beginning i fought him but i am weary of fighting a battle i cannot win and i have vaba and mavia to think of marcus she sighed sadly i am no longer zenobia the queen of palmyra palmyra like my spirit lies shattered into a million pieces beneath the desert sun the woman you knew died with her people then pushing past him she fled through the gardens back to her villa he made to follow her but dagian blocked his way hissing at him in a voice so fierce he hardly believed it was his mother do not follow her marcus lest you compromise us all aurelian is frantically jealous of her and fears you he is wise to fear me for i intend taking her back marcus vowed no my son he plans to make her his wife when ulpia severina dies marcuss face darkened with anger never he spat i will see him in hades first dagian shook her head sadly why are you both so destructive my son you would fight the emperor openly over zenobia and she plots to destroy him even at the cost of her own life be patient marcus aurelian cannot last much longer his time will come as surely as it did to those soldier emperors before him you have but to wait my son his face contorted with pain how can i wait any longer having seen her now mother it has been two years since aurelian separated us and i have ached every day i have been away from her who planned that zenobia live in the villa next to ours surely not the emperor no dagian said it was ulpia severina who arranged it because she wanted zenobia and me to be reunited he said excitedly yes dagian admitted but i do not believe that she knew the depth of her husbands involvement with zenobia marcus now she is dying she will do everything in her limited power to see aurelian is happy after she is gone and if aurelian wants your queen for his second wife then ulpia will try to see he has what he wants we could flee italy mother you and zenobia mavia and i could flee to britain and what of zenobias eldest son and his family in cyrene marcus what fate would await them in aurelians anger besides the emperors passion for her is allconsuming he would come after her with every legion at his command and when he caught us he would destroy you my son zenobia loves you marcus i was not sure of it until this afternoon but when she saw you spoke with you left you every fiber of her being proclaimed her love for you you can do no less you must not put her or her family in jeopardy trust meand wait he sank down on the marble bench and with a sob put his head in his hands zenobia her name burned like a brand within his brain it was almost like a dream now their brief encounter had he really held her in his arms again why had he not kissed her the gods only knew he had wanted to another groan escaped his lips heart pounding zenobia had fled across the gardens to her own villa marcus she wanted to scream his name aloud marcus marcus marcus she whispered softly oh marcus i love you and i shall die if i cannot be with you again she stopped upon the villas portico suddenly taken by a terrible fit of trembling reaching out she put her hand against a marble pillar to steady herself she closed her eyes but the tears could not be stopped they rolled unchecked down her face in such profusion that her eyes were soon burning and swollen with the salty stream praise jupiter that aurelian was in the city this day and could not see her she let the pain sweep over her and for several minutes she wept wildly unashamedly then taking several deep breaths she attempted to pull herself back together her instinct told her to run back to him to fling herself into his arms to flee aurelian with the man she truly loved her conscience sternly reminded her of her duty to those for whom she was responsible mavia and old bab adria vaba flavia julia and young gaius porcius so many people depended on her and even now in the bleakest and darkest hour of her defeat she could not think only of herself slowly she wiped the tears from her face and walked into the villa luck was with her and she saw no one in her hurried flight to her bedroom with a sigh she flung herself upon her bed and fell into a restless sleep a sleep haunted by his voice a faceless voice that declared his love for her over and over and over until she awoke to discover that she was weeping again she decided that this could not go on if she could not get herself in hand then aurelian was sure to discover that his dreaded rival marcus alexander britainus was separated from her by just a few feet of garden if the emperor suspected for one minute that they were in contact she knew that he would kill marcus without the slightest hesitation zenobia shivered that thought alone was enough to bring her to her senses i can face no more deaths she thought in the weeks that followed ulpia severina grew weaker aurelians passion for zenobia however grew greater as each day passed and he could scarcely bear to be out of her sight he was jealous of any man who spoke gently to the queen suspecting all of ulterior motives even the kindly claudius tacitus romes elderly and revered senator aurelian was frantic over the fact that he could not stay in rome for very long after his triumph his army was quickly ready to march again its destination gaul zenobia refused to come with him and aurelian knew that if he pressed her she would complain to her friend senator tacitus as an imperial captive she was forbidden to leave the rometivoli area what do you think will happen to me in your absence she mocked him on the evening of his departure the city is full of men who want you he declared indeed is rome so barren of women that its men will pant after a woman past thirty be sensible roman why would i accept another man when i can have the emperor of the romans strangely her mockery soothed him he felt momentarily foolish for she had never given him any cause to doubt her aurelian departed for gaul the last broken link in the roman empires chain to be reforged leaving his captive mistress to her solitude for the first time in weeks zenobia dared to renew her friendship with dagian although she had allowed mavia to visit regularly with her grandmother early one autumn evening the two women sat companionably together mavia having departed with her nursemaid charmian for her cot the news from gaul is good for the empire zenobia said tetricus the leader of the gallic rebels has surrendered and aurelian has spared both him and his son gaul is once more a loyal subject of rome praise the gods dagian said fervently now there will be fewer roman mothers to weep over their dead sons how i hate war sometimes there is no other choice zenobia replied you can say that having lost your younger son to a war i would rather demi lived but the choice was his like his father he valued his freedom over all else i see that now although there was a time when i thought he did what he did merely to spite vaba odenathus would have been proud of him yes marcus alexander britainus said he would have zenobia looked up and when their eyes locked hers quickly filled with tears go away she said in a low fierce voice would you endanger us all no one can see us from either villa beloved he said and then he turned to dagian mother i want to walk down by the river with zenobia will you keep watch you are mad zenobia cried softly i will watch dagian said go with him zenobia he will persist until you do even as a child he would not give up until he had what he wanted the servants are abed and with the emperor away you will be safe marcus took zenobias hand and led her to the cliffs edge where to her surprise she saw a flight of steps cut into the face of the incline slowly they descended he carefully leading the way her warm hand tucked into his big one at the bottom of the steps was a narrow strip of pebbled beach and in the dim twilight he led her a ways down it finally stopping before a thick group of greenery pushing aside the brush he drew her into a small cave with a sandy floor upon a small ledge was a lamp already burning with a cheery golden glow that cast dark flickering shadows upon the walls of the cave i have been seeking a place where we might meet in safety he said by way of explanation and then he swept her into his arms and kissed her her arms moved swiftly around him and their hearts pounded wildly with excitement she molded herself against him the desire for his love paramount his mouth worked against hers seeking coaxing drawing from her the kind of response she had never dreamed she would feel again she was afire with her passion for him taking his tongue into her mouth to play with sucking upon it nipping teasingly at it she was wantonly aggressive with him murmuring against his ear when their lips had finally parted i had forgotten how tall you are my darling ah marcus i have missed you so she made no protest when he loosened her long tunic dress and slipped it off her shoulders allowing it to fall to her ankles she stood shivering slightly in her thin cotton camisa as he stepped back removed his long cape and spread it over the sandy floor of the cave wordlessly he took off his tunic toga and undergarments a soft smile touched her mouth as his dear and familiar body was revealed to her once more she reached out and caressed his muscled shoulder their eyes met and then he smiled too do you not want to tell me how foolish this all is beloved he gently teased her in return she reached down and pulled her camisa up and off flinging it into a corner of the tiny cave he caught his breath seeing her once more as he had seen her so many times before their separation his deepblue eyes moved slowly over her lush form a warm and loving glance and she glowed in the light of his open and deep love for her reaching out he drew her slowly to him and enfolded her in his arms he stood holding her feeling her warmth against him enjoying the simple sensation of her she made no move standing quietly within the circle of his embrace as he reached up and carefully drew the jeweled pins from her hair letting it fall loose in a dark swirl about her body gently he stroked her long hair and the touch of his hand sent small delighted shivers through her all her lovely memories of him came tumbling back and she forgot her months of hurt and anger this great tall man this halfroman halfbriton was her mate and she wanted no other zenobia shifted in order to free her hands and slowly slid them up his broad chest when her palms rested flat upon him she let her slender fingers entwine and twirl themselves in a circular motion through the soft chestnut hair that covered the center of his chest it was a lovely teasing motion that he bore patiently until she finally tired of her play and slid her arms up and about his neck raising her head to look him fully in the face they were now practically welded together her full breasts pressed against his chest their thighs and bellies matching fierce passion blazed between them and with a low growl he bent his head to take her lips again with a sweet sigh she surrendered herself to him her mouth softening beneath his as together they slid to their knees still embracing they kissed and they kissed until finally she pulled her bruised lips from his laughing breathlessly and with a rueful grin he admitted i cant get enough of you beloved i have touched no woman in all me time we have been apart i remember she said softly that after mavia was born and i remembered her conception you told me you had touched no woman since me for you wanted no other now you tell me the same thing again and i am ashamed because of aurelian i understand why you have taken him as a lover zenobia as an imperial captive you had no choice in the matter short of death you are not a woman to take the easy way my darling for a brief moment she thought of all that had passed between herself and the emperor no she would not have willingly accepted him as a lover lust or no had he not forced her a brief shadow of worry crossed her beautiful face and he instantly asked what is it beloved there is now she said but what of tomorrow i do not know he answered her honestly so i must remain a choice bone to be fought over by the two of you she said softly he sighed my love for you cannot put you in such a terrible position beloved then he groaned zenobia is there nothing for us i cannot go on like this i dare not be seen with you publicly i cannot even see my daughter except across a garden wall i must not speak to the child lest she make some innocent remark to the emperor and compromise us both it is not to be borne compassionately she put her arms around him holding him close he offered her the chance to walk away from this encounter to remain meant that once more they would become lovers and then when aurelian returned and she welcomed him to her bed she would truly become a whore it isnt fair she thought angrily none of this is of my making yet i am a pawn suddenly his voice cut into her thoughts zenobia once i asked you to marry me secretly but you refused for the sake of your son and your position now will i ask you again there are many forms of roman marriage but legally all that is necessary is that we consent to live together as man and wife if we make this consent before several witnesses my mother old bab and your younger servant adriathen our union is legal will you marry me beloved now tonight but what of aurelian he is already on his way back from gaul how can i be your wife and his mistress i do not think that i can do it marcus not even for you my love you wont have to beloved i promised gaius cicero that i should look in on his wife while he was away and when i visited with clodia today she read me his latest message to her aurelian plans to stay in rome but a very short time when he returns from gaul his next campaign must begin almost immediately he goes east again toward byzantium there are rumblings there of extreme discomfort and unless he can quell them he will have a great deal of trouble on his hands a winter campaign your rumblings must be serious he will be in rome less than a month you can hold him off by claiming to be pregnant not only will it keep him off you but it will prevent him from taking you with him on campaign yes she said slowly i could do that the emperor desperately wants a child but marcus when he returns from this war with byzantium what will we do then we will not be here then zenobia none of us are kept under guard any longer a mistake on aurelians part while he marches his army across macedonia we will be making our way to britain winter travel is dangerous but we will survive no one will come after us i swear for who will know we are gone you do not entertain nor do you socialize with fashionable rome it could be that you will not be missed until aurelian returns and our trail will long be cold by then he will know we have gone to britain she said especially if you and your mother are missing too we will be where he cannot find us beloved i promise you that we will not go to my mothers people but rather to a group of small islands at the very tip of britain i visited them once when i was a boy my grandfather owned one of those little islandsit was a dowry from one of his wives it belongs to aulus now but i know that he will give it to us it is very tiny but it is warm almost all the year long and there are palm trees there not our beautiful palmyran palms but palm trees nonetheless the romans have never been seen upon those islands zenobia aurelian will not find us there my son is in cyrene she said what will aurelian do to him marcus he smiled there were so many barriers to their being together but he would dismantle them one by one until she was content if i swear to you that i will arrange to see to your entire familys escape will you marry me tonight yes then i promise you beloved everything shall be as you want suddenly zenobia began to giggle and when he looked somewhat puzzled she stopped and explained how can i ever explain to our children that their father proposed marriage to me while we both knelt naked in a cave a dark eyebrow waggled dangerously at her you plan to give me children my beauty he queried of course she exclaimed indignantly i may be past thirty but i can yet give you children then let us start now beloved he said and pulled her down upon his cloak with him i have hungered for you zenobia for two years i am no longer interested in talk then be silent marcus britainus she commanded him and drawing his head to hers she kissed him a long and sweet kiss although his head was spinning he still managed to place an arm about her shoulders and cradle her against him his big hand caressed her full breasts and zenobia felt a thrill run through her she had never again thought to be loved by him and now as his passion grew her own rose to match his he bent his dark chestnut head to nuzzle at her breasts and shifting so that she lay upon her back she drew him as close to her as she could murmuring softly as his tongue encircled her taut nipples she threaded her fingers through his thick hair and with one hand rubbed the sensitive back of his neck oh marcus she murmured you will think me wanton but i am so filled with desire for you my darling do not play long with me i beg you with a low rumble of deep laughter he lifted his head from her ripe breasts and shifting his position slightly gently entered her simultaneously they sighed and then as he began to move in a slow and sensuous rhythm against her she nipped him lightly upon his shoulder little wildcat he whispered i love you i love you she whispered back and then zenobia gave herself over to the storm of passion that built quickly within her sending her moaning and thrashing against him as her desire peaked over and over again still he would not give her release and when she roundly cursed him in her childhood bedawi dialect he laughed aloud but continued the pleasurepain until he knew from her mewlings and whimperings that she would bear no more only then did he tumble with her into that dark abyss of passion already longing to possess her again with the saucer lamp flickering low and the chill of the little damp cave licking at their naked flesh the lovers did not stay long that night they now desired only one thing to pledge themselves quickly in matrimony before witnesses neither would feel safe until that sacred promise had been made to the other alone each was helpless together they were invincible silently hurriedly they dressed and left the cave walking swiftly back down the pebbled beach and up the cliff staircase although they had been gone less than an hour night had fallen and had it not been for the quarter moon they would have had a hard time finding their way dagian dozed her head nodding against her chest as she sat waiting on the marble bench gently marcus kissed her and she awoke with a small start before she could speak he said zenobia and i intend to marry tonight mother will you go to her house and bring old bab and adria here to us we will pledge ourselves here beneath the night sky for all the gods to see let diana the goddess of the moon and the hunt be our chief witness if aurelian learns of this dagian said quietly but zenobia cut her short tonight we have learned that there is no life for us apart we should rather face the emperors wrath than ever be separated again dagian besides mother he is not going to know trust me for this time i have a foolproof plan dagian could see that there was no reasoning with either of them the light of their shared love shone in both their eyes and she realized that further argument would be useless obedient to her sons wishes she rose from her marble bench and hurried off to zenobias villa to fetch the queens two faithful servants when she was well out of earshot zenobia turned to her beloved and said softly i cannot tell aurelian that i am with child marcus not when he first returns at least he is no fool for all his passion for me if i say i am to bear his child he will call in a physician to examine me he will want to be assured that both the child and i are in good health he will want to know the birthdate he will want reassurance whether i am your wife or not i will have to play his whore a little time longer if you love me and value our safety then you must live with that knowledge can you perhaps you would prefer that we wait until we can escape to britain her gray eyes looked searchingly at him tell me true my darling for a moment marcus looked unhappy the mere thought of aurelian touching zenobia infuriated him yet he knew she was right if she claimed to be with child an excited and happy emperor would demand not only proof of her condition but more dangerous knowledge as well still he did not want to wait even knowing that she must bed again with the emperor marcus wanted zenobia for his wifenow tonight what she did with aurelian would mean nothing to her and in the years to come the memory would fade from both their minds what she did she did for love of him for their future together for their descendants i love you he said quietly i do not choose to wait then he took her into his arms and kissed her tenderly you have always been my wife beloved she brushed the sudden tears from her cheeks i think that perhaps the gods have not deserted me after all mayhap they were merely testing me for this night i have found the kind of happiness that is rarely granted to any mortal are you not zenobia the queen of palmyra he said are you not beloved of the gods of your people and of me oh yes she whispered breathily at him yes my darling darling marcus and she clung hungrily to him looking up at him with the shining light of her love transforming her whole being until she seemed almost luminous he stared down at her transfixed totally unaware that his own love shone as brightly infusing her with such warmth and wellbeing that for the first time in months she felt safe no longer afraid she had lived with fear these many months although never once had she dared admit it even to herself now like a ship escaped from a terrible tempest she was in a safe harbor at a noise on the path they broke apart into view came dagian bab and adria zenobias elderly servant looked at marcus with a sharp eye so marcus alexander britainus you are finally come back to us yes bab and tonight i shall claim my own it is good the old woman nodded the slaves zenobia queried her servants all in their quarters and sleeping adria assured her mistress very well then the queen said and she turned to marcus shall we begin my darling yes beloved so in the green sweetsmelling garden its flowers lightly touched by the silver glow of the quarter moon zenobia the queen of palmyra turned to her lover marcus alexander britainus and said in a low but clear voice when and where you are gaius i then and there am gaia it was that simple they were now man and wife and he took her once more into his arms to kiss her as dagian and adria wiped the tears from their faces and old bab gave a little hiccough of a sob and then said it has taken you two long enough i thought never to live long enough to see you both wed now may i die in peace you are not going to die yet marcus chuckled no i am not the old lady cackled else who will teach your son manners and keep me in my place he teased her my children dagian said we must separate now none of us must allow the least suspicion to fall on zenobia and marcus adria and bab nodded and began to make their way back to the villa while dagian walked in the opposite direction toward her own house the newly married pair stood hand in hand for a few minutes talking quietly to reassure each other that they were indeed man and wife once you said you would not marry me except that it be in the bright light of day before all and that i should escort you with much pomp to our new home alas at the moment i have no new home to escort you to beloved how foolish i was she answered him i should have insisted especially when i knew i had to return to rome i should not have left you so unprotected zenobia i will never again leave you my darling go now and dream of me beloved he kissed her gently once more and then stood watching as she obediently turned and hurried back to her own villa she would not always he thought somewhat amused be that obedient walking back through the garden zenobias heart soared with happiness she was his wife now and nothing would ever part them again she had once warned aurelian that in the end she would win the battle between them and now she almost had it mattered not to her that he would not know at least not yet what mattered most was that she and marcus were finally united united now and forever and nothing not even death would ever divide them again part four the woman aurelian arrived home victorious from gaul and a small triumph was held this time with the unfortunate tetricus walking behind the emperors chariot in that chariot zenobia the captive queen of palmyra rode again with her golden chains fastened to aurelians massive iron belt this time however she was garbed in royal purple and gold garments the palmyran crown upon her head romes emperor was making a strong point with the people a point that they did not for all their grumbling miss he was caesar his generals were not as easily impressed for aurelian had become more imperious as each day passed and was beginning to believe his own legend the queen had been summoned from tivoli to take part in this latest triumph and afterward she was escorted to aurelians residence on the palatine hill there had been little opportunity for them to speak even though they had shared the same chariot in the procession she had faintly protested being sent to his palace but he had quickly overruled her with a wave of his hand you will obey me goddess must i again teach you the folly of disobedience as you will roman she said scornfully and he laughed i see you have lost none of your spice goddess good i shall look forward to a long night of playful bedsport with you zenobia quickly turned away lest he see her repulsion the moment of truth had finally come for her she would have to enter into his games with gusto for when he had left to go to gaul she had been his willing mistress now he would expect her to eagerly welcome his advances having been bereft of him these last months if she suffered she knew that marcus suffered too and whatever happened she would for his sake play the role of the emperors whore just a little while longer she reassured herself and i will be free i will have won she was escorted to the royal residence by some halfdozen praetorian guards and upon entering it she demanded of the haughty majordomo to be taken to the empress ulpia severina yet lived and for that small blessing zenobia thanked the gods aurelian would never divorce his wife and so as long as she lived palmyras queen was safe the empress lay upon her couch obviously quite ill but when she saw zenobia she attempted to rouse herself smiling a sweet smile my dear her weak voice was warm with welcome how kind of you to come visit me i understand that you keep to your villa at tivoli i do majesty rome is too busy to suit me nevertheless i must beg your hospitality this night but of course you may stay here ulpia severina said and zenobia gratefully acknowledged the empresss consent zenobia was then taken to a suite of rooms where a group of busy slaves awaited her the chief of these women immediately pressed upon her a goblet of dark red wine insisting that she drink it down it will give you strength majesty the woman wheedled and it is the emperors orders zenobia took the goblet ready to protest but the wine though heavy in appearance was strangely light and fruity and the queen was thirsty after the triumph she quickly drained the goblet and the slave woman smiled broadly with approval now majesty the bath awaits you she said and hurried zenobia through tall double doors into the baths there she was scraped steamed soaped rinsed and scraped again a final rinse and she was led to the massage table and made comfortable a second goblet of wine was offered her she was hot from the bath and suddenly thirsty again and so she again drained the container the cool liquid slipping easily down her throat she stretched out upon the cool marble slab and at once the slaves about her began to massage her body with a faintly scented palegreen lotion they worked gently for some minutes as zenobia grew sleepy with the wine and their ministrations then they were turning her over onto her back massaging her breasts and her belly she protested faindy but suddenly all strengdi was gone from her limbs she slipped into a halfconscious state dimly realizing that she had been drugged and wondering why everything became shadowy even though she was quite sure her eyes were open she was being carried and yet her body felt weightless as if she were floating the dimness began to ease and once more she could see quite clearly zenobia was shocked to find she was in some sort of a temple and bound by delicate golden chains to a marble altar atop a flight of steps at each comer of the altar was set a huge standing lamp in the shape of a gold phallus burning a heavily muskscented oil the redgold flames leaping gently in the coolish night air swirling about in their carved golden pans from some hidden place the music of drum and reeds echoed forth zenobia turned her head slightly and was horrified to see that the altar was set in the very center of a small circular arena and upon the steps of that arena were men and women all nude they were chatting amiably quite oblivious to their nudity not the least bit concerned at least for the moment with zenobia their lack of interest gave her a chance to inspect her surroundings further the temple was very simple in design and obviously within the palace the only decoration of any kind was a huge sun of pure beaten gold its giant rays streaked with diamonds and rubies that hung suspended over the altar aurelian his name rocketed through her brain with the memory of something he had once said to her this had to be his doing and his temple a temple to the unconquerable sun she was in a temple dedicated to the unconquerable sun aurelians pet cult he had on several occasions spoken to her of his cult but she had ignored it not being particularly interested she still did not understand what it was he was up to but she imagined she would soon know a short but clear trumpet note cut the air and a deep stentorian voice called children of the sun the time draws near when the incarnation of the great and unconquerable sun god upon the earth will come among you to mate with she who is love harken for the sacrifices are about to begin at the instant the voice ceased powerful and sultry drums began to beat with a sensuous rhythm and a dozen dancers six males and six females ran out upon the floor below the altar the blond womenthey were all really girls no more than thirteen or fourteen zenobia guessedwere exquisitely and perfecdy formed the menprobably about eighteenwere equally beautiful also fairhaired and lighteyed they were allboth male and femalegilded with beaten gold except for a single stripe of bare skin running up their spines and they danced the most sensual and wanton dance zenobia had ever seen pantomiming the sex act in graphic abandon suddenly one of the maidens broke from the others and fled partway up the steps at once a young man his sex rampant leapt after her for a moment they sparred upon the marble stairs and then the man threw the girl down flung himself atop her and drove himself into her there was a pitiful shriek and the crowd moaned as one as the man withdrew from his victim turning to face them his penis bloody with the girls virginity ahh the spectators murmured leaning forward eyes glazed with their own lust mouths open with pleasure tongues quickly licking lips in undisguised pleasure the male dancer turned back to the helpless girl and pushing back into her continued to take his own pleasure as one by one the other gilded men caught and attacked the lovely gilded girls cries rent the air as each maiden parted publicly with her innocence to the frantic beat of the drums while slightly above them the worshipers of the unconquerable sun avidly watched the men now beginning to fondle themselves nearby women and in some cases even other men zenobia was horrified by it all terrified by the thought of whatever might be planned for her and yet strangely inflamed within her own body it was madness of the worst sort then as suddenly as the dancers had appeared they were gone the men carrying the weeping women all in their arms the stentorian voice again spoke what greater sacrifice can a woman make than to offer herself and her innocence to the god now he who is the sun incarnate on earth will mate with she who is love incarnate on earth this night it is foretold that together they will create a son a son who will rule the world in the name of the unconquerable sun she was to be taken publicly zenobia struggled against the seemingly delicate golden chains but they held firm then into her view came aurelian she recognized him by a scar upon his thigh for he wore a carved golden mask he stood tall acknowledging the cries of homage that came from the frenzied worshipers several women broke from among the spectators and running down the seatsteps flung themselves at his feet they unbound their hair and writhing about aurelian began to rise up some standing to caress and kiss him one kneeling and taking his sex into her mouth to stimulate him others remaining at his feet licking and stroking at his legs it was the worst kind of hysteria zenobia thought and yet to her own disgust she was aroused by it all while the women worshiped him aurelian remained perfectly still until finally their attentions had the desired effect gently kicking them aside and pushing them away he stood before zenobia with a swift motion he removed the golden mask and dte finally saw his face mocking the eyes glazed with lust and drugs the altar upon which she was bound was shaped like an m and her body had been placed so that her long legs were fastened on either side of the altars top a space between them now aurelian stepped into that space and kneeling leaned forward to touch her with his tongue dear venus he couldnt do that to her here not in front of all of those leering people see the disembodied voice cried see how he worships at the very shrine of love the emperors tongue stroked her flesh sending small shivers of fire through her no she shrieked silently for she could not seem to say it aloud all she was able to do was moan with helpless desire as he probed her delicately moving slowly never hurrying her up the path of pleasure but prolonging the torture until finally a long wail escaped her straining throat and the crowd began to chant fuck fuck fuck fuck aurelian lifted his head from between her legs and looking at her smiled a triumphant smile without a word he mounted her and slowly very slowly pushed himself into her withdrawing as slowly entering again withdrawing again in an unbearable rhythm that would shortly drive her to madness if he didnt satisfy her please she managed to moan through now dry lips hating herself even as she whimpered the word please what goddess please her eyes pleaded with him say the word goddess say it and i will make it good no he laughed at her defiance withdrew his lance from her and laid it wet and throbbing upon the sweet mound of her belly i am filled with special drugs and aphrodisiacs goddess when i have finished with you i will take a dozen women before i am satisfied this night i can wait can you he punctuated his question by rubbing his organ against her in a provocative manner all around her to the right to the left and above the other worshipers chanted as aurelian leaned forward to lick at her breasts which strained to be touched by his talented tongue please she whispered again please tell me what you want me to do to you goddess tell me and i will do it no she struggled to defy him the worshipers began to grow restless above them and their chanting took on a harsh sound he would lose them if he could not force her and so leaning forward aurelian took one of her nipples in his mouth and brutally bit it she screamed with the pain and the crowds attention was once more engaged they groaned together say it goddess he commanded her through gritted teeth for a moment incredible hatred blazed from her drugged eyes and then she whimpered at him fuck me roman fuck me before i die he rammed himself deep into her making her cry out again moving in and out of her with incredible swiftness as around them the other worshipers fell upon each other men with women women with women men with men in a frenzied orgy of sensual abandon mercifully zenobia fainted blotting the rest of the horror from her consciousness when she once more came to her senses she was surprised to find herself in her bedroom back in tivoli next to her old bab nodded and zenobia struggled to call to her through cracked lips bab instantly the faithful servant was awake my baby she cried you are awake at last how long has it been zenobia demanded her head was pounding the emperor brought you back four days ago he said you grew ill in rome but you have had no fever or other signs of illness you have been unconscious all that time and we could not rouse you what happened i cannot discuss it bab do not ask where is the emperor i will fetch him he asked to be called when you awoke she hurried off to return a few minutes later with aurelian who looked as cool elegant and calm as always leave us bab bab departed swiftly closing the door behind her with a resounding bang what happened to me her voice was icy with anger do you not remember goddess his eyes mocked her i did not dream it i hope not goddess we were both incredible so incredible that donations to the temple the other night reached an unprecedented high you are loathsome when i had finished with you he went on i took fifteen more women the gods how they fought and pleaded to be taken by me they did everything anything i desired i was invincible you are disgusting roman you defile the gods by your obscene worship of this unconquerable sun of yours you are now pregnant with my child he said ignoring her anger she started at him in shock then said you have never in all your years with your wife or your other women fathered a child what in the name of all the gods makes you think you have fathered one on me now because it is foretold in the writings of the unconquerable sun that he who is the god upon the earth will father a son upon she who is the goddess upon the earth from the moment i saw you i knew that you were she who is the goddess upon the earth why do you think i have spared you zenobia why have i always called you goddess you are venus reborn my fair one and from your womb will spring forth a mighty ruler were it not so then the other night when i finished with you you would have offered yourself to the others as i offered myself you however are the goddess and my seed could not be defiled so sure am i that you have conceived that in the few weeks i remain in rome before my next campaign i will not come to you i will not touch you lest i injure the babe i am to remain in tivoli again while you are away she queried of course i do not want either you or the child endangered goddess you will stay here in tivoli surely ulpia cannot last much longer and when i return i will wed with you if the child is already born i will legitimize him she could scarcely believe her good fortune she had looked forward with dread to a month of his insatiable passion and now he was telling her she was free zenobia was careful not to let her joy show composing her face she raised her eyes to him i did not like what you did to me the other night roman but i have been without you for several months now you say we are not to be together while you are here in rome her lips arranged themselves in a pretty pout he smiled at her i am pleased that you shall miss my loving attentions goddess but i will take no chances with you you are not bored with me this is not simply an excuse because you have found another her voice sounded delightfully suspicious in his ear how could there be anyone after you goddess he demanded no i adore you as always there is no other no others that mattered he thought pleased you cannot be sure that i am with child roman it is much too soon to know nevertheless i will take no risks zenobia i am returning to rome today and i will not be back again until just before we march i have a great deal to do goddess and a very short time in which to do it you must accept my decision it is for the best very well roman it will be as you say i see that you cannot be moved aurelian leaned forward and cupped her chin in his hand while his mouth found hers his kiss was a possessive one a demanding one and remembering the other night she shuddered he was a ruthless man releasing her from the kiss he said softly i understand that your neighbor is dagian the wife of the late lucius alexander yes zenobia replied choosing her words carefully she is a pleasant and amusing woman and she enjoys mavia greatly and have you seen her son goddess she could hear the dangerous undertone in his voice yes roman i have seen him several times in his mothers gardens she must be careful not to lie lest he suspect her you have spoken to him on at least two occasions she said certain now that someone an imperial spy undoubtedly had seen them and reported it to aurelian and and what roman she laughed lightly you arent jealous are you caesar leaning over she kissed him teasingly i do not know now what i ever saw in marcus alexander he is really a very dull pompous man then you love me alone i told you roman that it was doubtful that i should ever love again but what could marcus alexander offer me pray you offer me an empire and i should be a fool to refuse you especially since i am to bear your child he looked long and searchingly into her face and then certain that she spoke the truth admitted ruefully i knew that eventually you would see marcus alexander again and i was jealous i love you goddess you are my very life now i have never given you reason to doubt me roman she answered him thinking somewhat amused but only because i have been careful and not been caught he rose from the bedside i must leave you now goddess but i will return before we march she smiled up at him and watched through narrowed eyes as he left her bedchamber i shall only have to see you one more time roman she thought and at least i am free now of your eternal pawing a few minutes later both bab and adria entered her bedchamber and zenobia demanded is he gone he is on the road to rome as we speak majesty adria said zenobia turned to bab go to marcus and tell him that i am all right then tell him that there is an imperial spy in one of our houses he is not to come to me until after the emperor has left rome if he protests bab then you must tell him that aurelian asked me if i had spoken to him and i said yes for i was certain he knew i had we are watched and must take no chances dagian will carry messages for us but i will not endanger either of us when we are so close to escape tell him bab that i love him do not fear my baby bab soothed marcus alexander britainus values you above all things he will understand zenobia prayed it was so as the days went by dagian spoke of her son only once and that was to tell zenobia that marcus was seeing to their departure the palmyran queen began to grow curious and she plied dagian with many questions what is it like this britain of yours was her first ah dagian said a smile lighting her face it is very different from your palmyra and from italy it is an island nation a land of many contrasts one day may be sunny the skies bright blue and cloudless the next day may be misty cloudy filled with rain the winters can be harsh with much snow but the springs make up for all the gray cold days there are no deserts as in your land zenobia the only sandy places are by the sea britain is a land of hills and valleys of mountains and fields the romans do not control as much of it as they like to think for the tribes are very fierce and some bloodthirsty zenobia looked troubled you make it sound quite savage dagian is this place that marcus would take me safe for my children my childrens children i have only just received word that flavia was delivered of a little girl in cyrene will your britain be a safe place for such a tender baby dearest girl is any place in this world safe for children somehow they survive the place that marcus intends that you settle in is an island one of several off the very tip of britain in the south you need have no fear zenobia long ago so far back that there is no written date a small celtic tribe lived upon the island but today it is uninhabited the island is a lovely place as i remember it its climate mild even in the winter months flowers and fruits and vegetables grow year round upon it and you will be able to raise sheep and cattle the seas are full of fish and everything should thrive including your family will you come with us dagian no my dear i have long planned on living with aulus and his family in the region of my birth and girlhood i will come to visit you though as long as the gods give me good health zenobia felt reassured but now she worried about vaba and his family marcus had promised her that he would take care of them but how could he prisoner here in tivoli that he was again dagian was able to reassure her marcus has been freed of all travel restrictions as have i the older woman said one day we are to return to our own house in rome within the week i cannot bear to be without you zenobia cried curse aurelian he says he is no longer fearful of marcus but he is you are the only friend i have and i need you courage zenobia dagian chided gently our return to rome reassures aurelian that you truly no longer want marcus if you complain to him he will be suspicious in another week or two the army marches and with it goes the emperor you will be free then my daughter she put her arms around zenobia cradling her against her ample bosom i am so afraid zenobia admitted suddenly weeping i fear that aurelian will find us out and prevent marcus and me from being together we have waited so long dagian so very long you were meant to be together dagian soothed do not fear my daughter prudence will prevent the emperor from knowing our plans the gods will see to it the gods are capricious zenobia whispered hush my daughter dagian looked fearfully about her as if she might see an angry god then as suddenly as she had been fearful zenobia became calm again you are right dagian and i am behaving like a child we are so close to victory the two women embraced a final time and then each went her separate way a few days later the alexanders mother and son left the imperial villa in tivoli to return to their own home in rome although marcus alexander had sold the great trading house that had been his fathers he still had many contacts among the important commercial families among them was the son of one of the wealthy palmyran families slain in the destruction of that city with palmyras fall the young man had found himself alone and without a market for his goods he might have gone bankrupt had not marcus alexander stepped in and come to his aid marcus called in the debt owed and the young palmyran was eager to help ogga ben yorkhai was his name and he had friends in cyrene with whom he was in constant contact now he dispatched his pigeon messengers to that city and within ten days came word that vaballathus preferred to remain in imperial captivity than to brave the dangers of escape with his wife and infant daughter marcus knew how disappointed zenobia would be but in truth he was relieved the young man would always remember what he had lost always unconsciously blame his mother and between them there would never be any real peace a happier note however was word that vabas brother had been found alive in the ruins of palmyra by the bedawi there had been some halfdozen survivors of the massacre a woman four children and demi all of whom had been left for dead the tribesmen had taken them back to their encampment and although one of the children had died several days later the rest had survived demi knew that his brother now resided in cyrene and that his mother was in rome he preferred he wrote to vaba to remain with their uncle akbar and the bedawi if he could not live in palmyra now destroyed he preferred to roam the desert as his ancestors had done he already had his eye on a strong young girl of fourteen to take to wife once he could earn her bridesprice so marcus thought as he read the letter from cyrene we will start anew just zenobia and our daughter and me we will shed our old lives as the lizard sheds its old skin the armys departure was scheduled for the following day marcus alexander britainus wondered if aurelian would change his mind at the last moment and attempt to take zenobia with him they had not seen or spoken to one another in over a month although his mother had assured him before they left tivoli that all was well even dagian had not seen or communicated with zenobia in the last few weeks that afternoon gaius cicero came to see him and marcus welcomed his old friend warmly once more gaius smiled i must ask that you watch over my clodia and our children while i am away clodia is increasing again another child i shall not see born he said ruefully why do you not resign the army gaius your family is wealthy and although your older brother is the heir there is time for you to make a name for yourself in politics surely you do not really believe that aurelian has a long future as romes emperor this is my last campaign gaius admitted i must think of my family now as to the emperor ill admit i do not know how much longer he can hold on he is a fine general a good administrator but he lacks subtlety he makes enemies too easily take this temple of the unconquerable sun of his he has foresworn the old gods for this strange new religion and the truth of the matter is it is a scandal after this last triumph he held a fertility rite in his temple he mated upon the high altar with palmyras queen and then took fifteen more women before he was sated i know several of the men who attend these rites they do so for purely licentious reasons they were extremely annoyed that they could not take the captive queen usually aurelian who calls himself the god on earth allows his fellow worshipers to have a go at his woman when he has finished this night however he would not he claims that zenobia is the goddess upon earth and it was foretold that he should get a child upon her that night he said he did not want his seed defiled by others just as well if you ask me they say that zenobia fainted and could not be roused for several days from her stupor poor woman she had taken a great deal from aurelian and this surely was the worst the rumor is that he intends to make palmyras queen his empress when ulpia severina has died yes marcus said in a strangely calm voice i have heard that rumor keep calm his inner self warned him gaius is your friend but first he is loyal to aurelian although there were many questions he wanted to ask he instead changed the subject pretending lack of interest in zenobia and aurelian he could not be sure that gaius did not spy for the emperor i shall most happily keep clodia company gaius she is a fine wife and mother in the old tradition and you are fortunate to have her why dont you marry gaius asked suddenly marcus laughed because there is no one i love and i cannot settle for less my brother will perpetuate our family name and so there is no need for me to marry besides i prefer my freedom yes i have known a few men like you marcus gaius said some men are like that he rose i shall be on my way now i thank you for your kindness to my wife and my children my brother simply doesnt have time to bother with clodia and she does get lonely the two men clasped hands in the traditional roman salute and then gaius was gone his quick farewell echoing and then dying marcus sat down heavily once gaius cicero was gone and his mind raced back to his friends discussion of aurelians cult the emperor had publicly taken zenobia marcus shuddered with the horror of it he wanted to strangle aurelian feel his thick neck beneath his fingers watch as his face grew purple as he gasped his last few breaths as he died feeling the violence welling up within him he rose quickly and shut the library door then turning back into the room he began systematically to destroy everything in it furiously he flung the furniture against the beautiful frescoed walls every piece of pottery was smashed and only the book scrolls escaped destruction due to dagians timely entry into the library marcus she looked about her horrified at the terrible disaster the room had become marcus what is it somehow through the red mists of his fury he heard her and slowly his glazed eyes cleared it was either this or i would have killed himhe said dagian did not need to ask who she simply inquired why he told her and dagians eyes quickly filled with tears poor zenobia she said softly and then marcus you are not angry at zenobia no mother i am angry for her rome is truly a sewer and none of us belongs here any longer the gods only know how badly i want to take zenobia from this place you will have to wait until aurelian has embarked from brindisi marcus and then it will be another week after he has left we cannot at this late date take the chance of anyone discovering our plans you must remain calm my son i know mother but when i heard what he had done to my wife the gods curse him i hope he never returns to rome i hope they kill him aurelian however at that moment was far from dead at zenobias villa in tivoli he held his beautiful captive within the circle of his arms and kissed her passionately she forced herself to eagerly return his kisses nibbling teasingly at his lips to further arouse his desires his hands fondled her full breasts taunting the nipples to hard peaks you are so beautiful he murmured against her ear and she purred against him in apparent satisfaction do you know yet goddess he asked her can you be sure yet whether you carry my child it is much too soon caesar she said and then she lowered her eyes coyly i promise to send a message to you the moment i can be certain these things cannot be rushed roman i do not like leaving you goddess but i do not want you exposed to the rigors of travel in your condition i understand caesar she replied and i agree with you am not a maiden in the first flush of her womanhood it is better this way if only i could be sure he was so anxious and for a brief moment zenobia almost felt sorry for him then she remembered the rites those unholy rites he had held within his temple of the unconquerable sun publicly shaming her you were so virile and potent that night roman she murmured wickedly surely if it is written you cannot doubt the outcome no no he answered visibly upset lest his lack of faith cause the gods to turn upon him no you are with child i am certain then kiss me again aurelian and be on your way for the sooner you leave me the sooner you will return to meand to our child she looked him straight in the face now her silverygray eyes dancing with their haunting golden lights never had he seen her so beautiful he thought swiftly his mouth descended on her possessing her lips fiercely but she would not be subdued and kissed him as fiercely in return he was strangely breathless when they parted the gods go with you roman she said he could do nothing but leave her now but he did so feeling strangely dissatisfied climbing into his chariot he turned to look at her once more and the sight of zenobia in her flaming red kalasiris her long black hair blowing free in the afternoon breeze her proud head held high was a vision that remained with him he raised his hand in a gesture of farewell then slapped the reins upon his horses rumps and departed his chariot wheels rumbling up the drive and onto the via flaminia she also raised her hand in farewell wondering if he could hear her laughter following him i will never see you again roman and may my memory haunt you through all eternity she cried softly and then she whirled around and reentered her house the time went slowly the days long and dull the nights longer and lonely the only relief for zenobia during this period was her monthly show of blood she had never truly believed that the emperor could father a child upon her when he had never before sired one but the insanity of the temple of the unconquerable sun had left her shaken the praetorian guards about her villa were removed at her request to the senate through claudius tacitus i have no wish to cause the government undue expense on my behalf when it is not really necessary she told him it is enough that rome houses me perhaps tacitus said it may soon be possible for you to have your complete freedom my dear the senate however needs certain assurances his kindly old face was bland with detachment what assurances she demanded the emperor made some rather interesting statements concerning your condition prior to his departure and there was some gossip about fertility rites in his temple of the unconquerable sun several weeks back if you are referring tacitus to the night in which i was drugged and then raped by the emperor upon the high altar of his temple then allow me to assure you that nothing came of that night other than my acute sense of shame aurelian chose to believe that i was carrying his child before he departed i chose to allow him to believe it so i might be spared the boredom of accompanying him to byzantium if the senate does not believe me then let them question my women or call a physician in to examine me i am not with child do you love aurelian tacitus asked bluntly no she replied in kind i am his captive and that is all i have ever been he believes that you love him he also believes that i am the goddess venus incarnate but i am not tacitus she looked shrewdly at him you have all but said aloud that there is a plot against aurelian i care not why should i aurelian has taken everything that i ever held dear from me my sons are gone from me my people my city all i have left is my daughter and all i want is to be left alone in peace to raise her you may tell the senate that tacitus i simply wish to be left to myself your reputation was not a lie zenobia of palmyra you are indeed a wise woman tacitus replied and then he bid her farewell and withdrew from her when he had gone zenobia called for parchment andher writing materials and quickly wrote a note to dagian the note was then taken immediately to rome by a tiro a young slave of zenobias he was a skilled chariot driver who had been injured in the arena no longer any good for competition he had been sold by his master but he could still drive skillfully enough for the road she had purchased him given him a lovely slave girl as a wife and now tiro would have died for his mistress when tiro returned after dark that night marcus alexander britainus was with him muffled in a dark cloak as he slipped into the villa and made his way to zenobias bedchamber adria gave a small shriek as the large black figure entered the room without warning but marcus flung the long cape off and adria sighed oh master you gave me such a fright marcus chuckled deeply did you think i was aurelian returned adria made a face that caused marcus to laugh aloud that one adria sniffed praise the gods we shall not have to put up with him again master you sound more like old bab every day he teased her then the girl is finally getting some sense which is more than i can say for you marcus alexander britainus are you mad to come calling and the emperor not gone from the country yet bab stood glaring at him hands upon her plump hips aurelian sailed two days ago old woman and besides it was your beautiful mistress who summoned me here where is she here my love zenobia stood in the doorway of her bedchamber i was in the gardens walkingand dreaming find your beds bab adria the two servants scurried out and waiting until they were just gone zenobia threw herself into her husbands arms raising her face up for a kiss he stared down at her for a moment his fingers gently caressing her cheekbones and then his mouth descended to meet her eager lips her heart leapt wildly within her chest threatening she was certain to burst through her skin he kissed her softly at first and then as his mouth grew more certain of possession he demanded surrender total surrender of her she joyously gave him that surrender wrapping her smooth arms about his neck pressing herself as close to him as she could you are mine now and she could hear the triumph in his voice i am yours now and forever she answered him her eyes shining up into his with so much love that he felt humble unable to resist her he kissed her gently once more and then he led her to their bed where they sat down so they might speak aurelian is gone zenobia two days ago from brindisi according to reports received this morning in rome the news came by pigeon and was welcomed by the senate tacitus came to visit me this morning zenobia said excitedly i had requested the senate to withdraw the praetorian guards from the villa on what excuse he asked i said i wished to live quietly and not cause the government unnecessary expense marcus laughed loudly indeed my love you certainly must have caught their attention with that excuse he practically admitted a plot against aurelian this emperor will not i wager return from byzantium alive how can you be sure beloved tell me exactly what tacitus said to you i do not doubt that you have heard the rumors marcus of what happened to me in aurelians temple she said slowly i have heard he said tersely his face suddenly dark and grim with anger it was not my fault she whispered afraid he drew a deep breath and then took her onto his lap to comfort her i know that zenobia but i cannot help but be angry about it i am not angry with you but at the situation i am not one of these new christians who can turn the other cheek my wife the woman whom i prize above all others was taken publicly in a fertility rite the mere thought maddens me it was the most horrifying experience of my life marcus and i have lived through much i was drugged just enough to make me helpless but not enough to render me unconscious i was bound upon their high altar for all to see and all about me those unholy people chanted for aurelian to take me she sighed deeply sadly then said at least one good thing came of it aurelian was so certain that he had impregnated me that he never came near me after that he groaned pained how many times have you been helpless and i not able to defend you beloved never again i swear by all the gods it shall never happen again now you are in my keeping zenobia and i will protect you always and i will protect you my love alone we seem but half a person only together are we whole he was comforted by her words for he seemed to need the comfort more than she she smiled with the thought that where she was weak he was strong but where he was weak she was strong after a long moment marcus spoke again saying tell me what else tacitus said he said that the senate needed reassurances which i realized meant that they wished to know if i was indeed pregnant as aurelian kept insisting he said that given those assurances i might be granted my freedom entirely i of course told him i am not pregnant i offered my women to the senate for questioning and myself for examination by a physician of the senates choice why would they want such knowledge if they were not planning to assassinate aurelian they would kill me as quickly as aurelian if they thought there was any chance i was bearing his child since he has no other heirs and poor ulpia will shortly be dead herself they seek to tie up all the loose ends i wonder who will be the next emperor are there any generals who stand out in your mind none he answered her then why kill aurelian whywithout someone else to take his placedestabilize the government aurelian has offended enough men marcus explained that it matters not to them what happens to the government as long as their own interests are protected and rest assured my love the interests of the conspirators will be safe the powerful will find a new emperor and when he offends them marcus made a slicing motion across his throat with his finger then surely the time is right for us to flee my love now while they are involved with their plots yes beloved it is time for us to flee i have spent these last days planning our escape i have bought a ship zenobia a roman merchantman only two years old if we are to live on an island we shall need transportation between our new home and the mainland a merchantman then you mean to trade i am not a farmer or a herdsman beloved will you leave me then in this strange land that you are taking me to marcus leave me to pursue your business no beloved i will never leave you again but my ship will trade for me and i will have an interest she squirmed about in his lap and looked up at him what will i do she wondered aloud i am a queen without a kingdom a general without an army what on earth am i to do marcus you will be a good roman wife beloved he answered and zenobia laughed no marcus i should be bored to death for me there must be something else perhaps i shall make this island of ours the new kingdom over which i reign i must think on it you think too much he chuckled falling back upon the bed still clutching her within his arms come and be my good roman wife he teased repositioning her to lie in the curve of his arm beneath him as if she were a childs toy i think that you should begin by kissing me wife and he lowered his head to brush her lips with his own my wife he murmured against her mouth my beautiful wife my sweet wife my adorable wife her smile was deceptively sweet i have only been upon the sea once when aurelian brought me from macedonia to brindisi i liked it and i believe that i shall learn to navigate this ship of yours one may use the stars in the heavens upon the sea as easily as upon the desert he grinned down at her had i wanted to marry a sailor he waggled his eyebrows wickedly at her so that she giggled i wanted a woman beloved and i married woman incarnate his hand drew her robe open to bare her beautiful breasts to him and he leaned forward to brush them with his rough cheek her scent arose from the warmth of her lovely body to taunt and assail him oh zenobia he said softly and she reached out to draw him against her breasts they lay together in tender embrace enjoying the simple pleasure of being together without fear of discovery she threaded her fingers through his thick chestnutcolored hair noticing a silver strand here and there suddenly she realized that he had fallen asleep upon her breasts and again she chuckled as she shifted to cradle him more comfortably there had never before been a time when he hadnt made love to her their separation had taken its toll on him for he was obviously exhausted when morning came and he awoke marcus was much chagrined you were so tired my darling an amused zenobia comforted him but i wanted you he protested zenobia laughed and i wanted you she said but you were tired and you fell asleep then she roused him up for it was necessary that he return to the city that morning when are we to leave she asked as she helped him to dress in his freshened clothes we will sail from ostia in three days time he answered are we to sail the entire way my darling she looked a little nervous i would like to zenobia as there is less chance of our being caught but the sea is so dangerous we will follow the coast closely as far as massilia from massilia we will take the tin route up across gaul to the coast facing britain it is a very small piece of water beloved the ship will meet us there having gone through the pillars of hercules out into the great sea and around the coast of gaul our ship will then take us across to britain not to our own home no first we must take my mother to aulus and his family only then can we seek our own place zenobia besides i think it is only polite that i ask aulus for his island before we take it over his deepblue eyes were twinkling at her she laughed how the times have changed my darling i pray your brother will be generous he is a good man zenobia you must take some of the slaves with you today she said i cannot leave tivoli discreetly with a large train how many people do you have you need not worry about the women zenobia said they can come with me when i go to rome to meet you but you must take tiro my charioteer and otho the gardener they are the only men with me and i prefer they go with you today very well he answered how many women do you have besides old bab adria and charmian just two slave girls for cleaning and lenis the cook who is tiros wife youll attract no attention with so small a retinue he said have your women pack most of your goods and send them with tiro and otho to my house in rome then you may travel easily and in comfort he left her to return to rome and zenobia spent the rest of her day overseeing the packing by nightfall all was in readiness she had instructed both tiro and otho that they were to leave before morning in order to be through the town before everyone was up in the hour before the dawn she awakened and heard the carts lumbering from the villa courtyard with a sigh of relief zenobia turned over and went back to sleep she was awakened some time later by old bab who shook her frantically wake up my baby wake up what is it bab it was a monumental effort to keep her eyes open gaius cicero is here and he is demanding to see you you must get up and receive him instantly zenobia was awake her mind racing with curiosity gaius cicero was aurelians personal aide as well as the emperors favorite he had gone with his master to byzantium what was he doing back in tivoli was aurelian in rome had he learned of the plot against him she rose from her bed her body gleaming through her sleeping robe get me a tunic old woman where is gaius cicero now he waits in the atrium my baby bab replied pulling a light white wool tunica over zenobia and belting it with a length of red leather adria the sandals quickly zenobia slid her feet into her sandals and hurried from her bedchamber down the stairs of the house and into the atrium there she saw gaius cicero pacing greetings gaius cicero she called to him i thought you with the emperor i was majesty he has sent me back for you what she was astounded i am to bring you to the emperor majesty he says the soldier in gaius cicero flushed he says he cannot bear to be without you and i am to bring you to him have you come alone gaius cicero she asked him yes it was thought i might travel more quickly we can pick up an escort in rome very well gaius cicero if the emperor insists then who am i to argue it will take several days however for my things to be packed i was planning on going into rome today and so i shall ask you to accompany me but first i will give my servants orders to pack with a smile she turned and retraced her steps back to her bedchamber where she explained gaius ciceros presence to both bab and adria what will you do my baby i will go into rome now with gaius cicero and i shall let marcus handle this he and gaius cicero are friends perhaps we should warn him of the possible plot against aurelian if he does not return to the emperor then he may be saved i do not know his wife but i have heard it said that clodia cicero is a good woman and they have several children if he returns to the emperor he will surely suffer aurelians fate that however must be up to my husband i will not return here bab and so tomorrow you must bring mavia and the rest of the servants to me in rome it will be as you command my baby bab said be careful majesty lest gaius cicero suspect anything before you reach marcus alexander she then helped zenobia to dress for her journey into rome she left the tivoli villa without looking back the day was fair with early spring and the via flaminia mildly busy with traffic moving toward the city zenobia noted many farm carts filled with the first produce asparagus tiny onions new lettuce and brightly colored flowers there were some families undoubtedly going to visit relatives in rome and peddlers come to sell their wares in the streets there was little traffic from rome until a troupe of horsemen came galloping down the road causing those on foot and in smaller vehicles to scatter to the side of the via flaminia as they were about to pass the chariot in which zenobia and gaius cicero were riding their leader called a halt to his troupe hail gaius cicero i thought you were with the emperor hail fabius marcellus i was but i was sent back on an errand fabius marcellus looked at zenobia and then said is this not the queen of palmyra gaius cicero i am zenobia of palmyra she replied before he might speak i have an order for your arrest zenobia of palmyra came the frightening words gaius cicero was shocked and not a little surprised on whose order he demanded of fabius marcellus this woman is under the emperors personal protection on the orders of the senate came the reply there must be some mistake majesty gaius cicero said nonetheless i must let you go with fabius marcellus i will seek to find an answer to this puzzle and see to your release as quickly as possible zenobia was speechless with fearnot for herself but for marcus for mavia for dagian for her servants why was she being arrested had they somehow found out about her marriage to marcus a thousand questions flew through her numbed brain and then to her further terror she heard fabius marcellus say to gaius cicero i cannot let you go your way gaius cicero you are not where you should be and you are in the company of this woman i must ask that you accompany us until the senate knows of your presence and decides what to do with you gaius ciceros hand went to his broadsword and then upon reflectibn fell away he was badly outnumbered this was either a ridiculous mistake or else it was a plot against aurelian if it were an error he would shortly be free if it were a plot then his fate was in the hands of the gods i will go with you he said quietly and fabius marcellus sighed relieved he had known gaius cicero for a long time and he liked him he had no wish to kill a good officer zenobia roused herself where are you taking me she demanded drawing herself up her voice impersonal and imperious there is a small prison near the senate majesty i have been ordered to escort you there replied fabius marcellus now slightly discomfited by the tone of zenobias voice gaius cicero smiled to himself the queen he thought could certainly rise to the occasion a small prison the outrage in zenobias voice was evident for all to hear fabius marcellus suddenly realized that she was taller than he he flushed uncomfortably and then mumbled i am not to be held responsible for their decisions majesty i only do my duty he waved his hand in signal and suddenly the chariot was surrounded by praetorian guards with a nod and feeling that he had now regained charge of the situation fabius marcellus moved to the head of the group and they began to move off toward rome what do you know of this gaius cicero asked in a low voice nothing really she answered but several days ago senator tacitus called upon me and questioned me closely about what gaius cicero was curious about whether i carried the emperors child was her reply do you he looked closely at her no zenobia replied i do not oh i know that the emperor thinks i do but that is aurelians own desperation you are not a fool gaius cicero you cannot believe that i care for aurelian i am an imperial captive i have done what i had to to survive to insure my childrens survival i have loved but two men in my lifemy late husband and marcus alexander britainus but i thought you hated marcus for marrying carissa gaius cicero shook his head give me a simple woman like my clodia you must go to marcus when you are released gaius cicero you must go to him and tell him that i have been arrested he will know what to do and gaius remember your first loyalty is to your wife and family i have warned you do not fear majesty was his reply it is simply a misunderstanding i know nothing for certain gaius cicero yet i do know that if i have been ordered arrested it is because the senate would be certain that i am not with childaurelians child his heir when they are sure of that then i am certain to be released still i would have marcus know where i am gaius cicero will you promise to tell him for me very well majesty i promise you he paused and then he said i wonder if they will kill me because i am the emperors aide i do not think so gaius cicero simply pledge your fealty to rome to the new emperor seek out senator tacitus and explain to him that you are naught but a simple soldier not a politician he is a fair man and he will protect you so will your family yours is an old and honorable name cicero gaius cicero looked heartened by her words you are probably right had i been with the emperor i surely would have been struck down but the gods seemed to have arranged differently too quickly they were in rome and zenobia found herself being escorted into a building of deceptively innocent white marble fabius marcellus took her by the arm and presented her to the jailor i have the prisoner zenobia of palmyra on the senates orders she is to be held for interrogation fabius marcellus loosened his grip on her arm and zenobia turned to gaius cicero do not forget your promise gaius cicero she said before following after the jailor they went through a door and the stink that suddenly assailed her was worse than anything she had ever smelled she gasped and coughed sudden tears coming to her eyes youll get used to it the jailor said matteroffactly never she said what on earth is it the stink of human misery he answered her glancing around her as she followed after the jailor zenobia shuddered with distaste they were moving down a flight of stairs and she could see that both the steps and the walls were slippery with slime pitch torches stuck in crude iron holders lit the way flickering smokily and eerily reaching the bottom of the steps he led her along a corridor lined with small wooden doors there was no sound but the occasional rustle of rodents in the straw that lined the way at the very end of the corridor he stopped removed his key ring from his belt and unlocked a door in there my fine lady he said pointing through the open door zenobia ducked her head as she moved through the entry and into the cell behind her the door slammed and she heard the lock scraping as the jailor turned the key in it a quick look around the room convinced her that she was alone and she breathed easier free now to explore her surroundings she noted that the cell was small and obviously below ground level for there was no window a small pitch torch lit it and for that she was grateful if she had been thrown into darkness it would have been utterly terrifying like being buried alive in ones tomb there was straw on the floor and in an alcove in the wall a cracked pitcher of tepid water had been set there was nothing else to see and so she sat down on the floor to wait after a while she dozed she was startled awake by the sound of the key in the lock again and quickly scrambled to her feet with pounding heart to face two men who came into the cell you may close the door one of the men said to the jailor who instantly complied the other turned to zenobia and bowed politely majesty i am celsus the physician i have been appointed by the senate to examine you to determine whether or not you are with child i understand zenobia replied what would you have me do celsus the physician looked to the other man this is an impossible place in which to examine a patient senator nevertheless the senate commands it was the reply does the senate think i might have a clean basin with some warm water and additional light senator the senator flushed of course you may see to it while i entertain queen zenobia hurry this place is disgusting and i wish to leave as quickly as possible the physician bowed sarcastically called to the jailor and left with him to obtain what he needed the other man looked long at zenobia finally saying i am senator valerian hostilius majesty i have been appointed by the senate to oversee this examination i remember you senator i believe you wished to feed me to the lions the last time we met zenobia said scornfully it would have been better if the senate had listened to me hostilius said we can have no heirs of aurelian i am not with child senator zenobia said calmly so you say so you say i however was in the temple of the unconquerable sun the night of the rites the emperor was like a stallion that night he was the god he was and you are the goddess even i can see it hostilius licked his lips excitedly every one of the women he took that night has conceived a child and you tell me you are not with child i will not believe it unless the physician says it is so those women coupled with every man at that obscene orgy not just the emperor zenobia snapped at him aurelian is not capable of siring a child his own wife says it then a horrifying thought crossed her mind what has happened to those women that aurelian took that night she asked dead was his answer all dead we could have no spawn of aurelian coming back to haunt us by the gods she whispered you are all mad at that moment the physician returned with the jailor and the required items while the jailor set more light about the cell the physician placed his basin of warm water upon the alcove shelf and washed his hands you will have to disrobe majesty he said somewhat apologetically and then snapped at the openmouthed jailor out out you vermin there is nothing for you to see here the jailor scuttled away slamming the door as he went must he be here zenobia demanded looking at hostilius i remain on the senates orders lest you coerce this man into lying what celsus looked outraged my reputation is one of honesty valerian hostilius nonetheless i remain on the senates orders was the pompous reply celsus looked to zenobia i am sorry majesty i have never before examined a patient under such circumstances and i do apologize she nodded sympathetically at him and men said what must i do when you have disrobed you will please to lie upon the straw here ignoring hostilius zenobia removed her clothing and lay down upon the straw she could feel the chill of the cell now and involuntarily she shuddered his look offered commiseration the physician palpated her stomach and examined her breasts then taking infinite care not to hurt her he gently examined her internally finally satisfied celsus arose from his position on the floor and washing his hands again said queen zenobia is not with child senator i will tender my report in writing to the senate but you may tell them that she is absolutely positively not with child zenobia sat up somewhat lightheaded then i can be released unless the senate has other reasons for retaining you in custody majesty i can see no reason why you cant be released now he looked to hostilius senator you are not empowered to make official decisions physician you have done your duty now get you gone zenobia struggled to her feet her instincts warning her of impending danger celsus took a quick look at hostilius and then said i will wait for you senator we came together we shall leave together hostilius threw him a furious look swallowed visibly and then muttered very well i am ready celsus bowed to zenobia again majesty i apologize for the inconvenience her eyes spoke her thanks to him before he turned and left the cell with the senator slowly zenobia redressed then sat back down to await her release the extra lamps that the jailor had brought helped to cast a more cheerful light about the grim cell and they even released a bit of warmth into the chill air the time crawled by in an effort to make it go faster she began to sing softly to herself suddenly the door to the cell creaked open and it occurred to zenobia that she hadnt heard the key in the lock she rose to face hostilius he smiled nastily at her you thought that you were rid of me didnt you he leered the door closed behind him now she heard the key turning in the lock what do you want senator she said keeping her voice steady you haunt me hostilius said ever since that night in the temple of the unconquerable sun when i saw how beautiful you are and how passionate i have wanted you soon aurelian will be dead the plot is made the conspirators chosen it is only a matter of time and he will be dead you will need a new protector zenobia you will need someone powerful to take care of you the empire can be harsh with its captives but if you will accept my protection i will shower you with riches zenobia stared at the senator in genuine surprise and then she began to laugh her laughter shattered the heavy silence of the prison cell and echoed from wall to wall with open mockery hostilius started with surprise then grew red with anger but before he could speak she regained control of herself and said you have to be jesting valerian hostilius i am zenobia the queen of palmyra not some expensive courtesan for hire you are an imperial captive and aurelians whore he reminded her i am indeed an imperial captive she snapped back at him but if the emperor is to be deposed then i will no longer have to be his whore senator and i will most certainly not be yours i want you he moved toward her the violence of his lust clear in his eyes in his movements her eyes swept the tiny cell for something to defend herself with but there was nothing now it was hostilius seeing her predicament who laughed if you harm me i will complain to the senate she threatened him the jailor will identify you hostilius and the physician saw your intent the jailor has been well paid to keep his mouth shut and celsus did not see me return he reached out for her and she shrank back against the wall he chuckled delighted by her reticence come now he wheedled i wont hurt you i am said to be a good lover and you are no maid to be coy with me she looked at him horrified he was a nasty little man she thought at least two inches shorter than she with a balding head of sparse black hair a fat slug of a man with pudgy plump hands he was so white that he seemed almost bloodless you will take off your clothes for me he said in a soft dangeroussounding voice i will not from among the folds of his tunic and toga he suddenly withdrew a small dog whip i am very proficient with this he said flicking it perilously near her face i could put out your eye should i choose to do so she stood as still as a flushed rabbit as he rubbed the whip against her cheek take off your clothes zenobia he repeated you pig she hissed at him take off your clothes he smiled knowing that he had won as she slowly removed her tunic dress she debated the wisdom of physically attacking him she was taller than the senator but he outweighed her considerably what would she do with him if she overpowered him the jailor certainly wasnt going to come to her aid it was an impossible situation and hostilius decided the matter by grabbing one of her arms as she freed herself of her clothing yanking it up and imprisoning it within a wall manacle she gasped as the cold iron bracelet snapped shut about her wrist what are you doing she cried frightened now dont worry he soothed her as he fastened her other wrist within the restraint i have the key to unlock you afterward she hung now from the wall her toes just barely grazing the straw on the floor the wall behind her was cold and wet causing her to arch her body outward with trembling fingers hostilius slowly slid her garments over her hips and down her legs to the floor then he stood back and stared at her his eyes were glazed with desire his mouth hung slack with his lechery finally he spoke his voice hoarse with hunger you are even more beautiful than i remember as he groaned she saw a wet stain begin to spread on his toga and she realized with disgust that he had been unable to contain himself she hoped that having spilled his seed upon the straw he would be unable to continue but hostilius did not even appear to notice what had happened and reached out to touch her breasts zenobia shrank from him her back making contact with the wet cold stones of the cell wall his fleshy fingers began to brush the warmth of her skin slowly at first and then as his lust caught up with him he grasped her breasts in his two hands and squeezed fiercely making her wince with pain leaving marks upon her pale golden flesh with a moan he pressed up close against her his head swiveling swiftly to find a nipple and then suck it deep within his mouth he drew insistently upon her breast like a hungry child his mouth ferocious and demanding she was totally repelled by him and struggled to twist her body away from him but he merely grasped her hips to hold her still while he continued his obscene parody having wrung all he could from one breast his balding head moved to the other you are disgusting she said you are totally repellent to me can you not function normally with a woman must you force them in order to obtain satisfaction in answer he bit down upon her breast and she cried out in pain her arms jerking instinctively to strike him his hands moved around behind her crushing her buttocks in a brutal grip she tried to retaliate drawing her knees up and then kicking out at him her numbed feet made contact with his soft middle and hostilius staggered back from zenobia with an offff sound regaining his balance he came at her the little dog whip flying cutting into her tender thighs and belly making her cry out in pain again still she taunted him monster slithering reptile free me and then attempt your rape you are not man enough you will see how masculine i am bitch he snarled at her when i fuck you you will beg me to continue to never stop the little whip slashed at her again and again and she was bleeding from several small cuts on her legs and stomach zenobia was more angry than frightened now and she continued to mock him you are a pig hostilius you have already spilled your seed in your lust and i do not believe that you can replenish it it is probably the first time in months that you were able to rise to the occasion i think he said menacingly that i shall share you with the jailor she laughed scornfully must you see another man rape me before you are able to function hostilius valerian hostilius grew beet red and then a very evil look came into his eyes he smiled nastily at her and said i know just how to still your vicious tongue the dog whip flicked out at her nipple and she winced suddenly unnerved by his manner he walked to the door and pounded upon it almost instantly the entry creaked open and the jailor entered his eyes darting to zenobia his own craving evident hostilius smiled again i need help with this recalcitrant bitch jailor aid me and she is yours when i have finished when i am through with her she will be all cozy and obedient i promise you the jailor licked his lips and whined what if she tells noble senator i have not your rank to protect me hostilius laughed do you dunk this proud bitch will admit to having been humped by a piece of vermin like you dont be ridiculous help me now what do you want me to do noble senator im taking her down and i want you to restrain her across your knees i have a fancy to beat her bottom for a bit hostilius unlocked the iron manacles from zenobias wrists and once again her feet made contact with the floor dont help him good jailor she cried out i will say he sneaked into the cell when you werent looking and that unknowingly you locked him in here with me i will claim you found him when my cries alerted you good jailor i am a most important imperial captive hostilius dealt zenobia a staggering blow to the side of her head pay no attention to the bitch she is no one the whip descended upon her tender flesh forcing a cry through her clenched teem have you ever taken a woman like one takes a boy hostilius demanded of the jailor and then he laughed yes yes i can see you have well i am going to take her like that now lay her flat jailor i imagine that she is quite ready for me nowarent you zenobia the jailor laid her face down in the straw and then she felt hostilius climbing upon her buttocks the jailor held her arms down stretched above her head so she might not struggle the gods she thought dogs mate this way but people dont she felt his fingers beginning to separate the halves of her bottom felt something slimy trying to push at her and suddenly she screamed as loud as she could nooo nooooooo there was a roar of outrage from the doorway of the cell her arms were suddenly loosened and she felt hostiliuss weight yanked off of her the jailor was already babbling hysterically i only did what he told me i am a poor man sir dont kill me let him go marcus she heard gaius cicero say and then marcuss voice replied run for your miserable life man before i regret my merciful intent she ached all over but she was too weak to rise she could only lie there face down in the straw listening as her husband said coldly youre a dead man valerian hostilius and then there was a strange sound a wheezing sigh and the thump of a body hitting the floor she didnt need to be told that the senator was dead she fainted with relief returning to consciousness she was totally confused as to where she was as her eyes slowly focused she became aware of movement of the fact that she ached terribly the very fabric of her tunic scratching initatingly against her skin she was dressed she was in a litter she was in marcuss arms she was safe marcus she whispered eagerly through cracked lips beloved his face swam into view growing clearer with each moment praise the gods you came in time she said softly he was going to i know what the swine was going to do he said grimly gaius went to you yes they only held him long enough to be certain there was no counterplot he has already sworn his fealty to the senate and will be safe from harm no matter what happens to aurelian i am free yes the physician celsus wasted no time in reporting to senator tacitus that you were not carrying aurelians child and the order had already been given that you be released hostilius knew that it would be is he dead marcus yes i slit his fat throat we will go tomorrow yes i have requested permission in my mothers name to take you to the seaside to recuperate tacitus signed the order himself i think he suspects that it is not my mother who wants to take you to the seaside we could not get through the city gates to the port however without a pass from the senate you are still an imperial captive are you taking me home yes my beloved i am taking you home her eyes closed again and when she next awoke she was tucked into a comfortable bed within a house she was stripped of her garments but her wounds had been washed and dressed with a sweetsmelling unguent the coverlet of the bed had been raised somehow and although it sheltered her it did not touch her sensitive skin she sighed with relief and instantly dagian was at her side my dearest daughter praise mother juno that you are safe her blue eyes were wet with tears what time is it almost dawn came the reply have you watched by my bedside all night dagian only the last hour my dear marcus has been with you all night i am all right zenobia reassured dagian just somewhat sore marcus should not have sat up all night especially when we must leave this day we will not leave until the afternoon zenobia and marcus has changed our plans slightly when he returned with you late yesterday he sent word to his captain to take his ship from the old harbor at ostia and move it to the new harbor at portus rather than ride to the coast we are going to go by barge down the tiber and through the claudian canal directly into the portus harbor it will be far more comfortable for you my dear our household goods left here yesterday at dawn and will be awaiting us tomorrow aboard the ship a rider went after them late yesterday to tell them of the change in plans then we sail tomorrow on the first tide after we arrive my dear i shall not be sorry to say goodbye to italy dagian as much as i fear your britain fear britain why should you fear my homeland dagian was astounded from what marcus has told me over the years dagian your land is a wild and fierce one from what marcus has told me zenobia your homeland is a wild and fierce one dagian replied with a smile i think my dear daughter that it is merely a matter of familiarity britain seems frightening to you because you have never been there besides i doubt that you will ever see one of our warriors painted blue and driving his chariot in battle then she laughed at the startled look on zenobias face your warriors paint themselves blue indeed they do dagian said chuckling why because my dear our warriors believe that if they fall in battle their enemies may strip them only of their possessions but never of their dignity as long as they are painted blue zenobia thought a moment and then to dagians surprise she nodded her head and said thoughtfully yes i understand that what a strange thing dagian thought i meant to tease her about our warriors and instead i have calmed her fears go back to sleep zenobia she said we have a long journey ahead of us she slept again awakening close to midday both bab and adria were with her now and her soreness was almost gone she stretched yawning lazily and bab hurried over to the bed her face concerned the lady dagian has told me of your ordeal my baby curse the romans they are evil people my husband is a roman bab no he is not was the quick reply perhaps his father was but marcus alexander britainus is like his mother zenobia laughed you have settled it in your mind i can see very well i shall not argue with you old friend however i do wish to rise please see to my clothing while old bab did as she was bid adria gently lifted the bed coverlet back and helped zenobia to get up her face flushed with embarrassment when she saw her mistresss body and she turned away looking down zenobia gasped in shock venus aid me she cried for upon her breasts were distinct fingermarks her lower torso was crisscrossed with narrow raised red welts and in a small table mirror she could see over her shoulder that her buttocks were badly bruised turning around bab shrieked in horror and gaspingly clutched at her chest what have they done to you my baby zenobia was concerned less for herself than for the old lady who had so faithfully served her since childhood and so she said its all right bab but do you know of some potion or unguent that will help me erase these bruises quickly diverted the old woman thought a moment and then said i will send one of the slaves to the apothecarys shop for what i need do not fear my baby i will have the mark of that beast gone as quickly as possible what crassness to mark your lovely skin so why even the emperor never treated you thus no zenobia said he didnt and she remembered hostiliuss remark about the difference in treatment among imperial captives early in the afternoon they left the house of the alexander family they traveled to the barge landing by litter the slaves and the servants walking along beside them it was not a particularly large or impressive party nothing that would attract attention in addition to adria bab and charmian there were half a dozen alexander family slaves at the docks their papers were checked and approved by a centurion for no one entered or exited the city without permission the barge was luxurious but not overlarge it had a sail that was now raised to catch the afternoon winds and they began their trip downriver to the harbor at portus the weather was fair and warm but still they traveled master and servants alike in a state of nervous expectation neither marcus nor zenobia nor dagian would feel entirely safe until they were at sea when night fell slaves and family partook of a simple meal upon the open deck of the barge it was a meal that they had supplied themselves for the bargemaster was bound only to offer them passage and shelter to portus when night fell the slaves settled themselves to sleep upon the open deck while the family and their personal servants sought shelter in the barges cabin there were but two bunks and dagian was settled in one while mavia and old bab were put in the other bab protested loudly no no my baby it is not right that you sleep upon the floor while i rest in comfort peace old woman zenobia said remember your years in the last months you have been dragged from palmyra to rome and now you undertake another long journey i would have you comfortable so you will always be here to serve me what bab would i do without you i will be with you as long as the gods allow and no longer bab said marcus smiled warmly at the faithful old servant and he put a kindly arm about her sturdy shoulders britain will be lovelier bab if your old bones do not ache sleep with mavia and argue no longer bab looked adoringly up at him a look that zenobia had never seen her bestow before upon any man yes master she said and i thank you for your kindness to me adria and charmian were settled one beneath each bunk and then marcus and zenobia returned outside to sit on the open deck above them the warm spring night glistened with a million bright stars the river gently caressed the flat bottom of the boat and the wind teased at the loose tendrils of zenobias long black hair as she faced downriver he stood behind her his arms wrapped securely about her waist drawing her firmly against him for a long while they were silent and she marveled that just his simple gesture of holding her could make her feel so marvelous so loved so cherished she adored the hardness of his chest against her back the softness of his breath against her hair i am so glad that you love me she said quietly he laughed softly at last we are together do not say it she begged not yet not until we have escaped the empire once we are free of rome then i shall care not what happens as long as we are together marcus i have loved you for so very long that i dare not believe in this happy ending quite yet we are together zenobia now and forever he said with quiet assurance and we shall rebuild our lives on the edge of britain and rear our daughter in safety and have a son to love and raise i yet fear the motives of the gods she said softly do not fear them beloved for you are their chosen and have always been he turned her now and his mouth touched hers with infinite gentleness tasting as a bee tastes of precious nectar caressing possessively communicating his love of her his need of her with a sigh she returned the kiss her lips parting for him her arms wrapping about his neck to mold her lustiness against his hardness his tongue darted through her lips and about her mouth touching with wildfire the tip and sides of her tongue the roof of her mouth the corners of her mouth the kiss deepened growing more ardent more possessive stoking the passionate fires burning deep within them both zenobia shuddered with surrender but with the sudden realization of where they were marcus very gently broke off the embrace still holding her close to him she laughed weakly and said low never has any man ever driven me to such passion my darling if only there were a place upon this ship of yours where we might be alone i do not think i can bear being parted from you for much longer he chuckled and replied you are a most tempting morsel and i long to ravish you with my love but for now i think it best we seek the arms of morpheus and sleep reentering the cabin he spread his large cape upon the floor and they lay down to sleep two hours after the dawn they arrived in the bustling harbor town of portus having passed from the tiber river through the claudian canal at the dock they were met by the alexander family retainers and litters that carried them down to the waterfront where marcuss ship awaited them it was a magnificent vessel its dark wood sides polished to a glistening redbrown sheen the stern of the ship was beautifully carved with scenes of leaping porpoises ocean nymphs gamboling amid the waves and delicate whorled shells all exquisitely gilded with gold the deck was of wellrubbed lightcolored oak the four lightblue sailsa square mainsail the two triangular sails called lateen sails above the mainsail and the small square sail at the bow called the artemonwere of the finest canvas the vessel was one hundred eighty feet in length and fortyfive feet in width there were two rudders one on either side of the stem the helmsmen stood upon a small elevated deck that had on it the upper half of a swan painted quite realistically and hollowed so that it might serve as a shelter for the captain of the vessel or one of the helmsmen when he was not at his steering oar on the main deck was the masters cabin made up of two rooms the larger front room an airy and light place where they would eat behind the main cabin and beneath the steering deck was set a smaller inside cabin where marcus and zenobia would sleep in privacy below decks was the enormous cargo hold and a place for the crew to sleep also below the decks would be all of the alexander household slaves but it would not be overly crowded for the cargo space would be only half full with all the familys goods the merchantman called a corbitae was a round ship it was sturdy and reliable but could easily be caught by a faster bireme or trireme roman warships which were not only sailpowered but oarpowered it was therefore important that the alexander family cause no attention to be drawn to them the captain had been ordered to file a course for cyprus with the authorities and only when they were under way would marcus order that course changed the fewer people involved in his secret the better little mavia was delighted with the ship and promptly told everyone so what is it called mama she demanded of zenobia who turned to marcus for help it is called the sea nymph my daughter he answered her i am not your daughter am i mavia asked innocently marcus lifted the child up into his arms and looked into the blue eyes so like his own gently he brushed the chestnut hair also like his you are my own true child and i love you he answered her simply mavia put her arms about his neck and kissed him upon the cheek i have always wanted a father she said i am glad you are my papa it was as simple as that from that time on mavia the princess of palmyra disappeared into the mists of time there was only mavia the daughter of marcus alexander britainus and for mavia it was as if he had always been there although until this moment she had never called him father she would when she grew older never remember not having called him father zenobias eyes were bright with unshed tears thank you she said to her husband and marcus understood it was the right time he told her then together they went aboard the sea nymph to be warmly greeted by captain paulus charmian took mavia off to see the ship and the others settled themselves while zenobia and marcus spoke with the captain the next tide is two hours after midday sir the captain said with your permission we can sail then is there a reason to stay longer my love marcus asked no she replied i am willing to sail this day so be it then marcus looked to the captain who nodded his agreement weve all our supplies aboard and plenty of fresh water sir if you my lady need any extras you would be wise to purchase them now i can have one of my men escort you to the harbor shops i do not think that i lack for anything zenobia replied but i shall call my servants and visit the shops you suggest mayhap in the looking we will see something we need your escort will be most welcome zenobia sought out dagian and adria and the three women spent the next hour shopping in the company of two brawny sailors as they returned to the sea nymph zenobias heart lurched as she saw a familiar figure standing upon the deck with her husband the three women climbed the gangway and while adria hurried to store away their few purchases dagian and zenobia came forward to meet marcus and his guest gaius cicero it is good to see you dagian said cordially the tribune bowed from the waist and replied and as always lady dagian it is good to see you you are well i am how is clodia and your children they thrive there was a short awkward silence and then dagian said come zenobia let us see to mavia no marcus looked to his wife you go mother i would like zenobia to stay here with us for a few moments you will keep mavia occupied for us dagian withdrew and zenobia looked at the two men well she said what is it i can tell that all is not right i have an order for your return to rome majesty never both men were startled by the vehemence in her reply and in an effort to calm her marcus put a hand on her arm but she shook it off angrily i would the before i would return to rome gaius cicero i am tired of wars and i am tired of politics my only wish now is to live my life in peace if i cannot then take your sword and kill me for i will not return to rome she looked to her husband have you told him marcus shook his head tell him she commanded tell me what gaius cicero looked puzzled zenobia and i have been married for two months now gaius we have witnessesmy mother and zenobias two freedwomen by the gods the tribune said in a low voice you are leaving italy we are i cannot let you marcus the senate must be informed of queen zenobias marriage to you they will of course set the marriage aside for with a mate the queen becomes dangerous once more to rome im sorry but i cannot let you go he looked honestly regretful you owe me zenobia snarled and suddenly she was once again all queen she drew herself up to her full height and looking gaius cicero directly in the eye her gaze was proud he remembered the first time he had seen her standing in ah her queenly array atop the walls of palmyra defying the mighty roman empire i warned you of aurehans impending fall so that your wife need not mourn your death so that your children both born and unborn would not lose their father gaius cicero i gave you your life now give me mine majesty if it were my decision i would wish you neptunes own luck wherever you went but it is not my decision i am only a servant of the empire but i am a good servant i will not betray my people we do not ask you to betray rome gaius marcus said quietly zenobia and i have nothing to do with rome we are nothing more but a man and his wife trying to begin anew amid the ruins of our old lives palmyra is gone it will never again arise from the destruction that rome inflicted upon it its young king lives in exile with his family its younger prince is lost in time there is no longer a queen of palmyra there is only zenobia the wife of marcus alexander the mother the woman let her go gaius during his impassioned speech zenobia found herself pressing close to her husband they were at last a family she and marcus and mavia this time when he put his arm around her she melted back into the embrace with pride for she was proud to be his wife gaius cicero looked at them and knew in that instant that they would not be separated he knew that they would die first or that his old friend marcus alexander britainus would even set their long friendship aside and slit his throat before he would let gaius take her back to rome he didnt know why the senate had changed their minds but he reasoned how important could it be aurelians execution was a certainty and zenobia was fleeing the empire he could see that she posed no danger i came ahead of my soldiers he said there is no one to know that i saw you who will contradict me when i say that your ship had already sailed when i reached portus thank you my friend marcus said gratefully what course do you set cyprus came the answer gaius ciceros face said that he did not believe for a minute that cyprus was actually their destination i have no order to follow you he said i shall ascertain your destination from the harbor master and return to rome with my information then he smiled at them may the gods speed your journey my friends and bring you to safety the two men clasped arms in the old roman fashion then gaius cicero turned abruptly and left the ship walking away into the bustle upon the dock marcus turned and spoke to a nearby sailor is everyone aboard yes sir was the reply then take the gangway up the ships owner commanded giving zenobia a quick kiss on the forehead he hurried off to find captain paulus the captain was on the helmsmans deck i have ordered the gangway drawn up marcus told him is not the tide turning now yes sir was the reply i am just now giving orders to get underway change your course marcus said change my course for where sir for massalia captain paulus if we are to catch this tide sir there is no time for me to inform the harbor master that is indeed unfortunate captain paulus marcus said thoughtfully for i do want to depart now what harm can it do sir the captain replied we are only transporting our new owner and his family and their goods and chattel it can be of little import to the mighty roman empire so saying the captain began to give orders and the ship slowly got underway taking its place amid the vessels catching this tide marcus alexander britainus returned to the main deck below and stood with zenobia at the rail watching the activity of the harbor as sea nymphs sails caught the afternoon wind and began to move gradually out into the open sea i remember he said and he caught at her hand the day that we arrived here from britain those long years ago how different it was from my homeland i never loved rome the way i love britain nor did i love rome the way i loved palmyra he sighed i wonder he said if i shall still love britain it can be a harsh place zenobia you are not used to chill weather and britain can be cold you have told me that the climate is mild on the island where we shall make our home you have told me that palm trees grow on our island palms cannot exist in a harsh climate as long as the palms thrive then so shall i my love they had cleared the harbor and as the sea nymph swept into the open sea zenobia felt a small thrill of excitement strangely the sea did not frighten her child of the desert that she was she found it very much like the desert vast and rolling and everchanging it seemed to go on forever and in the days ahead she found that she could stand at the rail for hours her eyes seeking searching ever watching for what she knew not it had been early spring when they left portus and now they would shortly be reaching massilia the great and ancient port in that part of caesars gaul known as narbonensis here the alexander family would leave their ship and journey up through gaul using the roads traveled for centuries by the tin caravans on the north coast of gaul they would once again meet up with sea nymph and cross the channel to britain because of the dangers of sea travel marcus had preferred his family to travel by land where safe routes existed the slaves would remain with the ship but zenobia and dagians personal servants mavias nurse and severus would travel with the family at massilia there was no undue activity about the docks nor any interest shown in the sea nymph or her passengers marcus breathed a deep sigh of relief though he realized that if gaius cicero had returned to rome with the information that they had sailed for cyprus there would be a pursuit ordered in that direction when their pursuers discovered no trace of them the search would probably be ordered in the direction of britain but by then the trail would be cold and they would be where rome could not reach they left sea nymph and traveled easily and quickly up from the coast bordering the mediterranean to the coast on the channel that faced britain the weather was pleasant and they traveled amid the beauty of gaul with its flowerfilled fields and its great forests of oak it was the forests with their soaring trees and dappled sunlight that made zenobia nervous she had never seen such vast expanses of trees and she did not like being shut off from her sun the nights they spent in the forests were most frightening to her and she lay holloweyed and wide awake against marcus who slept unconcerned by her side every hoot of an owl every unexplained rustle and the long night seemed full of them set her heart beating quicker zenobia welcomed their arrival at the coast where sea nymph waited to ferry them across to britain they sailed from gaul on an evening tide by morning they would be in britain zenobia dozed fitfully that night her entire body attuned to the dawn and when it came she rose from her place and wrapped herself in a long cloak before leaving the cabin there was no wind and the sky was white sea nymph bobbed gently amid the clouds of fog the only sound the rhythmic splash of the sea against the sides of the ship then as the sky began to grow a clear blue and the mists were driven away by the rising wind she saw ahead of her a large island its white cliffs rising out of the sea behind her she heard a step so familiar she didnt even bother to turn what is it marcus it is the island of vectis and just beyond it is portus adurni where we shall land what makes the cliffs so white they are made of chalk he said interesting she replied then added will vaba and his family be awaiting us in portus adurni no he said quietly are they already upon our island or are they to come after us he sighed they are not coming at all beloved not coming she turned and looked up at him why are they not coming marcus because vaba chooses not to come cyrene is not the grandest place in the roman world but he prefers to remain there with flavia and their daughter he has found contentment quick tears sprang to her eyes he is rejecting me marcus he is rejecting his own mother he has never forgiven me for palmyra and i doubt he ever will my children are gone and i am alone your children are all alive although they choose to live their own lives beloved demi was found amid the ruins of the city and has been nursed back to health by your brothers he chooses to remain with the bedawi so the sons of odenathus have survived despite all and we have our daughter the gods have taken away with one hand it is true but they have also given with the other she cried then weeping against his chest until her sorrow was finally purged then sniffing loudly she looked up at him with a loving smile he kissed her on her nose and she had to laugh softly for it was the sort of thing a mischievous little boy would have done i love you he said and we are about to begin a new life put the past behind you zenobia only today and tomorrow matter yes she said you are right marcus and yet i cannot help but be sad they were only little boys the last time i looked and now suddenly they are grown men and they do not need me any longer i need you he answered her and our daughter needs you and the son you will give me needs you i know marcus but let me mourn my loss without guilt sometimes a woman needs time to mourn such a loss i shall not die of grief never fear sea nymph sailed past vectis and around the islands headland into the harbor of portus adurni compared to the great harbors she had seen this one was tiny and yet it was a main port of entry for roman britain around them on the deck great activity was taking place as the ships sailors prepared for landing look marcus pointed there is my brother aulus come to meet us your brother how did he know we were coming sea nymph arrived on the gaulish coast before we did before we left the ship at massilia i had instructed captain paulus that he was to send a messenger ahead to britain as soon as he reached gaul that is why aulus is here he turned back to the rail and grinning shouted aulus you are getting fat and you are graying like an old man came back the laughing reply the ropes from the ship were thrown shoreward and made fast the gangway was lowered and aulus alexander britainus rushed aboard to embrace his brother there were tears in his blue eyes although to his older brothers amusement he quickly brushed them aside still marcus was touched praise the gods you are safe aulus said and our mother i have brought her to safety also marcus replied the two broke apart and stood for a moment staring delightedly at each other then auluss eyes swung about to light upon zenobia and he boldly assessed her she stared back as coolly finally aulus grinned in a boyish impudent fashion is this zenobia he demanded marcus chuckled yes you overgrown roughneck this is zenobia my wife zenobia this is my charming but rude younger brother aulus hail brother zenobia said and then she mischievously embraced him kissing him on both cheeks and pressing her beautiful bosom against his chest as her heady hyacinth scent rose up to assail him auius felt a quick stab of desire and he gasped in surprise both marcus and zenobia laughed whew chuckled the younger alexander i surrender sister you are more woman than im prepared to deal with and i bow to my brothers ability as well you should zenobia teased him and then she turned to her husband i will go and fetch dagian she will want to see this reprobate i am sure aulus and marcus both watched her go and with a grin aulus congratulated his older brother by the gods she is a beauty youll get a host of sons on her brother perhaps if we are fortunate aulus but i will not endanger her life to insure my immortality zenobia and i are no longer children though we be newly married we already have a child and if mavia is all we ever have then i shall be satisfied but zenobias daughter is the child of her late husband that does not count zenobias daughter is mine brother aulus still did not understand but then he saw the little girl exiting the main cabin of the ship running toward them papa is this britain are we here marcus swept her up in his arms and aulus gaped at the two heads so alike in color the matching blue eyes and the childs nose and jaw so like his and marcuss mavia this is your uncle aulus marcus said matteroffactly mavia held out her arms to aulus and charmed he lifted her from her fathers grasp into his own she kissed him sweetly how do you do uncle aulus i do very well little mavia he said do you have a little girl like me she asked him indeed i do today you will start your journey to salinae where we have a fine villa you have lots of little cousins awaiting your arrival mavia and i promise you a very good time mavia clapped her hands gleefully do you hear that papa i have cousins who wait to play with me i have never had any cousins before i shall like this britain i know i shall aulus put her down and she ran off reentering the cabin as zenobia exited it your mother will be here shortly zenobia said what news of the emperor marcus demanded which emperor aurelian is dead assassinated outside of byzantium tacitus reigns the old senator yes the army asked the senate to appoint him as it could not agree upon a candidate has there been any outcry over the disappearance of the queen none i have not even heard she was missing the empress ulpia however died they say at the very hour of aurelians death faithful ulpia zenobia said she will serve him as well in death as she did in life you are sure aulus you are sure that there has been no mention of zenobia at all none that i have heard marcus and i am privy to accurate information we are safe then zenobia queried him perhaps beloved but nonetheless i will take no chances he touched her face in an affectionate gesture and then turned back to his brother aulus i wish to purchase from you the island off the southern coast that grandfathers concubine brought him as her dowry it is yours brother but i will not take your gold it is my wedding gift to you what will you do with it we will live there aulus there i believe zenobia and i will be safe from any pursuit yes aulus agreed you will be safe and i will help see to that with the luck of the gods we will have plenty of time to prepare first however you must come to salinae so that zenobia may meet the rest of the family i had thought to go immediately to the island marcus said with that roman ship of yours and its roman crew no brother i think not when it returns to rome all the captain and crew can say is that you were brought to portus adurni past here they will be able to tell the authorities nothing this land of ours may be an island but it is a large island our own people will get you to your island marcus aulus dagian hurried up to her son and kissed him did i not tell you it was not my fate to die in a foreign land i am home after all these years i can scarcely believe it tell me how fares eada and my grandchildren he returned the kiss and smilingly told her both my wife and the children are all well if you are ready mother we shall begin our journey to salinae dagian nodded happily and turned to marcus zenobia and mavia we are going home my children she said and they were all unable to contain their joy portus adurni had not been particularly impressive being more a village in size though it had its baths and temple to jupiter the streets were hardened dirt and zenobia imagined in winter a sea of mud although romes influence was evident in the soldiers and the more prosperous citizens who affected roman garb these were outnumbered by tall blackhaired lighteyed and fairskinned men and women wearing their own colorful dress including leg coverings for the men she had stared openly and was stared at in return aulus alexander britainus had arranged that his brothers entire family be transported by wagons the hundred fifteen miles from portus adurni to his villa outside the small town of salinae salinae was located in a beautiful river valley surrounded by gentle hills near the border of the ordovices tribesmen in wales even the slaves rode in the wagons for the alexander brothers wanted quickly to put as much distance between themselves and the coast as possible the farther away they moved from the coast the less strong the roman influenceand government zenobia insisted upon being given her own horse she reveled in this freedom the first she had had since aurelian had taken her prisoner at palmyra the countryside was like nothing she had ever seen before it is so green she remarked several times almost to no one and the brothers grinned over her head at each other she had always believed palmyra the fairest thing upon the earth but this green land with its orchards of pink and white blossoms its fields of wild white daisies and purple yarrow its rushing streams of clear water it was all too much the fields seemed to go on forever in their lustiness the hills rolled gently down to the valleys zenobia was falling more in love with the glorious countryside as each mile passed nonetheless she noticed a subtle change in her brotherinlaw the closer they came to the village of salinae where the alexander villa was located the less roman he became the trappings of the empire falling away from him easily the morning of the day they were to arrive he appeared in a riding costume of a mediumblue kneelength tunica embroidered in gold thread around its lower edge and the long sleeves deeper blue braccos crossgartered with bronze studded straps and a darkblue cloak fastened at the shoulder by a fibula by the gods marcus drawled amused youre affecting a britons dress little brother no marcus i was affecting roman dress in order to have easy access to the waterfront in portus adurni i dress like a briton because i am a briton my wife is a briton my children are british and i live in britain i have never been a perfumed roman our father was roman marcus said in a tense voice our mother was not came the reply you reject rome aulus i do we do not need the romans here in britain zenobia sighed she might have been in palmyra and it might have been she who spoke not aulus the romans seemed to bring nothing but dissension with them nothing changes she said quietly they turned to look at her and marcus realized what she was thinking it will not be like palmyra he reassured her this is my brothers way of being his own man your brother is very much his own man dagian said he did not want to tell you marcus but we are so near to salinae that now i must aulus is chief of the salinae dobunni he was elected by the tribe when his uncles were killed in a fight with the ordovices it was just before he came to rome at the time of your fathers death your cousins had not the leadership ability and in fact it was they who put him forth to be elected so the elder brother landless and now without power must look to his younger sibling for succor marcus said suddenly he laughed seeing humor in the situation you had best let me retire to the island aulus if i decide to stay at salinae i shall overcome you and rule the dobunni myself can you see me my hair long twin mustaches drooping mournfully my body painted blue leading a screaming charge into a legion aulus laughed back imagining the picture his elegant elder brother had painted i shall indeed give you the island brother you are far too civilized to be britainized briton or roman aulus i care not all i wish now is to live in peace with zenobia and our child i have had enough of wars and intrigues aulus was sympathetic to his brothers wishes his own life had been strangely easy he realized now that he looked back with more objectivity than he had ever had he had known from the moment he had met eada that she was the woman for him and they were today the proud parents of six sons and two daughters aulus alexander britainus felt an enormous burst of love for his older brother and his sisterinlaw they deserved peace and they deserved happiness he was going to try to see that they got both they had long passed through corinium and glevum and now the houses of the village of salinae came into view it was a pretty place its white houses having redtiled roofs each building or group of buildings walled in from the street there was a market in the center of the town but it was a small place and there were no public baths or temples in evidence as they entered the village zenobia could hear the cry being taken up the master is home the master comes they rode beneath a tall roofed gatehouse and into a pleasant courtyard from the open portico of the house came a tall and lovely woman in a paleblue tunic dress her long yellow braids bound up at the back of her head upon which rested a sheer white linen cloth held in place by a plain gold fillet aulus was off his horse in a minute to sweep the woman into his arms and place a resounding kiss upon her lips laughingly she chided him but her lightblue eyes were soft with love for shame my lord and before our guests marcus dismounted and carefully lifted zenobia down from her horse drawing her forward he said to the blond woman eada i am your brotherinlaw marcus and this is my wife zenobia you are most welcome to britain brother and sister and to our home was the cordial reply as eada came shyly forward and kissed them both on the cheeks dagian now stepped forward and stared at eada eada stared back and then the two women embraced they had never before met but they knew in an instant that they would be friends and dagian knew that her old age would be a safe and pleasant one in this young womans house where are the children dagian begged from the portico eight youngsters came forth and eada the love and pride shining from her eyes proudly introduced her children to their grandmother my eldest son grafere he has seventeen summers and this is leofel who is fifteen and aelfraed thirteen and his next brother banbrigge eleven they are the four eldest mother dagian dagian hugged each of the boys admiring their healthy good looks all were blueeyed but three were darkhaired like their father while leofel was a blond like his mother eada continued her introductions here are my daughters she drew forth two pretty blond girls their long hair in two neat plaits on either side of their heads this is erwina who is nine and her sister feam seven dagian knelt and holding out her arms embraced her two newly found granddaughters who shyly kissed her in return mavia where is my little mavia dagian asked mavia stepped from her hiding place behind her father and came before dagian yes grandmother dearest child these are your cousins erwina and feam i know you shall have good times together the three little girls looked at one another and finally erwina spoke i have a pony she said with the importance of the eldest i have a kitten little fearn piped then the two sisters looked to their cousin i am a princess mavia said settling the matter the sisters blue eyes grew round with wonder you are erwina said a real princess of course mavia replied there are no other kind take me to see your pony cousin my papa will give me a pony too and we shall ride together marcus chuckled indulgently but zenobia was mortified she must not do that and you must not encourage her marcus palmyra is gone and mavia is just a child eada laughed and tucked her arm companionably through her new sisterinlaws she is clinging to the past because this is all so strange and new to her it cannot have been easy for her either she will soon forget she was once a princess and she will be running barefoot in the fields with her cousins come now and meet my two youngest a sturdy applecheeked nursemaid came forward holding by the hands two towheaded little boys with mischievous and twinkling darkblue eyes these two scamps are gal who has managed to reach five and his baby brother tamtun who is now three dagian bent to kiss the littlest boys but tears flooded zenobias eyes as she remembered her sons now lost to her marcus put his arms about her and she wept softly into his chest as he soothed her gently we will have our own sons he said i am past thirty she sobbed oh why did i not wed with you years ago because you were stubborn and proud and queen of palmyra beloved you had so much responsibility my darling you could face nothing more and how were we to know that it would end this way how old are you zenobia eada asked and when zenobia told her eada laughed tamtun was born when i was only a year younger than you are now and i suspect that i am breeding again with another child it is not as if you have never had a child come on now she said briskly and i will take you to your room the interior of the house was like nothing zenobia had ever seen they entered into a vast hall with three fireplaces the floors of stone on either side of the main fireplace were corridors leading to a bath on one side and the kitchen wing on the other off the entry of the house which was located before the main hall were staircases leading up to the sleeping quarters zenobia and marcus were led to a large airy comfortable room which was to be theirs during their stay with aulus and his wife mavia was somewhere with her cousins probably already running barefooted thought her mother in the days to come zenobia began to learn a way of life that was quite different from the life she had led as the queen of palmyra nor was it like that of the proper roman wife whom marcus liked to tease her about if it resembled anything it was somewhat similar to her childhood within her fathers tribe aulus and his family were very close and that closeness extended to the members of the salinae dobunni tribe of whom he was chieftain he looked after those who could not look after themselves settled their arguments approved marriages between families kept the peace and administered the law it was not always easy although aulus was a popular leader his loyalty was clearly to britain for he had long ago cut his ties to rome britain however was a large land peopled by many tribes some more civilized than others and it was necessary to be constantly vigilant zenobia still felt pursued she could not escape the feeling that the roman authorities were not about to let an important imperial captive simply walk away as much as she enjoyed being with auluss family she was anxious to gain the safety of their island for instinct told her that she would have no peace until they were there one afternoon she and marcus rode out across the vast estate owned by aulus stopping to dismount upon a little hill about them spikes of purple lavender scented the air they sat upon the ground the sun warming their backs and looked out over the valley below the river winding its way across the green landscape when will we go to the island she asked him soon beloved i want to go on ahead of you and see what must be done to make it habitable you have paid your brother for it he did not want the gold but i made him take it i could not feel the island was really mine if i did not buy it i wanted no charity from aulus the rivalry is still there isnt it yes and so it shall always be i cannot forget it and neither can aulus we are better friends when we each have our own territory i shall be glad when we have our own home at last she answered him eada is kind but it is her house and the walls are thinner than i would wish last night when you slept i could hear grafere and leofel with a servant girl in the room next door to ours one of them and i am not sure which grunted like a boar in rut when atop the girl so that is why you have been so reluctant and so restrained he chuckled if i could hear them marcus then surely they could hear us there is no one to hear us now he said slowly and then he ran a finger down her arm here and now he said softly and then he reached up took down her dark hair and began to undo the braids i far prefer your beautiful hair loose and flowing as you have worn it in the past his fingers threaded themselves through the waves undoing them spreading the hair like a dark silken mantle over her shoulders she felt a surge of joyous pleasure at his sensuous action and rising to her feet she loosened the girdle at the waist of her tunic dress and drew the gown and its undergarment off letting them fall into the sweetsmelling grass she stood tall and proud her beautiful golden body with its softly blowing black hair swirling about her the air caressed her body and it felt good when and where you are gaius i then and there am gaia she said repeating her wedding vow to him marcus looked up at his golden wife outlined against the blue sky and said oh zenobia how very much i love you then he stood quickly disrobed and pulled her into his strong arms her hands caressed his back gently as he drew her against him they stood bodies pressed tightly against one another for several long moments and then he lowered his head to kiss her it was a deep kiss a passionate kiss a kiss that demanded and gave no quarter his mouth bruised hers but she kissed him back fiercely her heart soaring wildly as the passion of his lips and the warmth of his hard body communicated to her their intense need of each other her hands ran down his long smooth back to cup his buttocks to fondle them to feel the hard muscles within them he groaned shifting against her murmuring lovers thoughts against her lips beloved my beautiful beloved the gods how i want you how i long to possess youand be possessed by you her hands slid back up his frame to tangle themselves within his chestnut hair she held his head with her hands and pressed feathery kisses across his face i love you she said i think i always have from the moment that we met in the desert outside of palmyra then her mouth found his again and they kissed once more hungrily eagerly greedily like bumblebees seeking the sweetest nectar from a rose they drank of each others mouths his big hands sat firmly upon her hips and now he began to draw her down to the sweet grass the earth was warm beneath her back as she drew his head to her glorious breasts love me my marcus she said low love me as you have always loved me and then she lay quiet her head thrown back he leaned over her tenderly looking deep into her silvery eyes as they mirrored back his love of her and then he kissed her gently fleetingly upon the lips before moving slowly from the corner of her mouth to the soft hollow beneath her ear just above her jaw he lingered there for a few moments enjoying the sweet perfume of her fragrance and the tiny pulse that leapt beneath his lips moving lower he slipped along the side of her neck and down to her rounded shoulder which seemed to him to be begging to be nibbled gently he nipped the firm flesh before returning to her throat which beckoned him onward to the deep valley between her breasts one of his arms cradled her with tenderness while his other hand moved to caress her breasts trembling at the silky fineness of her skin he had touched her this way a thousand thousand times and yet it was as if this were the first his touch brought a little cry of pleasure which excited him greatly swiftly bending he captured a trembling nipple and sucked deeply upon it while his hand kneaded her breast for several long and wonderful minutes he gave all his attention to her one breast and then he moved on to the other lest it feel neglected zenobia now began to writhe slowly beneath her husbands expert lovemaking her excitement rising fast now finally he laid his head upon her belly and his fingers began a delicate teasing of her venus mount stroking probing tenderly between the plumpness of her nether lips finding the sweet hidden bud of her womanhood taunting it with a clever finger bringing his dark head down to taste of her honeyed sweetness coaxing the bud into blossom she shuddered forcefully and he swung a leg over her mounting her gently she reached out to caress his manhood her long fingers brushing him exciting him with her very touch softly she cupped the pouch of his sex in her hands her warmth communicating itself to him as she lightly fondled him then she guided him into her waiting body sighing as he buried his lance to the very hilt she wrapped her legs around him allowing him to go farther rejoicing in his skill as he began to find the rhythm for a moment her eyes focused upon the blue sky above her and then zenobia began to soar with the glorious pleasures he was unleashing throughout her body she became one with the sky floating free above the troubled earth she became one with him and they were invincible her cry startled the horses who snorted and danced about the tree to which they were tethered her nails raked down his back making thin bloody weals in the flesh and he reveled in the sharpness groaning his delight as his seed overflowed her parched and throbbing womb her hot sheath clutched at him drawing the last drop from him and then he fell exhausted upon her chest their wild hearts matching beat for beat they both lay semiconscious for some minutes and then he rolled off her and pulled her into his arms in a bear hug if i had died then beloved it would have been a glorious death i thought i had died she murmured back they lay a few minutes longer the warm sun and the breeze lightly brushing their skin and then he said we will have to go back zenobia although i should far prefer to remain in this outdoor bedchamber of ours it is the first time i have felt relaxed since we arrived in britain she answered him please marcus do not leave me when you go to our island i should prefer to live roughly than to be without you i dont want to leave you beloved but how can i take you when i do not know what i am going to find then go tomorrow go tomorrow and return quickly to me for i cannot even bear the thought of being separated from you they rose from their bed of sweet grass amid the lavender spikes and quickly redressed together they rode back toward the villa of aulus alexander they were almost there when a dobunni tribesman stepped from behind a tree along the path marcus alexander britainus he called do not go back to the villa the romans are there and they seek you and your wife you are to come with me to a place of safety mavia zenobias face paled i cannot leave her the little one will be safe the tribesman replied but zenobia was adamant i must get my child she said i will not leave her marcus reached out and put a steadying hand on his wife who are these romans he asked the tribesman are they from rome or are they from corinium corinium came the prompt reply listen to me zenobia i think you can get safely into the villa to mavia if the soldiers leave then we will leave almost as quickly if they stay then we will have to get you both out of the villa but i know that you will not rest easy without mavia and i can trust the woman who led palmyras legions not to get caught she nodded dismounted her horse and began to walk toward the village she turned once blowing him a kiss then continued on her way what if they catch her asked the tribesman they wont using a garden gate zenobia slipped into the grounds and entered the house are you mad auluss voice hissed in her ear are there any among them who know me she demanded of him no but you risk everything by coming back did you think i would leave my child zenobias voice was fierce who is this aulus alexander britainus you said that all of your household were present the speaker was a plump young man obviously new to britain i do apologize centurion but i had forgotten this serving wench she is but newly acquired i bought her at the last captives market aulus cuffed zenobia about the head and where have you been this time dog not at your duties ill wager the centurion was less interested now but still sought answers where is she from she does not look british she is from ierne the island nation to the west of britain she was brought back from a raid aulus answered i think she is a bit simpleminded for she has a tendency to wander go to your mistress wench and dont let me catch you out again probably in the stables humping the men he grumbled and the centurion laughed his interest in zenobia completely gone shes a bit too long in the tooth for me he said i like em young around eleven or twelve zenobia hurried to stand beside dagian her head lowered in a servile attitude what has happened she whispered they arrived about an hour ago dagian whispered back wait and i will tell you the family was finally dismissed and permitted to go about its business zenobia hurried upstairs with dagian and almost at once the older woman began to speak they came without warning it seems a trireme returning from massilia reported seeing sea nymph docked there and it was quickly ascertained that you had fled to britain although they did send to cyprus and capri both in case you were being clever with them finding sea nymph at portus adurni confirmed the triremes sighting the ship was seized dagian caught her breath why did you come back where is marcus i could not leave mavia and he is with the dobunni i am safe they have no idea what zenobia the queen of palmyra looks like are they going to stay i am not certain but i do know that this centurion is not very bright all he knows is that he is looking for marcus and you he has no idea that i just arrived here several weeks ago they are not staying eada came through the door and into dagians room oh zenobia how you frightened me when i saw you come into the room my heart went into my mouth why did you not stay away you might have been caught i was in no danger of being caught zenobia soothed her sisterinlaw i could not leave my child to seek safety mavia is our most precious possession they are coming back eada said they feel sure that you are in this area although aulus has denied seeing you they are returning to corinium for more soldiers and then they are coming back to search the whole area around salinae how long will that give us zenobia asked eada they cannot return to corinium until tomorrow and it will take them all day to get back then they must come back with more soldiers i think you will probably have three days a mischievous smile lit zenobias face we shall leave before them she said and since we will be riding we shall be through the town of corinium before them while they are retracing their steps to seek us we shall be going in the opposite direction eada began to laugh softly what a marvelous strategist you are sister is it true that in your own land you were a great general i led my armies zenobia admitted modestly marcus says she was indeed a great general dagian said i well believe it eada replied and then she asked zenobia anxiously you will forgive aulus for cuffing you wont you now zenobia laughed i think my brother has missed his calling she said he would make a marvelous actor humping the men in the stables indeed there was really no need for aulus to be quite so crude dagian chided no no zenobia defended aulus it was that marvelous touch that convinced the centurion that i was naught but a blowsy and stupid slave woman it was quite clever of him that night aulus was forced to offer the hospitality of his table to the centurion and to the legionnaires in his courtyard zenobia and mavia kept to their bedroom safe and out of sight mavia was nervous as she had not been since palmyra and at one point she began to cry zenobia soothed her child making a game out of what they would do later we are going to sneak out of uncle auluss villa just the way mama snuck out of palmyra to seek help from the persians zenobia said but the romans caught you mavia wailed only because papa wasnt with us mavia her mother said where is papa the child demanded with the dobunni they will help us to reach our island the romans will not catch us mavia sniffed we will not have to live with the emperor again no my darling the romans will not catch us and we will never again see the emperor i promise you mavia and zenobia hugged her small daughter tightly always on the run always fleeing bab muttered as she packed their things i hope that eventually before i die we will be given some measure of peace again adria bowed her head smiling at the old womans grumbling they all knew that bab now in her late seventies thrived on the excitement that seemed constantly to surround her mistress be patient with me old woman zenobia said surely this must be the last time i am forced to flee once we have gained the safety of our island home then they will never find me again i certainly hope so if your dear mother were alive it would have broken her heart to see how those romans have hounded you the clothing and personal effects necessary for a journey were packed carefully by adria in a small trunk everything else was packed by bab in the trunks for shipping later the centurion had been plied with excellent wine and now with the aid of a light sleeping draught slipped into his last cup he lay snoring noisily in a guest chamber he did not hear the family as mey slipped one by one into zenobias chamber to bid her farewell erwina and fearn brought their cousin mavia a small gray and white kitten as a farewell gift she is called blossom because she loves to smell the flowers lisped fearn mavia hugging blossom to her chest thanked her cousins and promised to visit again one day you must travel quickly now eada said but when we can send your things along safely i will include many rootings and cuttings from my gardens for you her blue eyes filled with tears i wish you werent going zenobia i shall miss you i have never had a sister zenobia said slowly i am fortunate that you are now mine how can i ever thank you for your hospitality if i were still a queen in my own land but i am not i have nothing i can give you except my love eada the two women embraced warmly and then with a teary look at zenobia eada left her she will never forget you dagian said she is a simple chiefs daughter who has never in her entire life been farther than corinium you have brought the world into her life she brought kindness into mine zenobia returned she opened her home and her heart to us i can never forget that dagian for it went beyond the bounds of hospitality she looked searchingly at her motherinlaw are you sure that you want to remain here once we have settled ourselves you are most welcome to come to us both marcus and i love you and mavia is going to be lost without you no my child i shall be content here at least come for the winters eada tells me that the winters here can be harsh and upon the island it will be mild perhaps for the winters dagian said and then she enfolded zenobia in a loving embrace be happy dearest daughter for you have made my son happy i could love you for that alone we shall meet again then she kissed zenobia tenderly and hurried from the room aulus came to get them youll be leaving through the garden gate and theres little likelihood of your encountering the romans therell be a dobunni to guide you to marcus and then youre safely on your way thank you a thousand times aulus without you i dont know what we would have done the romans came so quickly i thought we had more time you survived without me aulus muttered embarrassed for he was a simple man she kissed his rough cheek and then before he might protest said let us go brother bab chairman adria mavia come along old severus was to go with them also and he was waiting in the garden by the street gate for them dressed in dark cloaks to camouflage themselves the six set off through the gate and down the street at the corner they were joined by a barely distinguishable tribesman who stepped from the darkness to lead them silently they followed him their eyes upon his dark shape as they traveled through the village and out into the open fields a fine moon had now risen to silver the landscape and show them the way finally they entered a small wood where in a clearing marcus awaited them thankfully he embraced his wife and daughter praise the gods you are safe they never saw mavia and aulus told them i was a captive slave from ierne it was simple my darling tell me now how we get to where we are going we will travel to glevum and be through it by morning but we shall be able to bypass corinium entirely for they have built a new road in the last five years between glevum and aquae sulis then we do not have to worry about a large roman garrison she was relieved he continued from aquae sulis we go to lindinis and finally the last really important roman settlement in britain isca dumnonionim aulus has sent a message to the high chieftain of me dumnonii they will take us the rest of the way to the coast where a ship awaits us from here to there we travel in safety under the protection of the warriors of the dobunni he smiled down at her you are safe beloved you are safe now and forever and looking up into his moonlit eyes zenobia the queen of palmyra knew that he spoke the truth then lead on my husband she said quietly and take me home epilogue the island sat like a small green jewel in the bright blue sea the mainland had suffered a bitter winter but here the flowers had already bloomed and the air was mild and gentle when they arrived there had been no habitable building upon the island only the bleak and crude ruins of some past civilization but there was a fine harbor and several freshwater springs and ponds there were wild goats and small game and a host of birds marcus had given aulus a goodly supply of gold in order that his brother might barter and negotiate for him with the tribes for marcus did not think himself capable in this instance whatever aulus had done he had done right for the very day they landed upon the island another ship this one bearing men and supplies arrived at once the building of a house had begun using the sand from a local beach the builders began to mix concrete and within days a large twostory house with walls fifteen inches thick had risen on the cliffs above the harbor the inner facing of the house was of stone the outer facing of fine white limestone that gave the building a smooth hard white finish the roof tiles were red the house had been designed very much like auluss home with an entry that had staircases on either side and beyond a large hall there were wings on each side of the main fireplace one containing the baths the other the kitchens and servants quarters the second story of the house contained six large bedchambers all looking out upon the sea between the wings of the house was a lovely sheltered garden where the family would sit in the evening and on warmer winter days beyond the garden wall stretched a long building whose lower story housed the farm animals they had imported to the island and whose upper story housed the farm slaves the entire area was enclosed by a wall although marcus did not expect to have to repel invaders slaves had been imported to the island strong men for the farm and young women for the house and the gardens some of the slaves had had children and marcus had purchased them also for mavia was apt to be lonely without friends her age in rome old senator tacitus was already gone having caught a chill in the fourth month of his reign he had been replaced by his much younger brother who was head of the praetorian the younger tacitus had in his turn succumbed to poison and now less than eighteen months after aurelians assassination a third emperor sat upon the shaky imperial throne the new emperor was marcus aurelius probus the son of one dalmatius a country gardener by profession he was a distinguished military leader who had served under both valerian and aurelian how long he would last was of course a moot point zenobia thought as she nursed her infant son on a late summers afternoon at least roman interest in them seemed to be dying down although aulus had written that twice the romans had returned seeking them the last time in a midnight raid that had frightened everyone half to death dagian had come to the island to be with zenobia for the birth bringing with her an old herbal woman of the dobunni the birth had been incredibly easy but the herbal woman had advised zenobia against having future children you are no longer a girl and your life has taken its toll upon your health i can help you to regain your health but another child will kill you but eada is older than i and she continues to have her babies and thrive zenobia protested the lady eada is of this land and she has never stopped having children in all her married life how many years are between your daughter and the son you have just borne too many do not fear lady this boy will thrive and go on to father you many grandsons i shall give you something to use so you will not conceive again yet your husbands pleasure will not be spoiled listen to her dagian said seeing the unhappy look in zenobias eyes she has never been wrong zenobia had finally agreed although reluctantly for she had hoped to give her husband several sons despite the fact that she was in her late thirties now still marcus had not been disappointed that they would have no more children rather he had been delighted that she had given him another child at all they had named the boy lucius for his grandfather now the child was six months old and his mother was beginning to be as restless as his father was they had been on the island well over a year now and zenobia was well rested she was no longer fearful of capture she was bored she loved her children but she had been born to rule and now that she had no kingdom she found herself at loose ends wandering about the house one afternoon she discovered marcus in his library hovering over some maps drawn to join him she saw that the map was marked ierne isnt that the island kingdom to the west of britain she asked yes are there romans there no not to my knowledge what is there i do not know beloved he looked up and she could see in his eyes the same longing he could see in hers when do we go she asked we you do not believe that i shall stay here like a good roman wife while you go exploring what of the children its a marvelous excuse for us to keep your mother with us as for lucius my milk is not plentiful there is however among the slave women one who has just had a still birth and her milk is let me give her lucius to nurse she caught his hands in hers we were separated for too long marcus for me to let you go from me now yet i cannot deny you the opportunity i am restless and bored too our island may be a safe haven but there is little for me to do it could be dangerous beloved oh i hope so her face was alight with the anticipation of a child who looks forward to some special treat you will never be a roman wife he said with mock despair but his blue eyes shone with his love for her a love that would live on forever no marcus i shall never be a roman wife though i live to be as old a woman as bab her silvery eyes laughed up at him sympathizing with him loving him back then he said slowly there is nothing for it but we go exploring and perhaps we shall find another kingdom for you to rule over beloved no she replied i have ruled palmyra the greatest city in the east perhaps on this earth there will be no other earthly kingdoms for me i shall be happy to be with you to rule within the kingdom of your heart his hands rested lightly upon her shoulders and looking down at her he said again the words that had first won her to him i have loved you from the beginnings of time and i shall love you long after our memories have faded from this earth zenobias heart swelled within her chest it swelled until she thought it might break with the happiness she felt permeating her entire being as marcus lowered his head to capture her lips in a tender yet passionate kiss her last rational thought before she gave herself up to him was that no matter what happened now she was whole in body and spirit once again the world lay before them a wonderful new adventure was just over the horizon it would be all right now for she had marcus alexander britainus for all eternity she was still the beloved of the gods though in the end they would have the last word it is enough zenobia thought it is more than enough bertrice small bertrice small lives on the north fork of the eastern end of long island where she writes her novels in a lightfilled studio surrounded by her cover paintings and the many momentos of the romance genre she has collected married for thirtythree years to her husband george she is the mother of thomas a radio sportscaster and writer motherinlaw of megan and grandmother of chandler david small longtime readers will be happy to know that nicky the charming cockatiel chequers the fat blackandwhite cat with the pink ears now almost fourteen and sebastian the tiny twoyearold griegeandwhite cat remain her dearest companions many will be saddened to learn of the passing of deuteronomy her beloved longhaired maine coon cat at the age of twenty who will be sorely missed and of gilberto the cranky halfmoon conure age unknown who has gone to that great aviary in the sky
