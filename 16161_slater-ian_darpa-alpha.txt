ian slater darpa alpha chapter one early fall dusk sure beats binoculars the sergeant opined softly one hand deftly slipping another stick of odorless gum into his mouth the other holding a fourinchsquare monitor clear as crystal lieutenant sammy ramon nodded as he too watched the monitor his sergeant was holding the live video feed of the lakes research facility a quarter of a mile below was coming in from the twelveman teams tiny eightinch mav recon plane the micro air vehicle developed by darpa the us defense departments advanced research and projects agency was made up of collapsible transparent wings and tail and equipped with a viccol video camera and laser range finder to get a closer look at the monitor the lieutenant using his left hand to remove his fritz kevlar helmet his right to slide his m forward to his side momentarily wiped the beaded perspiration from his drab olivegreen face paint the latter indistinguishable from the camouflage paint of his collapsible paratrooper mountain bike nearby for security reasons the other eleven men in the lieutenants commando squad hadnt been given the precise incountry coordinates of the enemy naval base below yet each man looking down from his hide toward the lake knew the exact layout of the base everything from the small data hut on the lakes sandy shoreline to the bigger and more vital research barge offshore though the mav couldnt be detected by enemy radar because of its stealthfiber sharpedged construction affording it an extraordinarily small radar signature it nevertheless gave the lieutenant a start when for a second it passed as a black dot across the lemon wafer of the moon that was already visible in the dusk but any fright the momentary silhouette might have given him was ameliorated by the fact that apart from the lone civilian security guard which the mavs infrared vision had detected there seemed to be no other visible defenses once again the lieutenant had occasion to remind himself of what a fellow soldier retired us army general douglas freeman had once said on a cnn interview after that base security indeed security anywhere is more often a state of mind than a reality more an assumption than a fact as the tiny plane circled the enemy base again ramon switched to watching the target through his own videomounted m which gave him a headon view of it a lone barge in the fading light the ninetyfootlong thirtyfootwide research barge hadnt changed location remaining anchored more than a hundred yards offshore from the bungalowsized hut onshore intel had told the lieutenant that while this bungalow would have to be neutralized it was the barge that contained the data they were after and which would therefore be the commando teams primary target neither the lieutenant nor any of the eleven men under his command had been told what the data were specifically only that they would be on a disk and how the disk would be labeled but they had been told that this data was so vital it could irrevocably tip the balance of power in favor of the united states not only in its ongoing war against terror but also in the face of chinas massive buildup of hightech weaponry following the chinese leaders jawdropping surprise at witnessing americas delivery of shock and awe in the two gulf wars lieutenant ramons first job was to get his team into the enemy base before he could neutralize the main hut onshore and loot the barge computers hard drive as well as the disk which scientists back home could use to reverseengineer the weapon intel had told ramon the data had originally been spawned by a russian prototype of the revolutionary technology ramon had told his assault team that they were to approach the naval base with as casual an air as possible just another case of a friendly visit from us troops coming back from maneuvers during the day and not to give a damn about the security cameras around the research stations perimeter ramon would give a friendly howdydo to the security guard who was looking bored out of his mind from walking up and down along the quartermile chainlink storm fence that enclosed the shore hut and the fiftyfootlong jetty where a small rigid inflatable boat obviously used for transport to and from the barge was bobbing up and down in a small chop each of the twelve commandos extracted his collapsible khaki darpadesigned paratrooper mountain bike from its canvas shoulder bag mounted up and pedaled off some were soon freewheeling and braking but quietly as they headed down the blacktop road toward the fences gate sammy ramon spoke to each man personally as he had before the mission warning them that if he heard so much as a squeak or squeal coming from these special postafghanistandesigned bikes hed see to it that the man responsible would be put on a charge absolutely nothing hed intoned is to go wrong pushing for perfection the lieutenant had had them endlessly practicing extraction snap assembly and disassembly to qualify each of the eleven commandos had to be equally proficient in handling his molle as the darpadesigned stateoftheart modular lightweight loadcarrying equipment pack was known and which was equipped with an ergonomically designed plastic frame capable of hauling a central rucksack plus eighteen additional pouches of darpadesigned goodies including everything from extra ammunition for the videomounted reddotaiming ms to their gpsupdated inertial navigation system and darpadesigned mav every man had to extract his bike from his shoulder pack and assemble its two folding halves in less than thirty seconds his molle in under five minutes using bikes instead of noisy humvees ramon had explained to his team would enhance their just passing by explanation to the security guard after all what could be more natural than a group of the us tenth mountain divisions bicycle unit out practicing with their bikes and just waving hi to the locals in the spirit of mutual cooperation ramon and his team knew that what they were about to do if all went well was strictly against all international law but in the war between america and terrorists rules were frequently thrown out the window the enemy intel had assured him wouldnt be expecting an attack but sammy ramons hard experience told him that humint human intelligence and sigint signal intelligence could be dead wrong look at tony blair and george bushs search for wmds intel had also told ramon that thered been reports of long coppermesh curtains having been erected inside the onshore datareceiving hut and on board the offshore barge this being done intel reports had said in order to block any extraneous radio signals that might scramble any of the critical electronic communication traffic between the hut and offshore barge while they were calibrating their equipment all he needed the lieutenant told his sergeant was for the guard a dark swarthy man with a submachine gun slung about his shoulder to stand still for a couple of seconds you got the envelope asked the sergeant the lieutenant patted his battle dress shirt pocket im set as dusk faded day easing into night and the breeze that carried the faint smell of algae from the lake became cooler ramon watched the moons pale light sharply silhouetting the onshore hut and the offshore barge now they were ten yards from the chainlink gate and the big sign that warned in six languages keep out this is it ramon said softly to his sergeant as he stopped his column of eleven men who as theyd rehearsed it were doing their damnedest to look tired and disinterested their expressions suggesting they wanted to get back to their camp rather than waste time while the lieutenant started yakking with the locals how you doin ramon asked the guard through the chainlink fence the man with bushy black eyebrows and deepset brown eyes was wearing a cheap civilianmade securityfirm uniform festooned with shoulder patches and crimson epaulettes no doubt meant to intimidate the locals he looked grumpy and immediately suspicious but ramon took no notice as if he hadnt seen the mans unwelcoming frown hi im lieutenant ramon were here to see your director ramon took a letter from his pocket and held it up close to his eyes inclining the paper in the moonlight a doctor ramons forehead creased in concentration as if he were trying to read a name on the envelope all he needed was a moment or two of confusion the security guard to cease pacing up and down inside the chainlink fence but the guard much shorter than ramon had first guessed kept moving right to left behind the wire taking no notice of the proffered letter of authorization looking instead beyond ramon and the sergeant at the eleven other men he put up his hand signaling stop and began walking away from the fence toward the shoreline hut at which point ramon heart in his mouth called out hey standard procedure man check my id first the man paused looked back and saw that ramon was holding a striped id card against the fence a fence which ramon knew was normally linked to motion sensors but the latter intel had told him had been disengaged because of so many false alerts set off by roaming dogs sometimes the alarms were tripped by falcons which occasionally mistook the ground sensors for rodents the guard walked back to the fence and taking out his flashlight peered at the striped id card ramons sergeant held up his id card as well the guard glanced from one to the other and it was obvious to the lieutenant that the guard didnt recognize either but that his pride was demanding he examine the id cards as if he knew what he was doing ramon hoped intel was right about the copper shielding thwarting any communication with the barge or hut the guard came closer to the fence and stood still examining the cards the sergeant shot him pointblank through a diamondshaped space in the chainlink fence the spit of the heckler koch mm sidearm barely making a sound the guard fell backward thudding to the ground in seconds the tiredlooking soldiers standing around with their mountain bikes were galvanized into action within another five seconds ramon kneeling by the chainlink fence combat gloves on extracted what looked like the leg of a small cameras tripod from his molle it was a oneinchdiameter telescoping extension claw rod with three retractable fishhook talons on it that could be used in this case to hook the dead guards clothing and drag him closer to the fence there ramon pulled out his keys the stench of the dead guards involuntarily defecation heavy in the air the twelve were through the gate each of the six twoman teams knowing precisely where to go and what to do and that they had less than ten minutes before local police could be expected to be alerted and arrive with noise suppressors on their ms heckler koch submachine guns and sidearms there should be little noise and intel had told them that there should be relatively few people four science graduate students in the onshore hut six scientists on the offshore barge the four students in the shore hut all male took no notice of the door opening probably expecting visitors from the barge all four were shot quickly silently at pointblank range by two of ramons sidearm specialists ramons job with his sergeant and four others was to make straight for the rigid inflatable its presence confirmed by the mav tied up on the far side of the fiftyfootlong jetty ramon his sergeant and the fourman backup team ran toward the wharf ramon praying that every one of the six scientists would be inside the barge a hope stoked by the fact that even though it had been a relatively hot day the temperature had plummeted as soon as the sun had died and working conditions now were much more pleasant but what if one of the scientists were to stroll out for a minute for a cigarette or to relieve himself intel had told him there were no facilities on the barge other than an unhandy portable chemical toilet this meant there was a risk of somebody suddenly wanting to run ashore in the rigid inflatable which would screw up everybodys timing ramons squad had reached the jetty and were in the inflatable in seconds their training the seemingly endless repetition paying off in a few seconds the rib emitting a whiff of diesel was away from the wharf its outboard initially sounding to the lieutenant like the rip of a light machine gun but only because apart from the deep throb of a compressor there was no other noise on the shoreline in fact the outboard engine was remarkably quiet purring along after the initial burp it was too good too smooth to last thought ramon something must be about to happen murphys law the rib had just nudged into one of the rubber tires that served as a bump rail girding the barge when a door opened a skewed rectangle of light flooded out onto the black deck silhouetting ramon his sergeant and the four other men in the rib sharply against the moonlit lake the scientist let out a cry ramon and the sergeant fired and the man pitched forward crashing against a spool of cable on the black gritgrip deck moving quickly through the acrid smell of cordite into the barges housing they burst in to find five startled scientists two men in stained white lab coats were bending over a map of the lake while a woman in a spotless lab coat sat at the mainframe a second woman extraordinarily thin was busy reloading the printer while a man in his fifties in stainblotched white coveralls his balding head and eyeglasses catching the light from the swivelmounted monitor screen above his computer terminal looked at them in astonishment who za hell are you demanded the bald man imperiously ramon slammed his gloved fist into the mans face sending the scientist reeling back past the screaming woman the scientist crashing into a door three feet behind him and falling down amid a pile of stacked printer paper the flowinflight file demanded ramon as the older man now lying in shock and bleeding from his teeth gasped looking down at his bloodstained hand and at his four companions for help the four were frozen in fear the flowinflight file ramon repeated only more forcefully this time i want it on screennow he brought his heckler koch mp submachine gun level with the woman darkhaired and probably in her midtwenties bring it up ramon told her she shook her head a definite no ramon shot her the man bleeding on the floor yelling nein nein the other three scientists in their late twenties or early thirties were aghast faces turning waxen in fright bring it up ramon said once again you started this war well finish it the two male scientists to the left of the computer and the woman behind them looked at one another in shock as if they didnt understand there was a moment of indecision the sergeant glanced anxiously at his watch five minutes left before local police could be expected to arrive if any of the staff on the barge or in the onshore data hut had had time to punch an alarm intel hadnt known about ramon fired again this time at one of the men leaning against the mainframe it was a head shot ramon not wanting to damage the computer the scientist slid down his face a stare of utter astonishment he was bleeding profusely from the back of the head his two companions huddling together now against the mainframe as if it might give them protection bring it up or youre a dead man ramon told the next man in line the man tried to speak but couldnt mouth and tongue dry as parchment he keyed in what ramon hoped would bring up the file a millisecond later and there it was the flowinflight data the latest test results you have a backup disk ramon said it was a statement more than a question the terrified scientist nodded vigorously put it in the computer and show me ordered ramon the scientist did as he was told ramon watching closely over his shoulder and there on the screen appeared the same flowinflight data put it on the table ramon ordered the scientist complied copies shouted ramon the man shook his head and found his voice no i swear no copies ramon shot him dead and turned to the remaining two copies the man whom the lieutenant had knocked down and the remaining woman shook their heads no no the woman cried i swear to god grab the disk ramon ordered his sergeant and then in two bursts from his heckler koch shot the man and the woman ramons sergeant picked up the disk waving it triumphantly to the lieutenant we have it ramon allah is great destroy the hard drive ramon told him and get out of the us uniforms civilian dress remember no arabic english only till were home yes sir chapter two monterey in monterey it was still dark and in a modest bungalows bedroom the phone rang eight times before retired general douglas freeman finally relented half sitting up careful not to disturb his wife margaret he glanced at his watch it was am what the hell he knew it had to be something wrong with his son dan who was posted in the middle east for anyone to be calling at this ungodly hour the crump of high surf pounding the beach sounded to him like distant artillery a creeping barrage he fumbled sleepily for the phone hello he growled his voice gravelly and nasal in his sudden awakening hello general freeman yes who is this aussie lewis came the jovial voice in the background was the sound of either a special forces team checking weapons or metal crates banging together aussie whats wrong we clear fore and aft mate came aussies voice his australian twang still distinctive though hed been a us special forces commando and a naturalized american for fifteen years yes said the general clear fore and aft what is it pressed the general freeman was one of americas legendary commanders but right now all he was was a rather grumpy impatient retiree who needed his sleep well said aussie lewis theres this old sailor who decides to have a last fling so he goes down to the waterfront and picks up this lady of the evening well theyre goin at it and he says howm i doin and she says youre doin about three knots what dyou mean three knots he asks her and she says well youre not hard youre not in and youre not gettin your money back this was followed by raucous laughter from what sounded like a football team the metallic sound the general had heard earlier he decided must have been the rattle of beer cans son of a bitch said general douglas freeman you rang to tell me a joke an old joke at that at oh shite came aussies response i thought it was hours you must be on the east coast said freeman and pissed as usual yes and no general answered aussie a few of the old team got together for an ad hoc reunion were seeing the sights in washington dc saw the world war ii monument yesterday see where all our friggin taxes go the monuments aokay though we all like it bout time all those people had something to honor them anyway i thought id give you a bell see how you were you being retired and all thought you could do with a bit of a laugh freeman smiled relaxed and sat back against the beds headboard margaret stirring sleepily beside him well thanks aussie and youre right ever since the yuppies in the pentagon requested i take retirement because of my well what they said was your penchant answered aussie for politically incorrect statements you called those congressmen on the appropriations committee lets see what was it oh yeah a bunch of broadbanging bureaucrats dont think you can say broad anymore continued aussie sexist hmmm i suppose the general conceded ruefully never mind that it was the truth that bunch on the appropriations committee shouldve voted more money for darpa thats what the teams been talking about here wheres herea dive of course not general were on top of the roof at the willard hotel breakfast we can see the white house from here hope they cant see you guys whos there in the white house the president i guess no you dork whos with you at the willard ah lessee salvini alias the brooklyn dodger choir williams the bloody welsh tenor hes singing god help us and yours truly couldnt get eddie mervyn or gomez out here after that korean stint we did they went home to mommy they live on the west coast i know said freeman he knew exactly where every member of his old team was located and how he could reach them quickly if needed including medal of honor winner david brentwood who was laid up at the moment with a flareup of an old shoulder wound oh added aussie im getting crap for not mentioning johnny lee our multilingual expert hes here too pissed out of his mind that darpa outfit you were talking about what about it said the general you know said aussie this b and e at the naval facility break and enter said the general sitting up higher against the headboard his face clouding over he prided himself on being current particularly in this long hard war against terror which as bush had told the air force academy in colorado springs would be the work of decadeshow history was once more witnessing a great clash like that of the cold war only this war on terror was a damn sight hotter and it was for that reason that the general had vociferously argued for more money to be allocated for darpas black box stuff darpa needed all the funding it could get even if it meant hiding it so deep within the gaos the general accounting offices records that to locate it would be like trying to find the proverbial needle in a bureaucratic haystack the general was very uptodate visàvis darpa but he hadnt heard anything about a b and e against any darpa installation what happened he asked aussie no details really said aussie on the idiot box breaking news oh guess it must have been about an hour ago oh four hundred your time i didnt see anything said the general i was watching a late movie what channel cnn huh said freeman those people know more than the cia half the time tell me about it answered aussie having to raise his voice against the sound of the beer cans which facility freeman pressed he could hear the usually quiet welshman choir williams singing goodbye from white horse inn the willard wouldnt put up with that for long thats what weve been tossing around over a few beers here said aussie the location of the facility your old cnn flame marte price broke into the newscast said thered been a b and e at a highly sensitive naval base out your way my way said the general adding wryly you mean somewhere between san diego and alaska yeah pretty broad isnt it responded aussie i dunno but we all got the impression it was on the west coast somewhere out there all she said was something about a naval facility out west but just hold on a mo general then freeman heard aussie asking the others she did say it was a naval facility out west right there was a chorus of boozy agreement yeah general continued aussie she said it was a highly classified naval facility that had been broken into security guard killed and pressed freeman thats it no film just the verbal report but they must have aired the story again later more details nada said aussie we were up playing a few hands of poker we wouldve heard any more news about it my guess is dhs must have come down on cnn like a ton o bricks to kill the report course at the time of the newscast most people were in bed anyway that always helps to squelch a story you werent in bed said the general well you know how it is general team likes to stay up stay current and i dont the general joshed oh no said aussie we know youre uptodate but youve probably been busy staying up with your wife cheeky bastard oh no replied aussie again with mock embarrassment oh i didnt mean anything untoward general or anything under covers if you know what i mean i do youre pissed and youre insolent call me back if you hear anything on that darpa facility where the hell it is roger that said aussie you sleep tight now the general put the phone down and shook his head who was that asked margaret opening her eyes their brilliant turquoise color always surprised her famous or perhaps more truthfully nowadays oncefamous husband ah the boys replied the general theyre tying one on margaret had to think about that phrase it wasnt one she normally heard amongst her friends at the church socials even those put on for the benefit of retired service folk who with so many other americans had suffered catastrophic losses personal and financial when the family breadwinner had been killed in the long ongoing war against terror arent you coming back to bed margaret murmured taking a sip of water from the glass on the bedside table as freeman opened the closet reaching in for his long gray robe he didnt answer her already deep in thought about the darpa burglary if thats what it had been and surfing channels on their bedroom tv as he slipped his feet into his moccasins nothing about a breakin at any military base perhaps aussie had glimpsed part of an old documentary tape freeman recalled how just the other day he had pulled a newspaper out of the magazine rack and was halfway through reading an article on yet another terrorist raid in britain before he realized the paper was a month old margaret drew the duvet over her eyes to shut out the flashes of light from the television douglas what are you doing oh sorry he stabbed the power button shutting off the tv something wasnt right aussie had said all of them saw it think ill stay up awhile he told margaret get some juice maybe have a cup of coffee he glanced at his watch which from old incountry habit he wore so that the face was under his wrist and reflections from its quartz face couldnt be easily seen by the enemy id like some company margaret persisted and something in your robe tells me that you would too margaret he said feigning shock but pleased by her sudden sauciness time for me to get up he added nearly reveille you are up she said cest magnifique id like you to come down mrs freeman he said turning and looking down at her you astound me you wouldnt have said that six months ago in french or english no she conceded pulling down the covers invitingly i wouldnt but you know how these sudden conversions can be she was right once douglas had told her how catherine his late wife and margarets sister had hoped that he and margaret would get together should catherines melanoma spread and make douglas a widower margaret had experienced a surge of excitement i suddenly felt free she told him now thats the truth of it douglas catherine set me free since then ive been i dont know i feel like a new woman you are he said understandingly she had he knew been straining to be free he was at once enormously flattered that she had so secretly loved him all those years and sorry that the tension created in her by her suppression of her love had more often than not resulted in hostility i know i only hope youre not sorry that youve ended up with this retired old fart who still cant leave the wars behind him you most certainly are not an old fart why you jog more miles in a day than most marathoners you douglas freeman are as fit as a young buck but she could see that as virile as he was his mind was elsewhere right now and sliding back under the pink eiderdown she said oh all right ill wait i know you wont settle until you check out this darpa thing you were listening in he said pretending shock i thought you were asleep i was my darling until i felt you sit straight up as if there was a spider in the bed go on she said teasingly go down to your rolodex dont you make fun of my rolodex file lady when the power fails on my laptop i have my cards hard copy margaret oh she said holding back a laugh he smiled as he drew the charcoalgray truman show robe an old gift from his actor nephew tighter about his waist against the hard slab of his abdominal muscles youre very nice he continued as im about to rediscover in that nest of yours once i find out what the he hesitated refusing to use even the most commonplace blasphemy in her presence it was a leftover from his marriage to catherine once i find out whether a darpa facilitys been penetrated penetrated stop it woman is that all you can think of right now yes get up and make me some coffee oh tush she said make it yourself freeman grinned and walked through to the kitchen via the living room past a portrait of his ancestor william douglas freeman whose american riflemans forest green and chocolate brown uniform in the painting contrasted with the bloodred and white uniforms of the british regulars a photo of his twentyyearold son dan and his girlfriend was on the lamp table along with a vase of sweetsmelling pink mojave roses a birthday gift to margaret from dan who in the generals view was finding it difficult to accept that his father had not only remarried but had married his aunt he watched cnn there was nothing about a breakin at any defense base let alone any darpa facility had aussie and the other specforces seen it on another network there were so many now he channelsurfed while margarets ancient coffeemaker gurgled and spat she saved everything he had a rule for every new thing that came into the house an squarefoot bungalow some old thing had to go out in their first real quarrel after getting married shed suggested he be put out he smiled at how theyd laughed afterward and enjoyed passionfueled sex that had left the argument in its wake on nbc there was yet another story about a series of terrorist alerts throughout the world in london a taxi bombing at heathrow airport had killed eight twentythree injured six critically and there was a threat in washington state but no reference to a west coast naval base mention of washington however reminded him that the us navy did have several highly sensitive installations up in washington state taking his coffee into the hallway the general who had been retired by a white house that hadnt appreciated his blunt public description of jihad studied his wall map of cascadia the pacific northwest made up of british columbia idaho oregon and washington state first there was the extensive sub base on the stunningly beautiful hood canal surely at the top of any terrorists list and then there was the huge naval air station on whidbey island east of the canadianus strait of juan de fuca the latter usually mispronounced by aussie in crude allusions was the egress channel for the big american trident boomers and the hunterkiller attack subs out of bangor washington then there was the huge cold war sac strategic air command bomber base at fairchild near spokane way out in eastern washington in the sagebrush country where the gargantuan bs flew over the suntwinkling sprinklers that appeared like white lace across the irrigated farms and dry couleerutted earth closer to the coast there was the armys fort lewis near tacoma it was here on this enormous base that freeman had last attended a darpa demonstration having been accidentally invited by a pentagon clerk who hadnt realized that the general was now on the hasbeen list but according to aussie it hadnt been an army barracks that had been hit but a naval base he knew there were naval civilianstaffed bases secret research stations tucked away along the coast from san diego to san francisco and there were since several other locations on the west coast with its thousands of inlets and bays these mostly consisted of cuttingedge university labs with minimum if any real security the academic community not naturally disposed to the presence of armed guards arguing with a good deal of merit that low profiles in fact afforded more real security than any official display of armed security and highprofile signage the latter best exemplified by the use of deadly force authorized sign at the entrance to the secret bangor sub base that everyone knew about freeman thought as he sipped the strong black coffee that right then he couldnt have given aussie margaret or anyone else a good rational argument for his suspicion that it was probably the darpa installation outside bangor on puget sounds hood canal or the naval testing lab near keyport thirtyfive miles west of hood canal in puget sound but he felt it in his gut he called one of his many contacts in the puget sound area and discovered that his hunch was as aussie would have said as useful as tits on a bull completely off track he did a computer news search of all the major naval establishments on the west coast nothing next he did a specific search on the net for any current media mention of naval establishments on the east coast none had been referred to by either the networks anchors or their affiliates in the last twentyfour hours and there was nothing on the main blogs of course he reminded himself these days the government citing the patriot act in this long war against terror had annoyingly if understandably shut down thousands of internet sites with hitherto available defenserelated information and links the american civil liberties union was particularly vexed by fbi and homeland security visits to any blogger who persisted in internet searches visàvis classified defense establishments in frustration douglas freeman decided to call marte price surely his occasional trysts with her after catherine died when marte was embedded with various units of his overseas ought to be worth something besides he had never been cavalier with marte never treated her as a ready lay but as a goodlooking savvy newswoman who on tough lifeendangering assignments needed the same kind of sexual release he did it had been discreet or as discreet as any liaison can be in the field it had of course been strictly against army rules and regulations but the war had slammed peacetime propriety hard up against the certainty of their own mortality he had seen her a few times since and spoken with her on the phone but now that he was remarried he knew that a call to an old flame from his own house would not be a good tactical move and the call would have to be made on a land line anyone who used a cellphone these days for anything confidential had no idea of just how pervasive the national security agency phone taps were especially since not even voice over internet protocolencrypted phone data was being respected by the nsa im going down to the eleven for the times he told margaret as she walked into the living room hed always preferred the feel of a good newspaper such as the old international herald tribune that he used to scan every day in heidelberg during his cold war posting in germany a good newspaper with a second cup of coffee was one of the great pleasures in life and something he usually enjoyed after each mornings tenmile run fantasies of coming in first in the olympic marathon in his head the crowd on its feet for his sensational lastminute dash to victory well hell georgie patton had made it to the olympics you havent been for your run she said at the very moment hed thought it he smiled at the synchronicity here was a marriage he hoped that would last ah ill run later oh this darpa thing must be important then well i dont like stories that are aired once then die especially given that this is an election year somethings fishy might be something in the papers though douglas yes while youre on the phone with her why dont you invite the old tart around for dinner id love to see the competition he stood there stunned as if a grenade had exploded nearby speechless oh said margaret her arms akimbo smile gone her tone acidic why so shocked douglas you two were very chatty last time there was a terrorist attack i assume you want to chat again margaret freeman began i didnt want you to think im already thinking it im sorry said the general honey honest to god margaret there is no subterfuge in this i just thought it more discreet she proffered angrily to contact your tart from the eleven dont call her that shes just an old tart said margaret i know i have the misfortune to see her regularly on the boob tube because my legendary general of a husband just happens to be obsessed with watching cnn and guess who is one of the anchors margaret stop it thats enough dammit i merely want to know what happened to a story that was alive and well one moment and dead the next smells fishy and i want to get to the bottom of it you know as well as i do that im still on a special forces advisory retainer for the white house the president himself wanted retirees kept on a potential callup basis were spread our forces are spread too thinly all over the world and seeing theyve put me on retainer small though it is at least theyve given me something after pushing me out and the way i keep that unofficial job with entrée to the national security adviser i might add is to stay current its like anything else if youre not current youre dead margaret was rigid glacial ice ah dammit ill call from here no go go get the papers keep current there might be a picture of her in the obituaries son of a bitch this is getting out of control all i said was im going to the eleven and boom im in a minefield margaret turned abruptly stormed out of the living room and slammed the bedroom door shit said freeman im cut off for a week he put on his jogging suit grabbed his old sf forage cap and his keys along with his phone card and id and left thinking again of rudyard kiplings poem the old imperialists advice to fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run but he knew margaret was going to need more than sixty seconds sixty hours maybe dammit he should have just called marte price from home just do it in plain sight with admiral horatio nelsons stratagem in mind never mind maneuvers go straight at em well he thought this is what you get when you try to do things by stealth but then again as a virile fit man in his sixties feeling closer to a fit forty he was hugely flattered by margarets jealousy when she got that cold look the softer features of her face taking on a distinctively intimidating expression reminiscent of julia robertss in erin brockovich she was dauntingly beautiful he strode down to the eleven no douglas marte price assured him i dont know anything about an attack on a navy base who told you there was aussie lewis you remember him hes one of my old team you interviewed him after the team cleaned up those gangs of nohopers on the olympic peninsula up in washington state oh wait a minute freeman could hear the rustle of papers at her end yes marte said there was a news feed from some affiliate something about a breaking and entering caper but it all proved bogus marte laughed embarrassing as hell really we had to run a retraction i dont think she said laughing that the stringer who phoned it in will be paid for anything he or she pitches at our newspeople now apparently it was just some rumor probably some blogger screwing with us uhhuh said the general wiping his forehead with the heel of his right hand as he held the phone in the other and my name for the record marte is shirley and ive got the biggest hooters in monterey county good for you shirley she quipped oh come on marte give me a break dont give me that stringer rumor crap cnn has faster intel half the time than no such agency he meant the national security agency you dont run anything unless its reliable has to be factchecked im sorry douglas but im telling you the truth i hate to say it but sometimes we actually do make mistakes like that kid in san diego remember back in fortyone alone in the newsroom on the sunday december seventh couldnt get any confirmation but he was going to run the header japs bomb san francisco until they got it sorted out at the last moment bad analogy sweetheart said freeman the japanesejaps is politically incorrect martedid bomb us the kid just thought it was frisco instead of pearl harbor but there was a bombing attack douglas i dont want to be rude but im busy the story is theres no story nothing happened nothing bad news source nada she paused i hear traffic why arent you calling from home afraid your new wifell find out thanks marte he told her take care she hung up bitch well not really a bitch but a bad news source douglas freeman gleaned every headline in the eleven including those in usa today the new york times the los angeles times and la opinión nada he went down to the beach and began his morning run he hated jogging in sand but knew it increased his workout by a factor of two to three and tempered his calf muscles until they were as hard as the new hagfish and kevlar bulletproof vests hed championed as he pounded up and down the dunes he was confident hed give any drill instructor anywhere a run for his moneywith full modern combat pack of fifty to seventy pounds which just happened to be the same amount of weight as the roman legionnaires had carried on their twentymileaday marches as usual when jogging he imagined that he was in a historymaking race like philippides who ran the twentysix miles from marathon to athens to tell the athenians to hold fast that their army under general miltiades who had just whipped the persians was now on its way back to save athens itself which it did of course philippides had collapsed and died the second after hed delivered the fateful message by the time hed reached home freeman was in full sweat sweetie im home i can smell ouch maybe she would cut him off for a month sorry i know i must pong must what she asked sharply pong is that there was a pause and he thought he heard a stifled laugh and seized the opportunity yes pong means to really smell bad an aussie or brit word not sure which aussie lewis used to use it a lot guess i picked it up from him there was another long pause and she appeared at the door in a smart fall suit of variegated autumnal tones nothing too gauche but one that showed her ample bustline to best advantage where are you off to asked the general a little capinhand a man who had once commanded thousands of men in the field and the commander who had electrified america with his momentous uturn battle against the siberian sixth armored corps during the usled un peacekeeping action in the transbaikal im going out she said checking her reflection in the hall mirror i told you last week linda rushmein is giving a bridal shower for her niece julia rushmein mused freeman as in rush mein dinner mein herr margaret didnt smile the shower will be later in the day but lindas asked me to help with the preparations i wont be back till late shes coming to pick me up thats a long drive freeman noted dont wait up for me she said of course i will i cant imagine why ill be tired then ill run you a hot bath freeman said congenially she had put on gold dolphinshaped earrings freeman idly recalled that dolphins were the symbols of submariners it got him thinking that perhaps this nonstory about a darpa facility being attacked had to do with the new submarine base in alaska it might be a bit of a stretch he thought but a news source could say west coast and still mean alaska you can stay up for me if you want said margaret but im going straight to bed thats what i mean he said cheekily slipping off his jogging shoes ill be up dont be vulgar douglas she straightened her suit jacket crimped her hair then looked straight at him youre famous im told for your commando raids and command of detail meticulous planning and concern for your troops well through no fault of your own youve been pushed into retirement by what linda tells me is the ipod generation in the pentagon and im sorry for that and ill try my best to be a good loyal wife but im serious douglas i dont want you flirting with other women its something i abhor in men who are married and flirting he interjected margaret i was thinking of you i just thought it would be imprudent to be calling marte price from home id probably feel the same if you had reason however sound to call an old beau someone you had known slept with you mean like you did with that tart that was before i met you well i mean really got to know you after catherines death for heavens sake margaret get a grip youre blowing this way out of proportion talk about making a mountain out of a molehill its the lie douglas its not that youre phoning your old tart ive asked you before please dont refer to her like that its not that youre phoning your old tart its this pathetic eleven cover story linda rushmein tells me that even amongst your enemies in the state department whom youve raked over the coals for being professional liars youre thought to be an honest man but i caught you in one of your own lies his blood pressure was shooting up and his grimjawed george c scott in patton face was set in defcon the penultimate defense condition before outright war linda rushmouth should keep her mouth shut i did not call people in the state department professional liars i said that they lied because most diplomats were paid to lie oh dont be so tendentious its the same thing she snatched her raincoat from the hall rack all right all right he began it was foolish of me not to tell you id be calling her its just that i could see no good reason to tell you and get you all upset it was wrong of me to do it im sorry it wont happen again there was a horn bipping outside thatll be linda said margaret i have to go can you leave a number where i can reach you i always like to have a she scribbled the number on the yellow postit pad on the hall table i love you you silly woman he called after her and tell linda rushmein to get a muzzle and dont let her drive you home if shes had too many those krauts like their suds shouldnt have said that oaf he would have bawled out a subordinate for such boorishness as he looked into the hall mirror he rebuked himself now youve done it freeman you might be the hero from way back in the far east against the siberian sixth et al but here in monterey youre facing a domestic courtmartial for a damn fool tactical move he descended to the basement opened the rolodex file in the cabinet near his weights and looked up alaska naval bases nothing rang a bell perhaps this nonstory cnn had broadcast before theyd been obviously sat upon by the heavies from the department of homeland security the fbi et al didnt have anything to do with a naval base at all but was about an air force army or marine base with an unmarked black box darpa facility nearby the rolodex listed one darpa facility attached to elmendorf the big air force base adjacent to anchorage alaska as well as other bases down canadas adjoining west coast turning on his computer he did a net search for all armed forces bases but there were no reports not even a suggestion of a b and e only assurances that the government was doing a good job with your tax dollars he called the white house asking to speak to national security adviser eleanor prenty the only connection he had with the administration as per his contract he had promised hed call only on matters of national emergency he was put on hold usually the presidential staff like those at state didnt take kindly to freeman he was likely to say what he thought his words unadorned by the usual equivocation of career flipfloppers and yesmen he wouldnt have made the call if hed been able to get even a scrap of information about the nonstory but there were no scraps still the very idea that terrorists might have penetrated darpa security had set off his alarm bells his personal interest in darpa dated from when hed sent a memo to the pentagon personally championing what otherwise would have been a small item in the press the development of a hagfish slimefiber weave vest the slimes molecular structure he knew was so strong that he suggested it be mixed with the latest kevlar to make what he believed would be the toughest bulletproof vest possible given the weighttoloadbearing ratio of americas fighting men and women darpa had run with the idea and he was proved right since then countless american and allied lives had been saved by the vests and unfortunately the lives of americanhating terrorists who just as freeman had warned the pentagon had gotten their hands on either the chemical formula or the vests themselves so as to reverseengineer their own of course it was only a matter of time before the darpa vest went commercial anyway but hed hoped to give the pentagon the headsup to at least try to restrict the distribution of the vests had terrorists penetrated darpa again and if so what was at risk or was he way off course and marte price right that it was nothing more than a badly sourced nonstory a figment of some eager bloggers imagination the white house operator told the general hed have to leave a message or call back eleanor prenty was in a meeting right now to calm down he showered opening his eyes every now and then to check that no one else was in the bathroom as a youngster hed seen hitchcocks psycho and after that murder in the shower scene hed harbored a subliminal fear about showering with his eyes shut training himself to keep his eyes open even while shampooing it had saved his life in iraq when a terrorist breaching the us security ring around karbala had come in firing his ak freeman having glimpsed him through an eyestinging film of soapsuds had dived quickly knocking the terrorist over grabbing him in a headlock and plunging the wouldbe assassin headfirst into a toilet and drowning him hours later sitting in the living room lazboy waiting for margaret to come home and tired of surfing the net for any possible darpa connection douglas freeman was starting to have grave doubts about aussies story he had killed the tv and turned to read his favorite passages from thucydides history of the peloponnesian war when the phones jangle startled him it was aussie lewis hi aussie whats up we clear clear fore and aft the general replied his tone edgy after the fight with margaret whats up uh nothing much general but ive got a good bet there was a pause does mommy let you bet ill bet when i want said freeman it was an old special forces team joke that whenever you wanted to rib a guy you just said will mommy let you do it okay said aussie this is straight from the trainers mouth not the horses very interesting info on the eight horse in the sixth race at churchill downs its been raining the general was more alert now this was how his specwar teams military intelligence often came to him not from neat official reports but from bits and pieces buried here and there in casual conversation which because there was no record of it could be plausibly denied by all team members should some snoopy congressman launch a fishing expedition into the financial heart of the general accounting office trolling for black ops budgets its been raining aussie repeated uhhuh horse racing was the teams venue of choice for issuing an alert to the other team members the track chosen somewhere in the world where thered been bad weather in the last twentyfour hours the general was already googling churchill downs an inch of precipitation in the last twelve hours the eight horse aussie told him is a good mudder so put a packet on him if you want to make a bundle i dont know said the general feigning disinterest should his phone be tapped by any of the myriad agencies that were now watching their own citizens more closely than ever before in the ongoing war against terror there must be other nags in that race who can run in the mud aussie yeah but not like this one jockey told me this horse loves the mud digs deep no slipping and sliding the mother of all mudders general i dont know the general repeated unlike you aussies im not the betting type a ticket in the powerball now and then maybe but you know what they say about the lotteries yeah yeah tax on the stupid our mate choirs been singing that song to me for years course he doesnt gamble continued aussie sarcastically he invests but hes not on my case today hes got one hell of a hangover from last night and has to hightail it to catch a flight back to wheres that burg he lives in in washington it wasnt a burg it was a small township nestled in the hills on the eastern edge of the cascade mountains winthrop the general answered and answered jokingly hes not sick already choir williams one of the toughest of the tough in special forces having been trained first by the british sas special air service at brecon beacons in wales he was notorious for getting motion sickness choir they used to joke would get sick on an earlymorning dew but like his grandfather and so many others whod been violently ill on that gray ugly morning of june in normandy once he was in action it was the enemys turn to suffer hell be fine said aussie rubbing it in ill give im a coupla greasy fried eggs fore he leaves choirs terse response could be heard in the background you be sure to make the bet general aussie pressed the eight horse i guarantee it oh came the generals retort so youll give me a refund if it doesnt win or place stone the crows said aussie im not that stupid ill think about it aussie thanks for calling when freeman hung up he scribbled churchill downs on his bedside postit pad and got up to spin the rolodex file for the teams letterfornumber code that had been disguised on one of the threebyfiveinch index cards the cards contained everything from specs about the new weapons coming out of darpa to the dimensions of the new waspclass carriers of the kind that the team had used on earlier missions and which housed helos and vertical takeoff and joint strike fighter aircraft the rolodex also held the specifications for the object that looked like a marking pen that the general nearly always carried in his shirt pocket when out of the house consulting the rolodexs file for this days onetime pad that is this days numberforletter code he wrote down a sevendigit number prefixed by a threenumber area code but to make sure his end was as secure as aussies had been the general would now have to use a landline outside the house he knew the nsa had hired hundreds of arabspeaking translators post but he suspected some arab agents must have slipped through the net using the nsas intercepts for their own intelligence networks such was the paranoia of the world after he grabbed his windbreaker and zipped it up feeling a stiff breeze coming off the ocean and headed down to the eleven again he stood impatiently while a lanky dirtyhaired earringintongue youth of about twenty who could see that the general was anxious to get on the phone turned his back on freeman and proceeded to loll against the wall of the phone booth indulging himself in a long banal conversation with his girlfriend the communication consisting of repetition of yknow and totally and like like the general would you know like to pull the insolent son of a bitch right out of the phone booth and totally put him in the marine corps give him a parris island haircut feed him to the drill instructors and teach the kid a few manners the youth was picking his teeth with a broken fingernail as the general left cooling down telling himself hed been through his own rebellious time as a young man but assuring himself that hed not put anything in his body that didnt belong there as his selfrighteous mood abated he walked off to another phone booth four blocks away to dial the number aussie had given him hello it sounded like aussie but there was a lot of static on the line clear intoned the general clear came the reply the general hesitated as his old special forces outfit knew he was a stickler for details it wasnt only his normal disposition that made him so but the experience of having a mission in iraq compromised because of an englishspeaking insurgent having successfully imitated a us ranger calling down mortar rounds on us positions the interloper had used only clear instead of the full clear fore and aft but had sounded so much like an american that the specfor team had taken out four rangers before realizing theyd been set up for a blue on blue and so the general although he was percent sure it was aussie on the other end said clear is insufficient reply i say again clear is insufficient reply the static increased the general heard clear fore and aft whats up asked the general still on guard since nothing was safe voice mail email snail mail and especially text of any kind what was it j p morgan had advised never write anything down got a phone message this afternoon from an old girlfriend of ours yes said freeman the static eased up but then surged well she said she couldnt talk earlier because of the pressure of work the general still felt uneasy the static doing nothing to abate his lingering suspicion so thought freeman homeland security or the fbi had gotten to marte what did she say asked freeman maintaining a casual almost bored tone she said she wished she could have explained more but that her brother had been in the room uhhuh said freeman big brother a cnn boss or a dhs official did she like the card i sent her it was the teams phrase for more information oh yeah she said it was a little sentimental but every word was true she loved hearing your story about eleanor roosevelt the french fries and that kid who told her she had such big ears freeman was so keen to jot down the message he had at first mistakenly taken out the fake darpa marking pen from his shirt pocket instead of the regular ballpoint before reminding himself of the no text rule hed have to commit it to memory oh yeah said the general laughing casually i remember that incident cheeky damn kid where was that on the campaign trail for fdr down in louisiana no youre way off it was said goodnaturedly no remember the story was that she was flying out west for fdr and it was some vips kid on the plane who insulted her yeah said freeman in the tone of one who was just now recalling the full details of an old joke and she says to the cheeky kid never mind my ears your nose is longer than a french fry right that was it but i never believed that bit about her saying that to the kid from what i remember of my history lessons eleanor roosevelt wasnt like that so okay she mightnt have looked like a hollywood film starlet but she was a kind woman and she did a hell of a lot for this country she was fdrs righthand woman right right said freeman committing these three things to memory eleanor roosevelt the kids supposed comment about her big ears and french fries none of these words used by aussie were likely to trigger automatic nsa fbi or dhs phone taps besides the computerheavy nsa quite apart from the dhs and the fbi simply didnt have enough manpower the computers were programmed so that certain giveaway phrases such as terrorist assassination attack and the great satan would automatically trigger an nsa computer to record the conversation for later analysis on the off chance that any terrorist infiltrator from any of the security agencies had been plugged in neither freeman nor aussie had made any reference to a darpa breaking and entering and eleanor roosevelt french fries and big ears werent the kind of words that would alert nsas terrorist surveillance gotta go said aussie someone else wants to use this phone back at the house the general brewed another cup of velvet java as he liked to call the smooth black liquid that dripped from margarets old but thorough filtration system as he waited for his favorite pyrex glass mug to fill the one with the faded insignia of his old third army on it he mused over three things first aussies mention of an old girlfriend of ours clearly referred to marte price second she had felt her message urgent and sensitive enough to call aussie lewis whose number she would have from one of her interviews with the generals team following one of their celebrated raids and third she wanted to get the message to freeman quickly without phoning him directly having eschewed email snail mail or courier service all of which could be and were being opened under the patriot act if dhs and the other agencies had come down on her so hard about this nonstory then they were certainly going to check any email or phone calls from and to her office and home she had done the smart thing obviously having left the office and chosen a landline to call aussie but what in hell did her message mean he shook his head in ironic acknowledgement of the odd ofttimes mundane names that had been used to hide military secrets and the turning points of history climb mount nikita the three words that launched the japanese sneak attack on pearl harbor and the names juno sword omaha utah and gold the designations of the four beaches used in the allied invasion of normandy and for freeman the moving line of paul verlaines poetry blessent mon couer dune langueur monotonewound my heart with a monotonous languorbeing the longawaited signal that galvanized the maquis the french resistance to rise en masse against the nazis at least freeman now realized that the original b and e story was true and that aussies phone message from marte price was trying to help him identify the base all right then how about eleanor roosevelt what did her name signify in history freeman remembered how marte had once lamented to him that one of the most depressing things in her career as an investigative reporter and news anchor was discovering just how ignorant americans are of history not only the history of faroff places such as iraq but the history of our own country as well and shed noted the ignorance wasnt confined to the united states shed told him how shed had to cover the visit of one of canadas former prime ministers paul martin who was giving a televised speech at a military base to celebrate the dday landings in normandy but who called it the invasion of norway and there was the canadian cabinet minister who didnt know the difference between frances pronazi vichy government and the famous battle of vimy ridge in world war i where the canadians had charged and broken the german line but marte hadnt told him anything special or at least anything that he could remember about eleanor roosevelt and what on earth had she to do with aussies mention of french fries and big ears freeman an avid history buff had never heard such a story about fdrs wife and believed that a childs supposed insult to the first lady was a red herring that aussie had dropped into the conversation merely to get the phrase big ears into the message the general had considered the possibility that a callow youth could have actually said something so rude and hurtful to the first lady there had certainly been a lot of cruel if unpublished allusions to her looks during the war by many who had opposed fdr it had been bad enough that fdr had polio the scourge of his generation and was in iron leg braces and a wheelchair the press having had a gentlemans agreement that they would never photograph the leg braces or focus in too closely on the two secret service men who had to stand by the president at every function holding him by cupping his elbows marte and freeman had talked about that littleknown historical fact and how jfks severe back pain and his addisons disease had also been kept from the public freeman smiled affectionately at the memory of their chat about fdr and he did recall marte pointing out how the first lady had done so much good not only for the wartime generation but for everyone how the guy in the street like his father had loved fdr the man in the wheelchair who had served the longest term more than thirteen years of any us president and who had led america out of the terrible years of the depression he had stood up against hitler and helped save england despite the pervasive mood of isolationism against him and had vowed to stop the stomachturning brutality that was the modus operandi of the marauding empire of japan and through it all eleanor like so many uncomplaining wives had borne her husbands darkness with him and had become indispensable freeman had been googling the net for eleanor roosevelt french fries and big ears connections all afternoon by the time the evening news came on he was getting a headache from staring at the flickering screen nothing about any breakin at a military base he remembered watergate that had started to unwind because a b and e had been reported the story that was grabbing tv headlines this day was another worm attack on the net some jerk working for a big corporation had left a port open on his laptop and the perpetrator had downloaded the worm into the corporations mainframes once more he went to his laptop bringing up databases for eleanor roosevelt and crossreferencing keywords from them with defensebased links what he found were umpteen entries as margaret would have described them if she were still speaking to him eleanor roosevelt had sure traveled he googled big ears specifically on the defense contractor linkages nothing there was an ears or rather golden ears provincial park in canada not that far north of the big sub base at bangor on washington states hood canal but there were no references indicating a joint uscanadian armed forces base but when he saw that this provincial park the equivalent of a state park in the united states was landlocked he thought of a possibility so obvious he was embarrassed that it hadnt occurred to him earlier was it possible that there was a navy darpa base somewhere inland in the united states it didnt make sense but he ran it there were only a few but one of them was in idaho potatoes french fries a possibility he zoomed in it was situated on a lake pend oreille in the idaho panhandle thirtysix miles northeast of spokane spokane itself was east of semiarid desert country much of it now irrigated but pend oreille was in a thickly forested valley between the eightthousandfoothigh bitterroot range and the cabinet mountains wilderness area which the general noted placed the lake between northeastern washington and northwestern montana in an area that thousands of years ago had been deeply scoured by glaciers then the computer crashed why he had no idea but it forced him to curb his excitement having to admit with a crossword puzzle addicts reluctance that even if he was correct in his assumption that idaho was a key to unlocking martes message it was still only one of three clues hed been given and nothing was making sense he needed to know more before he could call national security adviser eleanor prenty with his theory that someone was trying to kill a story about a b and e just as someone in the nixon administration had tried to kill watergate then just as suddenly another connection presented itself eleanor prenty and eleanor roosevelt he sat back massaging his neck muscles was there anything more that he could glean from aussies conversation the general had long been a believer as all who had served under him knew in frederick the greats adage laudace laudace toujours laudace and it sure as hell was going to take audacity to call his wife in the middle of linda rushmeins shower so soon after the verbal firefight over marte price but the damned computer was down and he was impatient besides the fact was that margaret was fluent in french he wasnt hello it was linda rushmein on the phone hi its douglas freeman here could i speak to margaret i didnt think you two were on speaking terms replied linda tartly could i speak to my wife please cold as ice he could hear womens laughter in the background but when margaret came on there wasnt a trace of humor in her voice yes it was as if he was a telemarketer interrupting dinner hi sweetie said the general hows the party going fine what do you want it felt like he was standing in a force gale without his thermal underwear look im sorry to bother you sweetie crawl on your belly general hell hath no fury like a woman scorned what do you want douglas well first i want to apologize that was thoughtless of me going out earlier to call like that but you see it was important that i use a landline other than the one in the house im in a phone booth now is this more secret stuff she made it sound seedy its more secure on an outside landline he told her anyway im sorry i upset you i can fully understand how you must have seen it thats big of you she said icily look began freeman this might seem strange but something very importants come up and i need your help do you isnt marte smarter he took a deep breath no he answered slowly and as far as i know she didnt take french in college as you did and you keep it up right i read french i dont speak it well hardly at all thats fine what is it she asked impatiently i have to get back to the party theyre about to give julia the gifts right what does this mean he spelled out pend oreille ive never heard of a french word pend responded margaret but oreille is ear why the general was looking down at his tightly folded copy of the tpc tactical pilotage chart fb the shape of lake pend oreille could be seen as that of an ear pend was maybe a hybrid word from the english pendulouslong hanging down long ear the shape of the lake was roughly like that of an ear with a longer than usual lobe long ear big ear love you margaret there was a pause her voice lowered you too you big oaf see you later sweetheart ill be late not too late i hope margaret heard the excitement in his voice but it seemed to have been aroused more by her translation of oreille than by her impending return to monterey id like to show you something freeman told her its not an ear but its long really douglas but he could tell the ice had been broken i have to go she told him bye he said and with his heart pounding quickly dialed information for vancouver canada and asked for the history department at the university of british columbia where several years earlier hed taken a war and society course as part of the post norad north american defense pact liaison officer exchange program it had been a course primarily on the history of war and its impact on any number of societies how rosie the riveter had expanded the rights of women during the war how war had revolutionized technology and vice versa and how for the confederates the first battle of bull run turned from certain defeat to victory due in large part to the militarys use of railways to rush southern reinforcements to bull run in time to turn the tide for stonewall jackson the general asked to speak to dr retals not there home number the department secretary was polite but firm they couldnt give out home numbers and so he dialed the regular information number for area code and asked for a david retals who if he remembered correctly lived in or around the university area out in the dunbarpoint grey area on a postit the general had written big ears eleanor roosevelt idaho hello dr retals yes general douglas freeman here i took your course on war and i remember general how are you fine doc i need to know something and i needed it yesterday he heard retals give a short laugh you were always in a hurry general except as i remember with your final paper that should have been an a doc the general charged you gave me a bplus i was sorely disappointed you were sorely late an hour late as i recall my damn computer had crashed thats what they all say how can i help you asked the professor congenially obviously amused by his former students complaint about receiving a bplus instead of an a for a late paper and this coming from the legendary american officer whose standing order was that his officers mess at breakfast lunch and dinner must be closed exactly fifteen minutes after opening so as to punish latecomers and impress upon all the need for punctuality do you know of any connection doctor between eleanor roosevelt and a lake pend oreille oh yes the lakes in idaho right yes sir said freeman well began the historian early in the second world war eleanor roosevelt was on a flight out west on some business for fdr and looking down on the rockies she saw this astonishingly beautiful lake just west of the bitterroot range in idaho anyway she made a note of it and when she returned to washington dc she recommended it to fdr who at the time urgently needed a safe inland naval training base that would be well away from the east and west coasts safe from any possible attack particularly by the japanese navys air arm the lake shed seen turned out to be pend oreille its around ninety thousand acres if i remember correctly and very very deep over a thousand feet down in places anyway after training more than a quarter of a million us navy personnel mostly submariners in world war two this training center on the lake the navys second largest training base in the world at the time was decommissioned in the professor paused i think it was sometime in id have to check that anyway though it was decommissioned it wasnt forgotten the staff was greatly reduced in size down to a couple of dozen people at most i believe the navy turned it into some kind of research station thats all i know really professor if you were a woman id kiss you the professor laughed easily remembering how the general hadnt been so jolly when hed received the bplus thanks a million doc i owe you one not at all said retals may i ask what youre up to deter detect defend answered freeman it was norads motto which the professor had mentioned more than once in his course ah said the professor a word of advice shoot said freeman be careful general idaho can get cruelly cold the globes warming professor not everywhere now that he had something definite freeman called eleanor prenty again from the eleven she was in yet another meeting he was persistent insisting that his call was most urgent a matter of the highest national security and that he had information which if it got out could acutely embarrass the administration particularly in this its election year he was put on hold his ears assaulted by the most discordant jazz hed ever heard whoever was on the horn sounded as if he were playing underwater and the tape or disk was past its prime probably scratched to freeman it sounded little better than static being on hold was a damn insult here he was able to prove that it had taken him less than twentyfour hours to discover that whichever security agency was trying to keep the lid on the b and e at pend oreille wasnt quite up to the job and what did they do put him on hold it was what aussie lewis would call a pisspoor start douglas the national security adviser sounded polite but was clearly under a lot of strain her voice rough with fatigue eleanor ive just earned that retainer you pay me and then some how she asked impatiently no doubt hed dragged her away from yet another of the endless chain of meetings with the president and other nonretirees eleanor i have a rocksolid source in the press who confirms that a naval research base has been hit i know where it is its landlocked and its name refers to part of the anatomy i know she said what son of a are you on a landline douglas i may be kept out of the loop he said testily but im not stupid of course im on a landline douglas calm down i wasnt lying to you when we spoke earlier i mean i wasnt giving you the brushoff the cia fbi and dhs have been sitting on this its so explosive they didnt call it through until they thought theyd figured out exactly what had happened i assume you know how much the president hates speculation he wants hard facts from the agencies when they tell him something has fallen off the rails not first impressions but solid facts from what we can gather a computer disk has been stolen and us forces from the tenth mountain division were seen by some residents in the area riding down toward the base defense tells us that the tenth mountain division shouldnt have been anywhere near pend oreille switcheroos said freeman what switcheroos terrorists infiltrators wearing the other guys uniforms hell weve done the same thing in specops for years well whatever happened the disk is gone and apparently it contains highly sensitive data im not even cleared to that level it didnt surprise freeman for while he knew that most people would find it difficult if not impossible to understand how someone as highly placed as the national security adviser might not be privy to such information it was often the case indeed in the new office of scientific intelligence the distribution of darpa files freeman knew was obsessively controlled look freeman advised the national security adviser even from what little youve told me and from what ive heard about homeland security or whoever it was killing the story after an initial blurb on cnn this is clearly a nowait situation we dont need a lot of suits from either the intel agencies or foggy bottom discussing the options theres only one thing to do go find the pricks who stole the disk with the right transport i can have my team rendezvous and be on the trail within eight hours he hurried on hell one of my men he was thinking of choir williams lives in the area in question he said nothing about young prince choirs k dog who was one of the best trackers hed ever seen next to the team itself this is what we do eleanor then he added with some force i brought home the bacon from korea didnt i yes she agreed he and his team had successfully carried out a predawn raid on the coast of north korea in one of the most hostile military areas in the world and brought back vital intel freemans team had done precisely what the socalled us paratroopers had done at the darpa installation on pend oreille except that freeman and his team hadnt murdered civilians in cold blood they had fought their own kind warriors in the north korean raid freeman voice controlled but tight with the tension of expectation said i say again eleanor what weve got to do is go find these people before they get the disk out of the country right before she could answer he was asking have your people alerted all ports airports and we have and weve got hundreds of dhs and fbi agents swarming through every airport in the northwest all border personnel have been alerted and are triplechecking every passport the air force coast guard and navy on both coasts are also on alert that means no plane or vessel is leaving the country until we say so time eleanor the general stressed by the time the top brass in the pentagon get their heads around this these jokers will be on the west coast for heavens sake give me the green light let my team go after em were always ready to go on short notice you know that send in the heavyweight battalions later if i dont get them but lets go while the trails still hot i checked the longrange forecast and in a few days theres going to be a big snowfall up there thats not going to help track em eleanor its a wilderness up there one of the last great wild places in america and with our regular forces already stretched thin all across the world what you need is a small selfsufficient welltrained readytogo group on the ground now dammit we can smell a terrorist was her sigh one of disbelief or fatigue you all right he asked do you fight as fast as you talk douglas yes maam he answered goodnaturedly before he was back on the attack telling her weve trained for it eleanor its what we do he repeated when my guys move through the kill house at fort bragg theyre not only practicing close quarters combat they get to use their noses smell memory people with different diets give off differentsmelling perspiration my guys use their noses or by god i dont pass them he didnt mention prince once that puppy as freeman sometimes called choirs fully grown dog got onto a scent he was like a magnet to a fridge wouldnt let go eleanor yes how many of our people were killed up there im not certain as yet she replied but we think around a dozen not all the pix have come through from the fbi its not like suicide bombers douglas i mean the sheriff who was first on the scene said nothing much seems disturbed no butchershop massacre not like the mess suicide bombers leave behind first photos show one body slumped sitting on the floor back to a door if you didnt look closely and see the body a man she needed a second to regain her composure even the bullet holes arent messy at least not in the pictures i saw its so so surreal as if some of themve just gone to sleep on the floor except for an older man slumped down by the door he looks she couldnt go on for several more moments he began eleanor the older man i mean he was no older than my dad it was just so cruel douglas they werent even soldiers just civilians scientists doing their freeman spoke softly i know these terrorist bastards theyre not warriors theyre vermin he paused could hear her breathing eleanor for gods sake give me the green light can you stay on hold for a few minutes sure he answered without a trace of annoyance i like jazz while he waited shifting the receiver from one hand to the other the jazz static attacked again this time murdering stranger on the shore it was only now that freeman saw the muscular youth the one hed seen before silver stud in his tongue hed been waiting impatiently for the phone and was now moving menacingly toward the general what bothered freeman most was that hed been so focused on talking with eleanor that hed missed seeing the youth im going to be awhile here freeman told him cordially its an urgent call youd be better off to use the phone a couple of blocks from here what wondered freeman was a kid even a deadbeat doing without a cellphone did he have anything to do with pend oreille or was he a wild card looking for trouble courting it to fizz up his gray existence where the only certainty was uncertainty cant use it said the kid sourly his jaw jutting in the direction of the phone its busted listen said freeman as politely as time would allow im sorry but this is an urgent call so if you could give me a little space here the youth more sullen and unkempt up close than hed appeared earlier in the day came even closer freeman could smell him sour body odor and glimpsed soap dripping from a squeegee poking out from behind his waist not much traffic around here the general commented while wondering who in hell would use such a deadbeat as humint then again freeman took a pace toward the youth who backed off the phone was dangling sorry eleanor the general said picking it up had to get rid of a varmint but eleanor wasnt on the line and he was still in nomansland on hold he could see the youth returning with an older rube the latter covered from head to hairy arms in alarming tattoos his head clean shaven he held a baseball bat in his right fist there was more metal hanging from his neck waist and wrists than that hung on a louisiana chain gang you got a problem with muh boy the man bellowed no problem said freeman just waiting on a long distance call federal business i dont give a fuck what business it is growled the tattooed skinhead now get away from that fucking phone let muh boy use it the general knew that getting away from the phone was precisely what he should not do the phone cubicles sides and top meant that the only way mickey mantle could get to him with the bat was headon either that or the rube would have to stoop low enough to try to get the generals legs which would put the rube at a momentary disadvantage get out of the fuckin booth now roared the batwielding tough he made as if to get ready for a home run with the bat you ever heard of darpa asked the general drop that fuckin phone darpa makes good products the general said calmly reaching up to his shirt pocket with his free hand taking out what looked to the tough like a retractable pen the general holding it toward the mans gut then clicking it as he would a ballpoint the bang was so loud freeman couldnt hear anything for several seconds his ears ringing the man grunting stumbling backward an astonished look on his face as he fell flat on his butt his legs jerking spasmodically on the sidewalk like a childs in tantrum the baseball bat spilling out noisily onto the road the general unhurriedly retrieved the bat as the man now flat on his back groaning brought his hands to his chest where the hard rubber bullet from the generals nonlethal pen had struck him at pointblank range the general pointed the bats handle at the astonished son now you take daddy home to mommy hes gonna need about three pounds of ice on his belly and a change of underpants and call the police if you want itd be my pleasure now scram as the tattooed man limped slowly off touchingly assisted by his scruffy offspring the general returned to the phone that had again been dangling free during the fracas douglas eleanor was shouting in alarm are you all right was that a shot i heard car backfiring said freeman there was no point in worrying her so what does the man say he says go but theres one thing were going to have to release it to the media that darpa place is not too far from a little township the storys bound to get out and the president doesnt want to be caught looking flatfooted so were just going to say if were asked that the president has dispatched a special forces unit to track these terrorists down she paused when can you leave douglas soon as you give me one of your high tails it was the latest class of honda executive jet small fast but big enough to carry the team their combat backpacks and prince do we have any of those asked eleanor in the armed services i mean four freeman told her two on the west coast two on the east it was obvious to eleanor that hed already thought it through aussie lewis salvini and our multilingual expert johnny lee can get the honda out of andrews air force base in dc the rest of us on this side of the country myself choir eddie shark mervyn gomez and our new guy tony ruth hes an exarmy ranger we can take one of the two hondas dod has on the west coast the eight of us rendezvousing at fairchild air force base the big base in washington state she proffered affirmative answered freeman forty clicks west southwest of the ear i mean pend oreille all that eleanor had been told about the region was that it was beautiful and brutally rough terrain be careful douglas the man will give you fortyeight hours by then the guys at the pentagonll be stirring their battalions and wanting to move in no sweat replied freeman thats all we need this hunt was made for my team fortyeight hours well corner the bastards in half the time good hunting then she said remember fortyeight hours douglas thats all the lead time we can give you any more will be politically as well as militarily untenable once the public starts pressuring whoever the congressperson is for northern idaho it could be the election issue of the year rita carlisle said freeman what the congresswoman for idaho the general told eleanor is rita carlisle fiftytwo and a looker ill take your word for it but listen we need to know one thing eleanor said ive been so busy listening to you i almost forgot we havent been briefed as to exactly what has been stolen i mean whats on the disk all the pentagon can tell us is that its flowinflight data and that the darpa scientists at the navy base were operating above top secret level and eyes only so when you get to the lake youd better check with the director of the darpa installation or whats left of it hes on the daytime staff and the white housell give him authority to discuss it in more detail with you we cant figure out what theyre going to do with the information theyve stolen after all the terrorists dont have a navy freeman was surprised by her remark he put it down to fatigue for wasnt it obvious what the terrorists were going to do with it whatever it was darpa had been testing at the naval base the terrorists were sure to use it against the united states damn terrorists didnt need a navy to attack the uss cole freeman said used a rigid inflatable packed with c and douglas yes the pentagon set up darpa at pend oreille but apparently not even the joint chiefs were told exactly what the scientists were working on right now the pentagons highly pissed with the civilian scientists for not requesting full defcon security for the lake the pentagon says that this is what happens when you dont insist on military oversight of darpa contracts that civilians scientists know squat about security in all fairness though the base is at the end of a lake thats used a lot for recreation and so without moving the base ironclad security would have been impossible anyhow dont worry freeman assured her ill try not to get in a brawl between anyone but ill find out exactly what was on that disk and why they needed such deep water whatever it is eleanor cautioned him keep it to yourself the man does not want whatever it is going public its bad enough a research installation was broken into of course freeman assured her ill keep it strictly within the team godspeed douglas he could hear the worry in her tone when margaret returned late from the bridal shower for linda rushmeins niece she could smell fresh coffee but douglas wasnt there there was a note margaret on specfor mission presidents orders will contact you asap be out of touch for a few days if you need any further explanation pls ring eleanor prenty national security adviser at the white house her is in my rolodex shell fill you in as far as security allows all my love douglas bewildered she dropped onto the sofa unlike her dearly departed sister catherine she was not used to coming home to find her husband having left home so abruptly where was he what was he doing how would she know when hed call questions she knew that were being asked daily by the loved ones of thousands of us servicemen and servicewomen but for margaret it was far from the norm too far in fact was this what her life was going to be like living with retired general douglas freeman glory be she had thought they would sail congenially together into the golden twilight of retirement instead he was gone she knew she shouldnt be resentful but she was what could she do she switched on the tv if it was this darpa thing hed mentioned whatever it was precisely if it were that important surely thered be something on the news by now there wasnt the lead story was about a jailed enron executive who had presumably been attacked by a fellow inmate but all he would say was that hed accidentally tripped from the second floor out a window cnn reported the phone lines were jammed following the story by calls from people whod been forced out of retirement by enrons collapse back in suggesting that he should have tripped from the enron tower instead the remainder of the news consisted of the days wrapups of the opening barrages in the presidential primaries a candidate in new hampshire was running on a platform of getting to the root of the problem of the war on terror by making friends with the muslim fundamentalists well at least margaret thought douglas wasnt home to hear that his blood pressure was okay but it wasnt that good chapter three en route to idaho on one of the east coasts hondas aussie lewiss recurring dream about a special forces op hed taken part in in iraq in near karbala made his sleep restless more than once years after the op his wife alexsandra had to shake him out of a troubled sleep that had been sabotaged by the same dream aussie generally known for his laidback attitude was puzzled both by the persistence and clarity of the dream hed been with a recon group assigned to help a marine corps convoy negotiate the fedayeen minefields during a stop to regroup the hummers after theyd passed through a blinding sandstorm one of the young marines a twentyyearold the name on the headband of his kevlar helmet wain had been sent out about twenty yards with his buddy to secure the convoys right flank wain saw a woman in black chador and veil running away from the remains of an artillerygutted claybrick house on the citys outskirts and toward the convoy qiff he shouted it was the arabic word for halt the woman kept coming one hand frantically waving a dirty white rag her other hand cradling a baby who could now be heard screaming as the woman tripping and almost falling in the loose sandy loam continued her approach qiff yelled wain again his m now shoulder high give er a warning burst shouted wains buddy as the marine commander walked just ahead of the convoy for a situation report from aussie and two other scruffy special forces types who were pooling their minefield intel aussie was now walking out from the convoy coming up behind wain and his marine buddy qiff dammit yelled wain firing a warning burst the three rounds kicking up little puffs of dust the woman stopped as if only then realizing the americans order the whiplike crack from behind startled wain who spinning around saw that aussie had fired the woman stumbled then fell backwards her baby spilling onto the sand jesus man wain shouted at aussie come with me the dirtyfaced lewis had commanded without breaking stride cmon wain had walked with him toward the body you think that thats a real baby mate asked lewis wain though marine hardened was still in shock he couldnt think straight the baby was still crying dont worry aussie had told him it is a real baby but look at mommy here ever see an iraqi woman with such big feet ii never noticed wain had answered the babys screaming was unnerving no said lewis kicking the corpses shoes you werent meant to you were supposed to be looking at the baby and maybe at mommys eyes but not her feet aussie had bent down and gently pulled the veil aside oh look mommys got a beard he stood up friggin fedayeen baath party thugs wain his weapons stock in the sand bent down to pick up the baby no lewis said hauling him back by the collar shit wain had objected they wouldnt boobytrap a baby but the moment he said it he realized he was asking a question how long you been in this hellhole mate aussie asked him a week wain had answered theyll use anything and anyone to get at us aussie told him the babys screaming rattling wain further as aussie seemingly oblivious to the noise felt carefully about the babys clothes sniffing as he did so like a dog investigating carrion some guys can smell semtex hed told wain im one of em semtex inquired wain trying to maintain his equanimity in front of this specfor type who was obviously an experienced warrior the dead iraqi was staring at the washedout blue sky flies already moving across his bearded chin and mouth semtex you mean c plastique i do aussie had replied without taking his eyes off the baby whose face by now was crimson its arms stiff in distress gingerly aussie ran his fingers down the sides of the infants covered legs seems okay ten to one mommys dirty though thats why he kept walking at this point in the dream wain could always be seen paying particular attention to aussies hands which once removed from his specfor combat gloves moved with the steady confident deftness of a pickpocket as he frisked the dead iraqi a bomber aussie concluded quietly wain noting worriedly that the babys face was turning purple sticks are around his back aussie explained indicating the dead iraqi from one side to the other like a corset id say seven of em he looked up at wain lucky number for the fedayeen seven pillars of wisdom aussie grinned with obvious satisfaction at having found the explosive you can pick the little guy up now if you like he told wain wain was trying to lift the infant carefully but hed been spooked by the whole thing and fumbled give him to me aussie had said and cradling the infant in one arm unscrewed his belt canteen with his free hand tilted it slightly washing his finger tipped the canteen again and placed his wet fingertip on the babys parched lips smiling as the infant sucked off the moisture still holding the baby he walked back with wain toward a hummer wains buddy following maintaining the regulation threemeter gap between himself and wain what outfit you with wain asked aussie get a surgical glove from a corpsman aussie had told him fill it with water and prick one of the fingers for a teat i have to be going guide you guys through the minefield up yonder then get back to work what outfit you with wain repeated head hunters where you based here and there aussie had been rocking the infant to stop its crying smiling down at him what do do you say we name the little bugger blue eyes he asked wain and several other marines who had gathered around were grateful for something else to look at other than the heat waves of the desert in which mirages of beige sunbaked buildings from nearby karbala shimmered suspended in the brutal heat blue eyes said a machine gunner from his port atop a hummer the desert goggles on his fritz encrusted with sand since when does an arab have blue eyes jesus said wain shading his eyes from the sun think the kids old man coulda been one of our guys or a brit papa said the machine gunner or an aussie or a polack said another hey watch it ryan interjected a polishamerican driver in the convoy wain frowned yeah but i mean having it off with the enemy with a woman said aussie lewis winking at wain its been known to happen shit said wain would you screw a if she said please joked aussie there was a burst of laughter from the assembled marines except for wain in the dream his face always clouded over with a browcreasing frown of disapproval aussie shading blue eyes sleeping face from the sun looked over at wain opining not all iraqis are the enemy mate though youd never know that if you watch tv uhoh little guys wet himself he added wed better the crackle of a radio interrupted him and he heard the marines co calling out at this point aussie always realized he was in a dream but was unable to extricate himself okay guys the marines co ordered his voice crackling in the fierce dry heat back in the vehicles weve got an m tank column cutting across from karbala theyre gonna go ahead of us our sappers have confirmed these specfor guys suspicions we definitely have a minefield two clicks ahead i say again minefield two clicks ahead aussie handed blue eyes back to wain you know how to change a baby into what joshed a marine aussie had grinned and thered been laughter as they climbed into their hummers wain stood momentarily abandoned holding the baby gingerly out in front of him as if it were a time bomb no hey wait gotta go marine said a driver shit said wain rocking blue eyes with such intensity that the infant was screaming again easy wains buddy had said sharply youll rock his brains out here give im to me my sisters got a coupla kids ill change im in the humvee lets go well why the fuck didnt you tell me before wain had reflected with a mixture of relief and irritation i was havin too much fun watchin you shouldve seen your face when the specfor dropped that iraqi dead in his tracks so said wain you tellin me you werent surprised it wasnt a woman nah you lying fuck charged wain as the convoy started off wains buddy told the driver to keep it steady no jerking side to side as he used a khaki tshirt as a diaper for the little boy after the road had been cleared of antipersonnel mines by the seventyton m behemoths rolling unharmed and contemptuously over them aussie had taken blue eyes to the arab red cross the red crescent in baghdad as he handed the child to one of the crescents nurses after the boy had been printed and a blood sample taken for the records the dream which always presented itself in vivid color would suddenly and inexplicably change to a stark black and white of the kind aussie remembered seeing in the film sin city aussie enjoined the nurse to take care of him hes an orphan aussie had known then that if no one claimed the little boy quickly rejecting him because he might well be a halfcaste arab the odds were that he would forever be an outcast as he grew older and the danger then would be that the only refuge he would find would be in tightknit terrorist families such as hamas there he would learn that as surely as all christians and jews were taught that they were descended from abrahams son isaac and that all muslims were taught that they were descended from abrahams son ishmael he would be taught that his salvation lay in total obedience to allahs will as defined by hamas over southern idaho a gutwrenching wind shear slammed into the honda jet jerking aussie violently against his safety h harness sitting back hard in his seat his neck perspiring despite the cool interior of the honda aussie lewis once again tried to figure out why his particular encounter in the sunbaked iraqi desert continued to haunt him and in such tendentious detail then again he reminded himself he knew that many other vets had recurring dreams from their time in combat too he shouldnt be surprised what would have surprised him however was the speed with which the red crescent nurse in baghdad had given the halfcaste blue eyes to wadi elhage commander of hamass antiamerican operations the corpulent and gimleteyed elhage saw blue eyes deliverance to hamas as indeed a gift from allah blessed be his name for the infants fair skin if it did not change by the time he was in puberty would be an invaluable asset to any hamas agent selected to work against the americans still elhage had no illusions it was no easy thing training a hamas agent for while it was essential in elhages view that the boy receive a good multilingual education in order that he might blend as easily with say the americans as with the russians it must be a very carefully managed education so that the student would not become seduced by either slavic or western decadence chapter four two months before the attack on lake pend oreille three russian generals who were out of work out of hope and out of money due to the soviet unions post collapse were invited by two highly placed ministry of defense officials from moscow to a secret meeting the two officials rebel officers of the old kgbs thirteenth directorate had chosen orsk the russian city miles southeast of moscow and fifteen miles from the russiankazakhstan border for the meet each of these generals mikhail abramov from the siberian sixth armored corps viktor beria from infantry and sergei cherkashin from air defense arrived separately at fifteenminute intervals to be interviewed by the two officials in a smokefilled booth in orsks hotel metropole the two officials in their midfifties were dressed in illfitting suits as if they hoped to blend in with the thousands of other government officials all over russia but both the fatter redfaced man and his shorter rotund colleague nevertheless had the air of bristling confidence that so often accompanies the sudden acquisition of money or power shiskabigand malylittle as the three generals would subsequently refer to them ushered abramov beria and cherkashin into the opulent redvelvetcurtained bar on the mezzanine big and little began the meeting by empathizing with each of the generals in turn they knew what it must be like they commiserated with the three career officers to have been rendered ustarelyeobsolete by yeltsins democratic reforms to be downsized as the americans euphemistically called it and then to have whatever savings youd been able to accumulate wiped out your pension worthless now because the government had failed to rein in inflation and criminal speculators from moscow to vladivostok like so many of your generation began big a cigarette dangling from between his thick lips you three generals served your country in the cold war against the americans worked hard all your lives and he paused extending his arms palms upward what do you get no one answered as he sucked hard on the cigarette its grayish blue smoke leaking from nose and mouth nothing he told them jabbing the cigarette in the air you are humiliated thats what you get in moscow added little looking at each general in turn old soldiers are now packing grocery bags to make ends meet at least said abramov the lean sharpfeatured tank commander they have jobs we havent been paid for two months and put in army general viktor beria the short stocky infantry commander at least they have some food to put in the bags the battalion i now command instead of the regiment it once was is owed five months pay five months its a wonder there isnt mutiny the two officials glanced at each other tell them big invited his colleague who leaning forward on the cracked formica table lowered his voice then you havent heard comrades elements of the northern fleet have already done so that damned gorbachev said air defenses cherkashin the oldest of the three his dull gray hair as he leaned forward in striking contrast to the brightness of his bemedaled chest gorbachev started it all we were once a proud nation until he and his glasnost fairies ruined everything they took down the antifascist barricade in berlin and now look at what we are my air defense unit has been scattered to hell and gone i had six hundred men now since putin im down to a third of that and everyone wants to leave for a job with the arabs neither official interrupted they couldnt have hoped for a better response as a precursor to their coming offer years before any officer of infantry air defense or tank corps no matter how senior he was would have immediately been arrested and sent to one of the siberian gulags for the kind of criticism of the political leadership cherkashin was making but now such talk was common amongst officers and other ranks who had seen their careers and livelihoods ruined by what they called the razvalthe breakup of the once great union of soviet socialist republics now russia was surrounded by independent countries breakaway republics from the baltic in the northwest to former soviet satellite states such as poland to the south and flanked by a clutch of muslimdominated central asian republics where the usual resentments between the center and periphery of any country manifested themselves in siberias growing challenge to the kind of authority from moscow that had once decreed that all trains to and from vladivostok eleven time zones away must run on moscow time have you been to leningrad little asked disgustedly none of the three generals bothered to remind him that the politically correct name for the great naval base and artistic center was st petersburg as it had been called before the revolution were going backward instead of forward he continued yes concurred the infantrys beria whose beady eyes seemed almost to close as he paused pouring himself a shot of vodka his hairy hands and wrestlers build giving him a primitive appearance he tapped the label of the new kalashnikov vodka you think he asked grumpily kalashnikov gets royalties for this he peered through the cigarette haze at air chief cherkashin and the tank corps renowned abramov abramov shrugged kalashnikov continued beria he never took a kopeck for the weapon that bears his name he could have been a billionaire if hed been a capitalist beria now looked hard at the two officials you ask if we know what its like in politically correct st petersburg i know and i ask what was our revolution for our warships are wasting away submarines battle cruisers scores of destroyers all are turning to rust beria downed another vodka and in moscow gangsters are in control its like the americans chicago in the thirties yes cherkashin together with the two officials nodded his agreement abramov the tank commander who at fiftyfive was the youngest of the three generals was looking restive however an exasperated expression on his face big turned to him and you general abramov you agree with what asked the steel blue eyed abramov his lean face tight with impatience i assume you didnt invite us here to complain about the situation comrade we all know how bad the situation is how weve been stabbed in the back by communist billionaires and other democratic politicians in their lakeside dachas the point is what can we do about it how can you help us the corpulent official took another unfiltered sobranie cigarette from its tin and lit it with a gold dunhill lighter a decidedly upmarket item in striking contrast to his shabbily tailored suit the biting aroma of turkish tobacco rose voluminously around the booths thick velvet curtains we are not here just to help ourselves we five here you misunderstand weve come here in order to help the entire officer corps to form a successful economic nucleus to which other disaffected officers might be drawn quite so said the smaller official whose previously impassive face began to crease his eyes weeping involuntarily under the assault of smoke from the sobranie well mused the infantrys viktor beria this economic nucleus whatever it is will need money lots of it trucks full of it if you hope to put things right air defenses cherkashin nodded and abramov thoughtfully looking down and flicking away a trace of sobranie ash that had fallen from the officials cigarette onto the peak of his tank corpsmans cap said no damn rubles theyre worthless the big official gave them an enigmatic smile you might have to sup with the devil we will have to sup with the devil little corrected him stalin had to sup with roosevelt and churchill to save mother russia some things have to be done in churchill had to kill the french at oran rather than let their mediterranean ships fall into hitlers hands and never mind the french cut in the steely abramov whos our devil this time not muslims i hope proffered cherkashin those bastards in chechnya killing our people in the moscow theater in and all those children in beslan just two years later we dont know said the official disingenuously whether the muslims were connected to that cherkashin was outraged he stood up muslim fanatics murdered my nephew i wont have anything to do with them the nazis killed twenty million of us general shot back the sobranie smoker we did business with them when it suited us we got half of poland they got the other half sit down it was said with such unexpected authority that it transformed the atmosphere in the room abramov believing that these two officials from orsk were in fact military men themselves well be selling equipment capability the smoker continued taking another long drag on his cigarette which was now pointing at the air defense chief general cherkashin i believe you were a chief negotiator with the iraqis during the cold war how many thousand air defense units did you sell them and you abramov how many of our t tanks did you sell to the iraqis sergei cherkashin made to say something but sat down instead wed be selling them tanks asked abramov no interjected the other smaller official other equipment capability he was agitated do you know he asked intently looking first at abramov and beria then at cherkashin what our entire military budget was the year after the antifascist wall came down in berlin in he didnt wait for an answer four billion us dollars you know what the usas was ill tell them said his colleague who now leaned forward to make the point the united states defense budget was not four billion comrades but two hundred and sixty billion sixtyfive times that of the soviet union his tone and that of his colleague made it obvious to the three generals that they were dealing with more than two senior bureaucrats air defenses cherkashin sighed impatiently so now we know how much richer the us is than we are but why may i ask did you choose the three of us a general from air defense viktor here from infantry and our tank commander abramov perhaps we are so goodlooking big allowed himself a grin revealing through the foglike smoke three gold crowns on on his lower teeth and an extraordinarily expensive crown and bridge in his upper jaw before he resumed his serious tone three reasons comrades he told them whom he and little referred to only as a b and c first explained big because your exceptional organizational skills have come to our notice whether you liked it or not you were part of putins transition team before you were reassigned to your separate commands exiled put in beria bitterly a thousand miles from moscow secondly said big taking no notice of berias comment youve all seen combat in afghanistan and elsewhere so we three have organizational skills and combat experience said general abramov what is the third reason youre very poor said big he looked at each one of them in turn before exhaling fully his smoke engulfing them none of you can sleep because you dont know how youre going to look after your family in this new capitalist paradise of ours he paused youre worried sick gentlemen he fixed his gaze on abramov even you mikhail he inhaled again slowly deeply giving them time to realize just how much he might know about them beyond their outward show of braggadocio as the brownish blue smoke poured forth he continued i know what its like believe me we now have in russia the very very rich and the dirt poor the rich have reserves to see them through the chaos thats followed yeltsin putin and their successors the poor he shrugged well most of them have never known anything else only now its worse but you three he was using his cigarette as a pointer again jabbing it at them your whole officer class has been raised to enjoy the fruits of your hard work for the party and now its all crumbled he stubbed out his cigarette ive seen your medical files not your official military medical records your localprivatephysicians zopiclone he left the name of the sleeping pill hanging in the air before adding prozac and volga volga was the cheapest brand of vodka and big gave a sardonic grin reciting the commercial jingle like the mighty river volga it will wash your troubles away he leaned forward the smile gone shoulders hunched with intensity for you were offering a way to win back russia for the party and to earn yourselves some hard cash for your families it is what the americans call a winwin situation da he leaned back and opened his tin of sobranies plucking out another cigarette how much money asked air defense general cherkashin his medals clinking as he leaned forward placing both hands on the table a hundred thousand a month said big for each of you rubles asked beria american dollars the normally cool hardeyed abramov tried to appear nonchalant but his face was flushed with excitement and he had to make a conscious effort to sit back and look relaxed as if he could take it or leave it beria and cherkashin were stunned ah where do we move this equipment this capability asked cherkashin where moscow cant see it replied the sobranie smoker as far from here in orsk and from moscow as possible in fact east youll be told in due time if you accept our offer but once youre given the location the three of you hold your lives in your hands we want you to reaching into his pocket he fished out the gold dunhill lighter we want you to think it over but quickly there are plenty of other candidates disaffected officers like yourselves but my colleague and i he looked at little have to get back to moscow he glanced at his rolex asking his smaller partner the last plane out of orsk is at correct yes ill give you fifteen minutes big told the three generals who were now convinced by the officials use of that he was a military man well be down in the foyer big added getting up and gathering his jacket and the tin of sobranies its either yes or no the three generals went out into orsks polluted air to talk it over the roads badly cracked surface was an apt symbol mikhail abramov thought of the state of russia it was the beginning of the end necessity is the mother of invention big had told abramov the commander of the grossly understaffed siberian sixth armored division it was a phrase that had been quoted many times by the officer corps in the turmoil since the collapse he himself had had to cannibalize half his tanks just to keep the other half going so said viktor beria looking at the leaner abramov and the taller grayhaired cherkashin the air defense general are you two in i know im sick of constantly scrabbling around to make ends meet abramov had been conjuring up the glory days of the siberian sixth at least the days had been glorious until the humiliating defeat that he as a young lieutenant and other tank platoon commanders had suffered in a trap wherein american ma abrams tanks had duped the famed sixth armored corps during a winter battle between it and the usled un peacekeeping force in siberia a hundred thousand dollars a month said beria with a whistle but what is this equipment this capability he talks about said abramov i dont care said beria im broke i want to know said abramov as the three of them made their way back into the hotel whether this capability is real or not i at least want to ask him if its in place ready to go or are we expected to start from scratch i need to know that much if im to decide abramov posed the questions quietly but without preamble as they met the two officials in the foyer what capability are we talking about at least give us a rough idea the two officials looked at each other and decided that a little more bait was necessary to hook the generals a capability big answered him that is staggering general and which will be ready for full production in two months if our acquisition of the data is successful but beyond that i will discuss it in detail only if you wish to join our team whose team is that little who had spoken nary a word since the three generals had returned from outside suddenly leaned forward his suits crease crumpling as he did so the old team he told abramov as if the tank general was a student whod forgotten his most important lesson a lesson which governed all others the team which the stupid americans think is washed up but is just waiting as their george washington did to cross the delaware to regain what has been stolen stolen from our partys grip because some generals didnt have the balls to overturn all these ridiculous democratic reforms are you with us or not do you want to slave away for kopecks in this socalled new democratic russia or be able to hold your head up again armed with some real weapons for a change with something our clients can hit the americans with so fast so utterly that theyll be pissing themselves in the streets and which if successful if organized correctly will act as a nucleus to attract more of our comrades to reinvigorate the party now are you with us or not abramov thought for a second his final humiliation had been having to tell his daughter that shed have to stop taking her beloved studies in ballet because of the money hed stopped her dream da he told little im with you and so were beria and cherkashin the air force general asking gleefully now were in tell us how do we get the americans pissing their pants looking at the three generals in turn big asked have you ever heard the phrase flowinflight data none of them had chapter five his recurring dream evicted from consciousness upon his arrival at fairchild aussie with freeman and the other six members of the team was now aboard an oilysmelling chinook helo heading for the lower southernmost end of northwest idahos ninetythousandacre lake pend oreille to choir williamss extreme discomfort the team encountered a gutrolling turbulence as a lowpressure weather system rushing in from the pacific coast hit a canadian express a stream of freezing air pouring down from the arctic through british columbia a little more than sixty miles to the north of the lake as the general studied his tactical pilotage map of the rugged milewide milelong idaho panhandle that contained both lake pend oreille and priest lake thirty miles northnorthwest of pend oreille he shook his head whats up general aussie shouted over the roar of the chinooks engines freemans face was creased by what his team had come to call his george c scott look one of concern and hard focus it wasnt worry however douglas freeman tried to spend as little time as he could worrying a devotee of the man muslims saw as a holy prophet and christians the messiah set your mind on gods kingdom and his justice before everything else and all the rest will come to you as well so do not be anxious about tomorrow tomorrow will look after itself each day has troubles enough of its own even so freeman had to think ahead and sal seeing the generals frown of concentration asked problem it was a question that an enlisted man would hardly be expected to ask a general at least not so casually but this specfor team with the exception of tony ruth had been in action together before besides the easy familiarity between officers and enlisted men came naturally to such small groups of men whod been in combat and whod bivouacked in close quarters freemans voice thundered over the chinooks combined rotor slap and engine noise no problem gentlemen no problem at all he looked down at prince the fiveyearold black spaniel whose floppy ears were covered by earmuffs that choir williams had made especially for him and who seemed to perk up as if reading the generals mind the first thing we need to know the general continued is which way those bastards headed off from the darpa installation at the end of the lake and for that answer he leaned forward and scratched prince affectionately behind his ears the dog immediately half closing his eyes in canine ecstasy we need to get prince here a scent from those terrorist creeps if we can that right fella the generals right hand moved from princes ears to beneath his chin panting happily prince eagerly thrust his head forward asking for more from the helos open door the slipstream roaring like rushing water against his goggles freeman caught a glimpse of the densely forested mountain fastness of the cabinet mountain wilderness area that flanked lake pend oreille to the east beyond the idahomontana border to his left northwest he could see the sixthousandfoothigh summit of bald mountain and south of the lake cedar mountain on the long earshaped lake which looked to him more like an elongated question mark than an ear lay several rectangular shapes darpas barge out from the shore designated darpa alpha on his map the data hut on the shoreline and several other storage buildings scattered around the small settlement of bayview on the ears lobe with coeur dalene another twenty miles to the south freeman also saw there was only one road leading out from the darpa installation to interstate eight miles west of the lake princes nose was at his side the spaniels eyes watering from the icycold wind that swept over the misty blue mass of the cabinet mountains and the kootenai national wildlife refuge beyond the lake where rivulets born in snowcapped peaks fed both lake pend oreille and priest lake to the northwest gonna see a grizzly eh freeman asked prince who remained incommunicado as he basked in the extended chin scratch the general was giving him and the back scratch that now that the turbulence had subsided choir was lavishing on him grizzly put in aussie i certainly hope not terrorists are one thing grizzly bears are something else then freeman told the team youd better check your weapons guys make sure youre loaded for bear as well as scumbags salvini had selected a pound inch belgian generalpurpose machine gun or gpmg a weapon that could fire fiftyround belts of the big mm slugs over an effective killing range of threequarters of a mile should a long punch firefight break out for his part choir had chosen the germanmade heckler koch generalpurpose mg which was a lighter and shorter machine gun the mg with folding stock and carrying handle had a transparent thirtyround magazine fired standard nato mmcaliber rounds and had a kill reach of more than a third of a mile in his preop briefing at fairchild the general had told the other seven men in his eightman team that while the trail would most likely lead them through thick bush and forest there would also be open alpine meadows at the higher elevations of the bitterroot mountains in such places the shorterrange heckler kochs famous mppound submachine gun was favored by most others in the team the generals weapon of choice was an ak an updated ak which hed chosen for its relatively light weight pounds easy maintenance and greater range than the heckler koch mp the general had had his aks original folding metal frame stock replaced with wood so that it could be used as a door opener or skull crusher should the occasion arise as usual in the group the general had allowed each member of the team with the exception of aussie to select his own weapon lieutenant johnny lee the multilinguist gomez and eddie mervyn liked the heckler koch mp navy version with its closed bolt action unlike its open bolt cousin that begins firing when the bolt is triggered forward the navy version fires with the bolt already forward reducing any aimaltering shoulder bump and while weighing only pounds it has an effective kill range of feet firing mm ammo it was left to aussie lewis at the generals request to tote a standard heckler koch g assault rifle fitted with an underbarrel launcher that could fire up to ten mm grenades a minute to a distance of approximately yards the eighth member of the team tony ruth an exranger who had stayed in the kind of top physical condition freeman always demanded of his team members came along at aussies invitation tony ruth had met aussie lewis in iraq in karbala his favorite weapon was an italian franchi eightround spas sporting purpose automatic shotgun no tony ruth had told the other members of the specwar squad and anyone who ever challenged him and a lot of people had he wasnt any relation to babe ruth yes he had played in the minors and worked one game in the majors then iraq came a year before his retirement yes he sure did intend to go back to north carolina and play ball but the example of pat tillman the twentysevenyearold offensive lineman for the arizona cardinals who had walked away from a million threeyear contract in the nfl because he believed it was time to serve his country and who was killed in action in a blueonblue in afghanistan in june had had a great influence on tony ruth as it had on a lot of other americans and hed met douglas freeman through aussie not long after the specwar team lost a member on a specwar op off the hermit kingdomthe north korean coast hey tony aussie called out pointing to the franchi shotgun why not haul a mossberg instead of taking that old italian job holds nine rounds instead of eight you never know when that extra cartridge yeah riposted tony but if youve already had to fire eight rounds of buckshot or doorbashing slugs youre in so much trouble you dont need an extra round you need a medic fast ahha said salvini hes got you there aussie oh shut your face wop id still bet on a mossberg youd bet on anything said sal sals right choir williams told tony ruth last mission we were on aussie was sound asleep aboard the transport until he heard someone mention a bet that is correct chimed in freeman always happy to see such good morale en route to a mission that his gut instinct told him would stress the nerves and physical fitness of his seven fellow commandos to the max aussie could hear the word bet freeman said even if it was whispered at a rock concert i dont go to rock concerts said aussie sniffing im more cultured than you bastards oh said sal how about that cultural movie we saw the other night that blonde with the big a question of good photography said aussie affecting a highminded dismissive air it wasnt the young ladys cleavage that interested me it was the interpretive angle of the shot and the ah subtle arrangement of her wardrobe i was viewing what are you talking about said salvini she was naked nevertheless aussie began then paused oh you peasants wouldnt understand oh joshed ruth well tell me professor what would your wife say if shed seen you viewing well aussie answered slowly i think mr ruth that she would cut me off for a month everyone laughed though freemans mirth was restrained by recalling how he might still be in the proverbial doghouse for having to leave his wife so abruptly on the mission especially so soon after their donnybrook visàvis marte price as the general reached forward to pat prince once more he felt the oneshot pen in his pocket this time it wasnt loaded with a rubber stun bullet but a lethal round he hoped that all the other equipment in the teams goodies packs provided by darpa and the other offtheshelf wares of war would be as efficient two minutes announced the chinooks loadmaster as the amber light began flashing brace and each of the eight commandos readied themselves for a hard landing choir held prince to his chest the dog now strapped into his velcrohitched hagvar vest happily licking choirs face as the chinooks rear wheels touched down in what sounded like a hailstorm as gravel and sand kicked up by the rotors fierce downdraft struck the chinooks fuselage within a minute every man with his pack and prince were on the hard ground of the darpa base and freeman was being greeted by a somberlooking sheriff from sandpoint the wilderness resort area of about five thousand souls at the top of the lake twentyseven miles north of the naval research station bad business said the sheriff glumly it is said freeman first thing i need to do is talk to the staff here at darpa away from the exhaust and dust the general could breathe more deeply taking in the damp coolness of the mountain lake prince had already been doing this his tongue lolling expectantly a distinct smile on his face he loved tracking though at the moment all he could smell was baking soda the result of a standing order from freeman for his men to eschew any deodorant to combat the sweating in armpit and groin the soda unlike deodorants including those that commercials boasted were unscented was neutral and would help absorb the smell of their perspiration we threw up roadblocks the sheriff assured him all around the area north south and west of the research station and we sent boats across to the eastern side of the lake all sides covered but there was nothing highway patrols were alerted on the washington state montana and british columbia borders so they didnt get out that way but they had mountain bikes you know he pointed to where his deputy had found the mountain bike tracks up beyond the high hurricanestrength fence but they left them behind which way do you think theyre headed sheriff your best guess id say north canada yep so would i said freeman the general paused looking out across the metallic gray lake under the gathering gray stratus everyones expecting them to be hightailing it in cars or a plane how about that sheriff a plane general we shut down everything no planes out from sandpoint except for an emergency airlift of a hiker to spokane he broke his leg on one of the islands in priest lake farther north of here had to bring a float plane for him but hes a local i know him sides i doublechecked only the pilot and him aboard locals know em both freeman slapped the sheriff on the back by way of appreciation youve done good work sheriff itll go in my report the sheriff nodded appreciatively then added grimly ten people murdered in cold blood like a family ten queried the general i was told there were eleven no seemed so at first but one of em roberta juarez a technician survived massive head injuries but shes holding on with a head injury like that they no doubt figured she was dead i need to see her said the general well first the sheriff told him youll need to talk to grierson the local md hes a tough nut says we cant talk to her for days maybe weeks even choir freeman told the welshborn american take prince over to where the paratrooper bikes were abandoned after the raid should be good scent there he suddenly turned back to the sheriff you didnt let anyone near the bikes did you no sir yellowtaped the area and ive had a deputy there since good man freeman entertained the possibility of the terrorists backpacking out next he called johnny lee over sheriff says theres a patient roberta juarez freeman paused and looked back at the sheriff i take it shes spanishamerican or is that her husbands shes mexican right said freeman and turned to lee you come with me johnny were going for another helo ride quick trip up to sandpoint ten minutes and well be there lets go as he strode toward the chopper he told aussie lewis salvini gomez eddie mervyn and tony ruth to take a break while choir and prince were checking out the abandoned mountain bikes that had so successfully been used as props in the terrorists attack chapter six freeman and lee moved quickly away from the choppers downdraft and the exhaust fumes that were polluting the pristine mountain air into the thick antiseptic air of sandpoint hospital their vibram boots squeaking sharply on the polished linoleum floor through the glass of the intensive care unit freeman could see thirtythreeyearold roberta juarez lying in a bed her head in a shroud of bandages only her left eye her lips and nostrils were visible giving her an unfortunately ghoulish appearance an impression reinforced by the fact that her badly bruised right arm was attached to an intravenous drip it was obvious to freeman from his side on view of her neck that robertas hair had been shorn off in the trauma unit her left hand was in a cast the doctor explained because when shed been shot her left hand and arm must have taken the brunt of the fall she conscious asked freeman in and out replied the young casually dressed doctor who except for his stethoscope could have passed for a golfer about to go practice his putting through the window at the end of the corridor freeman glimpsed a menacingly overcast sky he flexed his wrist and glanced at his watch so that the young doctor would get the message that there was no time to lose if it started to rain it would wash away the marauders scent there were other ways of course to track them broken twigs and brush but the best would be for prince to get the scent from the abandoned bikes and go from there since freemans call to eleanor prenty the word had gone out to the department of homeland security fbi and the bureau of land management in northern idaho to give all assistance possible to general freemans team doctor i need to speak with ms juarez as soon as possible find out if she can tell us anything that might no way said the athleticlooking doctor planting himself imperiously in front of the door this patient is in critical condition and i johnny the general told his specfor translator give me a strip lee whipped out a plastic cuff strip from one of his battle dress uniforms many pockets what the hell began the doctor his face flushed with shock and anger nurse freemans face was an inch from the young physicians listen grierson im on the trail of terrorists who murdered i say again murderedten americans because they wanted something thats so classified that i dont even know what it is yet but i do know one thing and that is that roberta juarez is probably the only person still alive who saw the killers anything anything she can tell me could be vital not only to my finding those sons of bitches but to the security of the united states now step aside or ill arrest you under the patriot act section bdirectly or indirectly giving aid and comfort to the enemy this is outrageous said grierson im not moving nurse freeman felled him with one blow cuff him johnny the general stepped over the physician who was gasping for air like a landed fish and opened the door to intensive care roberta was moving her head slightly from side to side moaning perhaps the kerfuffle the general thought with young dr grierson had brought her around or had disturbed her somnolence sufficiently that she might hear him he identified himself gently but firmly not knowing whether she was hearing him had she seen anything that might help them identify the killers no answer no response at all he pressed the question respectfully but insistently the men who attacked you ms juarez freeman could hear the doctor swearing johnny lee had him cuffed to a hallway chair and told him that if he didnt want to be thumped again hed better be quiet a nurse saw them advanced stopped then turned and ran back to her station to call security all roberta could say her voice cracked and dry was its spotted her dark eyes closed she seemed to be asleep freeman stayed for a moment gently taking her warm flaccid wrist and prayed for her and if it be gods will help to catch those who had perpetrated the massacre when he emerged from the ic unit security a short overweight woman perspiring heavily was warning johnny lee that shed called the sheriff you can come with us maam johnny lee told her as the general emerged from the icu well take you to him lee uncuffed the doctor who was now vigorously massaging his wrists youre fucking fascists the doctor shouted at both men the security woman was standing by openmouthed get anything johnny asked the general on their way out its spotted freeman told him thats all she said one of the terrorists faces maybe johnny ventured spotted with psoriasis hmm its possible you fucking fascists when they returned from the far end of the lake below bayview to the darpa base the sheriff had mustered the day staff together seven scientists and their seven technicians who worked on the darpa flowinflight project he was told that there were more scientific personnel involved in ard acoustic research development as it related to submarines but the people freeman was interested in were those who had been working on the latest deepwatermoored darpa alpha barge and the hut where the terrorists had shot the night staff they had been added to the acoustic research development complex here only in the years since when more research money had been freed for homelanddefenseassociated projects the money became a flood following the terrorist attacks in which shoulderfired antiaircraft rockets had brought down three american aircraft since sorry for your loss douglas freeman told the visibly shaken chief scientist a professor richard moffat head of the fourteenperson day shift but i need to know precisely what these scumbags stole a disk said moffat a man around freemans age though most of the day staff were dressed casually in jeans like the doctor at the hospital here in the open they were all wearing either heavy sweaters or goretex windbreakers the temperature having plummeted in the confluency of the pacific ocean front that had come barreling in from the northwest slamming into a warmer chinook wind driving northward into the alberta badlands it was getting cold moffat was the only one wearing a white lab coat stained it seemed to freeman with rust and grease probably from working near the gantry and cranes of a second greenandwhitestriped darpa alpha barge where the staff had to haul in new largescale test units from the deep glaciercarved lake i know its a disk freeman told moffat but is there anything more specific than flowinflight written on it moffat was finding it difficult to focus acutely aware that his laissezfaire attitude toward the security of his fellow scientists had been a disastrous mistake professor repeated freeman impatiently is the disk labeled in any other way moffat was staring across the lake at the coldlooking mountains freeman knew that his specwar team had probably a half hour of reasonable weather before the churning gray clouds gave way to rain professor i know its tough on you at the moment but times of the essence here what oh sorry general the disk was simply labeled darpa alpha flowinflight what kind of data were on the disk moffat had the zombie look of someone in shock thats highly sensitive material general freeman shook his head in disbelief murphys law was on the loose hadnt eleanor prenty gotten through to moffat and cleared the general of any dsr document search restriction or perhaps eleanor had gotten through but moffat couldnt remember in the state he was in all right now listen to me professor i want you to focus your highly sensitive material has been stolen by terrorists and my team is going to have to know exactly what to look for for a moment the chief scientist stared at freeman as if he had no idea who the general was we need to focus freeman reiterated the professors eyes shifted from freeman again out to the slate gray waters of the lake its a lot of diagrams and formulas like so much technical literature i dont see how anyone without a degree in doc cut in freeman ive been sent by the president yes he paused ive been told that so whats on the fucking disk is there a diagram something we can key onto should we see it moffat thought for a moment doreen he called out and a thin woman in her twenties chestnut curls wreathing her face walked over from the gaggle of darpa alpha scientists who were talking to the fbi and dhs agents moffat introduced her as dr wyman and told her what the general wanted assuring her that freeman was cleared to the max well she told the general weve been recording data from trials of a supercavitating that is superspinning torpedo these super torpedoes were originally pioneered by the russians one of them a shkval class could run at two hundred miles an hour and was aboard the russian kursk freeman told her he remembered the kursk an oscar ii class sub that sank in the barents sea in the summer of it was because of the presence of this superspin torpedo on board doreen explained that the russians refused offers of help from other countries to rescue the kursk they were afraid that either we or the brits would get our hands on the technology doreen paused glancing about to make sure that no dhs or fbi agents could overhear our intelligence community got it anyway she told freeman and weve solved problems the russians couldnt because since russia went bellyup weve outpaced anything the russians had weve gotten up to supercavitation at a mile a second freeman was impressed but moffats downcast look was that of a man who knew his career was over unless his scientific brilliance could trump his appalling failure in security he stared out at the lake again as doreen asked him whether she could tell freeman about the torshell yes said moffat softly quietly her face strained because even with her bosss permission she was still reluctant to explain the enormity of what america had lost doreen explained the secret a torshell she told him is a supercavitating that is superspinning fiftycaliber torpedoshaped rifle round that weve developed from our research on the supercavitating torpedoes weve drilled a wirethin hole through the bullet think of the thin wire in one of those bag ties you pick up at the grocery store to twistlock a plastic bag of vegetables or bread rolls stuff like that will this take long the general asked glancing up at an increasingly morose sky and flicking up the leather cover of his watch no doreen said it wont take long but you need to understand how its very new this technology revolutionary in fact go on said freeman trying to contain the legendary impatience that had ironically also led to some of his greatest military breakthroughs well as i said because of the research here weve been able to apply supercavitating superspinning technology to what has been the usual fiftycaliber ammunition rounds what weve done is drill into a tungstencore bullet a nanothin lining of incendiary chemicals the bullet as in the case of the much larger torpedo cavitates or spins at super speed because a gas shoots out in front as the chemical inside morphs from a solid to a gas because of the heat from the torpedos or in this case the bullets propellant this jet of gas shooting out the front forms a protective bubble around the bullet in air or in water in the case of the torpedo and so the bullet or torpedo has next to no resistance freeman had understood five minutes ago youve developed a superfast bullet faster said doreen than anything ever produced except of course the speed of light how fast well the russians with their shkval torpedo have reached two hundred miles per hour in water slow compared to what weve been able to do its largely a matter of who has the best computergoverned lathes the tolerances are incredibly small so asked the general what speed has darpa alpha been able to reach nuwac doreen told him our naval underseas warfare center has already broken the sound barrier with a torpedo at darpa alpha added moffat in a voice so lifeless he might as well have been doing nothing more than giving freeman the time of day weve developed a projectile a bullet if you like thats reached mach son of exclaimed the general youve got my attention thats more than eleven thousand feet a second moffat continued in his monotone faster than anything in the history of warfare inside the usual cupronickel doreen wyman added referring to a normal rounds coppernickel jacket the bullet would melt and break up even with the gas bubble reducing most of the drag but in conjunction with nuwac weve developed a metalcarbon resin jacket that will remain intact until point of impact freeman instantly recognized the enormous implications how such a round developed by darpa alpha in this long landlocked lake more than a thousand feet deep would change warfare forever they were at a turning point at mach such a round could penetrate a tank the bullets superheated molten jet raising the temperature so high inside the tank it would explode how long would it take asked freeman to manufacture this supersonic round hypersonic moffat corrected him mach to mach is supersonic were talking hypersonic general all right how long would it take to lathe a hypersonic prototype of one of these rounds doreen wyman freeman could see was going to take the fifth on this one professor moffat freeman pressed how long a week if you had the right stateoftheart computercontrolled lathes et cetera and the disk yes admitted moffat sheepishly looking out at the slate gray water again do you agree freeman asked doreen wyman that they could have prototypes in a week from the time they get the disk yes a week it was time to move out prince had gotten a good scent from the abandoned bikes and had led the team to a large jetty farther down from the darpa alpha shore from where it was assumed the terrorists had escaped by boat but which way the lake was twentyfive miles long and five miles wide freeman stuck with his and the sheriffs canadabound idea with all road and air corridors closed there simply werent that many ways out and canada sixtyfour miles to the north beyond lake pend oreille and priest lake seemed not only the best escape route because the rugged heavily forested terrain would provide great cover but because there was always the added enticement of canadas long undefined border and the fact that canada simply didnt have the manpower to field effective patrols the sheriff overwhelmed by the catastrophe walked forlornly down to the jetty any leads at all asked freeman nothing very concrete replied the sheriff dr moffat has asked the navy to send up one of their hawkeye aircraft to help you with communications in this area and an fbi guy told me a bloodsoaked note was found in one of the victims hands a note mused aussie whatd it say hard to tell the sheriff replied one of the dhs guys told me all they could make out was a few letters looked like ram and scarund whatever the hell that means he spelled it out for them and aussie wrote it down ram computer capacity random access memory ventured freeman or peoples names suggested johnny lee perhaps said freeman recalling his visit to roberta juarez at the hospital the words have something to do with roberta saying it was spotted no one could see any connection whatsoever all right said the general no leads but princes nose at the moment we have to assume the terrorists have had ample time to reach the northern end of pend oreille where theyd have to leave their boat and hoof it up to priest lake and if the bastards know what theyre doing which it seems they do theyll be avoiding any known back roads because the sheriffs boys are out in full force so lets see if prince here can regain the scent up at the north end of pend oreille the general knelt down the team doing likewise prince sitting as if waiting for his best in show ribbon dear lord began freeman we praise you we thank you for this world and we here ask that you watch over us guide us so that we may do your will in the battle against evil amen they said in unison and a group of dhs and fbi agents looked variously astonished embarrassed and humbled prince panted in anticipation of the hunt the general aussie sal choir ruth lee gomez and mervyn grabbed their weapons and molles and boarded the chinook already freeman could see the hawkeye that moffat had requested if the terrorists with their head start reached priest lake fortysix miles north of darpa alpha following the general direction of secondary logging roads through the deep forest they would have a straight twentyfivemile southtonorth run up the full length of priest where they could then pass through a twoandahalfmilewide connecting channel to another threemile stretch of water had they planted a boat the map showed that along the edge of priest lakes primeval forest there was a smattering of momandpoptype cottages and a tiny marina but not much else aussie lewis seat harness on using his molle as a footrest wondered aloud and loudly hope were not heading in the wrong fucking direction it was unlike aussie to start the game with a pessimistic prognosis and the general wanted to counter it immediately for most of the team aussies question was nothing more than that but freeman knowing tony ruth was a relative newcomer to the team wanted to stanch any possible pessimism sometimes he shouted to aussie over the noise of the chinooks rotor slap the most obvious route is the correct one the scumbags who stole that diskll be in a hurry to get that information back to their masters in the mideast chechnya wherever they dont have to do it in person said johnny lee how about them using a landline with a computer and modem they could set up and transmit the disks contents from anywhere they like the general shook his head and prince looked concerned sheriff and dhs have all the landlines public phone booths et cetera covered answered freeman besides now the storys out the terrorists are going to know that anyone seen using public landlines with a modem and the like is acting suspiciously and should be reported anyway nsa is going to be picking up all private transmissions how about satellite phone asked eddie mervyn too insecure freeman replied nsad be all over it like the measles no the scumbags are heading for the canadian border i know it in my gut somewhere along the line where theres minimal surveillance manpower problems canadas a huge country bigger than the us and the whole countrys population is only equivalent to californias its as if every other state in the union were empty the general grabbed prince affectionately by the ears and spoke to him as if the dog understood every word prince you tell aussie here that you and i know right we just feel it in our bones dont we boy those bastards are headed for british columbia and weve got to get them before they reach it course you and i know by now theyre no doubt in civilian garb probably look like a bunch of greenpeacers out to see the flora and fauna they better watch out said sal as prince sitting up close to choir looked on otherwise a grizzlyll bite them on the ass you be careful joshed aussie otherwise general it was the chinooks loadmaster sergeant radio call for you from a richard moffat for a second freeman was wearing what aussie had long ago dubbed his patton frown he took the phone cupping the mouthpiece richard who chief scientist choir reminded him richard moffat hello doctor freeman here general we think we might have an answer for you regarding dr juarezs its spotted comment oh yes answered freeman first i should tell you roberta juarez didnt survive oh shit princes head shot up worried by the generals sharp tone im sorry to hear that freeman told him thank you general moffat acknowledged anyway continued moffat about her its spotted comment apparently for security reasons only one person who i found out was off sick today knew about an arrangement that was insisted upon by the chief of naval operations yes said freeman fighting the temptation to say that it was a damned pity that the cno or somebody else hadnt paid more attention to damned perimeter security in the first place well continued moffat the arrangement which was deliberately withheld from darpa directors as an added security measure should a director ever be taken hostage and interrogated under duress was that two scientists here at darpa alpha one on the day shift one on the night the night shift person being roberta had agreed to spot the disk yes well what was meant by spotting was that at the end of their respective shifts these two people would take the disk and im talking here about a threeandahalfinch floppy faster than a cdrom but larger than a usb memory device and for security theyd place a very small circular nde nondataerasing battery within the reverse hollow side of the metal hub so that so it would transmit a tracking signal freeman said excitedly anticipating moffat in case it was stolen yes normally the disks battery has a tensecond delay so it wont be activated while the disk is put in its jewel case at the end of the day i get it said freeman but if somebody steals it without its jewel case its battery would be activated a beeper correct ive passed this on to pacific coast command and the ec hawkeye out of whidbey naval station its festooned with electronic eyes and ears and its going to patch you into its radio net as soon as it picks up any signal from the disk brilliant said the general using the declarative adjective hed picked up from his sojourns with britains sas regiment absolutely brilliant ah general there are a couple of other things you ought to know about shoot dr grierson the physician yes said freeman mr cool the doctor who was looking after roberta yes ah well the words out that he and the hospital are suing you as being complicit in ah robertas death i thought you ought to fuck im said freeman his face reddening the phone in one hand the other holding a grab bar against the turbulence they were encountering fuck im but thanks for giving me the headsup doc youre welcome that prick physician freeman told johnny lee who i had you arrest at the hospital hes suing me poor womans dead and hes got a lawyer on my case ah said aussie disgustedly these guysve got attorneys comin out their ass prince was worried backing up against the teams two zodiacs as if looking for protection choir reassured him that the generals anger had nothing to do with him but freeman announced good news that disk the pricks stole has a beeper cut in aussie youve been listening in on my phone conversations charged freeman with mock severity i have everyone laughed i ought to have you arrested general freeman it was the helo pilots voice were descending to the priest lake turnoff hold on cut in freeman dont land here ive just heard from moffat that the terrorists are carrying a beeper so i want to contact the hawkeye to see whether they can get a fix on the bastards roger answered the chinooks pilot well take you back upstairs for a while the general allowing for murphys law expected it to take much longer than it did to contact the hawkeye but in fact they were exchanging info within five minutes one of the electronic warfare officers aboard the hawkeye was seeing a dot pulsing on his screen with the urgency of a boil about to burst the ewo one of the moles aboard the essentially windowless aircraft sat beneath the rotating spiralpainted rotodome he routed his call through the box and the binary codes of zeroes and ones sorted themselves out into a military frequency that could be heard on freemans modular infantry radio informing the general that the ec hawkeye was picking up a clearly identifiable beep from priest lake to underscore the sound the electronic warfare officer brought the beep sound on line so that all the team members could hear it via their mirs earpiece the hawkeye informed freeman that the plane would loiter on station to provide gpsassisted intel thank you lieutenant freeman told the ewo but i urge you to stay beyond manpad range appreciate your advice general but i hardly think the terrorists would bother adding shoulderfired rockets to their load the general signed off and wasted no time informing his pilot that the chinooks new landing zone would have to be as close as possible to the beep point the hawkeye was reporting the signal put their prey two miles west of an island in the southwest corner of priest lake the island itself was about a mile offshore i love that fucking beeper said aussie the fuckers are hoist by their own petard whats a petard inquired salvini who was tightening the webbing that held the helos two zodiacs firmly against the bulkhead johnny called out aussie as he busied himself checking out his hk g assault rifles underbarrel grenade tube the grenades festooned about him youre our linguist tell this ignorant savage from brooklyn what a friggin petard is i dont know said johnny lee the skin over his high cheekbones tightening with concern for all his knowledge of asian mideastern slavic and romance languages he didnt know what a petard was its an explosive device freeman explained formerly used to bust through walls to be hoist by your own petard means you screw up your own plans by your own actions what aussie means is that the very thing those scumbags stole is giving them away he allowed himself a smile despite the serious business they were embarked on serves the bastards right said tony ruth with grunts of approval from gomez and eddie mervyn who were tightening the slings on their navy rig heckler koch submachine guns and said choir if those swine havent picked up the hawkeyes transmit to us they wont know itll be one big surprise when we suddenly appear on top of em he turned to his beloved spaniel that right boy princes tail was wagging affectionately as choir adjusted the velcro tabs on the dogs hagvar bulletproof antishrapnel vest prince had easily passed the long hard training for a tracker at lackland air force base in san antonio texas but he had never liked the vest for while it protected his body in the area between his head and hindquarters it was heavy dont lets get ahead of ourselves freeman cautioned choir these swine are clever dicks otherwise they wouldnt have been able to pull off this attack theyve obviously been planning for it for a long time i checked with the fbi and dhs guys and they say that tenth mountain division has had no reports of theft visàvis their paratrooper mountain bikes or uniforms that tells me added freeman his voice rising above the noise of the chinook that these terrorists planned their op down to the last detail he paused holding his left hand up for silence his right hand gripping the roll bar as he listened to the beeper damn it had ceased which told him that his quarry might be in a dead zone physical barriers blocking transmission or maybe the terrorists know theyve got a beeper cut in johnny lee well said freeman the best we can do is keep our eyes and ears open his left hand indicated the southwest quadrant of his navigational pilotage chart well land here two miles west of this island the last reported beeper contact well move in the bush along the west side of this old logging road that runs southnorth parallel to the lake well follow prince and our own noses but and i cant stress this too much there are isolated cabins not many but some with a boat launch for hunters and fishermen so remember even if we get a beep right on top of one of them identify before engaging these scumbags twelve of em by the bicycle count may have commandeered a civilian vehicle to save travel time between pend oreille and priest lake for them therell be no need to worry about identifying friend or foe everyone is now their foe so theyll be quick on the trigger ill try to stay in contact with the hawkeye and in whisper contact with you via your mirs the general paused questions we have any idea what they look like asked salvini they could still be in us battle dress they could the general agreed but my guess sal is that theyve gone civilian the media will have the story out by now or at least their version of it reporters can be sat on for a day maybe but theres no way that the murder of ten american scientists and a security guard in a small community can be hushed up for much longer so sal my answer has to be that the creeps could still be in our battle dress uniform or hunting gear but not many hunters use automatic weapons which i presume theyre carrying true said aussie though i know some socalled sportsmen who hunt deer with aks and ms he shook his head in disgust during the remainder of the flight freeman and his team did a quick study of the list of cabins and of ten people who the sheriff had told him had fled civilization to live yearround by the now stormcaged lake jake mccairn sixtyfive had a bad back from too much stress he thought and had retreated from the world into his wild primeval domain he enjoyed not having to shave or wear his dentures he liked animals more than people and when he saw this army guy coming out of the forest at the edge of the lake and calling out mornin jake ignored him and continued checking the floatlines hed set for rainbow and dolly varden trout you jake eh jake checked another of the lines nothing youre jake mccairn right what of it signs on the way up from sandpoint on pend oreille say youve got a boat for rent sometimes why my names ramon my squad and i need a boat to go up the lake for a while shouldve brought your own boat what dya expect big marinas with neons flashing we had a boat a zodiac but it got ripped up by a bear or something up jake mccairn emitted a guttural cough that was a standin for a laugh it could be heard by ramons men thirty feet away in the woods fronting the lake low nimbostratus was coming lower gray mist leaking from it and wreathing the lake in banks of bonechilling fog so said ramon producing a wad of fiftydollar bills could you let us use your boat for a bit nope going out to the island soon gonna get me a wolf skin with that jake turned his back on the stranger and went back to his line casts jake heard ramons footfall behind him and turned to see about ten or twelve men approaching him from the marshy edge of the lake and heard the unmistakable sound of an approaching helicopter he looked up could see nothing but gray cloud no more than five hundred feet above a gray sheen on the lake a sign that the sun still existed and was trying to get through here and there ramon grabbed him in a hammerlock and now the other men were running across the marshy margin between the woods and lakeshore mccairn protesting violently until one of the men punched him so hard mccairn could hear his jawbone crack now asked ramon dark brown eyes appearing almost black in the weak daylight wheres your fucking boat before we break your jake tried to spit at them but only bloody dribble came out running down onto his beardstubbled chin break his leg ordered ramon glancing anxiously at the leaden sky for the helo jake attempted to speak but couldnt the pain of his broken jaw so intense it came out as boasup bou three hundred yar get him to his feet ramon ordered rashid naam speak english ramon snapped you and omar deal with the helo if it looks like its going to land yes captain cmon ramon told jake jabbing him hard with a heckler koch mm sidearm take us to the boat and fast or we will break your leg he jabbed the old man again think im kidding mr mccairn jake stumbled along through the reeds and fistsized rocks and in his hurting fury managed to ask you mericans the soldier ignored him when they found the boat two of ramons men brought the outboard from their torn zodiac then they cut his throat they started the outboard a gray wolf howled and ramon realized that the dead mans boat could carry only six men there was no argument as to who would go and who would stay behind ramons commandos from gupix the government of palestine in exile as they called it always knew that such difficult tactical situations might arise the four of them including the two american citizens from one of the vehement antifederalist idaho militias who had helped them in their mission against the us government had trained long and hard and each man understood what he might be called upon to do in order that those with the disk could escape and so morale remained high as ramon told five of his men that he would go with them and the disk in the boat while the other six men would stay behind the sound of the helicopter had now shifted from being eastward near montana back toward them in the thick soup of nimbostratus ramon took comfort in the knowledge of how stressed the pilots must be it would be tough enough on a clear day flying in the tight airspace in the mist and cloudshrouded amphitheater of the rocky mountains and surrounding hills but this must be a nightmare it was nothing like the iraqi desert ramon mused and he was struck by the sweet irony that in iraq in the desert the terrain had favored the infidels infiltration whereas here americas rugged terrain helped by inhibiting a helos maneuvers son of a bitch shouted tony ruth who struck by the loudness of the strong resurrected beep being amplified over the chinooks internal bay speaker declared we must be on top of the mothers we are confirmed the loadmaster gonna be tricky opined aussie looking down at the wide marshy margin between the lake proper and the edge of the woods thats what we do riposted freeman we do tricky he glanced down at prince who was panting sensing the excitement and hearing the soft stream of defensive flares that the chinook was dropping prior to landing that right prince said freeman we do tricky right princes tail was thumping a bulkhead when we land began freeman i want every he glimpsed a bluish tail of exhaust at the edge of the woods missile yelled the pilot they felt the helo jink sharply right then the explosion was earsplitting and for several moments neither the general nor the rest of the team who were slammed hard against the fuselage in their hstraps could hear anything then the high whine of the rear rotors portside engine took over the world screaming as it fought to compensate for the loss of power from the knockedout starboard engine going down yelled the loadmaster nothing sounded or smelled right anymore the usually loud but reassuring sounds and odors of a chinook in steady flight now replaced by decidedly outofwhack noises and the nauseating smell of leaking hydraulics as pilot and copilot fought to get the machine under control flares still popping through gray stratus and mist for a moment the big helo rose promisingly against a violent wind shear but then they began to plummet hard landing shouted the loadmaster and choir holding the spaniel close to him could hear prince whine they were out of the gray world the metallic sheen of the lake sliding downhill the helos nose rattling like crazy and rising insanely the forward rotor spinning the rear blades slowing arthritically before stopping altogether fuselage gyrating in the pilots unequal battle with gravity then they saw a long streak of dark woods west of them along the shoreline now seeming to run uphill an eagle was glimpsed then a darker softer green than the woods was racing up at them getting bigger then whump walls of reedscummy water erupted all around and a sound like hail as a downpour of dead stalks and other lakeside detritus struck the chinooks skin they had come down about a quarter mile from the shore in five feet of water marsh to the left open lake to their right young prince was whimpering like a puppy but no one said a word every one of the eightman team had braced for a tailbonesmashing crash but the water and marshy margin of the lake here on the southwestern end afforded them if not a soft landing then at least a less violent one than they had any right to expect tony ruth looked the most shaken princes bright and alarmed eyes were looking up at choir for reassurance the pilot and copilot were shouting to each other above the noise as they shut down all ancillary systems that could quickly catch fire if the gas tanks had been perforated in addition there were still some of the supposedly antimissile flares aboard and they too posed a fire hazard what happened with those damned flares freeman demanded the pilot and copilot glared at the general they had managed against extraordinary odds to bring the chinook to a crash landing in marshland about fifty yards east of the dark line of thick woods no one seemed badly hurt and what was freeman saying not thank you boys but what happened to the fucking flares how do we know said the helo captain theyre supposed to sucker missiles into thinking theyre our exhaust but something went wrong sure as hell wasnt our flying sir sorry gentlemen you did a great job but we all nearly bought it because captain cut in the copilot were still getting the radio signal from that beeper its up ahead of us about three clicks on the lake theyre definitely on the water general you hear that guys freeman shouted to the team who had already dislodged the two sixman zodiacs from the webbing and were ready to slide them down the reardoor ramp out to the marsh from which cold mist was blowing into the helo like smoke their beeper puts them about three clicks from here on the lake so lets rounds were thudding into the side of the helo and through the open ramp door aussie could see winks of light coming from the woods about two hundred yards from their position damn said freeman they must have split up we cant use the zodiacs on the lake theyll pick us off like flies captain he enjoined the chopper pilot can you stay here and give us their bearing for as long as possible will do good man aussie you and sal have got the longestrange weapons stay with the two pilots hunker down return fire were going to have to wade through the marsh to the shoreline get through the woods to that road and hit those bastards from the rear no other way ill radio for reinforcements said the pilot if the helos box is still working good said freeman who then ordered everyone to lighten their packs the copilot informed him that while the radar was still functional the choppers radio was out the best the pilots could do was keep aussie and sal informed of the getaway boats position so that as well as being able to return fire with their longerrange weapons the specfor commandos could notify the rest of freemans team via their mir headsets good enough said freeman so aussie you and sal are cnn roger that confirmed sal the volume of incoming fire zipping above their heads and tearing into the fuselage was increasing and despite his enthusiasm freeman realized that there was no way he could have his team wade through the marsh and expect any of them to be alive by the time they reached the shore let alone the edge of the woods well use the zodiacs after all he told them aussie you and sal get ready to throw everything you can at that bunch in the woods the rest of usll drive the zodiacs across the marsh toward the line of woods reedsll screw up the outboards props but they should get us there the reeds freeman hoped would also dampen the outboards noise the general shifted his ak to his left hand and grabbed hold of the zodiacs pull cord as choir with prince at his side came over the gunwale ruth johnny lee gomez and eddie mervyn were already in the second zodiac the best they could hope for was to use the body of the helo for cover keeping it between them and the enemys position as they headed for shore aussie reached for his g and sal positioned his heavyhitting machine gun with his sling go yelled the general aussie and sal opened up aiming at the winks of the enemys smallarms fire coming from about two hundred yards away to the northwest the hot gases from aussie and sals weapons bending the reeds close to the helo the two zodiacs on full power speeding across the fifty yards of thighdeep marsh between the downed chopper and the line of pine fir and goldenyellow larch aussie and sals fire was not only loud but accurate and in the melee of return fire aussies fritz was almost knocked off by a ricochet caught in the helos rotor he and sal heard a cry as one of the enemy winks was suddenly eclipsed aussie and sals enfilade wasnt the wild sweeping cover fire seen in movies where it seems the good guys have an endless supply of ammunition instead it was concentrated wellaimed fire not meant to simply keep the enemys heads down but to take them out by the time the opposition aussie and sal guesstimated there must be a group of five or six of them had taken cover from the two specfors ontarget fire zodiacs and were in thick reeds only ten yards from the woods freeman the other five men and prince were ashore but by now the terrorists had recovered from the surprise of sals and aussies heavy and accurate bursts of fire and raked the zodiacs putting both out of action prince was growling freeman could see the boat first detected on the helos radar disappearing from view about two to three miles up the lake close in to the northwestern shore and he knew that with the sound of the crash even the relatively few people who had cabins near or around the lake would raise an alarm which he hoped would bring police reinforcements and local reservists from sandpoint but the town was fifty miles away by road and by the time any reinforcements might arrive the terrorists in the boat would have gotten beyond the lake proper and entered the twoandahalfmilelong channel that would take them into priest lake all of which rapidly brought freeman to the conclusion that there was only one thing to do his sixman squad would have to do a marathon minimalration ammunition pack forty pounds to a man along the lone fifteenmile section of the secondary road an old logging trail that ran more or less parallel to the lake at a distance of a quarter of a mile in places four miles in others from the water there was no chance that he and his five could outrun the terrorists fleeing in a boat but he might be able to reach another boat or vehicle to catch up with them or head them off the general hoped that meantime the hawkeye would be frequency scanning and while he would be unable to make contact with the helo any longer that it would keep him updated via his modular infantry radio freeman had one asset that would save some time prince with the terrorists scent firmly impressed upon his olfactory sense he should be able to help them avoid any timeconsuming deadly ambushes by the five or so rearguard terrorists who had been firing from the edge of the woods at the helo these scumbags would almost certainly cut back through the dense woods and rush to the road then freeman suddenly realized his advantage if he choir ruth gomez johnny lee and eddie mervyn could run to the secondary road a mile and a quarter to the west of where they were at present they might be able to beat these rearguard terrorists who he saw on his tactical map were at the foot of a densely forested slope the terrorists were three miles from the secondary road rather than the one mile his team had to cover before reaching it right said freeman quickly we go fast adding now well see whos been spending too much time with mommy freeman thought of margaret but immediately pushed her out of his mind gomez eddie mervyn and tony ruth exchanged grins the team headed off freeman on point through the thick woods and the ubiquitous salal brush its green mistpolished leaves pushing against them at shoulder height with the same kind of determination it seemed as the plant used whenever it invaded a new area crowding out all other vegetation in its way they were violating the first rule of the special forces be quiet the salal in particular while not prickly had leaves that were rigid enough to resist a mere brushing aside as one could do with sword ferns and the like and the six men and dog created so much noise that it sounded to choir as if a tank was moving through but choir knew that the general knew when to break the rules and besides prince was nearby ready to stop and stiffen at the merest whiff of a terrorists scent then they got a break they had reached a hikers trail presumably one that linked the secondary road and the lakeshore through the forbidding woods a hard pushing slog suddenly became a run and someones camelback was sloshing for which at the appropriate time freeman would ream out the offender in no uncertain terms running it made no difference but if and when they were forced to close on the enemy quickly silently even the greenest cadet knew that the smallest sound could give him away it wasnt the fastest mile in history but for men weighed down with arms ammo and essential war wares it was exemplary in another five minutes they saw the road and slowed senses on high alert they walked quickly quietly now until they could see that the road was clear then split into two teams the general johnny lee and choir with prince leading on the eastern side of the northbound road ruth eddie mervyn and gomez on the opposite western side they were running again resolute in their intention to bypass the terrorist group that had been firing on them and to keep going until they found a cabin or one of the few small marinas scattered around the lakes seventymilelong shoreline with luck they could get either a boat or a vehicle in which to hightail it to the northern end of the lake before the disk party disembarked into the woods and followed one of the creek beds on the twentyto thirtymile hike to the border and the equally wild country of the canadian forests prince panting growled at a rush of sound that suddenly burst from the bush sending all six men to ground until they realized the noise was that of squirrels not men prince stopped to look back at them with what seemed to freeman an expression of mild contempt for their unwarranted belly flops they were running again and from their gpss they knew that soon they would be adjacent to the general area from which the rearguard terrorist squad had been firing chapter seven a world away the white house was learning just how important indeed critical it was to recover the darpa alpha disk the prospect of any country even the triedandtrue allies great britain and australia having possession of americas revolutionary flowinflight technology was as eleanor prenty told the president sending shock waves through the pentagon she placed an byinch scaleddown drawing of the gas in nose cone torpedo before him its downright traumatizing the chief of naval operations it would mean a sub having the ability to fire at an enemy ship two hundred miles away the darpa alpha people say there would be no wake no warning wouldnt the targeted ship hear it posed the president i mean on its sonar at a mile a second it would be like she consulted the notes shed taken from the cno darpa alpha scientists tell us that she had to turn several pages her hand trembling after being on her feet this long and stoked with coffee since the crisis broke she was beyond exhaustion the scientists say that at ten miles for example the sonar noise from the supercavitating torpedo would last no longer than a quick jab on a door buzzer but if you think the cnos in nearcoronary mode you should read the stuff ive been getting from the joint chiefs the army is piss sorry sir i mean the armys pissed that they hadnt heard of darpa alpha until today yes mr president eleanor moved her laptop so he could see the map of washington states kitsap peninsula the army knew about darpas division of naval surface warfare up here at bayview and about the keyport testing lab and torpedo range on the kitsap perimeter but darpa alpha was is completely different in intent and in staffing from the darpa installation we knew back in the president shrugged cant blame them these things have to be run on a strictly needtoknow basis black ops we cant all know what everybody else is doing well the armys particular worry is that they see the supercavitation technology in a smaller bulletsized projectile that could pierce the armor of the abrams m more important it could penetrate the armor of our new lighter faster stryker vehicles which have gained so much favor in the pentagon after the army brass realized just howconstipated is the word general freeman once used the big m is when trying to travel on nonamerican roads the tank weighs in at seventy tons and on any other highway system than our own or on the german autobahns it becomes a dinosaur no matter how well armored and upgunned it is which is why we need to get that disk back and quickly hows freemans team doing fbi says that the sheriff at sandpoint has told them that thereve been reports of a helo going down in the area possibly brought down by a manpad shoulderfired missile but she paused exhausted so much so she asked the president if she might sit for a moment what oh of course but eleanor had no sooner sat her feet resting on the border of the plush round blue oval carpet that bore the great seal of the united states than the president was asking freemans team okay functional yes sir eleanor replied catching her breath the moment the navys hawkeye lost contact with the helo and tracked its down position the local sheriffs and air rescue in coeur dalene were alerted then freemans team came through on their infantry radios freeman says its well in hand and he doesnt want more troops in there confusing the issue says its a case of too many cooks spoil the broth says hes closing in on the beeper via the radar contact the downed helo still has with the beeper that was planted in the disk okay said the president id prefer to send in more men but freemans the man on the ground if he feels hes closing theres no point in us getting in his way the president turned to the large map of the idaho panhandle that had been wheeled into his office i can see freemans point must be some of the densest part of the country up there even so i want the nearest army battalion on standby just in case he needs a lastminute assist thats already been taken care of said eleanor the president turned from the map to her next thing eleanor is for you to be driven home and not come back here for twelve hours thats an order got it yes sir she said gratefully but not without a feeling of guilt that she should stay go on now he ordered scram yes mr president chapter eight everyone on the team choir johnny lee and freeman on the eastern side of the road tony ruth gomez and murphy on the western side saw prince stop short pine cones flying in front of his paws the weight of his armored vest was starting to tell his panting more rapid than it had been when they left the helo but the rest of him was rigid he was pointing they froze freeman knelt on the soft earth and fallen leaves on the roads shoulder and tony ruth could see the generals gloved right hand switch his ak from the off position everybody else had done the same the disquieting noise of their controlled breathing could be heard above the stillness of the forest from which a white mist bled prince was pointing into the woods from the road at a barely discernible opening in the wall of trees and brush only a few yards from the roads shoulder had the terrorists rear guard anticipated his move wondered freeman and also raced through the woods from the lakeside to reach the road both sections of freemans team had automatically adopted caf covering arcs of fire so that they could engage the enemy and guard each other he saw the silhouette of an aks front sight above the trail and fired both of his sections opened up using the falling corpse a us army uniform as their central aiming point the air was ripped apart by the sudden fury of the firefight but it was all oneway the enfilade from freemens men having the crucial advantage anyone behind the first man theyd killed would be unable to get past him easily on the narrow trail and forced to ground amid timber and brush that was now the recipient of concentrated fire mm and mm rounds pouring into the woods in a narrow cone if the screams and arabic curses of the dying were anything to go by all six of the terrorists were either down dead or badly wounded prince growling ferociously at the mere gall of the interlopers johnny tony choir freeman shouted come with me he then told eddie mervyn and gomez to clean up then catch up as he and the other three with prince leading continued their forced march north on the deserted road freeman on point as usual spotted a faint gleam of metal in the woods off to his left it was a downpipe from a creepercovered cabin set well back about a hundred feet in the forest the general led his men in through shoulderhigh salal that formed the perimeter of a small clearing mist enveloping the surrounding timber like malevolent layers of swamp gas a thin lazy plume of smoke issued from the cabins stone chimney a beatup ford explorer its left rear fender badly rusted and strips of duct tape holding in a rectangle of transparent plastic that had replaced the back window stood forlornly a few yards from the rear of the cabin its tires tracks disappearing into the overcast green of salal freeman extracted one of darpas productsor goodies as the special forces called them it was a matchboxsize scannerremotekey that upon activation with one push of a mans thumb scans for the solenoid opening frequency of a vehicle and unlocks it a more civil approach knocking on the cabin door explaining the dire need for the vehicle to catch up with the terrorists to overtake them had occurred to the general but the very thought of the disk being in enemy hands was chilling enough the possibility of americans being attacked by such weapons evicting any idea of social niceties a woman inside the cabin was screaming and a man in a tiedyed nightshirt came running out with a baseball bat stop yelled freeman us army special forces we need your vehicle well pay you compensation give me the keys what the the keys quickly the man dropping the bat ran back into the dimly lit cabin followed by freeman the general watched him go past a potbellied stove to a small table by a creepercovered window here he tossed the suvs keys to freeman thank you sir said freeman as they came out stay inside bad day to be out youre as bad as the guys youre after freeman lobbed the keys to choir and glanced back at the man what other guys guys who done the same as you to mick sutter when the mans sense of outrage was increasing bout twenty minutes ago busted into his shed stole his car tried to call the cops but theyd cut his line smashed his cell too just charged in like you guys if his phones were taken out how come you know about it he walked down the road a ways to a neighbors he called us you have any description freeman asked him adding were on your side huh said the man derisively funny way of showin it but freeman could tell the man believed him they was dressed like you guys battle gear dark eyes micks wife said middle eastern guys like arabs they looked wet like theyd been out on the lake what kind of car did they take asked the general gray old dodge colt license canadian sutters are canadian stay all summer and fall thelma he called back to the woman in the cabin you got that license plate number mick gave you its rcv said the woman timidly emerging from the cabin with a piece of paper her hands shaking pulling jerkily at her bath robe rcv choir backed the explorer out quickly throwing gravel freeman made contact with sal and aussie via their headsets you still have a beep affirmative its coming from whats indicated on the tac nav chart as a campground a new one melson campground near the top of the lake possible theyre changing into civilian there was the crackle of static and then aussie and sal could hear freeman telling them that now that the rearguard action was over they should wait at the helo until further notice the general had no sooner finished talking with aussie and sal than he heard eddie mervyn coming in on his mir line informing him that as suspected all the rearguard terrorists six of them were dead freeman thanked eddie and gomez telling them that he ruth choir and johnny lee were only a quarter mile up the road they had an suv and would pick them up within a few minutes after mervyn and gomez were in the suv the team headed north on the lone road the ford explorer was doing a maximum of thirty miles per hour ruth on the passengerside running board the general on the driversside running board both looking ahead for any sign of an improvised booby trap the explorers defroster was on the fritz so choir had to use his free hand to wipe the condensation from the windshield thirty miles per hour on the straightaway was choirs compromise between getting there quickly but still having time to jam on the brakes should anything suspicious appear on the road that was now funneling into a dark tunnel of trees freeman figured choirs speed was a bit overcautious but one antipersonnel mine on the road could rupture a tire and bring everything to a screeching halt there was no mine but an allbutinvisible cable strung tautly across the road brake yelled ruth choir shouting heads down choirs controlled skid saved the explorer from taking the impact fullon its right side slamming against the cable ruth caught by the cable was lifted up by it his helmet flying off his severed head rolling along the roads shoulder in a flurry of dead leaves his torso gushing blood the noseclogging smell of burnt rubber wafted over the others as the suv stopped everyone in utter shock their obscenities rending the air recovering first douglas freeman said god watch him then put him in the back move as they did so the pungent odor of burnt rubber hung about the vehicle like a funeral pall choir was as white as a sheet it had been ruth yelling brake but it had been choir who made the mistake of swinging the wheel instead of letting the vehicle hit the wire fullon in which case it would likely have twanged over the roof without touching either ruth or freeman freeman ordered choir to get back in and drive again freeman took his position on the driversside running board go to prevent them from hearing the head rolling around johnny lee in the back almost sick to his stomach wrapped it up in a bunch of old clothing the owner had obviously dumped in the backseat and stuffed it into a corner no one spoke save freeman who riding the driversside running board bellowed into the window against the slipstream his eyes on the road all the time stay focused we cant do anything to help ruth now but we can make those bastards pay for every freemans body lurched forward his left wrist jammed against the driversside mirror as choir braked hard a swirl of leaves rising from the roads shoulder under the impact of the skid temporarily blocking freemans view mines screamed choir six of them right said johnny lee yes now freeman saw them six small black objects no more than a hands span wide placed staggered across the road so that it would be impossible for a vehicle to pass without making contact with at least one of them back up he ordered choir till were at least fifty yards away choir had no sooner stopped the explorer than the general regretting that neither sal nor aussies longerrange weapons were at hand ordered gomez and eddie mervyn to concentrate on two targets apiece while he freeman would deal with the remaining two choir turned the suvs engine off the ensuing silence was eerie they could smell the rain in the air an ominous deep green color curdled the sky promising heavy snow to the north along idahos border with bc leaves scuttled across the road with unnerving urgency although superbly trained gomez and eddie mervyn were showing signs of stress mervyn unusually jumpy eddie breathing rapidly still their aim was true and through the roar of the submachine guns freeman could see the targets disintegrating but something was wrong there were no explosions what the began johnny lee all right said the general lets go he told choir to stop momentarily by the targets then quickly stepped down from the driversside running board and retrieved part of what they had thought were mines son of a bitch what is it general pressed choir as prince on high alert cocked his head inquiringly gomez glancing anxiously at his watch figuring that at the speed they were going they were less than six miles from the campground eddie mervyn and johnny lee were watching the road intently through a shower of icecold rain china said the general saucers they put six damn saucers upside down across the road probably got em from the cabin they busted into eddie murphy suggested choir wasnt interested all right so they were cunning but right now hunched tight over the wheel eyes straining the specfor veteran was preoccupied watching the rainslicked road the calf of his right leg a tense bundle of nerves and muscle ready to stab the brake at the first sign of another wire the terrible dull thud and thwack of ruths decapitation burned into his memory forever the general guesstimated that they were about five miles around seven minutes from melson campground and he knew that the terrorist he was after this ram if that was what he was called was infuriatingly smart almost the general allowed as smart as he was well hell the general told himself one thing that he and the team werent going to do was drive pellmell into the campground it was early fall and though he doubted there would be many campers if any after the labor day weekend hed have to be careful not to get any more civilians involved theyd stop the explorer a quarter mile before the objective and go in for the kill on foot approaching the campground on the run prince on point was panting so loudly freeman thought that he could be heard a hundred feet away on the narrow potholed road that led through a tunnel of trees to the campground it was hoped that prince still had the scent and that the eager spaniel could lead the general and his fourman team to exactly where the terrorists were or to what hiking trail theyd selected to take them northward to the canadian border fourteen miles due north freemans specfors halted fifty yards from the campground they could see bodies strewn by the entrance where a bulletridden winnebago stood facing them its driver a woman her door open was slumped over the wheel two children seven possibly eight years old were lying very still on the ground the nearby grass so green it contrasted vividly with the pools of blood the childrens faces were horribly disfigured abdomens disemboweled prince became rigid and pointed several gray wolves tails down were slinking away on the off side of the camper one of them baring its bloodsmeared canines at the intrusion on what obviously from the gruesome state of one of the childrens bodies had been the predators meal freeman signaled choir to put prince back to work to find the enemys scent which prince did quickly despite the rain leading them to a trailhead a hundred yards beyond the campground by one of the creeks they followed prince along the dodge colts tracks which could be easily seen where the gravel ended and the grass began eddie mervyn was mouthing obscenities the car canadian plates rcv had been nosed into heavy brush there were a lot of pine needles around it the needles had probably showered down when the doors now shut had been opened none of the team thought there was an ambush set up that would be an unwarranted loss of time for the terrorists but none of the team expected to walk past the dodge scotfree the car was probably rigged for redready to blow via trip wire ten minutes later they knew there were no trip wires and that they had wasted ten minutes and they no longer had the beep it wasnt their modern infantry radios that had been jammed rather the thunderous collision of two big storm fronts whose electricblue strikes were dancing neurotically amid the selkirk mountains that bordered idaho and the canadian province of british columbia had temporarily scrambled all radio communication prince having led them to the dodge was now sneezing so hard and frequently that the team wondered if the terrorists had used black pepper or some other equally confusing compound to throw the dog off dont panic freeman told himself as if addressing the other members of his team stay calm go back to the campgrounds entrance look for boot marks get your sense of sight working and working hard but it was no use the heavy rain had obliterated any footprints or enemy smell for prince to work with the spaniel looked up and the general could have sworn the dogs eyes were saying sorry its all right bud said freeman kneeling catching his breath youve worked hard as the general patted prince he glanced back at the murdered woman in the winnebago and the bodies of her children which neither johnny lee nor choir wanted to deal with freeman called in on the sheriffs sandpoint police frequency a message machine answered he gave the teams location and told them were in trouble send in whoever you can well try to pick up the scumbags trail and well secure the campground perimeter just in case it was a mark of his leadership to know that he was beaten and not let pride prevent him from calling in the bigger albeit slower moving search and rescue elements with no scent no beep and heavy rain tracking the bad guys was virtually hopeless but just because hed failed on his quick dash by helo to priest lake there was no reason now to prevent the bigger battalions from coming in until it occurred to him the most unexpected scenario of all that because each tent and trailerhome site was so secluded in this heavily forested area the terrorists could be hiding in the campsite itself freeman could not give himself or his team a reason why the terrorists should do this but he did know that a good leader examines all the possibilities freeman choir gomez lee and eddie mervyn began doing a search moving swiftly yet cautiously from one site to another it was bad enough to have lost a man already and freeman didnt want any more casualties in this so far at least futile mission prince was doing his all between bouts of sneezing that jangled their nerves it took all of choirs concentration not to say bless you to the dog each time so close was his bond with prince he could see that prince was becoming increasingly uncomfortable under the weight of the protective vest now and then the spaniel would stop and paw at it to no avail johnny lee saw the strand and screamed down everyone did so including prince but hed already tripped the wire that had been strung a few inches above the apron of soggy ground the bang of the claymore mine and the whistling of its seven hundred steel balls temporarily blocked out the sound of the rain they were all hit with ricochets coming off the surrounding trees but their hagvar helmets vests and highcollared battle dress uniforms had saved them from any incapacitating injury though choirs right thigh would be badly bruised from one ricochet prince however had not been so lucky having caught part of the blast on the part of his hindquarters not covered by his hagvar coat he now lay yelping in a tangle of wire dangling from the exploded mines carcass choir limped to his spaniels side freeman already calling in search and rescue in coeur dalene via sandpoint for an evac helo eddie mervyn gomez and johnny lee went into tdp triangular defensive position to cover the general the delay they all knew meant more gained ground for the terrorists who the team now believed must be escaping on one of the many trails that wove their way farther from the campground into the wilderness of the idaho british columbia border hang on old boy choir whispered to prince unbuckling the bloodied rear strap of princes armored vest hang on a half an hour later as they waited for the sar helo that they could hear beating the air somewhere above them in the torrential downpour their fatigue the loss of tony and now possibly of prince sat upon them like a heavy gray sheet of metal freeman knew that they had lost too much time to catch the terrorists before they crossed the border into canada by now the regular army forces had had time to assemble and under presidential orders were taking over the search the general gomez mervyn choir and johnny lee all tried to hide their bitter disappointment as they regrouped waiting for a lift back to sandpoint but the plain fact was that the terrorists despite having lost half their number in the fiercely fought rearguard action at the lake had soundly defeated freemans team in the next twentyfour hours as a few grim locals put it the hills were alive with the sound of curses as battalions of army reservists and army rangers guided by forest rangers scoured the high wilderness areas west north and east of priest lake pressing ever farther into the mountainous fastness of idahos panhandle only one thing of any relevance was found and that by a ranger corporal it was a manila envelope with general d freemanpersonal written on it the envelope had been placed inside a large transparent plastic ziploc bag together with what looked like black marblesized pieces of bubble plastic the bag itself had been attached to a tree at the side of one of the many hiking trails that crisscrossed the border the area was inaccessible by vehicle and for this reason was frequently used by drug mules carrying prized bc budmarijuana across into the united states there was very little conversation as douglas freeman and his reunited team were heloed back to sandpoint where as freeman was tersely issuing instructions for the transfer of tony ruths remains back to arlington a major delivered the ziploc bag the general held it up against the gunmetal sky examining it carefully for any sign of booby traps though the fact that it had been forwarded to him by army rangers without anything untoward happening was reasonably good assurance that it hadnt been rigged still this was the post world and there could be anthrax or some other equally lethal powder in the manila envelope inside the ziploc it didnt take much to kill you the general walked downwind away from his team the black melted plastic bits sliding back and forth in the bag like popcorn he carefully removed the envelope from the bag slipped out his twelveinch cold steel blade from its scabbard and holding the envelope downwind at arms length slit it and waited no powder next he carefully opened the yellow folded lettersized sheet of paper americans suck the general the sole passenger aboard the dods west coast learjet en route back to monterey was handed an encoded email by the copilot it was from darpas general charles at the pentagon and confirmed what freeman had feared most that the black blobs of plastic in the ziploc bag had once been a computer disk the sickening implication was that the terrorists must have downloaded and transmitted the supercavitation data via hilltop lineofsight modem and that with apparently no copies at darpa alpha america now had no record of the data shifting the balance of power dramatically and terrifyingly from the west to the terrorists the generals concomitant fear was that already the precious data was being fed into the brains of computercontrolled lathes that could turn the requisite hard carbon and steel composites into weaponry and ammunition with hitherto undreamedof accuracy and destructive power eleanor prenty handled the news networks with typical aplomb she allowed marte price to interview her on this evenings prime time to state that classified material had indeed been stolen from a dod installation at lake pend oreille what kind of material asked marte price personnel files the look of incredulity from marte price was seen by millions of viewers secretary prenty are you telling me that she glanced down at her notes ten no eleven americans have been murdered by terrorists because they wanted personnel files prentys washingtonhoned expression gave away nothing chapter nine so the president growled at eleanor prenty who was standing respectfully behind him on the oval offices carpet as the chief executive of the united states hands clasped behind him gazed out through the bulletproof glass into the rose garden the hard drives been destroyed and the backup disk stolen and now we have the possibility indeed the probability that some terrorist cell who knows where will throw it back at us in the form of a prototype bullet torpedo or missile a technology which we dont know how to counter because weve had the damn technological data stolen mr president said eleanor in what was almost certainly the understatement of her career i know it looks bad she paused it is bad but chief scientist moffat has emailed me that its only the very latest cpl equipment for gods sake eleanor speak english sorry sir thats computer precision lathing equipment that would be needed to tool up for the extraordinarily small tolerances required to produce the supercavitation hardware ive alerted every one of our embassies consulates cultural and trade liaison offices to keep their eyes peeled for any shipments of such ultrahighquality equipment to any big or smallarms manufacturers throughout the world and for all we know roberta juarez she saw that the president was trying to put a name to a face and explained she was one of the senior scientists working on this supercavitation stuff yes replied the president i remember now she was the one continued eleanor who alerted us to the fact that the floppy backup disk had a battery transmitter in its hub before she died another of the dead scientists had a note in his hand with ram and scarund written on it my god you think thats that sarin nerve gas no said eleanor but given it was presumably the last thing he wrote we presume its the name of the terrorist leader or that of one of the other terrorists huh probably the one who left freeman that note the president turned around to face her that must have hurt filthy insult like that im sure it did said eleanor it upset me she took a sheet of paper from her briefcase this is the forensics report on the envelope and the discarded shoulderfired rocket launcher the terrorists used to down the chinook what have we got the president asked glumly his reelection desk calendar reminded him that tomorrow he was to give a progress report on the war against terrorism traces of thiokol tx reducedsmoke solid fuel with distinctive sulfur content as suspected by general freeman who witnessed the manpad launch spectrometer analysis of sulfur location specific electron microscope and spectrometer analyses of brown envelope which is chinese and yellow paper note addressed to general freeman and placed inside transparent plastic ziploc bag reveal pulp acid used to manufacture paper northeastern china also yellow paper is cm cm a standard chinese sheet while ours is cm cm several microscopic grains of soil detritus found in discarded us uniforms on canada side of idahocanada border reveal localized idaho british columbia deposits grains of soil and grasses from boots soles and interiors were also spectrometered and revealed soil indigenous not only to pacific northwest but to areas of northeastern china and russian far east in land adjacent to and including large wild bird sanctuary in and around lake khanka deposits of crushed bird eggshell and disproportionate amount of guano were found deep in the soles of some of the boots the guanos composition pointing to tancho and several species that normally cluster near or on large bodies of fresh water such as lake khanka inside the boots several microscopic specks of ant remains detected also indigenous to lake khanka area so eleanor asked the president whats your take on this soil stuff a wild bird sanctuary you think any of this has anything to do with the attack on darpa alpha eleanor shrugged cia has used soil forensics to locate terrorist training areas in the past the director of national intel is more interested in how we can stop the manufacture of darpa alphas hypersonic technology as i did hes also alerted the state department which has sent an immediateurgent defcon to all us embassies military attachés to be on the lookout for the movement of any highprecision computerslaved lathing equipment needed to tool up for everything from torpedo and artillery nose cones to smallarms mm rounds cia and darpa alphas general charles concur that in two months at the latest one damned terrorist with a rifle will be able to take out anything from an m abrams tank to our billiondollar joint strike fighters to any commercial aircraft or any other vehicle the president unleashed a train of obscenities several of which eleanor hadnt heard since lets pray eleanor that someone somewhere can get a handle on this do we have current satpix of this lake he looked down at the dhs report khanka cia courier is bringing over a package she glanced at her watch it was almost time for the next press briefing right now she wanted to quit the white house get out from all the pressure go home and be with her daughter jennifer go shopping play scrabble no that would take too much energy why not go to bed pull the covers up go into a cave do anything but face a hostile washington press corps she imagined that this was how condi rice must have felt when confronted by the european press scrums whose members had relentlessly pushed for details about the cias pow rendition policy in which al qaeda suspects were spirited away to secret prisons in eastern europe if the press even suspected what was on the darpa alpha socalled personnel files disk and that no backup had been found it could sink the presidency didnt the press know eleanor asked herself that scientists were human too that yes maybe roberta juarez god rest her soul should have had a backup of the backup but how much backup do you have for your own computer cmon people give us a break were doing the best we can eleanor oh sorry mr president you okay yes yes im fine i was just wondering whether roberta juarez had another backup disk somewhere so far theres no sign of one great said the president his tone one of utter exasperation so not only have the terrorists destroyed the damn disk probably downloaded to their hq by now but we have no record of what it is theyve stolen and those people who did know what was on the disk are all dead god help us we need a miracle i mean it he looked up as if startled those men who were on freemans team theyre out of the picture now but are we confident theyll keep their mouths shut absolutely eleanor assured him freeman had fairchild the air base near spokane disperse them back to their homes fairchild used six different planes special forces so no names were given out at least the press understands something about the need for privacy when that wont keep the tabloids quiet for long no it wont she replied the pentagon i suppose is unloading on freeman everyones unloading on freeman mr president success has a hundred fathers but failure is an orphan said the president are we unloading on him it was an electionyear question ends justifying the means if you win the election you can do a lot for the country but you need to win i dont think we should she answered he mightnt be as fast as he was an old warhorse but a warhorse nonetheless among the older guys his leadership and soldiering in that far eastern un command is still legendary the president nodded knowingly recalling the feat of arms in the taiga freemans famous uturn he paused for what seemed a long time to eleanor then confessed to her im sorry for even posing the question of course im disappointed as hell that he never bagged those terrorist bastards but he was fast off the mark and added eleanor if we do pick up their trail again his team might be useful if we dont pick up something itll cost me the presidency eleanor prenty knew he was right and it wasnt her habit to throw him a soft pitch the iranian hostage crisis had cost jimmy carter the presidency and though you couldnt put a price on american lives she knew that the loss of the top secret data from darpa alpha and the fact that no backup disk was in sight would in the long run be much more punishing for the country his opponent knew it everyone knew it ill have to put it to rest he said solemnly eleanor was alarmed did he mean he would have to absorb the loss politically as carter had done after the attempted rescue of american hostages by the american commando force had crashed and burned in the desert night holding the administration up to more ridicule by the iranian revolutionaries you mean mr president that wed have to eat it no no by putting it to rest i meant well have to run it down go after the terrorists no matter where they go no matter what people say about bush going into afghanistan and iraq it showed the world that well go in anywhere and go in unilaterally if we have to were not letting people come into this country murder our people and think they can ever find safe haven eleanor prenty was visibly relieved but only temporarily because both she and the president knew that all the tough talk in the world was nothing more than rhetoric unless the intelligence community could locate the receiver and the specific location of the stolen property no one in america wanted another wildgoose chase for wmds that didnt exist that had been a monumental intel disaster what had colin powell and then threestar general freeman called it the mother of all intel screwups the problem then the president reminded eleanor was that we didnt have enough agents on the ground relied too much on hightech satellite photos et cetera it takes years to build up the kind of humint networks like al qaeda had the rose gardens sharp unforgiving thorns suddenly appeared to him as ill omens he turned away from the garden and eleanor saw that his hands were clasped so tightly that they were bone white drained of blood and national security adviser eleanor prenty knew that unless in the parlance of the media something broke and soon not only the presidency but the fate of the entire country would be in terrorist hands the countrys chief executive and commander in chief looked across the oval office at frederic remingtons bronze sculpture the bronco buster alive with furious action weve alerted all carrier groups right yes it was what all presidents had done in times of crisis to extend the countrys reach and allow it to strike back if possible but where would you want to involve freeman again eleanor asked yes he may have lost them but he was johnnyonthespot and because hes already been up against them he might know something deduce something that we cant i agree we owe it to him no the president said we dont owe him anything he volunteered we owe the man he lost and those who were murdered an aide entered with the latest intel report the president scanned it nothing he concluded dropping the file on the desk not even a possible recipient of the info can you believe that well eleanor told the president im not at all surprised the president looked haggard defeated well all we can do right now is pray pray for a miracle chapter ten monterey are they going margaret asked closing the book she had hoped might distract her from the media circus outside their house not yet answered douglas freeman he felt foolish standing in his robe by the living rooms rose red drapes peering through a narrow slit in the curtains i think theyre just moving cables lights and stuff around difficult to tell in the glare dozens of lights like were on oprah we are margaret said tartly were the sensation of the moment douglas looked around at her well mrs freeman you are sensational a smile escaped youre not bad yourself general he returned the smile why dont you go off to bed sweetheart might as well get some rest she sighed no point i couldnt possibly doze off with that mob camped outside could you yes a soldier learns to sleep anywhere hes not needed for the moment he might have to go days if the balloon goes up then you should rest now no point in staying up the red drapes turned pink as a beam of light swept the length of the room what on earth was that a damned searchlight youd think we were in a pow camp we are prisoners margaret said resentfully the general hands thrust hard into his pockets walked over to the living room sofa against which his wifes face looked even paler than tony ruths had in the moments after the cable had beheaded the specfor warrior douglas took his wifes hand it felt remarkably warm im sorry youve had to get caught up in all this im a soldiers wife now you told me once that it comes with the territory with command it does but usually you can keep family out of it i shouldnt have come home shouldve stayed away she lifted her free hand slipped it around his waist and nuzzled into him some of them were here camped outside the house before you even arrived at the airport theyll go away he told her soon as the next story breaks dont worry about it she said weve got enough provisions we can stay holed up in here for she shrugged as long as it takes you mean douglas added forcing a grin until the milk runs out margaret didnt ask for much but one of the first things douglas had found out the first night of their honeymoon was that margaret had a sacrosanct ritual at she would shower prepare her bowl of cereal pour the milk and scan the funnies as she ate finishing before the news at eleven sex was nonnegotiable until the weather forecast was over and the sports report threatened but this night the general knew there was no chance of any conjugal enjoyment like many another soldier postcombat coitus came in second only to slaking your thirst but defeat failure on the scale of the darpa alpha murders and the nationthreatening theft that came with them could rob a man especially a commander of any emotion other than selfpunishing regret the awful accusatory postmortems of what ifs and if onlys that undermined selfconfidence in the field and the bedroom what he needed he knew was a win a victory a chance at a victory to redeem himself in his own eyes and the teams theyll go away margaret told him they have the attention span of a newt a what a newt freeman laughed you nit and that started her off giggling nit and newt shooting back and forth between them like fireflies in the gloom a burst of manic energy as inexplicable as it was unexpected fueling the exchange then vanishing as quickly as it had appeared dammit said the general getting up walking over to the drapes for a brief reconnaissance then to the kitchen i should have choppered the team ahead of where we were getting the bip from the transmitter on the disk gone ahead and set up an ambush margaret knew little if anything about military tactics but she intuitively sensed a spouses duty to support whatever decision the other had made unless there was something to be gained by a useful suggestion what would that be she wondered she tried to recollect what hed told her about the op on his return but she simply found it too tiring to keep up with all the details some of which she realized she had probably picked up from marte prices newsbreaks on cnn why didnt you go ahead on the trail and good grief she hadnt meant to say that but it was what his musing had suggested to her and besides wasnt he asking himself the very same question i didnt do it he bellowed from the kitchen because theres not just one trail up there its rugged mountain country wild country trappersve been going through those forests for hundreds of years one trail son of a bitch theres a hundred trails all hidden in the forest i had to move fast margaret with only seven men well then she said sharply you did your best and thats all anyone can do she paused anyway whats done is done there was an edge to her voice that was a caution a yellow light for this conversation to end not to cry over spilt milk she couldnt stand it if there was even a hint of selfpity wheres the damn decaf he bawled where it always is right cupboard above the sink men what i said men you never know where anything is i would if this cupboard was organized goddamned jumble in here dark as hades turn on the light she admonished he stood grumpily by the kettle ordering the water to boil faster until he realized he hadnt depressed the on switch as the water began roiling its subdued sound like the faroff rumble of artillery the cold kettle of a few minutes ago grew warm and shuddered slightly as if it were coming to life would you like a cup decaf she said sure his offer her acceptance constituted a ceasefire sorry he said as he handed her the white mug his second favorite with the brits special air service insignia and motto who dares wins sorry for what she said affecting surprise being so damned egotistical he sat down carefully in his tv command chair must have seemed that im more concerned about my reputation than about my team margaret smiled diplomatically egos first cousin to morale he looked at her pensively was that a shot an observation she replied coyly do you know a general without an ego he was about to answer when they heard a rumble outside and the rose red drapes were once again swept by lights theyre moving she said more out of hope than conviction douglas listened intently like the nuclear subs that kept a library of ships sounds and noise shorts in their sonar libraries he had over his years as a man who had soldiered all over the world compiled an impressive sound library of his own blindfolded he could tell precisely what kind of tank or armored personnel vehicle was approaching friend or foe nothing new out there he concluded then whats all the noise about warming up he said ready to leave or just repositioning he got up quickly and went to the slit in the drapes flashlights moving about he said fogs thicker if i didnt know better id say they were laying smoke to hide in were the ones hiding said margaret i have a feeling he mused i dont know why he paused do you ever have that feeling he asked her deep inside you a premonition almost that something you wouldnt normally expect déjà vu no he turned away from the drapes and she could see the expectation in his eyes i mean that you just know something is going to come along to help you out of a tight spot intuition said margaret yes intuition do you remember he continued when patton was in the doghouse with ike over slapping that soldier in sicily no well for a while patton thought he would be locked out of the dday invasion freeman still trying to ascertain whether more media were arriving withdrawing or repositioning turned around and looked at margaret he said god will not allow it i must fulfill my destiny douglas freeman paused as if expecting his wife to agree that he douglas freeman would like patton end up fulfilling his destiny end up victorious despite the slough of despondency in which he now found himself he could see had known in fact for a long time that while margaret would comfort and support him for better or for worse she would not lie to him i wouldnt know she told him i dont have such premonitions i feel it he told her turning back to spy on the media i know margaret ill my teamll get another chance to run those scumbags to ground it was precisely at that moment eleven minutes after three in the morning that the phone rang margaret answered and though sure that it was yet one more reporter tried to sound civil freeman residence it was a womans voice saying that she was calling from the pentagon and inquiring as to whether general freeman would be available to take a call in ten minutes from the cno chief of naval operations yes margaret answered her hung up and relayed the message to freeman ah said freeman the cno whats the navy got to do with it margaret asked douglas smiled at her it wasnt a husbandtowife expression but rather that of a patient adult to a child big navy chief said freeman boss of darpa alpha its a naval base not army im not that dumb douglas what he paused seeing his reflection in the wall mirror he looked like patton with ike about to reinstate him did i sound patronizing he asked margaret yes she said perhaps you might try being a little less sure of yourself when this naval person calls pride goeth before a fall naval person he joshed her naïveté regarding military ranks indeed regarding all things military at once amused and pleased him it meant he could always tell her something new about american defense about a soldiers life discuss a fresh topic over dinner instead of sitting there boring her mundane table talk and its sheer repetition he believed could finally be every bit as damaging to a marriage as an affair how long did the operator say douglas asked ten minutes yes said margaret dont be impatient you know how people are ten minutes could mean half an hour tired of pacing back and forth past the lightsuffused drapes in the living room he decided to go to his study switched on the computer and called up his teams email addresses all except ruths margaret brought in his coffee and the general could see that despite her overall cooler demeanor his wife was excited too but worried hoping for him that like patton he would get another chance to track down his enemies but worried like so many military spouses who never got used to seeing their loved ones going into harms way the phone rang startling her douglas indicating that she take the call a little psychology in order he thought freeman residence a demanding voice asked do you use grainfed beef and organic vegetables for a second margaret hesitated was it aussie lewis she wondered was it code to whom would you like to speak what is this the dim sum restaurant by then douglas was on the line no he said emphatically youve got the wrong number there was a click and the hum of the line what a rude person said margaret the least he could have done was apologize is dim sum open twentyfour hours asked douglas yes i think our number must be very similar why is there something wrong no said douglas tentatively thinking it over then more assertively no but this whole business about the terrorists i mean puts you on edge margaret concurred everyones on edge have been since we found out our own government has been listening in on all our calls when the phone rang two minutes later douglas took it it was a pentagon operator presumably the same one who had called margaret she apologized to the general but the cno had been delayed he would be calling shortly however douglas said that was fine and thanked her for calling he put the phone down godammit hes delayed margaret could see that he was worried that the delay might mean he was out of the running dont fret she told him freeman nodded amicably youre right you know why before she could answer he told her its because i still have that intuition this is no courtesy call at he glanced at his watch youre right margaret said unless the chief of naval operations wants to order takeout they both laughed margaret decided shed now have a cup of evening star herbal tea it was said to calm the nerves creating an ambience of tranquility an ambience that was shattered by the shrill ring of the kitchen phone not wishing to seem too eager freeman hesitated for a moment as he took the receiver from his wife giving her a wink and a smile she was pleased he was ready how often had he told her that luck is no more than being packed ready to act on a moments notice general the drawl of hard consonants was unmistakable aussie the one and only general sorry for calling so early but i wanted to give you a headsup before the media get to you well mate replied freeman youre a bit late theyve parked outside en masse so youve heard already heard what freeman asked impatiently the scumbags said aussie theyve bought it margaret was straining to hear what aussie was saying her face muscles tightening as she tried to make sense of it douglas she saw looked stricken where freeman asked aussie on the canadian side apparently the rcmp were called funny thing though i mean funny peculiar not funny haha was that it was a coupla civilians who tipped the mounties for freeman the image of a scarlettuniced mountie with the distinctive peaked hat brown leather riding boots and yellowstriped riding britches leapt to mind even though the general knew that this was the ceremonial garb of the royal canadian mounted police and not the more utilitarian khaki yellowbanded cap and yellowstriped navy trousers that constituted the workaday uniform of canadas famed federal police a firefight he asked aussie no aussie replied not a shot fired from what i was told they went off the road into a great bloody ravine snowing like crazy who told you this dammit pressed freeman who was anxiously awaiting the cnos call and growing more tense by the second with the knowledge that because margaret had declined to pay extra for call waiting the cno was probably trying to get through right now mate o mine in our mountain division told me aussie explained gave me a bell bell was british and aussie slang for someone phoning you freeman was struck anew by how cellphone communication had revolutionized life in this case it had allowed aussie lewiss buddy in the field to effortlessly transmit the news before official channels so youre telling me said the general that the terrorists are confirmed dead yeah thought id give you a bell before marte price and the jackals hit you with it out of the blue can you call your buddy back and get more details i tried general knew youd want more info but i cant reach the bugger aussie momentarily lost his accent as he affected the neutral tone of the ubiquitous cellphone operator the customer you have dialed is away from the phone or temporarily out of the fucking service area please try again do you know where the ravine is the general asked aussie somewhere near ripple mountain mike said just north norwest of the border corner area between idaho and british columbia mike my buddy said the mounties had to chopper in to retrieve the bodies an accident said freeman looks like it minibus they were in went off the road on a curve black ice all over apparently the weather channels been telling people to stay off the roads up there hell general they areweretowelheads desert guys its a sure bet that they knew squat bout driving in snow towelheads said freeman all of them not all two were brit muslims i think you know british citizens you sure about that well thats what mike told me his mountain division company was sent up to help the mounties intel section took mug shots bingo for every one of the pricks there was a match either on interpols or our homeland securitys wantedterrorist list freeman sat down hard at the kitchen table holding the phone in a peculiarly disembodied way as if hed had the wind punched out of him by now margaret had the gist of aussies call and whereas her husband seemed undone by the news of the terrorists demise margaret struggled to contain her delight he wouldnt have to leave her or put himself in harms way now if she had heard correctly that the darpa alpha murderers were dead she heard her husbands urgent almost desperate tone as he pressed aussie lewis are you positive that theyre all dead did your buddy mike actually see them in the ravine for the first time margaret thought she detected a hesitancy in aussies voice and strained to hear helped by the fact that aussies voice was loud to begin with well general im not sure whether he personally saw the scumbags but hes a trustworthy bloke doesnt bullshit anyway the jackalsll soon know i guess marte price and her wannabes in the press will be in a race to get it on the air big story i reckon theyll be coming to you for your reaction anytime now thanks for the headsup aussie i preciate it freeman gently returned the phone to its cradle and sat in silence he could hear the kitchen clock he dropped a lump of sugar into his black coffee stirring it for what to margaret seemed like an inordinately long time until she couldnt bear it any longer what are you worrying about now have you ever heard or read a news story that got all the facts straight i havent they always get something wrong particularly body counts he sipped the coffee while looking through the living room at the drapes it seemed as if the glare had abated he turned to margaret do you remember how the number of dead was always wrong incomplete and that big mine disaster in down in west virginia cnn said all the church bells were ringing all the miners safe then we heard no there had been a mixup in communications they were all dead except one man who survived douglas you seem disappointed they were found i mean i would have thought that grisly as it all is you must be she stopped unsure of what word she should use happy he said that theyve been found i suppose so but that note the creeps left for me makes it personal besides aussies information isnt something id take to the bank its secondhand info that aussies buddy in the mountain division got from somebody else and where did they get it from first thing you learn in this trade margaret is that the first reports are invariably wrong i take it then that you think theres a possibility that not all of those horrible people are dead yes and what irks me he was interrupted by the guttural sound of trucks and vans starting up outside headlight beams lighting up the kitchen blinds margaret walked over to her husband douglas i dont want you to be irked by anyone the disk those people stole has been destroyed hasnt it i mean cnn is saying what you said that the terrorists must have transmitted the information via hilltop modem or whatever those things are called and then the disk was smashed so he asked sharply then theyve won havent they she regretted her words the moment shed uttered them i mean she added quickly you did your best darling and its over that margaret is what sticks in my craw cant you understand so its a matter of hubris she retorted and murder he shot back cold premeditated murder of americans civilians my point is douglas what can you do the damage has already been the phone rang and the cno having no way of knowing that general freeman had been informally briefed by aussie lewis informed freeman that the royal canadian mounted police had retrieved bodies thought to be those of the terrorists from a ravine not far from the uscanadian border douglas now understood why all the media vans and satellite dish trucks were leaving for the media it was over the gaggle of reporters no longer interested in freemans thoughts on the subject he asked the cno how many bodies had been found theres some confusion about that the cno replied as there often is in these kinds of situations general if its one thing ive learned its to be circumspect about giving out precise numbers mounties inform me the snow was deep some of the bodies almost entirely buried in the drifts i think itll take a day or two to know for certain they were all in us army uniforms though and no dog tags so theres no doubt about them being the terrorists id say it was a lucky break for us except that i think we have to assume the darpa alpha data have been transmitted ive forwarded the information you got up there from your interview with dr freeman heard the rustle of paper then the clack of computer keys on the other end and guessed that the cno was trying to retrieve the head scientists name moffat freeman suggested richard moffat yes thats it ive sent the information to the di he meant the director of intelligence meanwhile the bodies are being flown to vancouver to see whether we can get any leads from them who they were where they were from et cetera ill let you know i apologize for calling you at such an ungodly hour but i wanted to thank you for your there was an awkward pause ah for your getting right onto it freeman thanked him for his courtesy you did your best margaret told him her comfort did nothing to assuage his feeling that hed failed if only he and the team had caught the bastards before they had a chance to bursttransmit the data if only the pricks vehicle had plunged into a ravine before theyd had a chance to transmit the information that would change the world if only ah he was thinking too much about himself by way of an antidote for his futile brooding he emailed choir williams about prince that beloved spaniel was the best damn tracker dog in america in the world at dawn his computer signaled he had mail prince was dead that was the most savage the single most demoralizing hit hed taken in the whole business it wasnt that he was uncaring about tony ruths death the decapitation of anyone was as grim a sight as any combat soldier has to look at but human beings bore their own responsibility and in this case tony had gone willingly like his team members following the general as they had before into what freemans soldiers knew despite what the relativist moralists of academe might say were crucial battles against evil a job for which they volunteered not so the likes of prince freeman mused an animal that had no choice but that was nevertheless with them in harms way and anyone who thought a canine wasnt conscious of fear was a fool and while there was no animalhuman bond stronger than that between choir and prince it would affect the whole team in a moment of selfdoubt douglas freeman wondered whether they would ever volunteer to follow him again of course they would and he jettisoned the doubt almost as quickly as it had assailed him kicked it out in disgust for it was nothing more than selfpity in disguise there was no room for selfpity in a world in which hundreds of thousands of children perished each year of starvation and preventable diseases and where there were breeding grounds for teenagers who would blow themselves up in the insane terrorism waged against the west he recalled what margaret had said regarding the futility of worrying about the possibility that one of the terrorists might still be on the loose the data she was right were almost certainly in the hands of whoever had paid enough to get them who had financed the attack the phone rang hello said margaret in her usual courteous manner then suddenly her tone turned icy covering the mouthpiece she hissed its that tart of yours marte wanted to know if the general had any comments visàvis the discovery of the bodies in the ravine no comment he told her huh thats unlike you general ive never found you lost for words im not lost theres nothing to say there are a lot of people in washington questioning eleanor prenty giving you the assignment i was ready he told her thats all my intention was to get into the area quickly hopefully to slow them down while our regular forces had time to get in there with so many of our specforces in the middle east i had one reserve team ready to go its as simple as that hmm what would you advise the president to do now if your opinion was sought i havent been asked and besides its not my place to advise the white house oh crap douglas you were trying to run this thing from day one dont go all humble on me what would you do now he knew what marte was up to she was trying to get a good fight going between the guy who blew it and the administration a quick feisty sound bite that would rile the white house in an election year i have no comment marte okay but off the record do you think were in trouble with this one cnn no us you me america shit obviously she didnt know about the pieces of melted black plastic in the ziploc bag the melted plastic that had been the darpa alpha disk he was too slow to reply with the intuition of a topnotch reporter she sensed something was wrong something was being held back cmon douglas you know ive never violated a confidence tell me is this big no comment replacing the receiver douglas met margarets jealous stare fullon you can come with me if you like but ive got to give her a more honest answer than that margaret why didnt you tell her not here he cut in not with the possibility of nsa and homeland security ears listening in all the other stuff the cno aussie thats all right nsa probably already knows all that but they dont know what i think margaret saw that his intensity wouldnt brook her jealousy of the tart not now ill get my coat the fogs bound to be chilly and it was in the fog on the way to the eleven that she asked him just how bad he thought the situation was for me im in the doghouse dog he thought of prince you could see the wonderful devotion in a dogs eyes he liked cats too but dogs better they needed you no margaret said i know how bad it is for you you look tortured tonight i mean tell me honestly just how bad is it for the country its bad sweetheart he slipped his arm about her warmth her perfume reminding him of the hawaiian islands the corny love songs hed heard coming from around fort derussys outside bar next to the hilton the pink flamingoes hypersonic is unbelievably fast he told her a hypersonic torpedo nuclear warhead could be fired at a us port from a trawler hundreds of miles offshore wed have no chance of an intercept margaret felt a shiver and leaned closer to him and very quietly asked him who do you think sent those killers to steal it from us i dont know it could be any of half a dozen countries from iran to china good lord she said her voice a whisper in the fog the sound of the sea muffled behind its curtain could we do anything if we knew hell yes weve got carrier groups all over the globe we could launch a he stopped two figures emerging out of the thick fog no more than ten feet in front of them they turned out to be young lovers the man nodding at them good evening evening freeman replied and a few seconds later said its killing me margaret i know she said every muscle in his body was tense what are you going to tell marte the truth that if they whoever they are have time to tool up well be sitting ducks so that if we do find out who they are well have to move fast theres nothing like getting the press behind you cuts a lot of red tape really gets things moving lets pray she said i already have his conversation with marte was devoid of warmup in part because he was tired and needed rest in part because as a matter of courtesy to margaret he didnt want it to be a long sitdown oldtimes kind of conversation what marte asked might happen if we dont contest this catastrophe for world stability by which you mean all of us in the west you dont have to be politically correct with me douglas thats why i wanted to talk most reporters are afraid to just come out and say that for all our faults the west is still the best and you and i know that as well as the muslim terrorists the runaway train coming at us is china you think beijings behind these murders no but anyone who hasnt had their head in the toilet for the last ten years knows that theres going to be an eastwest war when chinas insatiable appetite for oil coal bauxite and so on cant be satisfied by legitimate means then push is shove and the arms dealer is a kingmaker so the united states has to go wherever this leads us and get the technology back right or if they have the machinery set up ready to turn out prototype rounds well have to go in and destroy it like iran and the enriched uranium yes and heres where i get blunt marte gee thatll be a change he heard her laugh shoot she said we need the media to say what ive said to stress the importance of us being willing to go where we have to to get it back he paused to look out at margaret and give her a wave she smiled blew him a kiss as if they were newlyweds marriage was the one good thing when your job has just run off the road thats a tough one douglas he heard marte say i mean the administration doesnt want to look like its incompetent dropped the what is it flowinflight yes on the other hand said marte the white house has to sell the truth which i assume youre telling me to the public in order to win support for any unilateral kickass we might have to do if we know where it is exactly said the general big problem though is was iraq in no wmds found so why should anyone believe the governments perceived need to go in wherever to stop them using what we shouldnt have lost in the first place checkmate right the bodies douglas say again the americans who were murdered wmds are concepts apparitions but here we have the pictures of the murdered scientists and the old guy up by that lake the name of which none of us can pronounce douglas pronounced it phonetically as if it had been written in english lake pondohray the worst he continued the absolute worst were the children children at the campsite somehow she hadnt heard all the details he told her the essentials of the bloody indiscriminate trail that the terrorists had left from darpa alpha to priest lake thats good thats better than any wmds children people hate that theyll want to go after the bastards and never mind the no extradition treaty bullshit america will go anywhere after scum who murder children he could hear the soft tap of keys on a laptop any other details she asked he hesitated one of the children was unrecognizable he told her about the wolves he said he had to go and told her itd be nice if cnn could help the family survivors if there were any when he came out of the booth the ocean flooded his senses and he took a deep draft of sea air something hed always loved since the moment hed first sniffed the sea a thousand years ago when his dad had taken him on camping trips no campers then just a small pup tent a coleman stove condensed milk two fishing rods and the world was simple margaret hadnt said anything yet about the conversation with marte price but felt she should say something to show it didnt bother her for it did bother her say what you wanted yes he said i did feel better i feel like a shower she was nonplussed whats that special bath the jews have i dont know a baths a bath no said douglas a rabbi told me about it once when you take everything off that separates you from god from the purity of the water women have to take off all makeup eye shadow false nails everything so that they can get clean again you dont feel clean she asked doesnt matter how you deal with this scum some of it inevitably rubs off oh douglas you cant really mean that i do right now youre tired as they returned home the fog was thicker and freeman despite his usual disparagement of anything smacking of superstition took the worsening of the weather as an omen that the world that time itself was closing in on him it wasnt selfpity but it was a glasshalfempty moment and on the evidence of the darpa alpha debacle he felt it was a realistic assessment ive been thinking about that note you got said margaret as they entered the house what a horrible thing to read but that mans pride will be his undoing douglas she shook her head tightlipped and censorious as she took off her coat and headed off to unload the dishwasher freeman felt distinctly uncomfortable remembering the flashes of immodesty after his famous uturn against the russians yes margaret declared that horrid note of his might yet haunt him if he isnt already dead said the general i shouldnt say it i suppose i mean its not very christian but i hope hes dead so do i said freeman but it sounded to margaret more like an obligatory response than a fervent wish she straightened up from the dishwasher and fixed him with her gaze no she charged not truly youd prefer i mean youd like to chase him down the general said nothing topping up his coffee douglas what you like it dont you what do you mean woman i mean you men you like fighting dont you well if that isnt a blatant sexist remark i dont know what is if i said anything like that about women linda rushmein and her night ridersd have me in irons she ignored his comment douglas he met her stare but couldnt sustain his look of hurt surprise he blinked first shifting his gaze to the small triangular pane of glass high in the kitchen door out into the darkness i love it he said gently god forgive me but i do he faced her again to fight for the right i suppose that sounds pompous naïve even but i believe there is evil in the world margaret and what they did up there was evil to the core even if i didnt like the sting of battle id have a duty to pursue them if i could you did your best douglas he was afraid that she might be right im dog tired he told margaret im going to grab some shuteye dawn is breaking so im tired arent you yes but its not against the law freeman cut in i merely said she began youve got this anglosaxon hangup about sleeping during the day goddammit half the country dont be blasphemous then dont be so damn pious you have these damn silly rules because your folks were farmers doesnt mean its a sin to do things differently i was merely surprised at someone who dont be ive had just about all the surprises i can deal with at the moment it isnt my fault general that you didnt run those those monsters to ground never said it was you know douglas youre right you do need sleep a lot of it youre a republican that did it they burst out laughing at their childishness a dam of anxiety broken the tension swept away in a torrent of running giggles adult normalcy returning only when the full measure of the terrorist attack on darpa alpha was reiterated albeit reluctantly in a terse news report they watched on tv national security adviser prenty having to admit under persistent questioning that not all of the murderers in the administrations phrase had been accounted for how many are still at large one she replied tersely is that hard intel pressed a correspondent from fox or soft intel eleanor kept her composure it was a question born of the medias skepticism following the iraqi wmd fiasco its hard intel she said from the dni theres something else said douglas his arm around margarets shoulder holding her close what do you mean margaret asked somethings wrong i can smell it they know something else ive known eleanor prenty for donkeys years and shes got something else on her mind shes keeping something back well i would think margaret said tartly in that case she would have the common courtesy to let you know exactly whats going on douglas freeman agreed margaret had a point and a strong one at that even if the white house didnt want to inform him as a matter of courtesy hadnt it occurred to them that he might still have something to offer by further debriefing belying his present low expectation of the administration a call came twenty minutes later during the only bathroom break douglas freeman had taken all morning and so it was that the general took one of the most important calls of his life and in the history of the republic while sitting on the can the exhaust fan purring softly in the background and he afraid to flush as he listened to the white house operator instructing him that a homeland security agent in monterey was en route as she spoke to deliver a packet to the general by hand after reading it he was to call national security adviser prenty but not from his home number well margaret asked as freeman with a preoccupied air zipped up and buckled his belt the puzzled expression still with him the white house he explained is sending me something he looked at his wife who after handing him his cellphone had lingered outside the bathroom door what in damnations so important that she couldnt tell me on the phone whole country knows by now what happened perhaps theyve found the missing terrorist in hiding or something and dont want it made public it could alert him huh hes already been alerted rest of his gang found dead no its probably something the front door chimes sounded their mellifluous notes in marked contrast to the tension both douglas and margaret felt it was the dhs agent a tall african american clad in a dark blue suit his striped dhs identity card was clearly visible through the front door peephole that was quick observed freeman venturing a smile which wasnt reciprocated the whole world seemed tense the full forensic report was twentyone pages of graphs and columns galore all measurements from microns to centimeters weights in milligrams his eyes raced over the information stopping at the written summary that covered the last two pages for douglas freeman one of the most important nuggets of information was a brief footnote that mentioned that the rocket used against them on the helo at pend oreille was made in either poland or china given the composition and ratio of aluminum to steel a splinter sample from the wooden grip of the shoulderfired rocket launcher showed that it had at one time been infested with pine beetle bore holes visible during examination the insects secretions showing that this species of pine beetle was found in the russian taiga the paper on which americans suck had been written was of chinese manufacture the ink used very definitely china black a highquality calligraphic ink compound manufactured almost exclusively in harbin in chinas far northeastern province of heilongjiang whose heilong river amur to the russians bordered russias far east the river once the site of fierce sinosoviet clashes during the latter half of the twentieth century this was freemans country where hed fought against the siberian sixth debris from the punctured fuselage of the downed chinook from priest lake had been run through the spectrometer where the traces of sulfur used in the warhead registered the structure of the sulfur was typical of that found in what used to be called the manchurian mines that is northeastern china margaret saw her husbands brow furrowed with such intense concentration that she barely recognized him she knew it was said of him that like so many good leaders he was a quick study and could home in on a vital piece of wheat amid the chaff of countless reports that used to flood his desk and though he was retired his was an administrative skill which he had kept honed daily skimming through the plethora of newspapers blogs and magazines and journals from the economist to foreign affairs and so the email he was about to send to an old friend charles riser who was presently us cultural attaché in beijing was markedly short and to the point and because the general was not privy to the present official ciphers or codes the message was transmitted in plain language using the forensic reports mention of the tancho as the vital clue for riser the email subject ornithologists destination read group wishes to visit migratory bird sanctuary for tancho can you suggest prime location charles riser despite his prodigious knowledge of oriental culture did not know what tancho meant and asked bill heinz the embassys military attaché japanese crane replied bill youve probably seen lots of em on postcards japanese watercolors theyre a big deal in japan now that riser knew what tancho meant his china hands knowledge came into play well one of the biggest sanctuaries would be lake khanka the one up beyond harbin i think it straddles the sinorussian border riser emailed a coffeequaffing douglas freeman about lake khanka it was a huge fourthousandsquarekilometer body of water and marshland ninety kilometers long and in places seventy kilometers wide that constitutes one of the largest bird sanctuaries in the world the wetlands and lake are fed by the upper course of the ussuri river in a large depression where terrible forest fires over thousands of years had apparently rendered an area which should have been thick boreal forest now only sparsely treed leaving meadows and some copses of mongolian oak it was also reputed to be the last great refuge of the endangered far eastern leopard and siberian tiger and a vital refuge for hundreds of thousands of migrating birds including the tancho he also added courtesy of bill heinzs files that there had been repeated complaints by chinese enviro nuts about some kind of armament testing in the area adjacent to the lake in their computercummusic room freeman forced himself to contain his excitement as having quickly scanned charlie risers email he called up his meticulously crossreferenced militaryindustrial files which he was confident were better than the pentagons intel lake khanka had rung a distant bell in his memory about sinosoviet border disputes and its significance fairly jumped out at him from the monitor lake khanka at latitude degrees five minutes north longitude degrees east on the far eastern russiachina border was less than fifty kilometers north of the deng jiang sulfur mine sulfur being essential for any armaments including the newer man portable air defense rockets of the kind that had downed his specops chinook at priest lake calling margaret over he pointed to the area map he had called up zooming in on the area highlighting a place southwest of the lake called gayvoron noting that it must be the railhead oh no said margaret as she saw him snatch a light windbreaker from the hallway surely you can call from home not this one sweetie the general replied grabbing his cap giving her a peck on the cheek sweetheart murphy is always hanging around get sloppy on security just once and its like leaving your car unlocked from the repaired phone booth down by the eleven freeman dialed the white house and this time was immediately put through to eleanor prenty she got right to it youve read the summary douglas yes and ive deduced that everything points to those scumbags camp definitely being situated around a place called lake khanka its situated in yes we know eleanor cut in impatiently what he was stunned you know its lake khanka he heard a sigh that conveyed to him a sense of patient resignation on the other end douglas i think youre one of the most brilliant military commanders this countrys ever had your failure to catch these terrorists notwithstanding but you she was sighing again really pissing him off like us all i guess you have some surprising blind spots such as he asked grumpily my failure to catch these terrorists notwithstanding dont be childish general i havent got the time none of us have remember you and all other senior officers active and retired supported the patriot act now as aussie lewis might have said the penny dropped in freemans brain son of a youve been tracking my internet inquiries i have not nsa has surely you must know that their computers are surfing the net as soon as certain phrases or terms pop up the computers automatically tag and record them hell douglas they do the same with me you might not realize it but some terrorist cells have staged random breakandenters so they can use a citizens computer that way any backtracking of the terrorists metas to that ordinary citizens line is futile metas messages to activate explained eleanor its an nsa acronym freemans brain was racing despite his acute fatigue so you knew i mean nsa put the forensic analysis together with my computer files on lake khanka and gayvoron it was your sulfur mine around which all the forensic stuff jelled eleanor told him then its a matter for our air force said douglas i expect moscowll be as pleased as we are to take out a terrorist camp he was thinking of how the cia and kgb had joined forces and worked so well together to prevent a planeload of russian nuclear scientists from leaving russia for iran its not as easy as that cautioned eleanor the presidents been in contact with the russian premier theres no way moscow will allow a bombing mission on russian soil besides even if they did wed need much more precise targets than lake khanka and environs do you know how big that place is of course youre right commented freeman embarrassed by not having seen such an obvious problem he sure as hell needed some sleep plus continued eleanor once it gets out that we want to go after them by bombing therell be an outcry from every environmental group in the world can you imagine it douglas americans bombing a hallowed bird sanctuary were hated enough already around the world without every bird lover and audubon society on earth screaming bloody murder so whats the best theyll allow us pressed freeman what kind of force can we mobilize moscowll allow an meu to be ferried in by air and for us to hit the terrorists camp but weve only got twentyfour hours max the general was rapidly estimating how much time it would take for a soc meu a specialoperationscapable marine expeditionary unit of two thousand men to be dispatched fight a winter battle win and withdraw thats hardly enough time to well thats all the time theyve given us douglas its nonnegotiable moscow wants to clean up its backyard terrorists as much as we do ours but even with all the goodwill weve engendered between us since the end of the cold war theyre still very prickly about the whole thing its a political minefield for the guys in the kremlin were damned lucky theyll let us in thank god for the kgbcia joint venture against the nuclear scientists trying to hightail it to iran at least thats set a precedent well do we have any humint on the area we have several agents out of harbin taiwanese sleepers cia has asked them to send out burst intel transmits to the seventh fleet in the taiwanese straits our meu attached to the fleet will be going in from the yorktown well thats the best news ive heard so far freemans last specop into north korea had gone in from yorktown it was a ton waspclass lhdb landinghelicopterdock ship part of the us marines gator navy socalled because of the potent amphibian force the marines had proved to be in the victorious but bloody landings from guadalcanal to saipan it was complete with fortyfive assorted choppers several of the hybrid ospreys two vstolvertical or short takeoff or landing planes joint strike fighters and three lcacs which were hovercraft landing craft we have another piece of information eleanor told him our military attaché in berlin has received humint from germany that nanotech highprecision lathes are on the move east anyway the president wanted me to seek your counsel i dont know mused freeman itll be a very tricky operation any which way you look at it thats why said eleanor the president wants you to lead it will you the moment he hung up margaret knew surely you didnt accept it she asked freeman said nothing oh douglas im no politician but cant you see what this is an honor honor its oh douglas i wish youd stop saying oh douglas anybodyd think id robbed a goddamn bank but she wouldnt be deterred im no military expert lord knows but i can see a trap when its staring me in the face i havent spent all my time going to bridal showers with linda rushmein margaret he said sharply its obvious why i was chosen im the only goddamned general whos dont use that language please im the only general he said looking for all the world like patton uncaged whos had firsthand experience in the taiga in the un mission i led i mean my whole team has firsthand experience of the terrain and douglas douglas do you honestly believe that you were the first choice he said nothing but the tension could have been cut with a knife its a trap dear a political trap even i can see that no one who cares about his career would dare volunteer cant you see theyre using you what do they care theyre appealing to your ego douglas he gave her a long hard look and turned sharply about snatching up the tv remote its a matter of honor the president asked the president of the united states of america has asked me to finish the job that i started hes obviously got more confidence in me than he strode off into the living room to get the latest update margaret sat or rather slumped down in her lounge chair after a long silence she asked very carefully does the president have any idea of how many terrorists are in this wretched camp near lake khanka he said quietly no no one knows it could be a small outfit or a big complex well have to wait for a recon report from humint from what people on the ground in the area spies he said irritably informers she had her arms folded tightly below her breasts the normally soft features of her face hardened in her fear for him she remembered how catherine used to pray for him every night he was away you could be killed if their base if those people get a chance to tool up for hypersonic weaponry margaret a lot of people including a lot of americans are going to get killed to make matters even worse for margaret cnns marte price in an exclusive from washington dc was confirming that the die had been cast as she spoke a retaliatory us force was being readied for an attack on the terrorists camp at some as yet undisclosed location overseas cnns pentagon correspondent reported that the force would most likely be deployed from one of the united states carrier battle groups such a group would most likely consist of a carrier two frigates two guidedmissile aegis cruisers four destroyers a replenishment vessel and two nuclear attack submarines all in the service of protecting a waspclass helo carrier transport carrying combat troops of a marine expeditionary unit under the command of a fullbird colonel it was not known she told her viewers who would lead the assault but it was rumored by confidential sources within the administration and the pentagon that several of the armed services highestranking field commanders had strenuously objected to any precipitous action citing the unmitigated disaster that was president carters attempt in to rescue american hostages in iran in a similar inout lightning strike it seemed that no one who valued their career prospects wanted anything to do with what marte price was characterizing as a highrisk undertaking did you hear that margaret asked her husband he pretended not to hear closing his eyes he recalled the last known positions of the us navys carrier battle groups and deduced that unless there had been a radical shift in their combat patrol areas it would be admiral crowleys seventh fleet cbg which would be closest to lake khanka if this were the case the meu he was to lead would be that of colonel jack tibbet aboard the yorktown one of admiral crowleys twelvevessels scuttlebutt had it that because the navy as were the other branches of the american armed forces was dangerously overextended it might well be that crowley who used to be captain of the carrier mccain as well as overall admiral of the fleet would have to serve as captain of yorktown as well as admiral of the fleet for the duration of this mission i mean douglas margaret pressed him arent you getting too old for it was the worst possible thing she could have said chapter eleven for domestic consumption the russian president in his distinctive baritone vociferously objected to any interventionist plan against russia by the united states or any other country the truth however was that the russian presidents dire warning wildly greeted by crowds from st petersburg to vladivostok was strictly pro forma for the fact was that within the kremlin from which putin and his successors had tried to govern following the collapse of the soviet union after the cold war there was growing alarm at the rash of rebel commanders who having been suborned by bagmen into becoming rapacious capitalist arms dealers viewed moscow as nothing more than an impediment to their rapidly growing fortunes in this test of wills there were those in the kremlin who harbored a hope that the americans could be used to help redress the imbalance of power in russia wresting control away from moscow and transferring it to powerful regional rebel groups such a group was the triumvirate in russias far east dubbed by big and little two veteran englishspeaking rebel officers of the old kgbs thirteenth directorate as the abc a cabal of three generals mikhail abramov of the siberian sixth armored division viktor beria of the siberian third infantry division and sergei cherkashin of the siberian air defense arm fsb the russian security service the new kgb knew that abc jointly financed by muscovite gangsters and fundamentalist arab groups in the middle east in open defiance of moscow had concentrated and arrayed their forces around lake khanka and were considered to be amongst the best dug in of any of the breakaway rebel units abc had been careful to funnel the initial money provided by their backers into securing the best frontline troops available to defend the lake khanka perimeter and the railhead in the town of gayvoron from which armaments by the ton were being delivered to the port of vladivostok miles to the southeast fsb reported that abc had in effect built a private military economic zone in the far east wherein they could manufacture and export armaments well beyond moscows reach the idea of trying to oust the abc risked a civil war in the area and the very suggestion of yet another civil war in russia and yet another breakaway territory like chechnya was as unpalatable to moscows ruling elite as it was to the civilian population at large and so in one of those strange upsidedown ironies that violated all the tenets of the cold war the kremlin while vigorously objecting to the us plan in public simultaneously saw it as the best chance of ridding moscow of the abc whose socalled business practices pravda declared were even worse than enrons yet moscow knew that the risk the americans would be taking was enormous lake khanka was miles inland from vladivostok moscow knew the americans led by this socalled american legend general freeman would have to not only contend with a vicious ring of sophisticated antiaircraft weaponry including manpads and emplacements of four sams of the type that had downed the american scott bradys fighter over bosnia but also fight against paidoff rebellious elements of the russian navy chapter twelve alerted by their coast watchers and unable to move their lucrative weapons complex abc was waiting and ready for the hundreds of men of the ad hoc russian regiment everything was at stake survival and money in amounts that the three disgruntled exsoviet generals had never dreamed they would be within striking distance of the markup on igla vanguard and pirated stingerdesign manpads alone was percent production costs had fallen drastically with lake khanka providing a guaranteed supply of water for coolant productivity was also spurred on by bonuses for the fast loading of abcs shipcontainersized cargoes of twenty missiles per roro rollon rolloff load mideast sales tripled in the first six months of operation bonuses for overtime so coveted that the soldiers from abramovs tank company berias infantry and chekashins air defense ground crews assembling the delicate guidance heads and percent sulfur solid propellant were breaking all civilian productivity rates set in the goslow environment of the old soviet regime and now they had in their possession the uss supercavitating technology more bonuses as bonuses increased so did expectations the men wanting even more overtime indeed a strict duty roster had to be enforced as some soldiers particularly from berias infantry battalions had been skipping regular perimeter security duty so as to put in overtime on the assembly lines when general beria first heard from big and little in moscow that an attack by the american atfor american antiterrorism force was a possibility he immediately tightened up all perimeter skipping by instituting the death penalty for any russian absentee on the grounds that shirking this duty was desertion it had a salutary effect as those who wanted to make more money selling more missiles to hamas and others were only too willing to inform on comrades whose executions created a vacancy and hence more lucrative overtime on the already lucrative assembly line you wont have to worry about the americans abramov assured beria and cherkashin my tsll take the bastards out before they get a chance to get out of their helicopter seats bullshit announced beria my infantryll be the force thatll settle the matter youll see he slapped cherkashin on the shoulder your air defense missiles and tank rounds cant take out every individual sergei i tell you my ladsll be onto whoever survives their drop drop said abramov brusquely theyre not crazy enough to try parachuting their force in besides bad weather is coming it will be like duck shooting for our men no general the americansll be ferrying them in by helicopter abramov then turned to cherkashin your missile batteries should find them easily not a problem comrade well blow them out of the sky itll be raining americans dead americans they all laughed while none of the three believed it would be a cakewalk it was obvious that the american meu force of twothousandplus marines had no chance of surprising abc when it had to move in from the sea of japan before unleashing any attack even so the three rebel russian generals were determined not to burden themselves with any timewasting formalities that would slow down abcs production lines accordingly the triumvirate phoned each of the companys commanders pointing out to them that insofar as everyones financial future from general to private was on the line thered be no time to implement what they called the restraints of the geneva convention there would be no american prisoners taken should we issue a written directive posited beria why said abramov shrugging at the infantry generals question then its on paper youre not in the party anymore viktor he paused then added remember what happened at the wannsee conference viktor and sergei cherkashin nodded it had been the meeting convened by reinhard heydrich at wannsee in berlin where the final solution of the socalled jewish question was settled of which no copies were to be kept but one copy was and because of this copy adolph eichmann and others paid the price at the beginning of abcs formation they had rationalized their willingness to sell their souls to a terrorist clientele as a decision that was really based on an intention to rebuild and reassert soviet might but putin and others hadnt been able to get a handle on the chechen terrorists and so abc had adopted the oldest rationale for corruption in mankinds history if you cant lick em join em and when they realized the enormous profits to be made selling hitherto stockpiled soviet weaponry to terrorists the crisp sound of newly printed currency soon drowned the conscience of any lingering party loyalist besides there was no turning back the dream of making a bundle retiring to a dacha on the black sea held them in its thrall there would be swimming pools caviar by the bowlful your own private security as you lay in the hot caspian sun and flunkie lawyers arranging for you to go legitimate by investing in the big american pipeline being built through the stans the seven countries that before gorbachev had been soviet republics kept in line by the kind of iron discipline the three generals had used to establish and maintain order at the lake khanka complex any sight of them yet cherkashin the most impatient of the three asked his duty officer who was monitoring the big screen of the air defense radar no sir but well know the second they take off from that helo carrier the yorktown you sure pressed abramov yes general we have people on the coast abramov was now looking down to the right of the radar console at the situation table of the kind used by royal air force controllers during the crucial battle of britain contemplating the cutout silhouettes of the twelve american vessels his oldfashioned reliance on the blackboard amused the younger computerage duty officer but all three of the russian generals had seen what had happened to saddam husseins air force when the americans had taken out the iraqis early warning radar with stealths the iraqis with their sophisticated radar knocked out and without a situation table of the kind abramov was now studying were literally working in the dark and rapidly losing control of their dire situation question is pressed abramov whether the americans will launch fighters from the mccain no said cherkashin confidently moscow might turn a blind eye to a quick insertion of us troops on our soil after all we accepted allied intervention in in archangel but moscows pridell draw the line at permitting foreign fighters in russian airspace what i dont understand said abramov is how american intelligence found its way to us luck proffered beria pure stupid american luck whatever it was put in cherkashin we should make damn sure we get this freeman hes a cunning bastard hes like that patton and thisll be the second time hes been here we dont want to have to deal with him again on this there was unanimous agreement well said beria last i heard our arab friends were working with someone in hamas he paused or perhaps it was the abu hafs almasri martyr brigades some youngster who has lived in america studied there a bomber you mean said cherkashin perhaps said beria i dont know said cherkashin if the americans see anyone coming near them theyll shoot first and ask questions later theyve learned in iraq what we learned in afghanistan arabs have used kids as bombers do we have such people inquired beria no answered abramov but beria has a point last time i was in palestine closing the deal for what will be our first batch of the supercavitating manpads i also came across one of hamass leaders an iranian officer with the abu hafs almasri martyr brigades who had been given the job of mentoring a young boy with jetblack hair and blue eyes he was about eleven maybe twelve years old orphaned as a baby in the iraq war a true little muslim fanatic who the officer told me had been schooled for a time in america immersed in the enemys culture so said cherkashin who despite his brilliance as an air defense commander lacked the kind of forwardlooking imagination abramov possessed ah too young said beria dismissively exactly said abramov warming to his own logic thats precisely my point beria nodded approvingly eager to show that he was as quick as abramov and certainly quicker than cherkashin in seeing where the tank general was going yes a blueeyed kid clever he paused his forehead creased in concentration as he sought to extrapolate from abramovs or rather the terrorists idea the boy could appear injured perhaps caught between us and the americans cherkashin was mulling it over but theyd search him for weapons yes said abramov but that wouldnt be our problem all thats necessary is to have him found by the americans wandering dazed frightened the americans are suckers for a lost kid but cherkashin cautioned all this presupposes freeman will be here that he wont be directing operations aboard york city yorktown abramov corrected him adding i hope your knowledge of our air defense ring sergei is better than your knowledge of general freeman like patton hes always with his men hell come believe me hell lead them in the kid you saw pressed beria this blueeyed americanhater you say hes been to america yes yes said abramov of course probably sent him in with illegals across the canadian border for how long i dont know but hes now back in pakistan at one of their holywar madrassa schools i saw him briefly in islamabad when i did the last arms sale you think it might be possible asked beria for hamas to get him here in say the next twentyfour hours of course said abramov sharply if we offer to help them kill an american legend the arabs will send him on a flying carpet dont worry well get him one way or the other which reminds me have all platoon commanders been shown that photo of him on the net every infantryman has the photo beria assured the tank commander and ive personally put a bonus of ten thousand dollars on his head abramov pleasantly surprised gave one of his rare smiles and your men commander he asked cherkashin my men have also been promised high bonuses he thought of his brother grimacing with the memory of the day he was killed in combat against the usled un peacekeeping action in sibir a mm sabot round from one of freemans abrams tanks had hit the t cherkashin looked as if he could see straight through the thick cement walls of the subterranean bunker there had been nothing left his brother had been vaporized if my men capture him beria told cherkashin ill make sure they hand him over to you and my men abramov assured him will do the same it was near dusk and before it got too dark abramov wanted to inspect the sixths tank commanders and make sure everyone was maintaining high alert and with cherkashins mention of tank ammunition he wanted to quiz the gunners to make certain that in addition to he rounds they would have enough armorpiercing sabot rounds with which to repel the americans who because of abcs firstrate camouflage would be coming in blind if theyd be coming at all many at abcs lake khanka complex believed that after all the huffing and puffing in washington was over there would be no attack that the americans were all talk as abramov walked outside as expected he couldnt see any tanks and the marshland waters were turning golden in the fading sun chapter thirteen on the lower decks of the waspclass helocarriertransport yorktown the marine expeditionary unit under the command of colonel jack tibbet was being assembled the air was thick with the smell of oil and the shuddering roar of engines and giant exhaust fans as tibbets marines reviewed lastminute details prior to going topside to hear the mission commander general freeman give his preop address there was an understandable expectation that the general if not being outright contrite after the humiliation of losing the terrorists trail would at least be apologetic about having to put the meu in harms way because of his foulup at priest lake back home in both the foreign antiamerican press and the leftofcenter liberal press at home he was being portrayed despite his earlier accomplishments and battle honors as a loser as he slowly reluctantly shuffled his way in the confusion of the lower deck toward the elevator young peter norton the son of robert norton freemans former secondincommand from his russia days was one of those marines who werent looking forward to what must be the generals mea culpa to have the terrorists americans suck note flashed around the world by al jazeera was bad enough but to have the man who had failed the mission bare himself in front of the men and women he was now expected to lead fearlessly into battle was something that no marine wanted to either hear or witness it was a violation of strict marine tradition to go into a battle zone under anyone but their own even if freeman was an ex full general of the army but if there was one thing that the americanled war against terrorism all over the world had taught the marines and every other branch of the armed services it was that traditional ways of doing things often had to be overruled in the interest of expediency yorktown was the nearest meu ready to go it had been as simple as that there was a somber mood throughout the ship and little of the light banter that normally preceded an meu op everyone knew that freemans foray into this rebelheld russian territory could be freemans folly if what was euphemistically referred to as unsettled weather conspired with the crack russian defenders whose forebears in their ubiquitous ts had stopped the german panzers in the terrible massed winter battles of and peter norton harboring the chilling possibility of having to drive his pound cargocarrying hummer in the vicinity of the rebel russian tanks was in the grip of an icecold fear having been demoted from fullcombatmarine status to combat driver he was depressed enough already without having to think about being thrust into or anywhere near a heavily defended enemy position he had begun experiencing the chestgripping profusesweating im going to die anxiety attacks a few months before out of concern for his own wellbeing and as a machine gunner aboard one of the meus ground teams armored hummers he had dutifully reported to sick bay and the panic attacks had quickly been brought under control by a daily dose of ten milligrams of the antianxiety medication paxil but he had not been sufficiently alert to the fact that the navy into whose organization the marines were integrated remains the most traditionbound of the armed services as well as being the most senior service it remains deeply suspicious of shrinks whether they be psychologists or psychiatrists in peter nortons case the navy was even more rattled by the acronym pius possible instability under stress peter hadnt told any of his marine buddies about his connection with freeman nor had he tried to use his father or freeman who it was unlikely even knew he was on the yorktown to pull strings to overturn the damning psychological profile that he was sure had cost him promotion and a reduction in pay when he heard the criticism of freeman aboard yorktown peter was even more convinced that he had done the right thing in not owning up to any connection to the man whom most of peters marine buddies resented having been placed in overall command of the meu but he did regret reporting the panic attacks though nothing was said to him directly norton found his responsibilities further decreased and when the mission was announced his official designation was no longer combat driver but standby support driver and the only reason he had been assigned this job as a foodsupply driver in colonel tibbets battalion hq was that the armed forces were spread so thinly in the farflung world war against terrorism that all trained personnel including drivers were scarce in the tightly packed claustrophobic fuelladen atmosphere on the vehicle decks he was finding it difficult to breathe he felt the old chestgripping fear rising in him and as a psychological diversionary tactic began checking his stack of dark brown plasticwrapped mames marine meals which as cold rations designed out of the marine battle lab in quantico virginia were far superior to the usual mres meals readytoeat which troops frequently threw away because what the mres provided in nutrients they lacked in taste colonel tibbet passed by the tall lean marine commanding officer nodding to norton on his way then he stopped and turned on his heel norton peter norton right yes sir answered peter with some timidity you were the guy who suggested we stock up on what was it mars bars for the next combat ration yessir replied peter obediently then typically added but it wasnt my idea sir it was general freemans freemans said tibbet with obvious surprise you know general freeman no sir well not personally but he sent a memo to the quartermaster general after hed found out how the brits on the ships during the falklands war passed on all their rations and went instead for mars bars tibbet was nodding knowingly huh sugar surge i guess makes sense but general freeman shouldve recommended hershey bars yes sir tibbet moved on toward the tow antitankmissileloaded humvees that would be airlifted by one of the yorktowns super stallions unless there was interference in the assemblage of the air force from the yorktown by foreign aircraft in such a case the yorktowns marine vstol harriers would provide a potent protective screen for the meu force the harriers were tasked with going in to destroy what the meu s intel chief had been convinced by mccains signal exploitation space and by humint routed to the mccain by the us embassy in beijing and the shanghai trade office was a russian complex near lake khanka and its marshlands there was a problem however with the satpix it showed an hshaped building but no antiaircraft emplacements and a mobile aa battery was everyones nightmare on such an op that is one of the nightmares it was general freemans comment about the unusual number of airborne birds cluttering the satellite images of the area that had first aroused the meus intel chiefs interest freeman had pointed out to him that the fact of the birds constantly rising circling and landing on the lakeneurotically freeman had said pointed to a terrestrial anomaly that must be frightening the shit out of the cranes et cetera causing them to take flight much more often than what an ornithological report confirmed was normal if there was an earthquake freeman had told the officers mess on yorktown the entire area would liquefy its liquefied already general true what i meant captain was that even the wooded areas that we might rely on would simply become a vast slurry awful for armor what spooked the marines intel officer most was the sheer volume of bird traffic being monitored in the blue tile country the bluetiled inner sanctum of the uss mccains signal exploitation space compared to what was normal neurotic he decided was an apt description of the avian activity now colonel tibbet was inspecting the line of stingermounted humvees two swivelmounted boxes on each one of the ten vehicles contained four antiaircraft missiles eight stingers in all a potent defense system by any measure after a quick inspection of these units he walked quickly past the supply humvees which because his mission was not an amphibiouslanding op as such would have to be delivered together with extra fuel bladders by helo sling and would have to carry the total supply load from prepackaged meals to gas masks a job usually shared by the marines fiveton trucks which the yorktowns big landing craft ferried ashore after the troops disembarked but this kitdo or kickinthedoor operation as the troops called it to lake khanka was to be confined to airlift only tibbet was about to leave the vehicle deck and walk up one of the many internal ramps between decks to the big hangar when he paused and called back to peter norton howd you know it was general freeman who sent that memo my dad told me sir your dad yes sir he used to be the generals ic huh said tibbet wondering why the son of a g hadnt risen any higher than a driver no shame in it but not what youd expect general freemans stentorian voice coming on the yorktowns public address system sounded as if it was coming from on high its tone brooking neither interruption nor contradiction shit opined one marine sounds like moses this is no apology peter norton told himself this was an old blood n guts georgie patton speech and what made it doubly impressive or eerie depending on the audience of two thousand marines scattered throughout the ship was freemans likeness on the monitors to the controversial world war ii general reincarnation said a machine gunner bullshit responded another what dyou think norton peter shrugged dont know its going around town boomed the general that im a tired old horse now i take umbrage at that ive been a horses ass but ive never been old there was a smattering of laughter tween decks and on the yorktowns roof where the flight crews in the preemptory ballet of war were busily parking the first five of the helo carriers fifteen big super stallions the choppers in takeoff line rotors still folded like the wings of enormous sleeping dragonflies what makes it worse continued freeman is that the joker who said im a horses ass was a liberal mondaymorning quarterbacking son of a bitch who wouldnt know a condom from a balloon the marines roared their approval getting into it now marine commander tibbet high up on the islands bridge was shaking his head as he stared down at freeman who he saw had climbed atop one of the big super stallions cockpits even as its deck crew fittested the helos cargo hook and bananashaped sling that comment about liberalsll be on cnn in about five minutes tibbet complained to yorktowns diminutive captain crowley the mans got no sense of i dont know why lord why crowley petitioned heaven did he have to have george patton reincarnated on his boat a naval captain like anyone else abhorred controversy technically crowley mused as long as freemans on my boat hes under my command technically now continued freeman i want to tell you men and women that if i were you id be a mite teed off at suddenly being under the command of a horses ass a roar of laughter erupted tween decks flowing up from the vehicle and hangar deck over the ramps spilling out onto the flight deck but im here to tell you that ive seen my share of combat and ive still got some ideas about how to deal with scumbags and he was interrupted by another roar this one of such anger that it startled yorktowns captain but turned colonel tibbets frown into a knowing smile their blood was up and i want to tell you thundered the general that i and my team of veterans are here to work with you not over you this is from first to last colonel tibbets show im here in an advisory capacity only but youll see me around he paused not sitting like a horses ass but galloping in with your super stallions and there was clapping and cries of way to go general and continued freeman arms akimbo his camouflaged fritz with its airborne strap cupping his chin i intend to shit all over those comrades who give our enemies the means to kill our children are you ready hooha came the guttural marine response god bless you all freeman told them and god bless america the cheers of the marines were now interrupted by the coughing spitting noise of the helicopter engines starting in unison their collective roar amid the choking exhaust fumes drowning out the war cries of the first wave of marines to embark on the mission which freeman had suggested should be called operation bird rescue the president had thought it a brilliant choice so politically astute that he had sent a short thankyou note the heavily laden marines filed up from the cavernous recesses of the yorktown moving antlike along the flight deck and disappearing into the bellies of the super stallions whose giant rotors threw circles of dazzling transparent sunlight signaling that each of the choppers titaniumforged blades had now joined one of the earsplitting concerts of war in yorktowns landing force operations center deep within the o deck freeman like tibbet loaded for bear was going over their joint plan of attack like all good plans in life and in battle it was simple in concept of course the devil as always was in the details first yorktowns cobra gunships would ride shotgun on both the northern and southern flanks of yorktowns helo stream second the cobras fed satpix intel would soften up all of the rebel aa defenses leaving tibbets first wave of infantry to go in and gut the abc complex humint assets believed the two twostory structures connected at their midpoints by a twostory ferro cement walkway and surrounded by a virtually treeless onesquaremile perimeter comprised the central cog in abcs operation the complex was believed to be the place where the manufacture of terrorist weapons had made what the pentagons practitioners of the dismal science of economics referred to as a quantum leap in economies of scale all of which was pretentious pentagon jargon for the fact that terrorist weapons manufactured in the abc complex had shifted from the garages of the middle east to highefficiency americanstyle assembly lines moscow freeman understood had still not given official permission for the american helos to enter russian airspace it being accepted by washington that on advice from the united nations there would be an outraged denunciation of the us choppers presence led by the russian delegate petrov and supported by the french this was also accepted by the white house as necessary to make the russian president look tough even while it offered him a chance to be rid of the rebel abc without having to commit regular russian troops to fight russians what the russian president had not clarified however was whether american fighters or bombers would be permitted to enter russian airspace but he had reiterated to washington that he would be able to restrain regular russian air force and naval units from becoming embroiled with the meu for only a maximum of twentyfour hours douglas freeman assured colonel tibbet and yorktowns crowley that as titular head of the meus operation he would take full responsibility for releasing yorktowns harriers and mccains joint strike fighters against the abc complex at lake khanka should a russian air attack threaten american lives fleet wont go for this yorktowns captain crowley warned freeman and tibbet freemans jaws tightened lets get one thing straight gentlemen ive been personally tapped by the president of the united states to be the seniorranking officer to command the operation as such its not my intention to go running around the damn fleet getting permission slips so i can leave the room and go to the toilet is that understood tibbet was noncommittal the yorktowns skipper however was not so sanguine about freemans willingness to act independently of him as admiral of the fleet general the yorktown skipper informed him a quick enciphered email to the white house could clear this up with all due respect sir freeman replied by the time they fart around in that situation room down in that washington basement hell i mean half of those jokers down there dont know where baltimore is let alone this damned lake itll be hours before we get the green light that time lost could cost us marine lives a lot of lives and now that our chief source of realtime intel cnn has blabbed it all over that were about to go in after this abc complex the enemyll be dug in even more than usual securing their defensive perimeter like theres no tomorrow and lets hope theres no goddamned armor about freeman added i say lets quit pigfrigging around with emails to the white house release your harriers upon request by either the colonel or me i told you ill take the rap you can afford to retorted crowley youre retired he immediately wished he hadnt said it tibbet was watching the general and he saw freemans face redden in controlled anger retired or not retorted freeman i have the little matter of my reputation at stake you gentlemen know how it goes in our business youre as good as your last op like a damn movie star one big flop and youre in the doghouse priest lakes my doghouse and i want out badly but im not going into this just because i want to save my ass or get my picture on the cover of time im doing this for those poor bastards lawabiding americans who were just sitting there working one moment and were blown to smithereens the next by those scumbags tibbet had no difficulty in imagining fire coming from the generals nostrils anyway the general continued if our helos dont take at least one round from russian ground defenses ill eat my hat and if they do thatll justify release of the harriers crowley hoped the russians wouldnt violate the twentyfourhour agreement with washington but if they did the fighterbombers would certainly come in handy admiral it was his duty officer a few minutes later crowley informed freeman my do tells me theres been a leak were being inundated with email requests about bird rescue some correspondents including a gal from newsweek are saying the name the pentagon gave to this mission is a cynical ploy to win over the environmentalist lobby in support of yet another unilateral us invasion would you comment invasion freeman said angrily this is an operation to chase down a bunch of goddamn murderers you can tell them from me that wait a second general said crowley who instructed one of his computer operators to take down freemans comment verbatim tell them said freeman that the list of endangered species on lake khanka is as long as your goddamned arm the one to give to the media is the grus japonensus half those liberal bastards might even be able to spell it its a very rare endangered species of redcrowned crane and theres a critter called the sheathfish endemic to the region freeman turned to colonel tibbet i like giving the bastards that one jack just watch and wait for one of the tv anchors to keep a straight face with sheath ah crowley told the computer operator i suggest you clean that up a little before you send it okay with you douglas colonel tibbet grinned welcoming a flash of levity to the occasion and freeman readily agreed there was no point in deliberately riling them up it reminded him of marte price and his deal with her to give her first crack at an exclusive in return for her having come clean about the governments initial and futile attempt to keep the attack on darpa alpha under wraps they could all hear the mounting thunder on the roof and the appearance of tibbets s the marines intel chief confirmed the meu was ready to rocknroll look freeman told tibbet and crowley if we can knock these bastards out at khanka it wont be just them and the terrorists stockpile well be taking out gentlemen itll be a lesson to any other ragtag damn terrorists that no matter what it takes when you kill americans well come after you in your own damn country if need be so that captain crowley here might even release his harriers ill put the harriers on standby said crowley thats as far as ill go for now freeman shook his hand maybe cut in tibbet trying to help his old naval colleague crowley stand his ground against douglas freemans wellintentioned but relentless charge you tried to reach washington to get weaponsfree for the harriers but your encrypting program temporarily crashed freeman winked at tibbet i like it crowley kept a straight face ill take that under advisement john cuso the executive officer who had been seconded from mccain to yorktown to assist crowley had seen his share of helo assaults launched from the ship but it was always a new and exciting experience for him from vultures row high in the control island cuso looked down at the frantic yet endlessly rehearsed preparations for combat he could see the fifteen super stallions and tibbet and freeman crouching low as each was hurried aboard his respective chopper a lead super stallion for freeman his sixman specop team mortar squad and other marines aboard a command huey for tibbet cuso wondered how many would return what had hitler said making war was like grabbing a gun and walking into a pitchblack room anything could happen each of the fifteen super stallions in yorktowns thirtytwohelo force would be carrying fifty fully loaded marines which meant putting marines in the target zone in the first assault wave providing there was no interference en route each of the big stallions had threecaliber machine guns one located in the forward starboard crew door and two on pivot mounts for openramp firing all three weapons fed by linkedbeltcaliber ammunition as the air armada rose above a blue choppy sea twothirds of the total marine meu combat force was en route toward the rugged coast of russias far east which was already in sight as a dark squiggle on the horizon aboard his huey colonel tibbet was doublechecking the landing area selected from the satpix where two super stallions were to deposit their slingcarried fifteenthousandpound bladders of aviation fuel for both helos and harriers should it become necessary to call for the harriers to provide close air support and enough loiter time over the target during the vital refueling squads of marines would rush to form a defensive perimeter screen though it was not anticipated that much ground fire at all would be encountered given the absence of troops on sigint and satpix intel though clouds appeared to be thickening and were clustering ominously along the coast forming a line of ragged gray ahead of them the rising of the thirtytwoaircraft armada made an impressive sight an able force if ever hed seen one thought tibbet whose high morale had been duly noted by peter norton who in an attempt to contain his rising fear before the mission had closed his eyes trying to concentrate on the happiest most relaxing times of his youth picnicking and swimming in the james river to beat the awful humid heat of august as the lowflying meu approached the coast a russian fishermancumcoastwatcher alexander rostovich whose great grandfather had been killed as an adviser to ho chi minhs legions against the americans in vietnam was awakened to the choppers sound grabbing his binoculars he glimpsed a white us star with a white bar either side of it on one of the incoming helos of the us air armada racing into his fishing hut where he kept an old but reliable mm mauser that was always loaded for the sharks that bothered his nets when he was fishing off timpevay bay or for bears that could wipe out a years carefully tended vegetable patch in a few seconds rostovich raised the weapon and let fly a round at the armada pulled back the bolt swearing as he did so rammed another round home and fired again by sheer dumb luck this round hit the cockpit of a stallion spiderwebbing the copilots window screen and narrowly missing his head ground fire the copilot reported three oclock from that hut down by that garden anyone see it along the cliff edge ive got it stallion hes mine came a voice the violation of radio silence no serious thing given the number of helos that were airborne and clearly visible to isolated settlements along the coast in addition the abc thanks to cnn al jazeera and all the others clearly knew that the strike was imminent one of the supercobras feared by and known to saddams soldiers as the skinny birds peeled off into a steep mph dive the helo firing its threebarrel rotary chinmounted chain gun the oneinfive red tracers dancing crazily about the hut the hut collapsed as did rostovich there was no fire or explosion nothing more than a cloud of dust rising above the imploded hut the coastwatcher lying spreadeagled in a garden of collapsed trellises little chance he was still alive in any event the target had been neutralized even so jack tibbet did a oneeighty and called for the six harriers there was no way he could know how much ground fire was about to open up and with crowleys blessing decided that hed rather be called overcautious than unnecessarily risk his marines on the coast before they reached the target blackbirds go ordered crowley and within minutes the harriers electing to make their short takeoff over the vertical lift to conserve fuel were aloft freeman simultaneously requesting mccains vertical takeoff joint strike fighters to assist in suppression of hostile ground fire should it become necessary the latter phrase a qualifier indicating that the american aircraft would not fire unless fired upon a political fiction that might qualify as an acceptable order in the byzantine business of the militarys postop inquiries all that was known in the fleet was that a super stallion had taken a hit and no the copilot rudely informed tibbets g it was not a fucking bird it was a fucking round a fucking mm rolling around in the damn cabin for all anyone including freeman and tibbet whose lead helos had already passed well beyond the fishermans hut knew the entire helo armada might be coming under ground fire all everyone had heard for certain was that radio silence had been broken because a super stallion had come under ground fire the stallion had taken a direct hit soon the rumor amongst the fully laden combat troops wedged uncomfortably between their webseats and the fuselage was that a stallion had gone down anyone get out dont know shit in aussie lewiss wry assessment the usual fuckups had begun where are those friggin blackbirds asked the stallions copilot who had narrowly missed being killed on the way his pilot told him relax yeah right relax evers repeated the pilot more sternly i know this is your first hot mission but weve a ways to go freeman and tibbet know what theyre doing yeah sorry its okay i know its hard dave but youve been trained by the best youll be fine but there was trouble aboard the stallion it was coming from a hoarsevoiced general douglas freeman who by sheer accident during a chat with a mortar crewman discovered that the marine indeed the entire mortar crew and one of its mamarinetrained snipers aboard the stallion had by some oversight been through marine colonel cobb martens weapons training battalion made famous by colonel michael nance without having been given an ak or ak familiarization course freeman told the pilot to radio tibbet who redfaced sent an encrypted fastblast message to yorktown to the effect that anyone waiting in the second wave who was not familiar with firing either the ak or ak must be so instructed immediately there was a problem there were no aks or aks on the yorktown it was an american ship for crying out loud what was the generals thunderous reply he couldnt believe that in the twelve vessels that constituted the seventh fleet there wasnt a single ak in any of the ships armories it seemed particularly improbable given the popularity of the virtually indestructible russian weapon among british and american special ops teams like his i know where therere some aussie lewis assured him unofficial of course theyve got em stashed in mccains armory theres an exmarine captain there with special arms training he was wounded in iraq hes now working in mccains blue tile hes ah what you might call a collector is he said freeman who turning to lieutenant terry chester one of jack tibbets platoon commanders ordered message yorktown that colonel tibbet and i expect every marine to know how to fire and strip an ak before our stallions return to pick them up if we get into a logistics screwup and anyone runs short of ammo an ak snatched off a dead russian might be the thing that turns the tide on the yorktown the generals turn the tide phrase was met with skepticism but not as one might have expected by the veterans who knew how an extra clip of ammo could save your hide the skepticism came more from those young leathernecks who hadnt been in action before whose number comprised about seven hundred of the meus total sixteen hundred personnel some of them such as young peter norton who though he had never met freeman knew something of him understood that he was fanatical about logistical details one of his ruling adages being for want of a nail the shoe was lost for want of a shoe the horse was lost for want of a horse the kingdom was lost and had they known freeman skeptics would also have known that douglas freemans attention to logistical detail had been justified by every hostile engagement hed been part of how far to target aussie asked the stallions burly crew chief a hundred and fortyseven miles said the chief that by road aussie asked leaning forward expectantly elbows pressing down hard on his pack sal and gomez were watching intently as the crow flies answered the crew chief well said aussie im not a fucking crow and sat back visibly more relaxed so were the other team members it was a curious good luck ritual for aussie normally the least superstitious of men at some point at the beginning of a mission he would always ask the crew chief how far to target and hold his breath if the reply was so many miles or clicks aussie would ask that by road and the reply common enough in the airborne services was usually as the crow flies as long as the crew chiefs answer had crow in it it was a sign to aussie that the mission would be successful ya hear that boys he shouted at his team as the fucking crow flies what said sal absently checking his weapon oh yeah crow right gonna be a piece o cake said aussie no problem said freeman who was keen to maintain high morale but he and tibbet had pored over the logistics of the devils domain and knew the crucial element on this mission was not surprise that had been lost because of cnn but rapid resupply otherwise as the general and colonel concurred it could be a monumental ballsup the generals second priest lake what the general hadnt told aussie or the team had never told them was that he made it his business before every mission to give the crew chief aboard their helo or landing craft a headsup about aussies crow in a team where there were few if any secrets this was an exception that the general had made no matter how close he and his men had become over the years he believed that for each member there had to be a moat across which neither friend nor foe should venture an inviolable port that was the private preserve of secrets which only men and their maker knew the terrible memories of comrades lost like bone brady the fatally wounded specop soldier whom years before douglas freeman had shot at pointblank range it was the mans face head flung back eyes rolling comically and all the more grotesquely for that bloodied teeth bottom jaw sliding from side to side that haunted the general no matter that brady had begged to be put out of his misery the face would rise up in the guttightening minutes before deployment for a moment douglas freemans head slumped in shame but he sat up quickly ramrod straight and made as if to clear his eye of grit always a problem with so many men and things aboard packed tightly together know that fella orwell he shouted at johnny lee limey who wrote that animal farm read it in school said johnny straining for his naturally highpitched voice to rise above the roar of the helos three big turboshafts yeah said freeman pushing bone bradys face out of range turning his attention to maintaining morale well orwell said that he sometimes thought life was a constant battle against dirt freeman wiped his eye with his sleeve hoping that their brownish green camouflage uniforms wouldnt stand out too starkly against the ice in frozen marshland the camouflage would be perfect but not against the white sheet of a frozen lake aussie he called out sir shouted aussie obediently like a good marine that is more formally than he would have had only the team members been present joke ordered the general they hit an air pocket choir barfing asked aussie not yet said salvini is that the joke there was laughter now in the dark stuffy dimly lit interior choir smiled and doffed his fritz to aussie as if his horse had just won the triple crown do said choir raising his voice imitating an upperclass snob tell us your amusement my amusement said aussie head back in mock surprise screwing screwing what shouted a marine name tag picard anything that moves shouted salvini birds said aussie feigning indignation using the australian slang for young women nicelooking birds how bout one of those protected began a marine name tag jackson k who was nursing a squad automatic weapon what dyou call those birds cranes said marine picard yeah would you screw a crane aussie hed have to stand very still aussie answered i wouldnt chase the bugger catcalls and raucous laughter broke out so noisily that they momentarily drowned out the whoomp whoomp of the stallion fussy said choir now adopting a cockney accent that made his pronunciation sound like pussy aussie was suddenly alert pussy where the entire marine platoon was laughing and chortling at the silly banter marine jackson whod initiated the exchange with aussie now being referred to as pussy a name that he knew as a marine would stick to him as long as he was in the corps or dead joke another marine insisted that aussie isnt quitting on us is he no way replied aussie keep it clean said freeman women aboard aussies head shot up where show me where a lone hand was raised she was an african american melissa thomas tibbets meus first woman combatant no problem said aussie its as clean as a whistle stand up someone ordered aussie for the lady sure said aussie i dont mind no shouted a saw gunner so we can fuckin shoot you if it isnt funny that got a big laugh one of the loudest coming from the general who as much as any of them probably wouldnt have laughed at this nonsense during standdown time but whose unspoken anxiety about going into combat would lead him to grasp on to anything that would offer temporary relief well said aussie this young married couple both marines hey shouted someone no samesex marriage in the corps bullshit right thomas right melissa shouted let him finish said a gunny one of those sergeants who ran the corps right said aussie raising his voice to a near shout can you hear me yeah yeah get on with it so began aussie this couple are arguin about who should get up to make coffee every morning and the guy says to his wife i think you should be the one to brew the coffee youre the woman of the house and she says dont give me that crap were both working so i dont see why you cant get up and brew the coffee so this argument goes on about who should brew the friggin coffee an she sees its going nowhere so she says will you take scriptural authority on this the guy says scriptural you mean the bible she says yeah he thinks for a mo then says okay bring it out and there it was in the new testament hebrews there was a concerted groan within the super stallion shoot im someone shouted but still they liked it the joke had done just what freeman had wanted it to do channeling the precombat jitters especially amongst those such as melissa thomas who tibbet had told freeman had been too young for the war in afghanistan and iraq and for whom operation bird rescue was their first real mission that the general told aussie is the corniest damn joke ive ever heard i like it shouted choir yeah you would said aussie you biblethumping welsh turd thank you riposted choir very much freeman was grinning but melissa thomas sitting at the rear of the starboard row of canvaswebbed seats by the stallions door wasnt she envied the ease with which each member of freemans sixman specwar team enjoyed one anothers humor she still couldnt get that kind of response from her rifle squad no matter that ever since shed responded to the commercial on tv that showed marines fastroping down from a hazegray helicopter freezeframed as they raced into action from the helo shed done all that was required of her can you do it the commercials narrator had challenged if you can youre one of the best her brother danny dissed the ad as elitist and thats precisely what appealed to her that and the stirring background rendition of john philip sousas the stars and stripes forever it was an old story the military as the african americans way out of the ghetto if you couldnt dribble and sink a basketball in her detroit ghetto or get a scholarship to college your horizons were very limited the marine corps after a dogged battle against congress had finally been forced to yield and women were in but that was only half the battle female marines had not been allowed in ground combat units being assigned to operation bird rescue meant that melissa thomas was the first female marine in history to be purposely put in harms way rather than in a supportive capacity aboard ship melissa had learned much particularly about selfreliance the corps having the lowest officertopersonnel ratio in any of the united states armed forces and she said a prayer asking god to help her to be strong conscious of the fact that she was a trailblazer not only as an african american but as the first female marine to be in combat on the ground she thought of the bus journey to parris island along the lonely twolane elevated road over the swamps and the ebb and flow of the salt marshes of south carolinas port royal sound recalling the moment when shed first come to stand in the painted yellow footprints in front of the receiving shed knowing that there were drill instructors who wanted her to fail ever since she was a young girl in detroit she had always wanted to be part of a shipboard marine contingent her uncle explaining how a marines original role in the english navy was to go aloft high into the rigging so as to snipe the enemy and to enforce the captains discipline on their own ship with images of raising old glory on iwo jima dancing in her head during the hard unforgiving physical and mental conditioning of parris now behind her she had become the first ever female marine combatant to be assigned to an amphibious unit aboard the floating military airbase called yorktown but with few exceptions melissa had been only grudgingly accepted by her fellow marines an outsider informally assigned to little more than swab deck status aboard yorktown no matter that she had qualified in everything they threw at her shed run the marine gauntlet from the recruits fright night in her forming phase to phase is backbreaking sinewsapping pt to phase iis mastery of the ma mm combat rifle to north carolinas camp lejeune as the first female recruit ever to attend the school of infantry hitherto the sole preserve of male recruits and finally there was graduation day when her di presented her with the coveted eagletopped globe and anchor emblem of the united state marine corps and for melissa the special moment when she introduced her dad now frail with age and eyes brimming with tears of pride to di morgana schmidt schmidt a black belt level martial arts drill instructor of the fourth recruit training battalion had overseen recruit thomas and the other recruits in the platoon all the way from pickup briefing to graduation carefully at times roughly guiding melissa through the morphing of yet another civilian into a united states marine as the super stallion hit a series of sharp wind shears she felt a wave of nausea pass through her something she had not felt since experiencing what her di had introduced as a visit to the pool a gross understatement if melissa had ever heard one of the terrifying requirement of each marine to float in full battle dress and boots in the dreaded watertraining facility even now the memory of impending drowning and the palpable dread one experienced on approaching the hated drop boards over the water which she like any other recruit had to master still haunted her dreams and now as the stallion continued to buck she prayed to god as she had prayed with the yorktowns padre that she would not find herself in deep water in combat as they approached the gray sockedin coastline of russias wild and lonely far eastern coast turbulence struck the super stallions need a bag sal asked choir how bout a bucket proffered aussie choirs expression segued from mild anxiety into a broad smile im feeling great the stallion dropped again the gforce lifting many of the marines off the webseats to clearly voiced expressions of disapproval from the men and melissa who on this helo alone formed a third of the meus bravo rifle company which in turn constituted one of the three rifle companies of what would be the meus battalion landing team freeman saw the alarm on melissas face but it vanished as quickly as it had appeared marine discipline arresting any potential show of alarm for her to have complained or even sworn would have immediately been seen as a typical skirt reaction the parent in freeman wanted to reassure her that the turbulence would probably subside as soon as they passed over the coastal mountains between glazkovka and cape titova on the air route that he and tibbet had selected through the valleys between the kiyevka and ussuri rivers but the officer in him told him not to single her out it would only reinforce her marginalization which hed sensed albeit subtly during liftoff from yorktown still well announced the stallions crew chief were well past cape titova hoots and laughter followed bring it on yelled someone freeman saw melissa thomas smile trying to be one of the boys and he empathized with her sense of being an outsider everyone had such moments and thought about how he might help her to feel included in the team he asked a marine in the mortar squad a loader about thomass classification shes an e ss sir ah said freeman the designation telling him she was a private first class with sniping credentials impressive yes sir continued the loader shes a good shot a good shot was an understatement ss told the general that this marine with the shy dark eyes had been tough enough to have graduated from parris with not only a high score in marksmanship but also the designation scoutsniper it was an outstanding achievement but for a woman in a mans world it was yet another way of moving herself albeit unwittingly further from her fellow marines the rifle with the big scope told freeman that melissa must have been able to repeatedly hit a mansized target in the head at ranges greater than half a mile you didnt have to be a giant to do that occasionally but to do it consistently meant you had to be strong and have iron nerves nerves of iron freeman used to tell his recruits not nerves of steel because steel springs back at you no you need iron will to lie there for hours in your hide not moving so much as a hair waiting controlling your bladder sphincter through sheer will you might have the luxury of a scope spotter to share the mission with you or you might be alone it was douglas freemans intention as had always been his inclination to make the outsider feel at home a collective groan greeted another sudden gutplummeting drop in an air pocket aussie catching a glimpse out of one of the super stallions starboard windows of a white squiggle of river which he guessed must be the kiyevka and farther west ragged fragments of mountain mist above woods that in parts obliterated the sliver of another river cutting through forests as thick and dark as anything hed seen on the other side of the world at priest lake the general too had seen the black forests and detected a heightened tone of urgency rushing back from the stallions cockpit into the forty or so packladen marines of bravo rifle company for a millisecond eddie mervyn and interpreter johnny lee saw what looked like a marine harrier diving through the gray stratus and detected an acrid smell invading the cabin hold tight yelled the crew chief evasive action another fucking fisherman said aussie more than one said the crew chief unsmilingly the stallion was bucking and yawing violently amid a black pockscarred sky the pilot battling the yoke fighting to evade the aa fire oh shit said a marine one of the few who had a clear view through one of the square windows over the helos stubby portside wing a loud ripping noise cut through the vibrating roar of the stallions three engines and the deep thumping of its rotors as the helos gunners opened up hot shell casings momentarily glinting golden in a sudden sunbeam that quickly disappeared into the stratus the stallion was on instrument flying the copilot thanking god for the upgrade that had finally given the ches the forwardlooking infrared and radar eight oclock eight oclock aa the ramps rightside rear gunner was shouting to alert his ramp and crewdoor colleagues aussie was able to glimpse only part of the helos two arcs of red tracer that were streaming earthward as they sought to silence the two antiaircraft batteries manned by gunners who from this height looked no bigger than toys more at six bellowed eddie mervyn i see em acknowledged the crewdoor gunner this was followed by long concerted bursts from the stallions gunners the interior of the fuse the stallions long troop cabin filling with coughinducing cordite fumes together with the smell of perspiring bodies the heat having been turned way up to counteract the freezing rush of the slipstream through the open ramp and front crew door aussie saw freeman talking animatedly on the radio phone and then caught sight of the harrier its mm gau cannon obliquely spitting devastating white fire into both aa batteries knocking them out several marines were being sick without time to grab the thick brown paper lunch bags issued earlier by the crew chief over the noise of machinegun fire the rotors whoomp whoomp and engines roaring there was now a series of almost inaudible soft popping noises as the stallion released its flares in hopes of drawing any antiaircraft missiles to them rather than to the helo upon entering russian airspace everyone with the bird rescue armada had been worrying about sams the big russian surfacetoair missiles that had taken such a heavy toll of the bs and other american aircraft in nam freeman however with the priest lake catastrophe fresh in mind was more worried about the smaller deadly igla and other shoulderfired manpads at this relatively low altitude iglas had a range of more than two miles he was praying that the aa gunfire was all the flak that would come the helos way the general checked the super stallions airspeed indicator mph with the stallions engines on maximum power they should be over the site soon unless more aa batteries were waiting in ambush down the valley a marine lurched forward his insides blown across the aisle there was a tremendous flapping noise as ragged aluminum edging from the fistsized hole that had been shot out of the stallions starboard side trembled violently like a flag in a stiff gale there was panic half a dozen marines covered in entrails and blood one of the most disgusting sights freeman and his team had ever seen the crew chief though had witnessed it before and with astonishing agility given the crazy gyrations of the stallion as its pilots fought to regain control after the impact he had produced two large khaki plastic bags which he dumped at the feet of those covered in the blood and entrails which moments before had been their buddy private first class james cartwright this bag yelled the crew chief opening one has clean rags in it the other is for the dirty rags got it one marine his face splattered with his dead comrades blood and other unidentifiable pieces of flesh and bone couldnt respond his eyes frozen his body rigid with fear the crew chief shook him hard by the shoulder the chiefs canvas glove immediately soaking up blood hey shouted the chief his right hand grabbing the marines chin you hear me marine he said it with a dis command voice an undisguised call to duty a tone born and bred daily by the corps in the corps for the corps the marine answered the crew chief by assuring him that he was okay freeman glimpsed a marine beside him it was melissa thomas down on her knees by the dead marine placing a red gelatinous lump of something she picked up into the dump bag the aa fire was already past but no one noticed for several seconds freemans team had seen dead and dying from southeast asia to iraq but several of the marines were traumatized by the sight of one of their comrades with his entrails blasted out of him aussie assured the traumatized marine youll be right mate hang on unable to find his lunch bag in time the marine was throwing up violently into his helmet he fumbled for his canteen nah said aussie giving the marine his own sick bag and taking the mans helmet from him aussie turned to the crew chief got some extra water chief right with you said the chief and went back to his seat under which he had a fourgallon plastic drum of distilled water which he passed to aussie the specfor man dumped the helmets contents into the big plastic out bag the cloying stench of sick mixing with the smell of aviation exhaust was enough to make several others feel ill including johnny lee and choir aussie washed out the sick marines helmet and gave it back to him his name patch read r kegg listen aussie lied to the grateful young marine who looked no older than sixteen combatll be easier than this the marine nodded thank you sir anytime mate aussie could see however that the young marine was abnormally strung out with anxiety listen press your tongue hard up against your palate it forces you to breathe deeply youll relax aussie paused they teach you that at parris i wasnt at parris sir the youngster said almost apologetically oh said aussie so you must live west of the ole mississippi you were trained at point loma then yes sir im a im a hollywood marine he tried to smile so did they teach you that trick what oh about pressing yeah pressing your tongue against the roof of your mouth no sir well what the fuck did they teach you said aussie smiling he turned to melissa thomas who was helping to clean up the mess did you learn that at parris im not sure she answered embarrassed by the sudden attention not sure hey aussie yelled so loudly he startled young kegg you marines listen up a tip from uncle lewis on long op flights or short ones in any sticky situation you press your tongue hard up against your palate you will get more oxygen it helps believe me who are you demanded a marine grandstander offered another aussie ignored them and winked at melissa who was helping him and who unlike some of the others understood that aussie lewis was only trying to boost morale distracting them from the horror that had been visited upon them by the antiaircraft fire youve seen this stuff before aussie told melissa i was a nurses helper in an er for a while she replied before i joined the corps good for you marine said aussie melissa returned the smile which given the bloody circumstances aboard the super stallion struck some of the marines as disrespectful at best at worst obscene in the presence of the dead marine but melissa couldnt help her response to aussie it was the first time since parris that a man and a renowned specwar warrior at that had said something so warmly to her thank you she said he made a pass at you taunted one sullen marine as melissa returned to her seat at the rear of the helo and buckled up no she replied he said something nice to me ill bet hey thomas asked a marine who was nursing a saw this aussie isnt he the guy who coldcocked that arab fanatic all arabs are fanatics proffered a mortar squad loader bullshit said another marine whatever he used said the saw marine thats him right thats aussie lewis yes said melissa thats him my old man told me bout that convoy put in another marine the arab was belted and was using a baby as cover tryin to blow up the whole fuckin convoy when thomass boyfriend here wasted the fucker so technically he didnt coldcock him he used a shotgun horseshit argued another the aussie took him out with a piece i heard the crazy bomber was a woman said the mortar loader whatever he used repeated the saw marine thats him thats aussie lewis what happened to the baby another marine inquired who knows probably died concluded the loader either that or hes a martyr by now ready for all those virgins melissa saw something move up forward in the semidarkness and instinctively gripped her rifle it was the crew chief checking his watch against the speed indicator his sudden movement unnerving her everyone on edge twenty minutes to amber the chief announced twenty minutes growled one of the saw gunners feels like weve been up here twenty hours choir williams was looking pale again the fact that he had never complained about his motion sickness was one of the things freeman admired most about the warrior the general moved down the lines chatting with the marines it was hard physical work talking against the racket of the three engines the rotors and the bonejuddering vibrations that followed the aa fire but he kept at it exuding confidence and strength talking casually to the troops about anything surprising them with his grasp of detail as when he passed melissa thomas explaining to her how the end of the cold war had spawned two russias on the one hand there was the affluent technically savvy russia and on the other the outmoded but still politically powerful communist russia they were in fierce opposition jockeying for who would rule in the twentyfirst century the russians like us he pointed out like any sensible army dont go into a fight advertising who their officers are hell their spetsnaz specwar troops dont wear any insignia at all but you can tell whos in charge the general looked at melissa and her squad anyone know how because said a loader theyre the ones yelling at everybody freeman laughed easily maybe but the surest sign is that theyre the best dressed lot of them are still like the british officers in past wars if they can afford it they have their combat fatigues as well as fulldress uniforms made on nevsky prospect wheres that sir st petersburg said freeman glancing at the airspeed indicator the super stallions were capable of around mph but with a load of fifty marines and because fragments of the aa hit had bled off some hydraulic lines they were down to mph even so the warning amber light would be coming on soon someone asked freeman how it was that the terrorist hblock had been missed by satellite surveillance for so long its cold melissa thomas ventured wouldnt show up on the infrared no said freeman buffalos cold in winter too but satpixll pick up any building in buffalo because of all the heating vents they show up beautifully on the ir cameras so our best intel guess is that the terrorist tech wizards have designed a thermoslike roof shield so that the hbuilding shows up as a thermos without giving us any idea of whats inside the moment he said this douglas freeman felt an icecold tremor run through him what if the soil analyses et cetera were wrong and the damn place was an empty shell a trap he was determined to keep the possibility to himself his job now was to keep morale as high as possible so he told melissa and every other marksman which given the marines standard meant every man on the helo you should look for the bastards with the bestpressed battle fatigues and shoot them first i hope you notice that i on the other hand am no better dressed than any of you im indistinguishable from any of you cept for my big mouth more laughter more confidencebuilding after the bloody disaster that had just taken place aboard this the marines second helo huey one carrying tibbet and his hq communications group was a halfmile ahead ten to amber came the crew chiefs voice freeman was wondering what had happened when the harriers dove on the aa position had it been completely destroyed its guns as well as its crew or would it be recrewed and play havoc with the second wave as so often happened those in the middle of the action were the least able to discern exactly what was transpiring he thought of hitler again and the dark room the nazi führer had been right about that chapter fourteen the loud boom that reverberated across the frozen marshlands and savannahs and through the woodland of lake khanka was unmistakably that of an antipersonnel mine exploding normally neither abramov beria nor cherkashin would have bothered even looking up from their respective offices in the hblock but this morning was different with a marine expeditionary unit known to be en route to the complex the detonation caused each general to immediately check the computercontrolled security display on his monitor the halfmilewide perimeter that ran around the abc complex was mined and patrolled by berias motorized rifle companys amphibious bmps boyevaya mashina pekhoty infantry fighting vehicles the bmps traveling between dugin squads of eight men maintained a perimeter watch while a mobile animal squad on standby was ready to dash out from the hcomplex and replace any of the mines there was eager competition for the night shift because deer were the most probable trespassers and the commanding officers for all their missilemade money couldnt get a steady supply of venison due to past overhunting either by the chinese who worked the rice fields west of the lake or by the russian population east of lungwangmia the phone jangled on berias desk he being responsible for perimeter defense da major kermansky here general it was a vulpes vulpes beria was gruff dont show off kermansky what the hell is that a red fox sir very rare nowadays fur any good asked the general brusquely normally beria didnt care a fig about what animal or bird it was but red fox was an endangered species and a foxfur collar would make an exciting gift for his mistress in avdoyevka twenty miles east of the complex abc had put it under curfew i doubt it said captain kermansky one of those recruited with bonus bait from the naval infantry battalion south in vladivostok and a man who though he had sold out to abc insisted on wearing his old units badged beret and bluestriped tshirt beneath his battle smock is none of it salvageable asked beria kermansky could be lying saving the prized red fur for himself no sir sometimes they only get a foot blown off but he was blown to hell if the antipersonnel mine had blown the fox to hell wondered beria how come kermansky could tell it had been a male ill bury it deep said kermansky as if he was doing the general a personal favor instead of doing what every man in berias infantry company had been told to do in order to prevent any enviro crazy hearing about it on the bush telegraph but this time beria surprised him bring it to me maybe i can get a collar out of it but sir bring it to me snapped beria or you wont see a bonus this week with that the general slammed the phone down the call intercepted like all other russian or chinese radio traffic by the operators in mccains cuttingedge signal exploitation space was duly logged by the duty officer as a useless piece of information along with all the other intercepts of nonenciphered russian and local chinese military traffic what was that all about asked landing signals officer ray lynch bored now that mccain had launched its quad of joint strike fighters on radio silence to catch up with the harriers who in response to news of the antiaircraft fire against the super stallions were now following the south bank of the ussuri river mr b of abc the translator reported to lynch wants the coat of a red fox that blew itself up on a mine says hed like a collar made from it but his comrade the operator paused and called back the intercept note on his monitor some guy called kermansky sounded like an officer he says the fox was blown to pieces high intel huh the sess officer of the watch shrugged but nevertheless reminded the translator that any abc intercepts were to be forwarded to freeman or colonel tibbet maybe they can make something of it what the hells a dead fox gonna tell them that the perimeters mined put in ray lynch the ses team resented lynch being in the ses the bluetile area because of the ultrasecret status of its advanced supercomputers was strictly offlimits to all but designated ships officers and the captain though lynch had clearance he had no real business there ses called him lizard lynch because he was always lounging around in ses like a lizard in the sun and looking over their shoulders well the cpo countered lynch general freeman already knows the perimeters mined so we dont have to tell him that but our satpix have picked up a number of heat splotches where theres a temperature differential between undisturbed frozen ground and the ground thats been dug for a mine thatll give him specific locations of mines the message sent from the surreal quiet of the bluetile room to the thunder of the super stallions was being deciphered by the copilot who jotted it down on his sidearm computer he tore off the twoinchwide printout a red fox has been killed stepped on a mine youre joking said the pilot no sirree mccains ses is sending us a fucking intercept about a fucking fox a red fox oh well then said the pilot his voice dripping with sarcasm a red fox a commie fox this could be very important dave better give it to the crew chief right now the copilot summoned the crew chief big intel coup chief better tell the general and tell our fellow marines that amber warningll be in five amber in five acknowledged the chief and red fox to the general got it the crew chief read the message shaking his head he freeman and the marines were about to deplane and the enemy knew they were coming even if they didnt know the precise landing zones and here was ses wasting everyones time a red fox was kaput big deal the pa crackled as freeman took the message oh shit it was the copilot hold on marines we have several blips up ahead chopper speed but they arent friendlies our fighter jocks should take care of em but well be popping flares and may have to take evasive maneuvers freeman was alarmed and tried not to show it the blips he assumed were probably abc helos coming to attack but he was confident that the harriers and four jsfs could deal with them the red fox however worried him chart he asked his specop team interpreter lieutenant johnny lee brought it up on his laptop and showed him the satpixs mines a veritable moat of explosives around abc each mine indicated by a tiny x from the angle freeman was looking at them they resembled a graveyard hundreds of crosses chapter fifteen whats up sir aussie asked the general who didnt hear him at first the amber light came on ten minutes to green and the air armadas marines were gripping their weapons tightly checking that their c was safely packed and doing deals with god senses were so strained that the stink of the scared soldiers an oil drip from a leaking line and vomit was overwhelming general aussie asked again damn fox said freeman his face tight with concern killed on one of their mines an ses intercept aussies brain was racing to keep up with freeman but sometimes that just wasnt possible given the breadth and depth of the generals experience a fox wolf he told aussie whatever would never deliberately walk on a mine they can smell anything thats been handled by a human for months besides carnivoresve been hunted to damn near extinction so they know better than to go anywhere near that hblock with all its odors which means it was well out on the perimeter animald still smell it out there challenged aussie yes conceded the general but theres one thing however thatll override human scent any scent so that even a fox with its nose to the groundll miss it snow said choir ten minutes to green shouted the crew chief snow said freeman in disgust and were in nato khaki green shit said aussie mustve fallen this morning and still falling said freeman im going up to see the pilot bad enough we should have to try landing in snow let alone sticking out like a whores tit once we deplane might as well paint targets on our ass he jabbed a finger at the laptop our lz is by a wood near this marshland we could find cover in these woods outside the hblock perimeter five minutes to green warned the crew chief lock it up it was a new order occasioned by upgraded lockin pins that secured the webbed shoulder and waist harnesses in the event of a hard landing maybe no snows fallen on the lz said aussie hopefully i mean maybe that was just a sick old fox couldnt smell worth a damn even though there was no snow to cover the mine too many maybes said freeman but as he glanced down at the vastness of eastern siberia he couldnt see any snow only the sheen of the lake it was enormous the marines heard a gutpunching thud as the hydraulics began alternately bleeding and gorging with fluid that would fully extend the helos huge rear ramp door an enormous russian sky stretched before them but it came to an end farther west in what the ses had warned was a significantly bruised line of ls thunderheads stretching north to south like malevolent ships of the line the stallion flying at mph with a tailwind was soon out of the mountainous and hilly country east of the lake which they could see was completely frozen then they were descending over flatter lower ground ten miles west of the lake the land here a mere sixtyfive yards above sea level frozen but still no snow aussie could be right the fox having detonated the mine not because snow had smothered the scent of it but because quite simply foxes like humans aussie pointed out arent always at the top of their game fact remains freeman told aussie i should have insisted on arctic white coveralls just in case he signaled the crew chief and asked him to check with the pilot for any sign on radar of snow clouds the answer was that he couldnt be sure but the line of ls was moving east toward them freeman turned his attention back to the dots too slow for fighters slow enough for helos and a concomitant mass of smaller dots as if a mass of iridescent pepper had been shaken on the screen what do you think freeman pressed the pilot helos dropping chaff by chaff he meant strips of aluminum foil that would confuse enemy radar in this case it would be impossible for the helos of the approaching meu to get an accurate idea of the helo force approaching thats my guess general the copilot said while feeding the larger dots on the radar screen into the computers memory to see whether there was a match between the radar signatures of the large dots and the known radar signatures of enemy aircraft types the monitors orangestriped matchup bar was flashing the accompanying text hind mi a kind of attack helo bandit six miles and one oclock in the stallions cabin the red light was pulsing three minutes announced the chief eight miles and freeman knew that if the first wave faltered failing either to keep the defenders inside the hblocks perimeter or destroying the hblock itself moscow might summon the troops believed to be based in kamen rybolov nine miles south of the abc complex to join the rebels for a split second freeman recalled patton telling the troops of third army that americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser and freemans ic robert norton saying that russians liked to win just as much as americans its not snowing sir the chief informed him but it looks like one mother of a rainstorm up ahead another arctic blast coming in over chinas wanda shan mountains good said freeman which surprised melissa thomas rain we can use one minute bandit two miles evasive action the radio seemed to explode in multichannel chaos the stallion descending cobra gunships and mis mixing it up watch him watch him lock him up lock him up good kill the general rose grabbing the pa mike grumpily brushing the flexicord away from his face melissa remembered how kegg had told her the old mans a dead ringer for george c scott she didnt know who george c scott could be but the phrase dead ringer bothered her and in the midst of the din all around she had the strangest premonition stronger than any shed ever had that while douglas freeman might win this battle and pass into legend it would be his last that though victorious he would like admiral lord nelson die at the moment of his greatest triumph she immediately told herself it was nothing more than a figment of her imagination but the stark image of him falling in this his last battle gripped her like no other premonition ever had holy shit someone yelled the big stallion rising higher and higher popping flares orange blossoms in a mad rain then the stallion descended once more marines freeman shouted to the accompaniment of rain drumming with such intensity against the stallion that even the general had to shout in his command voice to be heard youre marines half fish remember weather is not neutral use this to your advantage use it the red light was steady ten seconds till touchdown in the cockpit pilot and copilot were sweating profusely what theyd assumed to be frozen ground or marshland below was obscured by a furious rush of hail that was hitting the stallions rotors and fuselage like a mad sower throwing bullets instead of grain brace came the pilots warning a jolt and the offcenter touchdown was of such force that against all intent weapons flew from the hands of several marines only milliseconds before the huge helos front wheels took the full weight of men and matériel the noise of the big rotors in the downpour sounding like an enormous car wash freeman his team and the forty marines of bravo companys first platoon ran down the ramp its zebrapainted edges a blur as they deployed into waisthigh reeds and a cold rush of unfamiliar odors from somewhere on their left flank how far away it was difficult to tell there came the deafening noise of other rotors scything through the downpour and the sounds of battle already under way the rain had reduced visibility to zero the urgent throbbing and roar of cobra gunships and marine harriers mixing it up overhead adding to the ceaseless crackling of smallarms fire and the distinctive swoosh of airdefense missiles heard but unseen overhead all combining with the frantic screeching of thousands upon thousands of birds and other wildlife creating an earringing cacophony and confusion that was enough to unnerve even the most hardened veteran their stallion was lifting off for the mile return journey to patch repair refuel and repack for a second wave of marines from tibbets battalion waiting aboard yorktown all of which meant it would be an hour and a half at the earliest before any reinforcements might arrive for the men deplaning and unslinging the hummers mortars and other weapons that were vital to any offensive against the abc complex a tremendous earpunching boom was followed by a huge roiling orangeblack ball of flame rising several hundred feet above them through the rain two cobra gunships had collided their burning debris fell slowly through the downpour momentarily illuminating a small wood on their left flank to his dismay freeman saw snowy ground and iceencrusted marsh ahead a mass of icesheathed reeds looming and fleetingly turning orange in the fires light the reeds some instantly dried by the heat rattling furiously in the explosions aftermath beyond the marsh they could see the gray of rain and nothing more no hblock or any other structure the most they could hope for in that moment was that the marines of bravo companys second and third platoons and the assault forces four stallionferried antitank hummers and six light fastattack vehicles had been put down close by a quick gps check by platoon leader lieutenant terry chester confirmed that the super stallion had delivered his marines and the generals specops team to within a quarter mile of the lzs center a prodigious feat of flying given the atrocious weather down shouted freeman upon hearing the peculiarly rushing shuffling noise of incoming the russian mm round exploding in the woods in a yellow crash and sending whitehot fragments singing and ripping into a small stand of trees shrapnel whizzing into and out of the wood im hit cried a marine corpsman shouted the platoon sergeant but the marine medic was already there the young marine whod been struck in the head by wood splinters was bleeding profusely stunned he sat up and looked at his m with a puzzled expression the corpsman shouted at him to keep his hands away from his face thick smoke almost completely obliterated the marsh directly ahead only about sixty yards away it looked as if swamp gas was rising until its whiteness suggested a smokemaking round had landed there keep your eyes open freeman ordered unnecessarily as everyone was straining to see anxious to link up with fellow marines from bravo company on either flank and simultaneously fearing the danger of blue on blue what correspondents such as marte price and her ilk would call friendly fire btr two oclock yelled aussie lewis crouching down by the wood pointing at the vehicles presence no more than a hundred yards away one of the most brutish of the sovietdesigned troop transports the bronetransporter was a huge eightwheeled armored personnel carrier its two armorlidded front eye slits boatlike hull sloping sides and tortoiseshelllike top giving it the appearance of some lumbering metallic reptile from another age that however as lieutenant chester knew was an illusion freeze he ordered javelin only the btr a type freeman thought by the looks of it would probably be carrying twelve troops inside each soldier most likely armed with the new aksu a weapon that freeman had chosen for himself a shorterbarreled foldingstock version of the ak it was designed for easier use in the confined space that was the rear troop section this meant the twelve russian troops weapon would have a shorter range than most of the weaponry the marines carried but he also knew the ak had more whack per cartridge than most regular submachine guns by now freeman like chester was wondering whether the russians had spotted the platoon both the general and chester in unconscious unison training their binoculars on the enemy war wagon freeman quickly tapping the digital focus button for as sharp an image as possible through the curtain of rain the btrs turret with its heavy mm and lighter coaxial mm machine guns was slewing left to right like a trap shooter unsure of which sector he should be watching amateurs aussie told freeman they dont know where the hell theyre going in panic mode maybe here maybe there kegg called out lieutenant chester from long battle experience freemans vision unlike that of kegg and most of the marines wasnt held captive by the btr instead he was scanning through a full while taking care not to show himself above the reeds at the edge of the marsh that fringed this western sector of the vast lake mines were much less likely to be buried here because of the glutinous mud he glimpsed a marine it was kegg moving smartly forward with the javelin antitank unit but freeman was more interested in looking beyond at the rising clouds of steamy vapor of the kind that hed seen rising from the hot pools of new zealand and yellowstone he could smell animal excrement which struck him as odd given that the ground was frozen perhaps he had stepped in a fresh pile of it adjusting his throat mike and popping the digital earpiece from the matchboxsized collar unit into his ear the general made contact with lieutenant chester chesters voice sounded scratchy the platoon commander having just inhaled a pungent odor captain something weird going on here that vapor up ahead you see any hot springs on the chart preop no sir could be swamp gas could be acknowledged freeman but ive got a gut feeling we ought to stay put chester agreed if for no other reason than he like colonel tibbet and the others now under freeman knew that much of the generals legendary reputation rested upon one simple fact he was a meticulous observer it was something first noted by bob norton his old ic in third army norton in a lecture at the army staff college pointed out that most women could tell you the eye color of their close friends and acquaintances most men could not freeman could there was something about the vapor hed seen that bothered him there was an eruption of marines smallarms fire off to their left maybe yards at what was probably the first russian they had seen in the marshes so far the btrs turret immediately slewed in the direction of the firing the btr itself growling exuding a coal black plume of diesel exhaust into the rain cmon kegg aussie hissed fire the fucking thing the marine was using a tree at the edge of the woods to steady the weapon it had been only twenty thirty seconds at the most since lieutenant chester had summoned kegg but the btr was picking up speed across the frozen marsh where shoulderhigh stalks of icesheathed grass were starting to bend as the rain deiced them suddenly the russian behemoth foundered its slanting chin breaking through the platethick ice it was only a momentary pause however and the amphibian its exhaust and bilge jet spouting up high at the rear continued crashing forward in the marsh deep enough now that the btr was afloat looking to kegg like a mechanical hippopotamus moving inexorably toward the marines young kegg having snapped the javelins launch unit to the disposable launch tube and steadying the fireandforget fiftypound weapon assembly against an aged mongolian oak tree looked through the fourpower scope centered the hulking btr in the green and black of his infrared world and fired the kick motor flared with minimal backblast for kegg then the onetwo punch of the missile hit the btr the javelins initial charge blasting down through the topmost layers of the btrs roof the second shaped charge piercing the armor proper the btr was now a crematorium the vehicle stopped its wake of dark chocolatecolored diesel and exhaustblown reeds pushing forward over it like a flood freeman saw the rear door open and heard the feral screams of rage and terror as two perhaps three russian soldiers it was difficult to tell how many in the fiery swirl of bodies and debris came splashing out one man was afire trying futilely to swim toward the splintered and icy edge of the marsh when the btrs munitions blew making it look as if a cyclonic fire had hit melissa thomas felt her heart pounding in her chest half in fear half in god help her empathy for the enemy as marine rifle fire ended the swimmers misery hold fire it was freeman bellowing above the other nearby sounds of battle follow me the general breaking cover eddie mervyn at his side was running hard toward the lake but skirting its icy perimeter as sal choir aussie johnny lee and the fortyman platoon followed good shooting marine chester told kegg and seeing how shaken the boy was by what hed done knowing that there were eight possibly nine men cooked alive inside the btr added darpa alpha kegg good shooting marine kegg had difficulty hearing the lieutenant because of the noise off on their left flank where he guessed colonel tibbets hq section must be engaging the russians and what the hell wondered kegg was the general up to running pellmell leading the first two squads of chesters foursquad platoon kegg started in fright as freemans team closer to the lake with chesters first two squads opened up on a fiveton russian truck that came roaring through the steamy vapor packed with helmeted troops and heading straight for the drowning btr an officer on the running board was shouting and waving his ak at freemans team and the lead marines but neither the officer nor his troops in the back of the truck had seen chesters other two squads now emerging from the tall grass by the wood the truck coming under such an enfilade of fire from these marines ms saws and h k submachine guns and chesters burst of six rounds in half a second that it had no hope out of control the vehicle started sliding at speed toward freeman and his team striking a hard clump of stunted and windknotted reeds by the lakes edge with such force that it flipped and rolled bloodied bodies were strewn across the ice weapons mostly aks slithering some of them sliding so far that they disappeared into the rainfreckled water of the marsh where the btr was sinking the tip of its whip aerial just visible which told the everobservant freeman that the lake here was about ten feet deep several of the russians still able to function scrambled frantically on the ice trying to retrieve their weapons but freemans team and chesters first squad of ten marines gave abcs troops little chance of recovery only one man from the truck survived the marines storm of depleted uranium the ice seemed to come alive as frozen chips some red with blood flew into the air then suddenly a head popped to the surface followed by a pair of thrashing arms a btr crewman had survived though gasping frantically for air and dogpaddling furiously the russian plunged his right hand back into the water and came up firing his mm pistol at aussie who dealt with the interruption with a burst from his h k silly prick look after these two ordered freeman indicating a forlorn and soakingwet duo one of them rescued by freeman who had extended his unloaded ak to the floundering man was the only survivor of the btr the other though slightly wounded was the only trooper from the truck who had not been killed in the short but furious exchange while aussie whose right calf had been nicked by one of the truckborne soldiers was having it attended to by the corpsman it took johnny lee the teams interpreter only five minutes with the help of a grimlooking eddie mervyn to conclude that neither of the two prisoners knew anything about the hcomplex other than that they had been summoned for perimeter defense as part of some reciprocal arrangement between abcs hblock commanders what worried freeman was that most of the dead soldiers were wearing bluestriped tshirts beneath their sandy green battle jackets naval infantry together with spetsnaz specops and airborne infantry these naval troops were the best the russians had and freeman knew that despite the massive drawdown of military assets following putins ascendancy to boris yeltsins throne amid the rubles nosedive the naval infantry remained an elite fighting force he keeps saying said johnny lee pointing to one of the two prisoners a thin wiry type who had a bad burn on his left arm and was cradling it with his right that he and his comrade are pows says theyre lee had to shout against the rattle of smallarms fire and the earringing explosions of nearby battle entitled to protection under the geneva convention geneva what opined aussie smarting under the corpsmans alcohol swab tell im i havent seen that film no joking aussie lee replied hes claiming theyre regular troops called to secure the abc perimeter and as such and as such cut in aussie theyre aiding and abetting fucking terrorists if theyre regular troops they shouldnt fucking be here even moscows declared abc persona non grata right general correct said freeman adding quietly to aussie at least for twentyfour hours the general then turned to lee if i thought they knew anything more than the route out from abc johnny id shoot em if they didnt cooperate chester having managed to make radio contact with tibbets hq group so that closein hand signals in the nearzero visibility were no longer needed ordered nine of his ten fourman teams to spread out captain freeman called to chester id like my team to concentrate on finding entry those truck tracks should be visible for a while ill call you the moment we get in you betcha acknowledged the marine lieutenant stay well ill try said freeman turning over the two prisoners to chester then he addressed his six team members okay guys everyone marine idd they were with small infrared diamond shapes on the fronts and backs of their helmets and camouflage battle jackets it began snowing aw shit announced sal thats all we need the four marines of the tenth fire team ordered by chester to stay behind to provide a perimeter defense for the arrival of the second wave of stallions if theyd come in zero visibility plasticstripped the two russians a corpsman having given the burn victim a shot of morphine assisted the teams sniper in unlacing the russians boots and with a hastily invented sign language they told the two pows theyd be shot if they tried to run the two navy infantry comrades nodded their heads vigorously they understood dyou think began one of the marines in a voice barely audible amid the increasingly confused sounds of the battle farther in the general was kidding about shooting these guys if he thought they knew more you know just shoot them geneva convention interjected the burn victim anxiously hey you know english little bit yeah well you know what shut the fuck up means da the geneva convention said the sniper authoritatively does not apply to masked terrorists and those who aid and abet terrorists in any way the other three marines were impressed more by their buddys matteroffact delivery than by the answer after all they knew how marines had viewed terrorists and fellow travelers in iraq as freeman led his team along the edge of the lakes frozen western marsh he could feel the pressure of the twentyfourhour deadline mounting could the first wave hold long enough for the second wave which would have to fly in on instruments alone to land in the increasing foul weather and could he find traces of the trucks tires on the frozen ground before the snow hid them showing him and his team the way back to abc through the minefield that surrounded the hblock and he of uturn fame had brought in the first wave sans white coveralls he had rolled dice with the meteorological officers report and lost but his team was moving in the harmony that comes only with practice with knowing how each man operates with being able to recognize one another even in the dark by footfall alone everything was starting to look white the rattle of machine guns sounding farther west now away from the edge of the lake itself but still in the marshy area the team could hear shouts in english and in another language that johnny lee told freeman was neither russian nor chinese so far as freeman knew his team had been landed in the right grid but hed sensed from his short radio communications with tibbet that while the colonel had been careful not to give coordinates he had indicated via slang that his hq platoon was on freemans left as it should be but more than half a mile farther west while chesters fire teams were spread out a hundred yards to freemans right murphy he of murphys law was always waiting in the wings as freeman and his team had found out at priest lake but despite everyone not landing precisely where he should it sounded as if the first wave was at least moving in the direction of the terrorists hblock passing through waisthigh reeds checking his wrist gps the general estimated that the outer limit of the halfmiledeep minefield that surrounded the abc complex and from which terry chester had surmised swamp gas was rising was no more than fifty feet away to the right of bravo companys line of advance douglas freeman sniffed the snowy air whiffs of cordite coming downwind in what was now a heavy swirling snowfall the general held up his hand and everyone stopped as he knelt in the cold still marsh grass that was now shoulder high and completely hid him and the team from view and saw tire tracks impressed in the frozen earth not yet completely covered by the snow because of a tree bough he glanced back and saw eddie mervyn and gomez only a few paces behind him sal choir johnny lee and aussie farther back with the marines something which he couldnt articulate at that moment cautioned him not to raise his voice for while the snowmuffled thumps of the russian mortars sounded about a mile off the generals experience of winter battles told him that the russians were only half that distance away then he realized why his sense of smell was giving his brain a flashing red signal marsh gas stank the marines whod done their training in the intertidal swamps around parris island would know that too rotting vegetation gave off the rottenegg smell of hydrogen sulfide there was no offputting odor to this vapor maybe hed been right all along and it was a hot spring he gestured for eddie and gomez to come closer and spoke softly see that vapor rising about fifteen yards off by that clump of woods both had seen it assuming as lieutenant chester had that it was swamp gas its got no smell freeman told them watch the ground directly in front of you as well as our flanks both men acknowledged his advice knowing how easy it was not to do this when one was walking freeman in the same low tone in which hed instructed gomez and eddie to come with him pointed to yet another wood on their left flank and instructed aussie and the marines i want you to head over to that wood on our left flank the area he indicated was on high ground it was about two acres in size with brush and trees that would afford them good cover aussie gave him a thumbsup farther back at the head of the column while freeman drawing his ak bayonet with eddie mervyn covering him with his shotgun and gomez as tail end charlie for the three of them approached the area where the vapor was coming from and which his gps told him must be just a foot or two beyond the outer limit of the mined perimeter while aussie choir johnny lee and sal the two pows and chesters marines moved to the wood freeman had indicated the reeds were shoulder high but as they walked farther and passed a small copse of wizened mongolian oak the ground underfoot was becoming higher and quickly the reeds became shorter so that in another fifteen feet they passed from shoulderto kneehigh reeds suddenly something enormous burst out of the reeds eddie mervyn was so startled he stepped back and fell detonating a mine the explosion ripped into his buttocks and groin the mines detonation further terrifying any wildlife in the reeds like the huge bird that had broken cover dont move freeman shouted at gomez even as he was getting up snow and earth were still raining down on him eddie was hemorrhaging severely and the second waves relief choppers were at least one and a half hours away if they made it freeman could have called in a highpriority mayday but that would have imperiled the entire team he knew as did eddie that in this situation the best that could be done was first aid and pumping him full of morphine so that though he was already in violent spasm the pain would be diminished gomez shaken despite all his specwar training fumbled at first almost dropping his helmet before he managed to pull out his ringer packet of fourinch foamgelimpregnated gauze pads freeman grabbed the packet ripped open the waterproof seal and used the six pads as one compress on the gaping wound between eddies legs the gauze becoming one with the wound and under the pressure of freemans hand stanching the hemorrhaging as gomez recovering his wits injected eddie with cc of morphine for the pain its all right eddie gomez told him were getting you medevaced youll be out of here in lying son of a oh god god help me aussie was getting johnny lee choir sal and the marines ready for a rescue squad but knew that freeman wouldnt request it as it would put more lives at risk in a possible minefield all aussie could do for the present was to form a csection defense on the perimeter of the wood should the russians send out anyone to investigate bastards arent gonna find a fucking fox next time they come nosin around here no one but choir whod been sitting next to aussie in the helo and heard freeman and the helos crew chief talking about the fox knew what he meant choir flicked his h ks safety to off as the general and gomez carried eddie back to the shelter of the copse of mongolian oak as if the enemy had heard aussies comment the team and marines heard the guttural roar of a big diesel this time it wasnt a btr or truck that showed up but a bmd a fighting infantry vehicle another amphibian but this one a postputin topoftheline airtransportable bmd for a tracked monster it was moving fast at forty miles per hour its metal treads throwing up a high wake of powder snow as it skirted the ice along the edge of the lake before slowing and then entering the marsh reeds then it stopped a hundred yards from where the mine had exploded and began to hose the reeds across a fiftyyard front with its mm antiaircraft cannon and its coaxia l mm machine gun in the copse of oak where freeman and gomez lay protecting either side of eddie gomez checked eddies vital signs they were all bad amid the woodchopping racket of the bmd strafing the reeds and firing in the general direction of the wood where aussie and the marines were hunkered down eddies voice faded to a weak rasp and he uttered a desperate plea for his mother freeman turned sharply to eddie leave your mother out of this and stop whining youll be fine a new flexidick and youll be pushing pussy in no time that son of yours the fouryearold whats his name foster yeah eddie managed to groan well hang on to that youre gonna go bowling with him he took off his fritz and handed it to gomez another gel pack quickly whats your girls name eddie freeman asked even though he knew it i what melanie i need medevac dont we all joshed freeman youll be fine just keep thinking about bowling with young foster well get you out on the second wave eddie was rolling from side to side in pain stay still eddie theyre gone he moaned my ballsve been theyre fine freeman lied just a bit mussed up oh god eddie moaned give me a shot of morphine for crying out we just did freeman glimpsed a straight white vapor trail that streaked from the wood through the falling snow saw the bmd buck and its right track unravel off its steel wheels the explosion of the bmds magazine was so violent that it sent a searing wind through the trees whipping up dead branches and flinging them against the denuded trunks and the log behind which freeman gomez and eddie mervyn had sought shelter payback one to payback two freeman whispered hoarsely you receive loud but sliced came aussies reply which meant that freemans transmission was segmented are you receiving asked the general his speech more deliberate loud and clear now eddies gonna make it freeman said more for eddies morale than from conviction gomez and the general had stopped the bleeding but eddies chances were fiftyfifty unless they could get some lactate into him and stabilize for that they needed saline the general quickly considered the options he and gomez could carry eddie to choir who had the saline or choir could bring it to them freeman decided while it might seem more logical for choir to come to mervyn that choir aussie lee and the others in the wood were in a more sheltered and thus safer area in which to treat eddie than by the log besides if choir were to be shot down trying to reach them then freemans specfor team would be without saline still as he helped heave eddie onto gomezs back he knew it was a gamble abc with its apparently unlimited resources was no doubt listening in to field communications and despite the best efforts of mccains ses to jam the russians it would take less than a minute for any stateoftheart russian computer radiofrequency scanner to zero in on the american sources of transmission lets go freeman told gomez who was still shaken by the horror of eddies wound eddie had confessed his fear of just such a wound the one most feared by men during the days when he was gomezs swim buddy at seal school in coronado a surge of smallarms firing at least platoonsized could be heard erupting farther west of the lake where the bulk of tibbets marines had landed closer to the zapadnyy siniy mountains than planned while freeman and tibbets hq group were also west of the lake they were closest to it and to the hblock which no one had yet reported seeing in the foul weather indeed the one thing freeman terry chester colonel tibbet and their men were certain of was that there was no certainty about the disposition of units in this first wave of more than six hundred troops and no clear picture of the emerging battlefield it was impossible to discern meaningful patterns from the mélange of radio traffic that included orders some frantic from both the russians and the americans whose transmissions were often jumbled in the frequencyjumping of both sides it was always the same not knowing where everybody was and the concomitant worry about the possibility of blue on blue this time when freeman with gomez carrying eddie retraced their earlier path through the reeds following their now barely discernible footprints in the falling snow the general made sure that neither he nor gomez wandered off the path lest they too detonate a rogue mine the vapor the general had been on his way to investigate was still rising from a multitude of tennisballsized bubbles breaking open through the cracked ice that had fissured at the base of the reeds on the high ground where he eddie mervyn and gomez had been walking when an enormous gray bird had shattered the icepolished reeds flying up into the swirling whiteness of vapor and snow that hung over the marshland perhaps thought freeman the komissarov river fed by runoff from the zapadnyy siniy mountains was a conduit of hot spring water pouring into the lake but there was still no smell emitted by the vapor which here and there created ballparksized areas of dense fog next to areas where there was no vapor rising and where visibility improved up to twenty feet it was gomez who first heard the freighttrain shuffles of approaching artillery mms freeman guessed and while the rest of the team immediately fell flat to the ground the circular rubberized nose cone of the predator tube that aussie had slung on his back swung around hard hitting him in the nose and starting a bleed while all the marines in the area also hit the dirt freeman told gomez not to move to remain standing was counterintuitive but it was better than moving off the path through the reeds and risking detonating a mine the two screaming shells fell short with a tremendous whoomp their explosions sending huge shards of ice whooshing through the air one of the surfboardsized splinters slammed into a copse of pines and disintegrated into smaller pieces that tumbled down like broken glass around freeman gomez and eddie it told freeman two things one that the russian terrorists were definitely scanning and two that theyd reacted far more quickly than hed anticipated on the basis of hearing a simple transmit sending out their stateoftheart bmd to investigate the tripping of the antipersonnel mine were their inner defenses so much weaker inside the perimeter freeman wondered that they worried about one measly antipersonnel mine going off there had to be another reason the general concluded for the panicky response of trying to kill a few soldiers with artillery you all right freeman asked gomez who despite being in a physical condition was straining under the weight of his comatose friend yeah answered gomez itll be better once we get moving as freeman took point his right hand from force of habit reached for his radio mike then he checked himself the best he could hope for was that aussie sal choir and johnny lee would see him and gomez carrying eddie making their way over the two hundred yards to the protection of the wood as fast as caution allowed freeman followed by gomez began to move out through the tall reeds hearing gunfire closing in from the west with more artillery rounds screaming in exploding in and around the position theyd just vacated freemans ability to retrace their steps out of the reeds with surprising speed given the bad weather was due to the generals photographic memory his skill in noting and remembering minute details along the way was less innate than learned in battles all over the world from featureless deserts where windstorms could obliterate telltale tracks to arctic storms where falling snow threatened to do the same and gomezs ability to keep up a good pace despite having to bear his wounded comrade on his back was mute testimony to the extraordinary level of physical fitness freemans specwar warriors habitually maintained as freeman and gomez broke out of the tall marsh reeds below the vaporcovered mound that was the local high ground they could hear more incoming the eerie shuffling sound was much closer now becoming a scream the rounds explosions shaking the ground beneath them geysers of earth dirty snow and reeds shooting high into the frigid air then raining down on the mound twenty yards behind them where there were more eruptions as antipersonnel mines were detonated by the concussion in his determination to reach the protection of the wood and the two russian prisoners the general always cognizant of a potential blue on blue in the confusion of combat especially here in fog and snow raised his ak the staywhereyouare signal in the direction of the wood where he hoped aussie sal choir and johnny lee were still waiting for him to arrive suddenly gomez stopped hold up general then you hear that yes acknowledged freeman there must be hundreds of them over there gomez tiring quickly now realized that the general had mistaken his question freeman was talking about the scores of birds gathered in another section of the vaporous marsh no said gomez eddies weight getting to him now i mean the hummer it had stopped at the wood now only thirty yards away the hummer was topped with two fourtube canisters of tow antitank missiles where the fuck were they earlier when we needed them aussie challenged still he was glad to see the vehicle everybody was glad to see it a marine corporal had stepped out of the hummer followed by two other marines dressed in snow whites one of whom was kegg whered you get those freeman asked dead russians one of them said grinning until he saw how badly eddie was injured quickly kegg helped gomez the general asking for saline from the hummers kit good man said freeman as keggs marine buddy handed him the pack choir also brought a saline pouch freeman now turned to the four marines in the fire team nearest the woods perimeter where are the two pricks the prisoners said a marine we tied em up over there behind that brush general a marine corporal glanced uneasily at the other three marines in his fire squad as the general strode toward the two russians they were sitting forlornly in the wood under cover of a huge snowladen fir its branches gnarled and deformed over the years from the bitter gritladen westerlies that came sweeping down from the wanda shan in china and on through the nearby foothills of zapadnyy siniy before howling bansheelike across the thirtyfivemilewide expanse of the lake on whose closer shore abc had built its stalinesque hblock which at the moment lay hidden by the blizzard that had made a mockery of mccains optimistic weather forecast im tired of this damn weather freeman opined formally to no one in particular but his tone alerted his teammates that the general in the manner of george patton was about to voice a direct request to the almighty to intercede on behalf of operation bird rescue before this however freeman gave instructions for gomez and a marine corpsman to do what was possible as soon as possible for eddie mervyn who despite having received an infusion of saline seemed to have slipped further into coma freeman prayed they could keep eddie alive long enough for the specwar warrior to be medevaced out by one of the choppers in the second wave both russian captives were visibly alarmed when the american general whom abramov beria and cherkashin had described as a madman suddenly took off his helmet and holding it under his left arm his ak cradled in the other bowed his head the russian duo were clearly alarmed by the generals body language was it the prelude to executing prisoners while the four marines including the corpsman who was helping gomez with eddie exchanged uneasy glances the generals specwar team with an ease obviously born of practice formed a protective square around their general who amid the sounds of intermittent gunfire far and near began his prayer his hair turning white with the snow that showed no sign of abating almighty god we beseech thee in this battle to afford us better weather so that we might vanquish our terrorist foes and destroy their evil here and forevermore amen with this freeman put his helmet back on and turned to salvini sal cut em loose as sal drew his sas knife the younger of the two abc russians a lean short man in his early thirties who didnt speak english stiffened in fright looking imploringly at his comrade who did know some english for an explanation of what was happening had the mad americans prayer been for his prisoners a last rite before he executed them general it was gomez in shock his face crumbling his shoulders shaking in a futile effort to dam his emotions so that the moment hed called the general every man present knew that eddie mervyn was dead freemans eyes were turned intently upon the two prisoners not wildly ablaze with anger but with an unblinking cold rage it was the kind of rage theyd seen in the eyes of comrade general abramov the commander of the tank and armored company when abramov had been told that one of their terrorist clients had tried a double cross on a big payment for a railcar full of igla shoulderfired manpads shipped from the nearby railhead at kamen rybolov and across the wooden bridges of the marshes to the south there was no pity in the comrade generals eyes instinctively the two russians still sitting on the ground moved their backs against the trunk of the big fir tree as if it might give them some protection from what the american might do they watched nervously as the americans general got down on one knee looking at the dead american who had been his comrade in arms as inconspicuously as possible the two prisoners looked at the marines and the rest of freemans team for any expression or body language that might convey what the prevailing mood might be amongst them whether the grief would turn to anger both prisoners knowing what they would do had the situation been reversed the edict from abramov beria and cherkashin had been unequivocal all of the american gangsters were to be summarily executed and the edict wasnt confined to the americans as demonstrated by abcs ruthless cleansing of those elements in the civilian population around the lake who had had the temerity to protest abcs takeover dozens of corpses had been dumped in the vast surrounding marshlands as freeman handing his ak to a marine looked down at eddie mervyns boyish face he was also seeing the faces of the dead the murdered at darpa alpha and the smoking funeral pyre of the thousands at ground zero taking off his gloves he closed eddies eyes but the eyelid muscle retracted the lids and aussie lewis handed freeman two small stones that did the job freeman having been as insistent as any di on parris island that his men not carry any change into combat freeman rose quickly from the snowy ground of the wood and then with an abruptness that belied the gentleness hed shown kneeling by eddie he asked aussie lewis whether the woods perimeter had been secured yes sir where are the bastards now dont know for sure general but most of the noise is coming from the north of us about two miles away id say theyre giving tibbet hell the general didnt respond but turned abruptly toward the prisoners and aussie lewis saw in his eyes the metamorphosis from soldier to avenger of all those americans murdered since which one of you speaks english a little this phrase was said with such menace that the russian who spoke english was reluctant to admit to the fact but he remembered that it was one of this mans soldiers whom he had told i speak a little he raised his hand so tentatively i do sir that he might have been a schoolboy terrified of his teacher now you listen to me you son of a bitch the general was taking his sidearm from its holster you understand son of a bitch he asked the russian the prisoner nodded the cold fury in this americans face so obvious that the russians throat constricted rendering him temporarily unable to speak and he could feel his skin now itching like crazy sir interrupted the marine what sir i think i hear armor bout a quarter of a mile away to the west this only added to the generals sense of urgency he was still glaring at the hapless russian do you understand more freighttrainlike rushes came shuffling through the pristine air the rounds exploding with a roar which though muffled by the snow nevertheless was still deafening and left the generals ears ringing stand up freeman ordered them you know why i asked you to stand the smaller of the two wheyfaced prisoners looked imploringly at his englishspeaking partner what was going on you want us to stand said the english speaker we stand youre standing freeman told them because i do not shoot men when they are sitting you understand that you terrorist turd it was clear to chester that while the russian didnt cotton on to every word he understood readily enough and was terrified now you told us you came from the hblock from the building but you know nothing about the building correct the russian nodded his adams apple bobbing nervously correct admiral chester bit his lip to stop himself from smiling he could see that the russian was far too terrified to even try making a joke i am a general freeman told them unsmilingly and you have murdered thousands of innocent men women and children the englishspeaking russian found voice to tell his comrade what had transpired nyet nyet the russian speaker was repeating da retorted freeman with such resounding authority both men fell silent he fixed his stare on the english speaker your name my name yes goddammit your name ilya my comrades name is boris ilya you and your comrade know more about abcs setup than youve told us ilya was shaking his head as vigorously as boris had we have not been inside much i swear on mothers grave it was never good practice to talk too much to prisoners freeman knew their names and conversation lent humanity to their otherwise sullen or scared faces but freeman as colonel tibbet had told his marines kept in mind the sight of the seemingly endless funeral processions after the terrorist attacks on america since and the bravery of the victims the people on flight and the scientist at darpa alpha with ram and scarund written on the note in his hand you steal our plans said freeman slowly and deliberately ignoring the cacophony of battle just a mile south and west of him down by the rail line then sell them to other terrorists who kill our children you help them you are as guilty as they are youre not prisoners of war youre opportunists outlawed by your own people in moscow youre comurderers terrorists the russian prisoners didnt understand co but murderers and terrorists they did understand and now looked grim in addition to being scared they didnt whimper they were after all opportunists who had been trained as soldiers outlawed by their country as terrorists regular soldiers turned bad and theyd been told by abramov beria and cherkashin to expect no mercy from moscow or the american interventionists if they were caught they had crossed the line becoming fantastically wealthy by russian standards their manpad bonuses alone catapulting their lifestyle into another world way above that of the average russian koreans burst out ilya we are not only people involved koreans are helping freeman was nonplussed he could hear more incoming what was this ilya telling him about koreans tell me more freeman urged the other russian boris couldnt conceal his surprise at ilya having mentioned the koreans who freeman quickly surmised must be either one of abcs best customers or joint manufacturers tell me more freeman pressed nyet cautioned boris and freeman shot him dead ilya jumping sideways in fright holy shit it was the hummer corporal be quiet ordered freeman and turned the gun on ilya tell me about the koreans quickly ilyas hands shot up in mute surrender the body of his dead comrade spreadeagled in the scant snowfall that had penetrated the thick branches of the fir tree like clumps of icing sugar on the dead mans chest his eyes wide open his expression grotesque as if his dentist had just asked him to open wide ilya was trembling believe me admiral i have not much been in abc it is not a lie what about the koreans dammit they are he couldnt think of the word general it had taken a lot of guts for the marine corporal to speak after being expressly told by freeman not to but the sound of the armor was getting closer what tank sir getting closer cant see em yet in the fog but then go find them and take them out do your job man yessir the corporals right hand circled in a rev up motion and the other two marines whod given the white overalls theyd taken from the dead russians to two of the four fire team marines jumped back into the hummer chester telling melissa thomas to join them the corporal called back to the fire team therell probably be infantry behind this fucker when we see it so you boys be ready to give us an assist when we nose out of these trees to fire youve got it corp ilya was perspiring babbling something but neither freeman nor johnny lee could understand him the russian in such a state of emotional turmoil that words wouldnt come to him and so he made as if he was shoveling that better not be bullshit the general snapped without a trace of humor never more serious in his life what do you mean trenches ilya was in a frantic charade and he like freeman had never been more serious in his life dont try to think of the word lee told ilya itll only go farther away but apparently the thought of what the admiral would do to him if he didnt make it clear only heightened the prisoners anxiety in his search for the english word in desperation he ceased his shoveling motion and instead gave lee the word in russian fonar flashlight said lee da said ilya making as if he was walking through a tunnel said freeman da tunnels yes admiral tunnels how many three incoming warned aussie a tremendous crash of steel ripping into timber followed everyone was down for cover except freeman grabbing ilya by the lapel where are the tunnels mother of he remembered the vapor coming from the high ground vapor that had no smell heating vents abcs weapons were being made underground freeman pointed his h k mm sidearm down at the ground down there yes yes entrances freeman asked next johnny ask him if theres one entrance two how many an entrance for each tunnel ilya realizing that information was his only salvation was now speaking at such a rate that lee had to slow him down he says that for security reasons theres only one main entrance for all three tunnels and this is deep under the hblock under the administration offices is it north koreans who are building the tunnels freeman asked da general with boris supine beside him in the snow ilya was suddenly a gold mine of information the gist of what he was saying was that the north korean communists who as freeman and anyone with even a passing acquaintance with north korea knew had watched american air supremacy over korea in awe during the war of had also realized that in future wars the only way for industry of any kind to survive american airpower would be to do as their north vietnamese comrades had done in cu chi that is to burrow underground deep underground so deep that their military garrisons and factories couldnt be penetrated by the american bunkerbusters that had laid waste to saddam insanes regime what ilya was also explaining was that in exchange for desperately needed foreign currency the north koreans tunnelers extraordinaire had been engaged by abc to do the dirty hard yakka labor as aussie would have called it of burrowing deep into one of the rock spars that speared out into the marshes from the base of the nearby zapadnyy siniy mountains the deep missile assembly and storage plant located ninety feet underground and heated by harnessing the hot spring conduits that vented in and about lake khankas marshes the crash of artillery rounds from the creeping rather than targetspecific barrage had now passed beyond the wood but had the enemy armor done the same can you hear any armor the general asked lee aware that his own hearing was deficient in what he had described to margaret as the high birdsong trill and squeak range no sir answered lee i dont know whats going on freemans intuition told him something particularly troubling was afoot was abcs rebel infantry following the tank and had they now spread out moving stealthily through the sea of reeds toward the last radio spot if so this meant the russians would have to pass by the wood before they reached the sot farther west from which he had radioed aussie in the wood for now despite all his impatience to find the tunnels if ilya was telling the truth the general knew they would have to find the tank in the event of a second wave a tank could destroy as many helos as it had rounds killing a hovering stallion with one shot from its main gun its coaxial mm heavy machine gun obliterating any of the troop carriers surviving marines damn said freeman he whipped out a small notebook from his thigh pocket and a small flexigrip indelible pencil that was firm enough to make a note with but not hard enough to be a deadly piece of shrapnel as hard plastic or alloyed ballpoint pens were prone to become when their owners were hit in iraq on the day aussie had shot the bombbelted woman running at him with little blue eyes aussie had seen a brit sapper whod lost an eye because a plastic ballpoint pen had disintegrated when hed been nicked at chest level by a round from a terrorists ak the plastic pen had shattered but its ball had perforated the brits eyeball also taking out the optic nerve draw me a picture of the entrance freeman told ilya any lie you understand propaganda bullshit and you die ilya understand johnny lee told ilya the same thing in russian just to make sure the russian left hand trembling though less now than it had been when the general had shot boris began drawing a diagram of the hblock building telling freeman that it was very cold inside it no warming ilya told them so it does not show on satellites ah freeman said thats why it doesnt give off a heat signature for the satellites ir lens everyone in the tunnels said ilya wears downfilled goretex you know goretex everyone knows goretex said freeman show me something i dont know show me where the tunnel entrance is okay ad general im telling you truth now no propaganda bullshit youd better be son or you can join boris if the russian thought the conversation between his captor and himself was going to produce any kind of stockholm effect his captor coming around to understanding why he and boris in the chaos of post cold war russia had thrown in their lot with abc and helped kill innocent americans for money it wasnt going to happen there was no room in freemans mind for these slaughterers of civilians freeman glanced through the white blobs of snowcovered bush at the woods perimeter out at the fogblanketed whiteness of the reeds anxious to see melissa thomas and the three other marines returning in the hummer either that or the sweetsounding swish of a tow missile en route to enemy armor he glanced back down at ilyas drawing showing three tunnels ninety feet below the surface accessed by elevator from the hblock at the base of the elevator there was a large open area from which the tunnels branched and which was sealed off from the elevator shaft by large double doors the tunnels themselves were about ten feet in diameter and six feet apart and ran parallel to one another for a distance of about three hundred feet thruways that connected the tunnels were spaced at fiftyfoot intervals ask him freeman told lee impatiently what the arrangement is in each tunnel whats being made ilya sensing the generals agitated mood responded quickly he labeled the three tunnels a b c for abramov beria and cherkashin respectively explaining to lee that one was for installing missile motors the second for electronics antiinfrared guidance et cetera and the third tunnel was for the installation of warheads wheres the exit asked freeman entrance is also exit thats dumb you go ninety feet underground and the tunnels run for three hundred feet what if theres fire exit still being dug by koreans here ilya pointed to the end of the three fingerlike tunnels where they converged in a fiftyfootdiameter area same size as the entrance is it finished almost one more month maybe less there is much blasting by the koreans but this delays assembly and our three big bosses in abc he indicated the hblock hed crudely drawn sitting ninety feet above where the tunnels began they are not so interested in making exit for workers only making more missiles to sell to sell to terrorists freeman charged yes said ilya looking more chagrined than sorry the russian moved his map of the three tunnels around for johnny lee to get a better view thus affirming his cooperative spirit hes telling us lee told freeman that many of the parts for the weaponry are stacked in the interconnecting tunnels and no smoking is allowed in any of the tunnels now freeman told ilya softly his tone nevertheless pregnant with authority draw the way in through the minefield youll be in the front vehicle comrade ilya flinched so did freeman as another arty battery opened up sending more freight train rounds on their mission to kill us marines freeman glanced at his watch if thomas kegg and the other two marines including the corporal didnt return in ten minutes he was going to break cover and go after abcs armor unless the tank was disabled the second helo wave as well as his and tibbets marines already on the ground was doomed like so many plans hed seen in civilian and military life everything as the academics at staff college sometimes said was in a state of flux or as aussie succinctly put it everything was going to rat shit the snow was falling even more heavily now and there was still no sign of melissa thomas kegg the other marine and the corporal or enemy armor it was as if everything had been swallowed up in what was now a fullblown blizzard the wood as silent as a tomb freemans team and chesters marines statuelike in the swirling whiteness even the sound of the smallarms fire and the occasional scream of russian manpads which the russians were using as groundtoground munitions in the absence of any discernible radar signatures in the air were muted many of colonel tibbets men had still failed to link up due to the erratically spaced landings the big stallions had been forced to make due to the cobras sudden midair collision to further discombobulate the americans the russians had affixed a small thimblesized stuka screamer to their artillery rounds and some of their missiles designed as had been the nazi prototype to instill icecold terror into their potential victims the first time he heard it freeman immediately recalled the stories of his greatgrandfather who had served as a liaison officer in the american international brigade during the spanish civil war of about how the inhabitants of guernica had been the first nonmilitary target in history to be flattened by the luftwaffe goerings air force practicing on the unarmed civilians of the town as a curtain raiser to the nazis blitzkrieg lightning war that began world war ii the sound of a broad front battle had dropped off from the more or less sustained ripping noise of machine gun fire guttural roars of big triple a and the highpitched screaming of the heatseeking manpads to pockets of noise these erupted spasmodically from what freeman guessed were isolated squads of infantry and fourman fire teams the backbone of the meu engaging russian patrols and gun emplacements all of which the snow would be covering helping to camouflage the terrorists positions against the attacking marines those not engaged in these isolated clashes were in a physical state reminiscent of suspended animation each marines body wound up like an alarm clock the alarm due to go off at any moment but no one knowing quite when every marine as well as freemans team was praying for the arrival of the second wave but every one of them knew it would be a hard thing for tibbet to have to send the enciphered message to come on down the old quiz shows phrase a current favorite of marine slang though melissa thomas was more often than not the recipient of oprah winfreys ubiquitous you go girl a doubleedged encouragement thrown at her as shed struggled to stay afloat in parris islands water facility while one marine and the marine corporal remained in the hummer thomas and kegg were kneeling in a natural blind of shoulderhigh reeds whose formerly froststiffened stalks were now starting to yield to the weight of snow as peasized powder crystals gave way to bigger sloppier flakes that adhered and quickly accumulated on the stalks melissa knew that if she and her fireteam buddy kegg didnt move soon the reeds would be bent over by the weight of snow to knee height and lower and both marines knew that the prone position in what was now a fourto fiveinch snow cover some drifts back at the wood more than a foot deep was not the position from which to do any useful recon everything in this sector less than a mile west of the lake had become unnervingly quiet since the asyetunseen tank could no longer be heard marine thomas moving her right arm with glacial slowness had managed to squirt a shot of defrost on her rifles long thermalimaging nitesight scope and knew she had one of the mags five mm match grade rounds already chambered and the rifles trigger weight set for a threeinstead of a fivepound pull she knew that even in good weather a quick shot was often difficult to get off in time and that in these nearzerovisibility conditions it would be impossible were it not for the scopes infrared capacity all she needed was a heat bleed a mans head moving a blurryedged white spot against a green background but shed never before fired at another human being and not from five hundred yards in the abstract she had no doubt but now here her heart pounding under the stress the cold it was the same feeling shed experienced when first she stood on the edge of the water tank on parris island and choked remember kegg had told her as theyd alighted from the hummer into the reeds the terrorist assholes well be hunting will be trying to take us out before our guys can consolidate and go looking for the hblock and shit its their home ground he was right but she reminded herself the marines had gone over the d computergenerated satpix maps of the area ad nauseam so that despite the allbutfeatureless expanse of the reeds here west of the lake and less than five miles north of the railhead at kamen rybolov each marine with his gps wristwatch should know where he was though not speaking melissa kegg and the two others by carefully studying their thighpocket charts had estimated that they were less than two miles from the hblock whose vague outline had shown up on satpix and that the tank they had heard must have stopped for even given the soundsuppressing quality of snow the nailsonchalkboardlike screech of steel treads on steel wheels should have been audible then melissa heard movement slight yet distinct about twenty feet off at two oclock was it a bird like the one whod spooked that guy in the reeds who in turn had triggered the antipersonnel mine or was it someone moving and if so friend or foe kegg heard it too and froze ready with his m mm carbine this shortened m with grenade launcher attached was more easily handled in the reeds than an m and melissa saw the tip of his trigger finger ready to either unleash a mm grenade or fire a flushout burst of mm rounds but the same questions dogged him was it a man or an animal a mistake could cost you your life or the hauntingtillyoudie agony of having initiated a blueonblue melissa wanted to raise her snipers rifle for a quick look through the scope but thatd be like waving a flag besides which even the slightest movement would cause the reeds to move she heard a hissed ga ja kegg saw reeds shivering and fired not a profligate hosing of ammo but a marinestyle burst into the middle of the rustle melissa fired from the hip seeing greenwhite reeds exploding in burntbrown fragments as her heavy mm round tore its path through the vegetation in a nanosecond for her however time morphed into that strange slow motion that danger decrees when time for those involved irrationally stands still then screaming and chaos as a firefight erupted melissa punched backward saw three figures heard ga ja ga ja again kegg lobbing a grenade and dropping down next to her a mad rushing like a bull charging amid the crash and flame of the grenade and more feral screaming the hummer broke cover from the shoulderhigh reeds twenty yards back the corporal driving hard into the reeds the other marine manning the frontrightdoor machine gun its red tracer cutting through the snowbent stalks in a segmented red line ending where hed seen the trouble the corporal careful to steer east of the gps vector that marked the edge of the mined moat of frozen marsh around the hblock the latter still unseen but supposedly there satpix verified three terrorists were down all dead from what kegg could make out but his marine training had instilled in him the caution needed when approaching a downed enemy terrorists more than any other combatants marines had encountered except perhaps for the south seas detachment of the japanese army in were known to boobytrap their dead and themselves lying on a grenade pin pulled the weight of their body holding down the spring lever you rolled them over at your peril melissa found it excruciating to breathe the impact from the terrorists ak burst or rather from the one shot that had hit her in the chest although having been stopped by her flak jacket had caused an enormous and painful welt on her left breast the shock of the hit having penetrated deep into her chest and she suspected broken a rib but there was no way she was going to complain and become the whining bitch if she did so itd be in emails home from yorktownif they got out of this mess she could imagine the leads congressman calls for end to female combatants a womans place is in the home not on the battlefield say southern baptist bishops you okay asked kegg who while he kept his eyes on the three bodies stood up slowly his ms clipon launcher having another grenade up the spout just in case yeah she told him kegg moved off to the right to avoid being in her line of fire cover me he told her the terrorists looked dead from head shots and grenade shrapnel but he knew he had to be sure feel the wrist pulse melissa the fifteen pounds of her ma sniper rifle feeling like a ton covered him the pain in her rib cage feeling like someone twisting an icecold knife inside every intake of air an act of will there was no pulse in any of them he wasnt going to turn them over even so he and melissa could see they were two caucasian terrorists and an asian chinese or korean they reported this to the hummer corporal whose vehicles roofmounted tow radar was sweeping the snowy expanse for the tank that had disappeared the corporal as well as kegg and melissa hypothesizing that the earlier squeaking noises theyd heard had been armor retreating from a defilade position beyond the wood should search them for intel melissa thomas said trying not to grimace with her pain but kegg noticed anyway and seeing her flak jacket perforated asked you bleeding no just a bit of indigestion that slug winded me damn lucky it wasnt higher the hummer corporal said youd have a tracheotomy you didnt ask for she grinned manfully asking him again should we check them for intel she knew it was paramount in this kind of operation especially given the minefield satpix had indicated temperature differential spots where earth had been disturbed dug up but snow covering the ground made it difficult to pinpoint the mines while you were being shot at the corporal had a lariat formed with the rope from the hummers front bumper he tossed the loop over the dead asian ill haul him over in case hes lying on a pine cone i like that better said kegg who wanted no part of frisking anyone lying facedown lets get out of here said the other marine manning the frontdoor gun ive got dots on the radar big ones second wave asked kegg due north said the hummers frontdoor gunner doubling as radar nerd so pressed kegg whats the problem problem marine cut in the marine corporal is that our second wave would be coming from the southeast maybe due east not out of the north oh said a disappointed kegg as the hummer reversed taking up the ropes slack at the front the door gunner enjoining his fellow marines quietly but urgently to get aboard as he watched the radar dots grow lets get going if theyre voodoos were too exposed melissa thomas smiled for the first time since her chat on the stallion with freeman exposed maybe she thought in the sense they were out on the frozen expanse of marsh but the snow was falling so heavily visibility was now only twenty feet at best that was as much a defense as a hindrance the snowdotted body rolled over the hummer advanced and reversed twice more there was no sign of a booby trap on either of the other two bodies the three terrorists probably hadnt time to do anything more than get off a few rounds in the direction of melissa and kegg before kegg felled them as the marine corporal quickly recoiled the rope melissa with a great effort and the stink of the hummers diesel exhaust temporarily shutting down her nose knelt down and started frisking the asian while kegg and the corporal whod finished with the rope began searching the two caucasian terrorists bingo said melissa the corporal and kegg turned toward her the hummers gunner repeatedly making a degree sweep urging them to hurry up lets go i dont like it whatve we got thomas the corporal asked watching her unrolling a scroll shed found inside the asians jacket some kind of map melissa answered cmon guys said the gunner melissa flattened it out quickly the map was the size of a mans handkerchief she and kegg glanced at it then she rapidly rolled it up tucking it inside her helmet against the liner well give it to freeman that specwar guy of his the lieutenant lee said the gunner yeah lieutenant lee hey that tanks gotta be round here somewhere relax the corporal told him you see it on the radar no said the gunner but those fuckin bogeys are moving in maybe theyre ufos joshed the corporal you a fucking comedian how many bogeys you got pete looks like nine the gunner answered three threes what was that the corporal asked melissa as they walked to the hummer the printing on that guys map arabic korean i think said melissa anyway that lee guys multilingual he should know she looked back at kegg might know what ga ja means too maybe its his grocery list joked kegg for cryin out loud said the machine gunner looking anxiously over the reeds and stealing a glance at the radar what the fucks going on with you guys lets go a nervous rifleman on the woods perimeter squeezed off a threeround burst before freeman and aussie saw the hummers whip aerial and its tow missile housing through the falling snow the hummer was hit midships as described by the enraged corporal who had been driving and who was now tearing the proverbial strip off a young marine whose first live fire in combat was to hit the hummer freeman kept out of it the marines humiliation was punishment enough besides the general more conscious than anyone in the wood of time slipping by and the twentyfourhour deadline bearing down on him turned his attention to the scroll found by melissa thomas on the dead asian terrorist as the general unrolled the scroll saw the dotted lines and elaborately styled calligraphy he realized that the map was more or less a duplicate of ilyas more roughly drawn sketch but whereas ilya had said the entrance to and the exit from the tunnels were the same the dead koreans map his nationality confirmed by johnny lees examination of the blackinked characters showed an exit tunnel the characters written here lee told freeman indicate its a tunnel wide enough for two men how does the exit tunnel connect up to the three tunnels asked freeman he was having trouble reading the drawing overlaid with characters does it go up from the fiftyfoot area ilya mentioned yes confirmed lee not a trap is it johnny pressed freeman brushing big sloppy flakes of snow off the map i mean that dead son of a bitch kegg and marine thomas wasted violated every military code carrying around detail like that could it be a plant sucker us in memories of americans suck were lit large in the generals mind no lee replied confidently i dont think so he turned to melissa thomas was this terrorist you got the map from in russian fatigues it was a crucial question but neither melissa kegg nor the corporal could vouch for the answer hed been pretty well covered in snow and the hummer with the rope had turned him over several times but maybe the two caucasians had been dressed a little differently from the korean but the truth was that in the confusion and speed of the firefight none of the three marines could be certain theyd all been looking at the dead mens faces when the hummers rope turned them over im not sure said melissa im sorry general no problem you did well thank you sir said melissa whys it important about how he was dressed the korean i mean the general glanced over at ilya because my friend ilya here tells me thereve been a lot of koreans working up here so if the korean terrorist you marines took out was a civil engineer not an army type who wouldnt or shouldnt carry maps of the system thatd lend credence to this scroll you found itd make sense for an engineer army or not to have this with him itd be like our tac maps he meant the tactical maps colonel tibbet himself and selected company commanders had to have the general paused and as casually as he could asked johnny lee any date on it and he watched ilya whose eyes were avoiding the generals with such illdisguised purpose that freeman became more convinced that lees answer would be critical yep said johnny lee its got intended and completion dates marked near all the separate tunnel stuff hmm murmured the general while the others were looking down at the map he was watching ilya again any date on the exit tunnel johnny yep its dated johnny turned the map around placing it on a stump under cover of the firs branches using two h k mm mags to weight it down his calligraphys ornate flowery but its not really very neat they could all hear the first wokkawokka and whoopwhoop noises of approaching helos russian or american no one knew radio silence was complete it began lieutenant johnny lee i mean the exit tunnel is marked as having been completed two months ago that a fact said freeman urbanely his left hand accommodating an itchy spot beneath his fritz his right returning his mm to its holster funny he continued hearing the approaching din of aircraft and looking up high through the firs snowpacked branches at the invisible racket thundering directly overhead the heavy pulsing in the snowthick air told every one of the first waves marines spread out higgledypiggledy in the landing snafu that they were either being reinforced by yorktowns second wave or attacked by gunships johnny lees answer that the exit tunnel had been completed months ago was followed by such a cacophony from the helos that freemans instruction to ilya had to be delivered in his full command voice you were leading my men into a trap we go in the entrance and your comrades your comrades shouted freeman would be in there lights out waiting for us a trap you cunning son of a bitch no no general pleaded ilya i didnt know no freeman slung the ak over his left arm jabbing his finger at ilya you told me you terrorist son of a bitch that there was no exit yet that it wasnt completed ilyas eyes told the general hed run out of excuses he was asking for mercy having prevaricated with just enough of the truth to set up the trap that would have annihilated the americans suddenly ilya lunged at freeman pulling the generals kabar bringing the knife up with such speed that freeman putting his hand on the pistols grip ready to draw had only a split second to up the holster the gun still in it and fire the parabellum round exiting the canvas holster and striking the russian in the chest punching him back he fell staggered to his feet taking freemans second shot in the throat his carotid artery punctured gushed blood giving freeman time for the third shot the mm slug ending the business in a flurry of snow as the russian fell back onto the firs snowladen branches his blood staining the clumps of virgin snow that suddenly cascaded down from the trees branches a denuded branch relieved of its burden springing up rising another foot or two above the ground now in addition to the headacheinducing din of the armada of helos freemans team and chesters marines could hear another sound which melissa thomas and kegg recognized as the loud ripping noise of machinegun fire it was coming from the helos above which were invisible except as blips on the hummers radar and identified as enemy craft by freemans and chesters infrared friendorfoe helmet patches the hummers heloexperienced corporal identified the craft as black shark kamov attack helos and hind transporters the black sharks and hind transports were arriving headon with the second wave of joint strike fighter escorted super stallions no one thought it was anything but a rather deliberate tactical ploy by the air force general cherkashin hes a hard son of a bitch pronounced kegg who asked the hummer corporal what the hell was kegg on about do you mean freeman or the son of a bitch who sent his choppers in to fuck up our second wave cher whats his name cherkov cherkashin kegg corrected him no i mean freemans the hardass shooting pows like that pows my ass cut in aussie they were friggin terrorists theyd sell their sister for two bits fuckin mercenaries all of em so interjected the corporal who made you pope listen sonny aussie shot back you wouldve had your sorry ass in a trap if thomas here hadnt found that map what makes you think were not in one now said kegg maybe the maps a trap hey put in the frontdoor gunner maps a trap thats a rap theyll wrap your ass if im right said kegg the frontdoor gunner had no response or if he did he left it unsaid everyones attention was drawn to the claustrophobic throbbing in the sky despite the danger presented to him by the presence of the enemy helos as a soldier freeman had to admire cherkashins strategy with many of the inferior russian radars whited out by snow and therefore posing a high risk of blue on blue amongst the russian helos cherkashin like rommel in the france of had clearly decided that he must engage the americans in the air in this case before they had a chance to land in force and link up with the first wave much of the surprise cherkashin was creating with this helo attack was due to sheer luck in obtaining an unofficial loan of the elite helos from the siberian sixth armoreds air wing located just east of spasskdalni fifteen miles east of the lakes southeastern shore in fact the air battle now under way had begun north of the lake as the meus second wave of stallions tried an end run around the northwestern half of the lake hoping to come up behind the russians that the mccains ses had picked up even given the blizzard conditions over the lake cherkashins black shark helos which nato commander roger hawkins had nicknamed werewolves had proved how good they were in tight turns of gs and dive speeds of and more miles per hour with their t thermal imagers the joint russianisraelibuilt erdogan version with its pilot and copilot sitting in a natoweaponscompatible cockpit encased in mmproof armor plating and equipped with the worlds first operational helo rocketassisted ejection system was particularly deadly one super stallion had already been shot down by an erdogans rapidfiring a mm cannon its pilot eschewing highfragmentation rounds in favor of armorpiercing rounds the guns virtuoso performance owed much to the sharkshaped helo having a coaxial rotor but no tail rotor enabling it to perform a flat turn its gun free to move through either an unrestricted vertical or horizontal circle as the shark climbed and dived with its two horsepower sidemounted turboshaft engines the helo performed maneuvers that would have seemed impossible to an earlier generation of chopper pilots as freeman often told his team everything has its limitations and the swarm of nine black sharks was no match for the four american vertical takeoff and landing joint strike fighters led by mccains chipper armstrong each of the big pound mm gasoperated revolver guns was so deadly that slaved to the jsfs avionics it outshot the black sharks best in close air battle and because the americans radar was percent more effective than that of the nine black sharks the thirty american gunners in this second wave of fifteen super stallions were able to take their copilots voice feed directly from his headsup radar display without any intermediate step which gave them a twoto threesecond advantage johnny lee listening in to radio voices in the frantic chaos and urgency of the air battle repeatedly heard the american helos being referred to as freemans birds shit said one of chesters marines they think youre running the show general no one contradicted him because now that freeman had the map it seemed as if he was certainly the man best informed to run the show given that tibbet was still preoccupied trying to gather in the disparate units of the first wave johnny freeman began down shouted gomez who was kneeling beside eddie mervyns rigid body when they heard a swishing sound overhead the heat generated by the flight of the missile creating a tumbling roll of warm air that swept the wood like a prairie chinook sending large plops of snow falling from tree and bush that was close said the hummer corporal i thought he was silenced by the hummers gunner who said he thought hed heard the squeak of a tracked vehicle several seconds before but had since lost all trace of it in the din of more than twentyfour helos diving hovering landing and all of them seemingly firing at once some of the errant rounds ripped into the frozen marsh and reeds skirting the lake freeman now heard the second wave being put down only a mile and a quarter west of the abc complex as planned but over a mile north of the first waves scattered troops this meant tibbet would lose valuable time having to hustle if he was to have his second wave join the first what neither tibbet nor freeman knew was that by calling in every iou they had as well as offering us currency bonuses on the spot mikhail abramov viktor beria and sergei cherkashin had obtained an ad hoc force of troops which were being ferried in by four highttailed ilyushinp transports each of the planes four big d kp engines controlled by updated computer avionics so that landing on the relatively short abc runway was virtually handsoff despite the snowfall in much the same way for the first time in outofcountry operations two of the marine expeditionary units jsfs the first fighter piloted by mccains chipper armstrong the other by rhino manowski set down as instructed by tibbets enciphered groundtoair communication once radio silence had been broken in the russian helo attack while armstrongs jsf put down on a slab of frozen marsh by freemans wood manowski landed his plane by another wood island as it were nearer tibbet who had now reached cover just outside the perimeter where a platoon of secondwave marines were coming under sustained rocketpropelledgrenade heavy machine gun and ak fire but in the whiteout this enfilade from the unseen russian defenders was more smoke than fire with only a small percentage of the russian infantry defenders having the use of ir scopes and sights the weather forecasters having disappointed them as well as the americans amid the cacophony of rotor slap and battle freeman was writing quickly on his knee pad sketching out a plan of attack using ilyas map gambling on his hunch that ilyas map of a route through the minefield would be accurate because it had clearly been ilyas intention to lure all of the americans into the tunnel at one end and bottle them up in a killing zone johnny freeman called out to lee encrypt this and send to jack tibbet abc hblock hang on general cut in lee uncharacteristic alarm in his voice freeman recognized it as lees computer down tone as johnnys ungloved hands tapped the foldout keypad again with the same results nothings going through sir like its frozen maybe it is said choir his voice all but lost to a sudden surge of fighting all down the line all right said freeman obviously annoyed but unfazed writing quickly on his bloodspattered knee pad johnny try the encrypted function again lee did and it didnt work we only have pl general all right dammit plain languagell have to do contact tibbets hq and explain about the tunnels approximate location but obviously we cant give him any tactical information and we havent much time so while youre messaging his hq johnny ill see what i can do dig up a trick or two from the old days in a followup pl message in all his time with douglas freeman aussie had never seen the generals hands move so fast like a vegas dealers and within five minutes during which time lee was radioing tibbets hq the general tore off a message sheet telling johnny send the following wyfwbaanghariunneoenoltddvonkmlhwme dyemniirrloeeotppduugbteeeicroohnttd keotithegfcdhtreraoetoeamrmriofxnoobuvguic uslseosteteea the din of the battle soon reached an apogee then dramatically fell off the snow drifting piling up under a bonefreezing wind that was howling down from the zapadnyy siniy only a few miles to the west are we going in general aussie asked no option pronounced freeman firmly we attack he had one eye on johnny lee who though the biting wind was freezing his hands was forcing himself to focus so as not to screw up the burst message to tibbet any pause by johnny would count as a space in the train of letters a missing or in a binary message would jumble the sequence and thus scramble the message signature lee asked the general freeman thought of his favorite president franklin delano roosevelt all we have to fear is fear itself well use fdr he told lee johnny was blowing on his fingers and flexing them signature within or without sir he asked freeman within very well all set to they heard the unmistakable whoosh of a fuel air explosive the fae bomb sending an enormous flash of orange through the snow that immediately turned to steam then to sheets of filigreed ice that cracked on the frozen marsh like shattered glass all set to send burst transmission lee informed freeman send its gone sir said johnny but he looked worried any transmission was easy to intercept cracking the code listen up freeman told his fellow soldiers weve got the best outfit possible here my team a hummer with four tows loaded and four in the rack and a fire team par excellence with terrible thomas and killer kegg there was a snort of laughter what more could we ask for continued freeman soon as i get acknowledgment of this message we find our way back to where eddie got it but we keep strictly this side of the gps mine line the snow willve buried any sign of booby traps so even with this map showing where the exit from the three tunnels is were going to have to move slowly till we find the exit door from the terrorists map the door is like one of those used on an old houses coal chute the exit itself appears to be a steeply graded stairwell about eighty feet or more long and its barely wide enough if johnnys interpretation of this map is correct for two men abreast he paused though in this damn refrigerator i wouldnt mind being next to a breast myself hoo ha came the marine reply melissa thomass smile was tired and patient the smile of a woman who had heard much more gauche comments from grownup boys freeman became serious again this isnt going to be a cakewalk but im confident well be able to reach that exit door if this map is right and remember the approach to it wont be mined otherwise it wouldnt be a damned exit questions aussie asked about the entrance to the tunnel if freeman attacked the exit wouldnt abcs technicians be able to escape back out the entrance doesnt matter if they do replied freeman right now were after the machinery more than the men he paused checking that everyone was ready right he said check your weapons remember condoms on the barrels so snow doesnt get up the spout and freeze the rifling got it got it good with the chaotic roar of the helos fading as quickly as it had begun freemans force moved off in the relative silence broken here and there only by sporadic blind mans firing as freeman called it a hundred yards out the marine corporal sitting in the hummer could have sworn he heard a squeaking sound he also knew hearing it was like watching clouds you often see the image that the mind projects and sometimes you hear noises that arent there sounds born of imagination and the circumstances of the kind the corporal was encountering now in the conditions of war with the russian terrorists of whom hed seen very few except for those in the illfated btr and the truck wanting to kill every american they could find the damp air all around was thick with the pungent smell of burning gasoline and highexplosive fumes rising slowly from those places in the minefield moat where more than forty americans their transport stallion thrown off course by the black sharks had perished as it hit the ground its huge rotors cartwheeling and breaking up the fuselage suddenly bursting into flame chapter sixteen abramov had been holding back his twenty ts behind the protection of the minefield that skirted abcs hblock and the thicket of cherkashins antiaircraft defenses until the weather abated and visibility improved enough to unleash his armor and make devastating use of his laser and infrared targeting but he suspected now that he had made an error and waited too long initial reports coming into the hblock from berias lonesniper observers in reed hides at the edge of the minefield indicated that white bears now outnumbered brown which told abramov beria and cherkashin that not only had a second wave of americans arrived but that these new american arrivals were equipped with snow whites or winter uniforms then suddenly and completely unexpectedly beria burst into abramovs office waving a piece of yellow paper of the size abc had given ramon who had so successfully led abcs spetsnaz commando group in the attack on the americans darpa alpha base god exists beria bellowed to a startled abramov mikhail i bring you a gift what in hell are you talking about asked the tank commander looking up grumpily at the diminutive beria whose chin seemed barely to clear the top of abramovs huge metal desk wheres cherkashin beria inquired loudly looking about the map room adjoining abramovs office hes busy said abramov brusquely clearly irritated by berias exuberance which was in marked contrast to his own bad mood and anger at himself for not having committed his tanks earlier it had been his dream to avenge the one humiliating defeat his siberian sixth had suffered abramov had been smart enough this time around or so he had told himself to not let his tanks loose when bird rescues cobra gunships had shown up in the first wave his intel group had assured him the cobra attack helos would not return in the terrible weather the gunships simply were not equipped with sufficiently good avionics given the distance between the us fleet and lake khanka furthermore his perimeter snipers had been told that if the cobras did risk a second wave they would like any other helo be vulnerable when refueling from bladders dropped by the cargohauling stallions any inflight refueling was deemed to be out of the question during the blizzard cherkashins air defense had assured abramov that such a delicate maneuver required visuals as well as outstanding instrument flying by the cobras twoman crew and the tankers pilot in what the russians referred to as a tit and sucker maneuver but abramovs g his intelligence chief had confirmed that there were reports by coastwatchers of american helos refueling in the air beria had placed the yellow sheet of paper which was also the color used for radio intercepts on abramovs desk waving his hand side to side as if to clear the room of the smoke from the ultraexpensive diplomaticos no cigar one of which abramov always had on the go ever since abcs massive profits had enabled the tank commander to buy the very best havana cigars whats this abramov asked picking up the yellow intercept strip unenthusiastically beria strode to the window momentarily struggling with the latch and letting in a draft of the frigid air glancing at abramovs snowcovered main battle tanks surrounded by cherkashins twelve multibarreled zsu antiaircraft units and a score of igla manpad teams beria thanked his lucky stars that as much as moscow wanted abc destroyed the russian president simply could not allow any foreigners especially americans to bomb russian soil rebel or otherwise for the russian president to allow anyone especially americans to bomb would risk enraging even those russians who though opposed to the terrorist activities of abc could not tolerate foreign bombs falling on the motherland it was a visceral reaction born of the collective trauma of hitlers operation barbarossa the massive and savage invasion of mother russia when hitlers luftwaffe had sent in the nazis screaming stuka divebombers to pulverize russian defenses and terrify the civilian population looking out the window as abramov scanned the yellow page an excited beria was reveling in abcs double good fortune first in how moscow by securing a nobombing agreement with the us president in dealing with abc had in effect rendered abcs hblock and minefield offlimits to american aircraft and now abcs second lucky break which had come in the form of an intercepted transcript of a message between the american general freeman and the marine commander colonel tibbet the americans said beria coming back to the desk his finger tapping the yellow sheet of paper think they are the only ones with stateoftheart computer scanners so said abramov still not convinced you have intercepted a line of letters whats it mean our intel boys are working as fast as they can they think its a letterforletter code you know each letter stands in for another letter so when you put b it could be a or c were running the parameters now why isnt it encrypted asked abramov brusquely digitized beria shrugged not every squad carries an encrypter maybe their encrypter wasnt working huh said abramov it looks too easy well then countered beria what does it say i dont know admitted abramov taking a long clenchedteeth drag on his diplomaticos ive just seen it this second havent i our boysll crack it said beria confidently taking back the yellow strip leave it abramov told the infantry general ill peruse it as well meanwhile our met officer says this snows going to turn to rain a layer of mistll be moving from north of the lake down toward us but it should be clear enough that ill be able to go out and attack with my armor americansll have nothing comparable biggest things they can haul under those super stallions of theirs are hummers and light howitzers and the most theyre ferrying in are two of the howitzers otherwise they couldnt have carried the required troops weight to make up the second wave dont worry mikhail beria said your tsll eat those marines alive once the weather i know that snapped abramov his tobaccostained teeth in a snarl the point is to let my boys loose when the worst of the weather lifts but theres still enough mist to give us cover as we speed through our minefields exits well have to move fast before the americans rush the minefield exit which isnt visible now but will be once they backtrack our tread marks i want your infantry to be ready viktor to watch my flanks ready theyve been ready waiting all around the perimeter dug in until they can move en masse my god havent you heard them firing ive heard a lot of noise retorted abramov but were still frozen in position well see whos been firing accurately when we can see what the hells going on were still in the fog of battle viktor same as the americans dont complain about the snow mikhail its whats buying us time against the american force once your armor rolls out well flush them out for you grease your treads with their guts abramov had no doubt hed mash the americans though he might lose a few of his ts and mm mobile missile launchers these were still firing spasmodically at very low altitude to sweep the snowfilled air of any american helo caught in the critically vulnerable hovering position disgorging men and matériel abramov looked down again at the long string of letters on the yellow sheet dont worry beria assured him our intel comrades are working the permutations and combinations now theyll crack it soon soon said abramov better be before the weather clears theyll crack it beria promised abramov looked at his watch rain is predicted in thirty minutes then it tapers to showers ah you cant always trust those weather people mikhail opined beria look how it was supposed to be low overcast maybe showers then what do we get dumped on us tons of snow a veritable blizzard comrade thats because were so near the mountains abramov told him you know how quickly things change beria wasnt convinced though as he left abramovs office he recalled how contrary to public opinion weather forecasting was now percent accurate even in seaports as far away as vladivostok and vancouver and so when he found cherkashin in the map room he told him that mikhail was probably right about the optimistic weather forecast but the normally garrulous air force commander was in no mood for optimism he was furious that the snow had effectively grounded the two migs promised him by his brotherinlaw in spasskdalni east sergei beria assured him you wont need the two fulcrums youve given us good antiaircraft fire already now its our turn cherkashin his white mane in disarray stared at beria the infantry commanders optimism annoyed him war was so unpredictable that few of those in it had any clear idea of how it would turn out chapter seventeen as the helo marine one descended gracefully to the south lawn of the white house the president of the united states confessed to national security adviser prenty and his press secretary that hed made a mistake in agreeing to come back from camp david the line of protestors was much longer than marte price had reported they bus them in said the press secretary who asked eleanor prenty buses in protestors against us tracking down terrorists those people replied the press secretary who dont think america should make unilateral decisions about sending our armed forces into other countries the president felt the gentle touchdown and what do you think the president asked his press secretary i think you did the right thing mr president so long as terrorists think they can hit us and run to sanctuary we have to go into the sanctuaries well said the president stepped down from the chopper returned the marines salute and slipping his tie back under his suit jacket felt the hardness of the bulletproof vest beneath he gave a presidential wave to both the protesters and those including a group from idaho who were holding signs up supporting the bird rescue intervention mr president said eleanor prenty walking beside him by my count the supporters outnumber the protesters good the president told her but if freeman and colonel tibbet dont pull this bird rescue off and destroy that damn terrorist complex well tank in the polls excuse me being such a hardass but i cant do what i want to do in this country unless im reelected and i sure as hell wont be if freeman and tibbet blow it he had no sooner entered the oval office than the white phone the direct line from moscow rang the russian president wanted the american antiterrorist force out of lake khanka before the twentyfour hours were up he was taking a great amount of flak from the opposition in the newly elected duma the russian parliament the president of the united states told his russian counterpart that he understood and would have the pentagon give freeman the timeline but please mr president dont let any of your enemies know in fact i suggest it would be better if you didnt mention it to any i am not an idiot retorted the russian president then there would be added pressure on me as well as on your general freeman but tell this freeman to hurry up he wins or loses when the twentyfour hours have passed and it is getting late otherwise i cannot hold the hotheads at bay it could be general war freeman couldnt receive the white house message however because his teams encrypter was out of commission tibbet had received freemans transmit and acknowledged the same but since then there had been no reply from the general still nothing on encrypt tibbet asked his second in command no sir not on encrypt thought he might have fixed it by now or picked up another decoder from another platoon in his sector but i guess everyones lying low till the snow not freeman cut in tibbet who was looking at his marines strung out on either side of him lying down behind the escarpment that his platoon was using as protective high ground beyond one of the small acresized woods that stood like islands in the sea of marshlands that bordered and in some places spread out for miles from the lake the escarpment was only a few feet high but with the piling up of snowdrifts it had grown to nearly twice that height tibbet reminding his men that they must lie low until he received freemans situation report if the generals go or yankee call couldnt be sent because the generals encrypterdecoder machine was down then his yankee call would come either by hummer runner or in plain language but not before freeman judged his team ready for a joint attack against abc what direction for the attack sir inquired bravo companys major hoyt tibbet grimaced in the snowfall though the snow was easing off it was still bitterly cold he kept flexing his gloved hands to keep his blood moving he gave the major the coordinates for the planned attack but keep them to yourself until weif we get that go call from freeman i dont want it going through the company if god forbid one of our guys is captured and tells them that we know where the tunnels entrance and exit are remember that time they got one of our guys in iraq and arty someone shouted and tibbets group of seven and two fire teams kissed the snow again the shell sounded like a mm one of the russians thermobaric rockets it slammed into a rise of marshland scrub several hundred yards to tibbets left the shock wave sweeping over tibbets marines like a furnace blast well be in trouble when the weather clears said major hoyt those toss have a cant sensor and computerized fire control once they can pick us up visually they i know that said tibbet the russian toss were big ugly boxes of thirty rockets set on a t chassis he felt anxious and looked at his watch while taking care not to express any more signs of anxiety in front of his hq group he estimated that there were now more than marines landed consolidating the line it was a very thin line given the huge area of the lake and environs the had sounded like a lot however to the marine quartermaster back on board yorktown who had to find every item needed from the snow whites hed sent with the second wave to each of the marine forces thirty land warrior micro air vehicle systems each lawmavs was no bigger than a childs rubberbandandbalsawood glider and had a transparent fuselage containing a laser range finder video camera and computer the hairthin spars of its tiny tail and wings were transmitter antennae but now like chipper armstrongs and manowskis jsfs the lawmavs one issued to each fortyoneman platoon in the meu were grounded by the atrocious weather jack tibbet ordered his communications operator if we dont get a yankee call in ten minutes i want you to send a plain language to freeman get your pad ill punch it in now sir and save no to hell with it send it now right sir replied jimmy tibbet frowned in concentration pl message is as follows airseyraenakdeye tibbet paused remembering the emergency keys he and freeman had agreed on the first plainlanguage transmit from freeman would contain a birte builtin reverse target error with a threeletter key at the end of the message to open it the threeletter key being any threeletter initials of a us president hst for harry truman or jfk lbj gwb et cetera tibbets reply also with a builtin reverse target error was to be signed off with the twoletter initials of a president such as al for abraham lincoln jc for jimmy carter et cetera sign it ht said tibbet its a hurryup for freeman he explained to his radio operator we cant broadcast the fact that weve had a twentyfourhour deadline placed on us the terrorists here at lake khanka would love to know that we might have to go in sooner than we thought message sent sir very well acknowledged tibbet snow is easing said hoyt encouragingly not fast enough said tibbet we cant even use our mavs they were supposed to relay back good pix to us jimmy tibbets radio operator had been monitoring the weather forecasts sir they say the weathers changeable around the lake here and with those mountains nearby everything can change in a jiffy they say tibbet said who are they jimmy farmers almanac no cnn sir that marte price woman shes covering the op tibbet muttered an obscenity as tibbets radio operator jimmy vanes was one of the few marines authorized to dial up cnn pix on a cell because no commander wanted his troops secondguessing themselves in the midst of a battle because of some talking face five thousand miles away in atlanta like those embedded correspondents who had reported every hit the us army took and every terrorist hostage murdered creating the impression that us and coalition forces were on the ropes turn that damn cnn phone off jimmy yessir sorry i sir reply coming in plain language reads ygaonokdeteoegsotj last two letters tj thomas jefferson proffered tibbet jimmy was already breaking the message minus the two signature letters tj into two lines it read yankeees goodtogo very well said tibbet pass the word in abcs hblock sergei cherkashin rushed in thumping the snow from his fur hat and gloves what a break huh he said smiling the frosty air issuing from his breath rising up to mix with abramovs cigar smoke what are you talking about asked abramov tersely still feeling that his armor in its hidden revetment areas could be bombed once the snow stopped and their engines started up giving off infrared signatures of the kind his two big tos tracked rocket launchers were looking out for in the american lines along the perimeter they cracked the code of that freeman to tibbet message beria asked hopefully no no comrades said cherkashin stomping his snowladen boots i mean the message from moscow my assembly line captain who i might add gentlemen is keeping the three tunnels working as we speak heard it not more than five minutes ago beria and abramov said nothing abcs assembly line captains were supposed to keep the production lines moving no matter what did cherkashin think the us marine corps took a day off in battle well cherkashin began pouring himself coffee relishing the moment despite knowing how much his petty drama annoyed his comrades this captain heard it on the banned chechen terrorist radio network it appears that fourteen hours before the chechen network heard of it our glorious comrade president issued the americans a twentyfourhour deadline twentyfour hours and cherkashin glanced up at the old pendulum clock a museum piece in the sparse brutal stalinesque architecture of the hblock that means by now these boys the americans have sent to do a mans job have only four hours to do us any damage so my comrades in arms this shit freeman is in a box our box weve got more men than he has plus your twenty ts mikhail all we have to do is keep him away from the tunnels for another he knows about the tunnels it was abramov hands forming a chin rest the smoke rising from his head as if he was on fire your stupid computers viktor he told beria while theyve been what did you call it crunching the numbers ive worked it out with pen and paper with that the tank commander of the siberian sixth turned around the notepad hed been working on and fixed his eyes on beria who frowning stared down through the havanas bluish brown haze abramov sat back in his chair well viktor youve been crunching numbers with all your permutations and what dyou call them combinations but theyre all wrong you havent got the message have you abramov didnt wait for a reply because you assumed the key the signature key in that plainlanguage message that your experts intercepted is fdr these three initials were given at the end so you thought ah its a threeline message in fact its a nineline message arrived at by the sum of the number of letters in roosevelt nine obviously the key for their message was the initials of any american president so the three letters fdr are just to tell them which american presidents name to use it could have been an american actor or something but the prearranged key between freeman and tibbet was presidential initials viktor beria gazed down noncommitally at mikhail abramovs jottings there was no doubt that abramov had indeed cleverly broken the long line of letters in the plainlanguage string down to nine lines of fourteen letters each so that the plain language text revealed freemans message to tibbet as whenyoureceive yankeegoodtogo frommebothofus willnothitexit buthitentrance andwipethemout andmrpeterrose neverdidgamble goodluckforusa beria picked up the yellow sheet and sat down in one of the six ugly but functional metal chairs that lined the rooms walls abramov was sitting back now allowing himself a victorious smile so viktor youre right we do have a gift abramov drew in a full draft of the dense cigar smoke we know that when freeman radios yankee good to go to the colonel tibbet the americans are going to attack the entrance and thanks to the chechen radio report we now know freeman and tibbet have to attack effectively in the next few hours to allow for any hope of success and abramov paused for effect it will give us ample time in which to evacuate the tunnels beautiful said beria approvingly his arms spread out like an angels wings we get all our technicians out and set one big fuck of an explosion at the entrance blow his what do the americans call those marines leathernecks yes comrades well blow freeman and his leathernecks sky high the snow will be red with american blood i like it said cherkashin the mood in abramovs office so upbeat it was all but palpable cherkashin was beaming he looked at both the infantry and the tank general weve got him comrades in the box once hes in well close the lid hes finished abramov exhaled the usually taciturn nononsense commander of the siberian sixth allowing himself the visceral excitement of anticipated revenge yes he agreed its payback time for our nemesis gentlemen but a word of caution close the entrances two blast doors but dont leave the outer door unguarded or he might suspect a trap well load the space between the outer and inner security doors with explosives we can destroy the enemy without destroying the equipment abramov looked at viktor beria how big is the outer door viktor five meters high ten meters wide abramov nodded and the depth of the space between the entrances outer door and its inner blast door one meter said beria maybe more abramov sat quietly thinking none of the three bothered to go down to the tunnels much once youd seen the technicians assemble one manpad torpedo or missile on the tunnels production line there wasnt much more to see and the air despite the constant roar of the high ventilation shafts was dank heavy with the sour smell of perspiration abramov beria and cherkashin preferred being in the abc hblock down in its palatially furnished bunker if necessary taking care of the consortiums business which had never been better since the fundamentalist muslim terrorists decision to carry out bin ladens promise to destroy america you know boasted beria these boys of mine guarding the entrance they might stop freeman by themselves without the need for any explosive is that a wish or a question abramov shot back as he simultaneously grabbed his landline phone to call the duty officer in charge of the guards at the entrance to the tunnels asking beria are you worried about them viktor abramov punched in the duty officers number while answering his own question to beria i wouldnt concern myself viktor they get their bonuses same as everyone else here but look if they cant hold well blow them up with the american bastards we cant afford a disruption of production ramon and his friends have been unequivocal on this point and for what his clients pay for our merchandise you cant blame him the arabs especially are constantly pushing him for product they want to be the first to use it against the us in the us thats why they sent elhage up here yes added cherkashin with his blueeyed boy who el hage sleeps with abramov countered is not our concern the duty officer was sorry hed kept abramov on hold hed been in the bathroom abramov fined him a hundred dollars on the spot for not having arranged for someone to man the phone during his absence now abramov continued be sure that you seal that second door switch off the air flow thats sucked down from the surface to feed the tunnels just have enough air coming in from the intake shafts we have hidden in the reeds around the exit abramov saw cherkashin glancing agitatedly at his watch i know what im doing sergei you look after your antiaircraft batteries if this snow stops you might be busy for a while the americansll try to use any gunships they managed to put down around the lake weve had bmd patrolling there but remember the lake is four thousand square kilometers weve been shelling the woods sector in hopes of hitting anything hidden in them but the snowdrifts have created a lot of hiding places that normally wouldnt be there on the flats abramov turned to cherkashin viktors right with such a time limit on them the americans are in a box he paused asking his two comrades how do the americans say it shooting fish in a barrel before either man could respond abramov advised cherkashin so sergei have your men ready with their manpads al jazeera will love it itll be the best commercial we could have wished for but be thorough we dont want to take chances seal the exit doors as well in the unlikely event that a few of the bastards escape the explosion in the entrance and manage to make it through the tunnels to the exit shaft good said beria yes replied abramov well play it safe he couldnt suppress a smile can you imagine comrades cnn has another special coming up and doesnt even know it thisll be bigger than katrina will there be enough air sucked in from the exit ventilators for our guys in the tunnels asked beria id say pull them out but youre correct weve got a backlog of al qaeda and hezbollah orders and added cherkashin we have wadi elhage here from hamas with his blueeyed boy whats the deal with elhage asked beria abramov didnt respond busying himself with consulting his rukovoditel vzryvchikablasters manual for the correct amount of rdx with a detonation of feet per second in order to annihilate the americans whats the deal repeated beria dont you read my memos responded cherkashin miffed that beria didnt recall all the work he and abramov had put into securing the deal between abc and hamas our agreement with elhage is to give him a hundred igla and vanguard manpads in return for him having hamas kill the infidel american general that was a contingency plan beria conceded when we first heard that freeman had been assigned to track down ramon and his team cherkashins tone was terse with sarcasm well viktor id say having freeman in our backyard is a fucking contingency all right all right answered the infantry commander i just left it up to mikhail you always do charged cherkashin you sign off on the memos then leave the unpleasant work to everyone else whats got your balls in a trap comrade retorted beria abramovs desk phone jangled the conversation was short and as he hung up he rose tightening his pistol belt the makarov mm snug against his waist the americans are starting to move now its stopped snowing so i suggest comrades that you save all your piss and vinegar for them remember what rommel used to say if you feel irritable kill something huh griped beria i dont need to be out of sorts to kill americans but i dont like being accused of laziness my battalion has always been ready to sergei isnt accusing you of anything said abramov hes upset about elhage bringing the boy with him sergeis a prude either that or some arab tried to fuck him when he was a boy eh sergei is that it if an arab had tried to mess with me said sergei id have strangled the bastard quite suddenly abramov abandoned all levity and punched the air force general affectionately on the shoulder so would i sergei i would do the same thing but business is business comrade those manpads for elhagell bring five million tax free cherkashin somewhat mollified by the promise of five million us dollars nodded in agreement the thing is responded cherkashin we dont need a suicide bomber now that we have freeman in a trap added insurance said abramov are they still at the farmhouse asked cherkashin yes confirmed abramov outside kamen rybolov thats on the lake cut in beria isnt that a bit close k chertovoy materi dammit viktor said cherkashin didnt you read any of the memos i sent you yes its a farmhouse but its six miles from the tunnels here the idea was to have one of the farm vehicles a trailor rig with a white flag approaching the american line for help americans are suckers for that kind of stuff americans suck said abramov and they all laughed at the memory of ramons scroll well began beria but couldnt continue until he coughed out the smoke from abramovs havana freeman wont suck in the morning hell be dead abramovs tobaccostained lower teeth were visible as his jaws closed hard on the cigar dead he joked in that heat viktor the bastardll evaporate with this abramov picked up the phone again and rang the entrance do you all set with the rdx all set sir good ah general abramov yes sir shouldnt we leave right now asked the duty officer i mean the guard party as well as production line staff abramov was again dusting ash off his uniform you have the remote yes sir the do answered well then bring it to me right now tell the guard detail youll be back in a half hour unless you want to stay with them youve notified the production line general ive got your bonus if you obey orders you can forget about your fine and ill triple your bonus if you dont youll get nothing im on my way general excellent money could do anything so said beria who frequently annoyed abramov and cherkashin with just this expression so what asked abramov getting up and grabbing his cap from the stand hearing the rain pelting down so this is it the americans are on the move yes we know that viktor chapter eighteen indeed the americans were moving and quickly freeman telling his fire team of aussie choir sal lee and gomez the tow hummers threeman crew and twelve other marines including melissa thomas that now speed was everything speed with laudace laudace toujours laudace the hummer was to be their mobile missile platform the twelve marines would form a crescent around the exit and freemans team would hit the exit itself do we know approximately where it is general aussie had asked on their departure from the wood approximately answered the general his force was moving west southwest from the wood toward the midsection of the twelvemile northsouth rail line between the town of kamen rybolov and the hamlet of ilinka leaving a new fire team from the advancing second wave to occupy the wood and so protect the hide of chipper armstrongs joint strike fighter in a natural revetment amongst fir and deadwood debris at the northwest sector of the wood for despite the allweather capability of the jsf the weather would have to improve further before either freeman or tibbet would unleash it for close air support freeman intended to get so close to the enemy that even with the jsfs stateoftheart avionics and friendorfoe detector the danger of blue on blue was too acute to risk it in the air beyond the wood errant abc artillery was coming down in unprecedented lines of fire a nightmare of work for abcs gunners who located between the hblock and the minefield had to continually change not only the elevation but also the azimuth settings of their guns it meant added anxiety for freemans force for unlike a creeping barrage or a fireforeffect barrage there was no discernible pattern that it could plan to avoid and out here trudging through the marsh where snow would soon turn to a muddy slush the high whistle of enemy artillery rounds whether coughed out from the ts main guns or by the big brutish tos seemed much louder in the absence of the noisedampening wood now a hundred yards behind them gomez out on freemans left saw a flash dived but never reached the white soggy earth before the airdelivered incendiary bomb exploded in an intense aerosol the blast lifted him up like a rag doll before dropping him to the earth corpsman bellowed freeman and within twenty seconds the marine medic ran fifty meters from the wood through rain and snow aussie lewis using his hands to pack gomez in snow snuffing out the multiple globs of fire all over gomezs body three minutes later aussie rejoined freemans group of nineteen now four in his team the hummers three and the twelve marines hows gomez freeman asked aussie thirddegree burns those fucking toss fucking flamethrower bombs outlawed by the geneva convention fucking russians used them against the chechens that was against civilians freeman said not combatants geneva convention banned them against combatants too aussie corrected him keep your voice down freeman told him incoming they all dropped to the snow as a full salvo thirty of the tos rounds screamed upon launch a long shoosh overhead and crashed into the wood ironically gomez helped by a medic and another marine whod come out from the wood to meet them was momentarily safer in the open while parts of the wood were burning i suppose freeman challenged aussie as they got to their feet and the general spat out a gob of dirty snow that you dont think i should have shot those two russians back there aussie shrugged for him to criticize the general would have been what his mother used to call a case of the pot calling the kettle black the war on terror was exactly that a war not a hereandthere situation where you had time for a seminar on human rights it was an ongoing every night every day thing for these and other soldiers fighting terror around the globe they walked on in the pouring rain for another fifteen minutes each man lost in his own thoughts until they paused before what freeman believed from the dead koreans map would be another fifteenminute walk to the exit which should be recognizable by a cluster of hot air vents its hard sometimes the general told aussie when youre hunting evil not to become evil yourself stress well all have to answer to god for that aussie his eyes temporarily focusing on the curtain of rain wasnt surprised either by the answer or by the fact that the general hadnt sidestepped or dismissed it it was the kind of dilemma that the general had trained all his men to examine here in this cold damp clime aussie recalled the hot dry day years before in iraq where he had been prepared on a mere hunch to take out a civilian who was running toward him pleading with a baby freeman and his group continued to spearhead the hummer by fifty yards the general preferring to place himself and the others in the snow and now rainveiled reeds ahead of the sound of the hummer the downpour was a subdued roar as it pelted down on the ant and termite mounds in the reeds and along with the partially melting sheets of ice flooded the indigent flora unless they kept moving fast the ice would start crunching underfoot giving their position away despite what was now the shoulderhigh cover of sodden reeds freeman moving and thinking fast on point realized the russians had been particularly clever arranging for the incoming fresh air and outgoing bad air vents to be hidden in the tall reeds of the lake and marshlands these were the last places anyone would suspect of having three tunnels beneath them tunnels that from the dead korean engineers info ran for about three hundred feet back from here near the edge of the lakes southwestern marsh to directly below abcs hblock it meant that the land mines like the one that had fatally wounded eddie mervyn must have been sown from where eddie had fallen all the way back to the hblock but there were certain things that the map the scale of which was approximate hadnt shown and freeman wondered whether or not there was any kind of security apron of mines immediately beyond the exit they were now approaching the area where eddie had tripped the mine the generals senses were in sync excited by the sounds of renewed battle all around him he was absorbing and processing every sight sound and memory he could possibly monitor under the pressure of the looming deadline freemans experience and his encyclopedic knowledge of military tactics had taught him how russians unlike their american counterparts were not known for building in redundancy in the us cheyenne mountain tunnel complex the rockcovered redoubt of norad control there was always more than one of anything in case something broke down the russian rubles collapse after the end of the cold war and the frantic drive amongst russian entrepreneurs to catch up to make a quick buck had as far as freeman saw done nothing to reduce the noredundancy problem his guess therefore was that there was probably only one exit the scale of the map that melissa thomas had retrieved from the korean engineer placed the exit in an area of about a square mile but in the hurry he and the rest of the group were in there wouldnt be much if any time to do an indepth search and i see it announced aussie vapor eleven oclock a hundred yards freeman saw something buck violently in the tall raincurtained rocks beyond the twoto threefoot rise hed felt earlier in the day before eddie had fallen the heat and scream of the toss rounds rushed over them exploding in the wood of mongolian oak at the height of a man splintered oak clods of sand reeds frozen earth and vegetation cascaded around them frozen lumps of iceveined marsh mud striking aussies and melissa thomass helmets the big fortytwoton tos bucked again the hummers tires churning up reeds ice and sand as it veered wildly left and right to avoid being hit a tos round they were usually fired at distances of under four hundred yards missed the hummer again this time ripping open a nearby colony of mansized ant nests with such force that the concussion swept into the group with the strength of a kick in the back the shock had put young melissa thomas into a dangerous comatose condition that without immediate access to stateoftheart mash equipment could result in her slipping into deep coma mark that vent freeman shouted but most couldnt see it freeman pointed immediately right and ducked down the hummers tow missile its control vanes and wires silver streaks through the rain had hit the tos causing it to buck again but this time it wasnt moving from the recoil of firing another mm thermobaric warhead but flying apart its metal fragments bansheeing through the rainslashed air the marine fire team and the remainder of the group scrambling for protection behind anthill tree stump anything nearby the fragments from the tos rained down over the minefield setting off a score of antipersonnel mines to the right where freeman had been pointing when the hummers corporal had gotten the big lumbering tos in his sights as the shower of debris diminished freeman again shouted find that vent move while his men spread out freeman called out to aussie give me a hand here the general was kneeling by the unconscious thomas she had no pulse help me drag her to that ant pile aussie did as he was told but wondered why bother wasting time trying to get the young marine to the shelter of a damned ant heap found it it was young kegg he meant the outlet vents not the exit itself theyre using tree stumps to house the air vents looks like three no four of em theyre all grated and elbowed like a sink to stop leaves and crap falling in freeman called out to sal you johnny and choir see if you can find the exit opening in this snow itll probably be flush to the earth maybe a trapdoor in that high hump i dont think itll be mined but watch your step yes sir said sal shooting a quick glance at aussie and at the prostrate marine think shell be okay well see said freeman quickly tearing off her flak jacket and ripping open her khaki shirt bandage her eyes quickly he told aussie as sal ran off kegg and the fire team forming a defense perimeter after tagging the four tree stumps that contained the tin housings that were shaped like the number two were intakes two outlets the shoulderhigh reeds hiding them but condensation was clearly visible where the warmer vented air met the icy arctic air hurry up aussie what i dont understand said aussie quickly using his own field bandage to blindfold the comatose thomas is that the rumor in the group is that you told colonel tibbet in your message to him that were going to attack the entrance to the tunnels not the exit i know said the general and nothing more the moment aussie had finished blindfolding melissa freeman grabbed the marines ankles and dragged her onto the ant heap the insects immediately swarmed over the invaders chest face and body what in hell began aussie but before he could get out the next word thomass body was in spasm her heart given the jolt it needed not an invasive jolt of electricity but a collective jolt of poison from the hundreds of ant bites shocking her heart back into action via her bodys adrenaline response shit said aussie seeing her twitching coming back to life youre a fucking genius general id argue if i could aussie said freeman dragging melissa who was now screaming with pain away from the insects quiet he told her as she struggled to stand up fell back then succeeded with his help were taking off the blindfold melissa didnt want those ants to get at your eyes ants what i be quiet freeman told her sternly as she collapsed again youll wake up the neighborhood a comment that added to aussie lewiss awe at what hed just seen on this battlefield if i survive he promised himself ill never forget this ever freeman jabbed her with a onetime morphine syringe and pushed out a small oval pink pill from his firstaid blister pack benadryl thisll help make you a bit dozy but not too much again melissa was trying very unsteadily to get on her feet but the effect of the tos rounds concussion was still evident in her wobbly walk as aussie hustling as much as he dared led her over to the high brushand reedcovered ground where wisps of vapor could be seen bleeding from the marsh and which kegg and another in his fire team suspected of housing the exit door on closer examination kegg saw there were other large circular bumps of snow rocks sticking through the lake now turning a chafflike brown color the glistening ice tent that had formerly sheathed them now melting in the downpour that was sending the ants into a further frenzy as they sought to repair the earthquake that had assaulted them in the blast from the explosion of the mm missile and thomass sudden appearance in their midst well have you medevaced asap freeman assured melissa soon as we get this tunnel business wrapped up aussie handed thomas her ma rifle can you still use this he had to repeat it in the din you kidding said melissa mistaking genuine concern as criticism of the only female marine combatant in yorktowns marine expeditionary unit beneath the superbly camouflaged net roof of abcs tank park near the hblock general abramov with cherkashin nearby was issuing lastminute instructions to his siberian sixths second in command colonel nureyev a short tough thickset man whom his tank crews called the dancer in deliberate contrast to the great nimblefooted nureyev of ballet fame and stressing to all his siberian sixth tank captains that except for a few main battle tanks that had been given weaponsfree status and sent out to harass the american flanks most of the ts must be held back these would be ready to surge around and into the main american force that abramov was certain would soon launch an attack against the hblock but no sooner had he explained the situation to the siberian sixth than abramov saw at least two platoons of berias naval infantry company moving through the safe channels in the minefield before turning south toward the exit area about a mile from freemans force whats the point abramov thundered at beria who was standing in his infantry command car abramov was incredulous you should have kept your men back here beria didnt you read the intercept between freeman and tibbet that i decoded why are you committing your best infantry over there on the lake side near the exit dammit didnt you read the message freeman is only using the attack on the exit as a diversionary tactic when all the time he and tibbet plan to hit us here at the hblock the entrance to the tunnels so im asking you viktor why are you bothering to commit your crack naval infantry to the damned exit because i have read your decode whats more ive reread and reread it and now i think that maybe freeman is trying to pull a fast one i think he intends to make the main attack through the exit how do you possibly come to that conclusion you think im an idiot you think ive decoded the message incorrectly no answered beria i dont think theres anything wrong with your decoding but that you havent understood what freeman means ive misunderstood you say what it tells me viktor and i might add what it tells cherkashin is that we need everybody here particularly crack troops like yours to guard headquarters and the computer the whole thrust of freemans message if youd read it carefullyis that he intends to attack the entrance freeman knows and hes right that if he destroys us and the computer here at headquarters the americans have won lathes all the engineering stuff in the tunnels can be replaced but if the darpa alpha information is destroyed then were finished my propali kaput didnt you read the decode or what beria was stunned what the hell was abramov ranting about asking him ad nauseam whether he understood the intercepted message between freeman and tibbet da beria said employing the sullen tone of a disrespectful peasant staring angrily at abramov and his bigprick cigar yes comrade general i saw your fucking decode but youre so cocksure of yourself mikhail youre not seeing what the hell is happening are you beria paused using his revolver hand to angrily wave away the thick bluish gray smoke the havanas stink mixing with the choking fumes of abramovs twenty massed main battle tanks arent you watching freemans troops over there through your binoculars if you ask me theyre more than a diversionary force theyre marines from the american fleet theyre tough bastards huh said abramov dismissively youre seeing what you want to believe beria looked hard at abramov with the sounds of battle growing closer he reached inside his battle tunic pulled out his copy of abramovs decoded intercept and quickly read it aloud then asked abramov the reference to this peter rose yes i saw it said abramov its probably a goodluck phrase the americans use in the same way that we do you know who pete rose is beria pressed breaking open his pistol it was always the last check he made before going into action like rubbing a rabbits foot for good luck no abramov answered testily i dont know who he is and as i said it doesnt matter a gocode or an operational name can be anything operation bird rescue for example beria seeing that each chamber was loaded snapped the revolver shut you see no other significance in the name no beria slipping the revolver into his holster asked cherkashin the same question no answered cherkashin who up to this point had been ignoring the argument poring instead over his pilots tactical charts and the meteorological reports which called for more heavy rain rose said beria was an american baseball player famous neither the air force general nor abramov showed much interest i dont follow sports said abramov with an air of condescension as a wine snob might address a beer drinker after which he took obvious satisfaction as commander of the sixth siberian armored as well as overall garrison commander in ordering that the bulk of abcs forces at least threequarters of all personnel were to secure hblock his tanks would form a ring of steel around it so that the assault force which the american was no doubt assembling with a fresh infusion of marines from the second wave would not be met by a skeleton abc force as freeman would no doubt have it but instead would be annihilated and if the guards in the tunnels could not hold the duty officer need only press a button and the rdx would vaporize the enemy in the tunnels as well as many of abcs soldiers but abramov knew that such collateral damage could always be replaced by abcs danger bonuses russia was full of desperate men without work soldiers without work pete rose beria continued was disgraced and never made baseballs hall of fame at cooperstown because he had been caught betting on baseball games i think mention of him by freeman is to tell tibbet that everything in the message is exactly the opposite of what freeman intends to do youre crazy said abramov youve been reading too much american press its full of lies beria ignored the remark and continued calmly during world war ii when englishspeaking japanese pilots tried to pass themselves off on radio as americans the american pilots if suspicious used to ask questions the answers to which were common knowledge to bornandbred americans if the american pilots didnt get the right responses they knew there was a spy amongst them and if youve bothered to read freemans file indeed if you know anything about freeman youll know he has an encyclopedic mind about things military and its exactly the kind of trickery and wartime practice that hed know about abramov opened his hands like a holy man in the universal gesture of conciliation i tell you viktor this pete rose thing is nothing the phrase is probably merely a decryption identification key for their intercomputer traffic youre being paranoid viktor now recall your infantry before beria could respond cherkashin added mikhails right viktor youre making too much of this were all on edge but you have to recall your naval platoons because well need them here well finish the americans off together eh it was two against one so beria compromised he recalled two of the four platoons eighty of the best and now most highly paid terrorist infantry in the world good decision viktor said abramov now i should tell you both that ive ordered several company hqs to assign video technicians along the twomile front that means comrades the pictures of the americans being decimated as they attack us will be on cnn and al jazeera this evening tomorrow mornings newscasts at the latest cherkashin was a tad uncomfortable with abramovs use of the word decimated the tank general was using it cherkashin knew as most people did to mean a casualty rate of nine out of ten when in fact it had originally meant one casualty in ten still this was a high rate for american commanders abramovs tv idea was a good one because the american public always started to panic as soon as they saw a single body bag coming off an aircraft on cnn and when the cnn woman with the big chest marte price started yakking about more american casualties the americans would start going weak at the knees she and other american media announcers were considered by abcs clientele such as elhage hamas and hezbollah as valuable albeit unwitting propagandists for the terrorist cause one of a pair of hummers flown in less than ten minutes before from the second wave and ordered by tibbet to assist freeman in his attack through the tunnels exit skidded to a stop as its gunner saw tanks moving and snaking quickly through the minefields safe road the four tanks commanders were doing an israeli standing up cupolas open to see better in the pouring rain despite the ts infrared recon and lasertargeting system the commanders four of abramovs best from the siberian sixth were cursing the snaking course of the road meant to keep the tanks off a straight line to prevent any antiarmor units having time to frame them for successful missile attack but now that the american line was reported as being still five hundred yards southeast of the square mile of mines it was unlikely any of them would see any more russian armor in the heavy rain radio silence between the four ts was maintained instead the tanks cos were communicating by the triedandtrue russian method of using rapid yet distinct flag signals such as those still used by such elite forces as the british royal navy when a ship was requested to go sid signals dead for reasons of launching a surprise attack against the enemy colonel nureyev abramovs second in command and tactical leader of the t force took the small but distinct yellow flag he used on such occasions and held it out snappily to his left soon they would be out of the minefield the crackle and spit of smallarms fire so loud now that he could see the flashes of the soontobe outnumbered and outmechanized american force in this area because of the midair collision of the cobras during the first wave many marines because their transport helos had had to take sharp evasive action ended up being too far north of the minefield and too close to the lake fighting their way westward from the lake then south they were exhausted and desperately short of ammunition and food worst of all they were now too far away to lend support to freemans team the threeman fire team of kegg and the two other marines one of them with the saw machine gun formed a cshaped defensive arc facing away from the general area indicated on the koreans map as the exit zone it was the carcs job to protect the backs of freeman aussie sal choir and johnny lee as choir used his small metallic finger to search for mines as he moved the twoandahalfinchlong batterypowered sonaractivated probe which extended like a bayonet from the end of his m he listened attentively for the probes lowpitched return warning the outgoing pitch so high that it was detectable by only a few individuals whose hearing was well above the hertz level the instrument was so expensive that only one had been issued per fourman fire team it might have saved eddie mervyn from his horrific wound but in the pressure of battle not knowing how far away the russians were there had been no time to use it but now that tibbets second wave was arriving bolstering the first freeman seized the window of opportunity to press forward with the search for the exit hatch no mines here sir said choir planting one of his green safety flags and sweeping the finger from one side of the suspected exit zone to the other without getting a mine tone over his walkmantype earphones preoccupied as he was with his task indeed precisely because he was so preoccupied searching for mines choir thought of prince and felt heartsick two minutes later one of the three marines manning the protective carc spotted a ts aerial whipping back and forth and moving his way above headhigh reeds two hundred yards away its diesel engine a subdued but angry growl in the sodden vegetation then it disappeared shit said the marine whered he go he radioed back to the hummer you see that tank he asked the corporal affirmative came the answer got the fucker on thermal there are three more a ways back coming from the direction of the minefield tone shouted choir ten oclock he moved farther left tone theyve mined this side of the snow hump right up to those four tree trunks that theyre using to hide the air shafts but theyve left clear ground on the other side so thats obviously where anyone coming out of the tunnels is going to head if this is an exit well freeman ordered if we find an opening anywhere in this goddamn hump make sure we flag it correctly he didnt want to see another eddie mervyn incident lets probe the snow mound on the minefree side said choir quickly use your bayonets if that maps right we should find a door or something freeman could hear more armor approaching in the distance the tanks were moving more slowly than the first t that the hummers corporal had fixed in his thermal sight but the general could see they were gaining ground nonetheless and so he told the men to stop digging ordering everyone back he would use the hummer to do the digging corporal he radioed the hummer back up out of these reeds get two hundred yards from here if we lose the radio ill use visuals one wave with my helmet hit the mound with a tow second fritz use another one got it two hundred yards one tow on your wave another on each subsequent wave got it sir with that the hummer made a tight uturn the still partially frozen reeds crunching underneath like cereal a rush of the vehicles bluish exhaust rising dissipating and wafting over the carc marines and into the reeds around the tree trunks now twenty feet away from freeman lets all get back behind the hummer shouted freeman soon as the second tow hits it we go in no matter what got it yes sir freemans marines said in unison determination in their eyes then everything went wrong running back freeman saw the hummer buck glimpsed one of its tows contrails then heard the distinctive boom of a ts main gun firing the hummer somersaulted then disintegrated into gobs of fire simultaneously a headpunching whoomp told freeman the t had exploded and he could see it belching flame and vomiting crimson fire into the dark green reeds he didnt pause everyone back to the mound and well dig out that snow now aussie go check the hummer aussie did by which time the general choir sal and johnny lee were using their trench tools to dig scrape and chuck away the snow sweating like gandy dancers on a railroad in high summer perspiration running down each mans face they dug like men possessed aussie came running back from the hummer all dead he reported tersely nothing usable he began digging they all heard the ring of metal against an entrenching tool and fell to the ground except choir not a mine he assured them just metal on metal it was a door handle another handle became visible a second later no shovels freeman ordered hands only he had no idea how close the exit was to the tunnels only that the map had shown a narrow tubular exit burrowed out of the rock approximately four feet wide and less than a hundred feet long on a thirtydegree gradient which as he noted to aussie was an extraordinarily sharp incline if they were approaching the tunnel entrance freeman didnt want to give his teams presence away by making any unnecessary noise drawing on all his expertise in things military and nonmilitary freeman devised a war plan on the spot aussie sal johnny come with me choir i want you to handle the grenades right responded choir already donning his ir goggles and gas mask his tone confident after years of working as part of freemans team and of always thinking one step ahead he was ready for action good said freeman who with aussie sal and johnny lee began donning his ir goggles and gas mask choir freeman instructed start the proceedings chapter nineteen ninety feet below in a guard station at the foot of the long exit stairway a guard unit of seven men and three women responsible for the security of the exit end of abcs tunnel complex were bored silly completely cut off from the action above them and long used to the numbing sameness of production line noises in the three tunnels there was nothing new to do or discuss other than the american attack about which they had been given no news whatsoever the only thing that mitigated the sheer bonecrushing monotony of guard duty in the three connected tunnels was the substantial tunnelnaya premiya tunnel bonus but even the bonus could not keep the guard detail on their feet during the eighthour shift and despite the strict rules against it a game of texas hold em poker would usually be in progress as it was now with the latest production line inspector wandering over now and then between checking the counterfeit american korean and chinese manufacturers serial numbers on the completed igla and vanguard manpads and the new hypersonic weapons and ammunition being made as a result of abcs victory at darpa alpha did you hear that scraping noise one of the cardplaying four asked dont worry andreyovich said the number checker vladimir the exit door must be under a ton of snow if it is anything its probably one of those stupid deer rooting around for grass anyway in this weather all kinds of craps blowing around the lake and the marshes plus last reports from hblock say we can just keep working no problem the americans are getting the shit kicked out of them andreyovich nodded maybe but someone had better check lets not risk the bonus vladimir you come up with me andreyovich looked at his cards the worst hand hed had in months im out he said grabbing his ak need to stretch my legs anyway good man said the numbers inspector a big bald jovial man from one of the hamlets near the railhead that were now all but ghost towns abc having combed them for maintenance support workers both guards heard several hollowsounding bumps as choir tossed two tear gas canisters and yellow sos smoke grenades onto the grates of the two airintake shafts the yellow smoke laced with tear gas descended quickly spreading throughout the three parallel tunnels their connecting passages and the entrance and exit vestibules at either end of the tunnels the moment the terrorist guards and weapons assemblers at the exit end of the three tunnels saw the thickening malevolentlooking yellow gas pouring down the ninetyfootlong cementlined exit shaft the alarm horn sounded its deep strangled arggh arggh drowning out the usual cacophony of the assembly line the horns unrelenting blasts accompanied by the scream of gaz filling the subterranean world turned panic to frenzy sending the disorganized horde of three hundred terrorist workers rushing away from the exit toward the massive security doors at the tunnels entrance roars of rage erupting from the frantic mob when they found the inner security door locked the terror of men and women clamoring screaming for the door to be opened fed on itself the duty officer who only hours before had thought himself incapable of pushing the button that would explode the rdx unless he was blackmailed now discovered that his fear of the mob made it easier to contemplate putting his fellow terrorists out of their misery up on the surface the moment the general aussie sal lee and choir saw the yellowish green smoke rising up from the out vents freeman and his team ran down the stairs of the long narrow exit tunnel then split up at the bottom freeman taking the first tunnel aussie and sal the second johnny lee and choir the third running along a grated metal floor they could hear the nightmarish cries coming from the mob of trapped terrorists beyond hammering and yelling hysterically for the entrance doors to be opened no doubt terrified the tunnel complex was being attacked with chlorine gas or as their greatgreatgrandfathers had called it mustard gas which the americans like the russians still had in ample supply further exciting the terrorists fear was their conviction shared by the duty officer who sitting safely two floors up in one of the hblocks administrative offices had caught a glimpse of the intruders that the tunnel complex would soon be swarming with americans and when the duty officer heard abramovs insistence that the rdx be blown any hesitation that he might have had disappeared in the belief that he would be acting humanely putting such tortured souls out of their misery after all as abramov sharply instructed him you wouldnt treat an animal like that the duty officer pressed the button the resulting subterranean roar reverberated through the tunnels the concussion wave almost knocking freemans team off their feet and in the middle tunnel forcing aussie and sal to grab one of the manpad lathes to steady themselves it was testimony to abramovs expertise that he had calculated the amount of rdx so precisely that while the two halves of the massive door were bent and rendered useless by the blast the door had not collapsed acting as abramov had wanted it to as a barrier between him and the enemy safe above in the hblock abramov beria and cherkashin were cold as steel they had no intention of waiting for what was being reported by the entrance guard detail as poison gas to leak up into the hblock thoroughly professional now with no time to spare in a blame game at least not yet about the colossal error abramov had made enabling dedushkagrandpa freeman to heap humiliation upon them via the pete rose feint abramov declared dead men cant make sales adding poison gas wont hurt the production line we can always get more men i suggest gentlemen we take our bonuses and vacate without waiting for the other twos acquiescence abramov quickly took his cell phone out of its holster and punched in three digits briskly instructing his quartermaster transport helo for three plus luggage fully armed sharks to escort us and yourself on the pad behind abc fuel for vladivostok now yes general well be there in ten minutes five abramov shouted into the phone five and you get double your bonus in gold yes general beria and cherkashin now moved quickly to the safe and withdrew their keys to their respective gold bullion boxes and attaché cases as well as the access codes to their swiss bank accounts got your keys beria asked abramov abramov checking the slide on his makarov mm pistol retorted are you serious well be back in production next week cmon lets get to the pad they could already hear the heavily armed black shark escort helos hovering overhead and the rotors of a big bugeyed hind transport chopper descending to the hblocks emergency pad located only yards from the edge of the enormous t camouflage net beyond the mass of redhot twisted and steaming metal that had been the inner door between the entrance vestibule and the tunnels there was a phalanx of upraised russian hands dimly visible in the emergency lanterns light were they surrendering many of the terrorists were crumpling to the floor in the eerie yellowgreen fog the choking impact of the tear gas in the confined space taking a rapid toll chesters marines above keeping up a steady rain of tear gas canisters and smoke grenades from inside their gas masks freeman aussie sal choir and johnny lee found that despite the stateoftheart charcoaland chemicalpad filters the air was becoming throatraspingly hot and thin none of freemans team saw the flash but all heard the bursts of ak fire in the choking gas the shooters aim was way off but they could have hit any one of the team fire yelled freeman and the team opened up taking what shelter they could behind the assembly line machinery nearest them in addition to firing their weapons freemans team tossed twelve he and eight flashbang grenades the wild terrorist ak fire presumably coming from the guard detail absorbed by the boxes of guidance vanes for igla and vanguard manpads that lined the walls of the tunnels the flashbangs taking out most of the remaining emergency lanterns what little light remained casting huge macabre shadows on the tunnel walls amid the acridsmelling smoke and tear gas some of the terrorists managed to stand screaming for mercy freemans stentorian nasal voice boomed through his mask the cole the world trade towers the pentagon flight his ak chopping them down the barrel of his kalashnikov so hot he wondered whether it would tolerate another mag just yet giving it time to cool he whipped out his h k sidearm and with aussie sal lee and choir doing likewise continued putting the wounded out of their misery aussie his hand wet with flesh and bone continued his gruesome but as he saw it necessary task if america and her allies were to be safer from these heartless murderers who sold their wares to the likes of hamas and hezbollah he could make out a clutch of swarthy middle eastern faces screaming at him not begging for mercy but hurling their hatred at him the arab face nearest him so contorted for a moment he looked as frightening as aussie must in his gas mask aussie yelling at him you look like one of those bastards in bali as the next burst punched the arab back his body crumpling beneath the waning light aussie seeing the name ramon stenciled on the mans bloodsoaked battle tunic immediately aussie remembered the attack on darpa alpha one of the victims having written ram and scarund on a piece of paper before he died now looking down at the dead terrorist he saw the raised angry red scar under the mans chin all right freeman yelled out his voice muffled by the gas masks filters but sounding just as resolute as it had at the beginning of the subterranean raid hurry up with the c guys and lets get back topside the five men the general in the first tunnel aussie and sal in the second and johnny and choir in the third quickly placed the fistsized lumps of c connecting them with det cord at strategic points along the production line of each tunnel the det cords from the three tunnels were wrapped into one then run topside by the team and connected to the remote initiator that once the team was safe topside would be activated beginning the firing sequence that would move through the det cord to the globs of c the cords explosive detonation wave traveling at more than seven thousand yards a second thus in effect exploding all the globs of c simultaneously freeman told each of the other four men to take a manpad and portable power pack with him from the assembly line there was a chance he knew that if the weather cleared the russians might just risk some of their hitherto revetmenthidden attack helos to harass the marines evacuation if for no other reason than sheer spite against this however there was the equally good chance that without product to sell after the tunnels blew up what pilot would bother to risk his life for revenge sans bonus son of a bitch said young kegg as freeman and the other four gasmasked manpadcarrying warriors emerged from the exit what the fuck went on down there sounded like a a war it was said aussie for the fucking terrorists he whipped off his gas mask with his left hand and took in a deep draft of cold rainy air those pricks wont be making any more of these he raised the igla with his right hand these five are the only ones left you know how to fire one aussie joshed kegg surely you jest boy aussie lifted the fortypound missile in its launchersheath to his right shoulder the rockets aerodynamic spike in front of the heatseeking infrared and its flare decoy analyzer piercing the air aussie looked about whered the opposition go the navy infantry replied a sodden but smiling lieutenant chester soon as the word got out that the tunnels were under attack that freeman suckered abramov i guess they thought whats the point anyway theyve pulled back for now you ready with that remote choir called out freeman ready sir good the general told kegg and the marines two fire team buddies to go back with melissa thomas these vents are going to start really smoking in the blink of an eye cmon people move they moved and waited for choir to activate the inititiator the det cord in effect a long explosivefilled flexitube from a spool had a burn rate so fast that once the initiator kicked off the firing sequence the major explosions of the c would occur in a fraction of a second but they didnt aw came aussies bitter disappointment fuck a duck it seemed interminable then they heard saw high up through the rain five helos a big transporter and four black shark gunships rising and turning above the minefield take those bastards out yelled freeman ill take the big guy in the middle lets see how they like their own medicine freeman hadnt even had time to take his gas mask off the igla on his shoulder he placed his left foot forward the ground power supply kit giving full surge power to the missile in four seconds gripping the launcher by its flanged neck he gained visual contact squeezed the trigger and heard the gentle whirring of the missiles automatic target lock and launch circuits the primary booster igniting the missile passing through the tube disabling the first safety twenty feet from the general the sustainer motor firing blowing hot air and reed debris into his gas mask the missile now streaking at over a thousand miles per hour in the two seconds since leaving the tube second safety was now gone and unless the missiles twentyfivepound blast and fragmentation warhead hit something within fifteen seconds it would selfdestruct the subsequent whooshing sounds were the other four fireandforget iglas taking off from the shoulder launchers on aussie sal choir and johnny lee johnny slipped on a patch of mud as he fired the igla going near vertical no one said anything watching the five missiles fierce orange streaks with the bluish sulfur exhausts visible terrorists are popping flares called sal look at em panic said aussie watching the helos jinking hard left right right trying to outmaneuver the closing iglas flares popping everywhere like hundreds of little meteorites burning up in the gray rainy sky but the iglae devoid of a friendorfoe tone because terrorists didnt need any such discriminating equipment proved a formidable weapon with infrared decoy override the e ignored the tortuous frantic maneuvers of the helos two miles up there were one two three then a fourth explosion as the traveling fuel tanks as aussie called the russian choppers blew up sending down heavy golden showers of burning debris that upon impact detonated dozens of small antipersonnel and big antitank mines cratering the snowand raincovered ground a lone shark helo the only survivor of the four attack choppers obviously deciding not to risk any more manpad attacks turned west climbed higher and fled into the mountain fastness of china across the border freeman and salvini thought they saw a chute blossom but in the rain it was difficult to be sure whether it was that or a piece of fabric from the transporter caught in the air currents as the fuselage plunged earthward there was something wrong however as freeman taking off his gas mask realized that there should have been explosions not above him but ninety feet below in the tunnels did you press that remote the general asked choir yes sir ive checked the box and its middle tunnels det cord thats screwing things up there must be a break nothings wrong up at this end something must have fallen on it or cut through it said aussie one of those bastards his voice was suddenly drowned out by the combined roar of a super stallion and a cobra gunship riding shotgun both helos dropping decoy flares despite the noise the booming voice of the stallions crew chief managed to cut through it and the fury of the rotor wash evac immediately mission is over every one of freemans team and the marines around him wanted to leave but no one thought that they should theyd cleaned out the rats in the nest below but not the nest as freeman told the stallions crew chief through cupped hands that reeked of cordite and tear gas from the tunnels doesnt matter the crew chief hollered back we got orders from yorktown cmon general i havent got all fucking day the cobra gunship was rising and falling in the side draft of the stallions enormous rotors cmon missions over thats an order from colonel tibbet youve run out of time the general was cupping his right ear cant hear you general the crew chief bellowed again we have to get you guys out of here now colonel tibbets order i outrank him said freeman but dammit all right he continued and ordered everyone aboard go go no matter what their personal feelings they were professional soldiers freemans team and the marines and knew orders were orders as the crew chief helped lift gomez to put him in a litter the others scrambled aboard the overcrowded helo through a jumble of other bodies and weapons the stallions anxious copilot glanced back saw no one on the ground but spotted an armored vehicle spitting fire and bristling with manpads racing toward them from about a mile away on the edge of the frozen marshland that ran back to the lake because he too was looking in the distance at the armored vehicle even as he kept hauling the others into the helo the crew chief noticed something in the rainwashed landscape previously hidden by the snow a vast carpet of dead birds thousands of them it wasnt until six minutes after theyd scrambled aboard the already dangerously overloaded helo which like all the other stallions was trying to get as many of their fellow americans out before the twentyfourhour deadline that someone noticed that neither freeman nor the marine melissa thomas was aboard the stallion but the pilot and the copilot had their orders on the other hand marines didnt leave their dead wounded or living behind those cocksuckers kegg shouted get a load of this shit he was watching the crew chiefs tv feed on the twelveinch bulkhead inset screen cnn was running an al jazeera tape which the arab station said had just been taken in overflight by a lone shark helo and which showed patches of yellowish smoke rising in lake khanka near siberia al jazeera claimed the smoke was poison gas used by americans against a defenseless refugee camp then there was a cnn clip marte price thrusting her mike into the face of a nearly hysterical coed iinever thought id live to see the day my country would use such a such a horrible awful thing its like you know totally irresponsible oh mimicked a marine who was also watching the feed like youre totally insane you silly bitch we colored the friggin tear gas with a yellow smoke grenade you stupid whore thats all we did yeah put in kegg but it sure frightened the shit out of em his laugh was contagious the marines pentup emotions suddenly finding a release but aussie choir sal and johnny lee werent laughing they were petitioning the pilot to go back and pick up melissa thomas and freeman cant do it said the pilot quite properly to go back with a manpad vehicle on the loose and risk losing every man hed picked up would have been the height of irresponsibility where the fuck did he go aussie asked sal angrily and the woman said choir it was so disorderly we shouldve never mind what we should have done cut in aussie what are we gonna do now tell yorktown put in the crew chief to get a star bird over here fast itd be their only chance agreed choir by the time they drop them a kit we can have a herk on its way out of japan and here in choir did the math in his head four hundred and fifty miles two hours tops two hours said aussie i know said choir but its a star or nothing we can say the herks coming in to pick up our wounded tibbets boys say were missing a few well go plain language if you like said the pilot tell everyone to head for the lake bit bloody vague snorted aussie lakes four thousand square miles bigger n rhode island weve got a couple of dusters hueys the pilot told him theyre packed under nets near the ice as backup evac for any lost marines then shit said aussie send one of the hueys in to pick up the general and thomas negative said the pilot a lot of guys have been given the location of those two hueys but those birds come out exposing themselves looking for our general and his girlfriend hey aussie was on the stairs up to the cockpit but sal choir and johnny lee managed to save the pilot from aussie snapping his neck fer cryin out loud aussie salvini shouted above the deafening rotor slap and engines hes right aussie shouted choir calm down boyo those hueys cant risk having any manpads fired at them or risk anything else those terrorist pricks have left if the general and thomas stay where they are theyve got a chance with a star aussie cooler now shook off sals restraining arm have you ever done it a star no but sal tried a smile its in the manual he then resorted to a favorite line of freemans lighter moments taken from one of his favorite movies those magnificent men in their flying machines ja repeated sal its in zee manual a german officer can do anything from zee manual seriously though aussie put in choir they drop instructions with it i fuckin hope so the marines only use volunteer crew you think he went back said johnny lee of course he went back johnny said aussie fucking det cord fucked up so the old mans gone back down the hole alone stupid bastard it was a term of affection think thomas is helping him i dunno said sal she couldve collapsed under the belly of the stallion it was a hell of a rush before we left not even the cobra would have seen her sal was only half right melissa thomas hadnt collapsed in the evac rush and the cobra hadnt seen her nor had freeman in the maelstrom of swirling reeds and muddy snow that was aerosoled by the downward blast of the stallions rotors the general quickly pulling on his gas mask had slipped back into the tall reeds to retrieve his pack melissa thomas seeing him intuitively sensed he wasnt going to evac that he was going back down to rectify the broken det cord or remove whatever had either fallen on it or been put there by a terrorist in a lastditch effort to stop the detonation of the c laid by the team she owed him her life from the moment he had astonished his men dragging her blindfolded onto the ant heap the adrenaline rush triggered by her bodys reaction to the ant bites poison bringing her back to life she had incurred a debt that any human being would understand was she overconfident she wondered putting a neophytes faith in the corps in the article of faith that the marines as always would be back to get as many people out as possible or given the naked fact that the deadline had now passed would she merely be listed as mia the best she could hope for to be honored in absentia what marine thomas didnt know was that what freeman and his team member sal had surmised might be a chute was indeed a parachute abramov landing sodden and bruised but otherwise unhurt in the reeddense minefield abramov made no attempt to chase his chute or rein it in instead he stood precisely where he had landed knowing he was in the minefield and though his legs were trembling with the effort of sustaining the weight of the bundles of us thousanddollar bills beneath his tank commanders uniform and the sheer weight of the twenty small gold bullion bars he wore in a belt he remained on spot making one call on his cell to his tank commander colonel nureyev dancer release elhage and friend and tell your men theres bullion for freemans head done general said colonel nureyev who then called whatever abc staff were still on duty most had fled but a radio operator still on duty had apprised nureyev of the intercepts that had been made of the american aircraft communication and that abramov beria and cherkashin had left together in the transports with abramov as overall commander having taken the vital darpa alpha computer disk with him having now spoken with abramov nureyev concluded that of the three abramov was the sole survivor of the igla manpad attack nureyev then called his own private troop of four ts i know he told them that the americans are pulling out but this freeman bastard is still around american channels were randomly monitored by our scanners during their first wave evac one intercept was specifically asking wheres freeman so hes still out there strictly speaking were on a ceasefire order some girlfriend deal between our two socalled presidents following the deadline but out here we rule and theres bullion on his head who wants in one of the four tank teams opted out theyd seen enough destruction five ts taken out by marine antitank missiles and hummerfired tows but the three remaining tank crews opted for the chance of bullion lets hope captain nureyev told his ic that elhage doesnt get freeman before we do right said the captain do we have a gps on freeman no but the iglas that brought down abramov could have only come from the tunnels and they havent been blown i dont think that american shithead has come all this way to kill us only to leave our factory intact those specop teams carry around plastique like you and i carry keys they always have it ill bet ten to one captain that the bastard is still sniffing around the tunnels with his boys very well then said the captain i know where ill take my tank meanwhile said nureyev ill take my tanks out to the minefield road and run over some bettys to get abramov out the sight of all that lovely currency going skyhigh and getting burned up is enough to make you ill yes so be careful in that minefield said the captain ah said nureyev dismissively i can run over those betty antipersonnel jobs no problem they wont even rattle my beasts treads yes the russian tank captain agreed but dont get too close you dont want shrapnel from a bouncing betty to burn those dollar bills you think im stupid countered nureyev ill get just close enough to extend the main gun to him he grabs it and ill swing the gun around behind us but began the captain until he sensed the dancers wide grin and understood a tank with its gun pointing to the rear was giving the sign of surrender so you see said nureyev any asshole american with an antitank weapon wont fire at me be careful the general doesnt lose his grip on the guns barrel would you until you were out of the minefield no comrade replied the captain id hang on like grim death so would i agreed nureyev with a smile his mood clearly elevated by the promise of the largest bonus ever paid by abc now a all right lets go ordered nureyev you get to that exit and put a few rounds down that shaft the captain paused and nureyev could hear him pulling down his ribbed leather helmet one thing i dont get comrade i thought this freeman and his team were supposed to attack the entrance not the exit thats what we thought but from what the boys who are still in hblock tell me freeman sent a bogus message to an american colonel rumor is that there was a signal within the signal that deliberately misled abramov something about a baseball player in america who claimed he had never wagered and was thrown out when it was found he lied so when this freeman said he was going to attack the hblock and the tunnels joint entrance below our decoders or abramov himself didnt recognize this thing about the baseball player it was like a verbal wink you see like saying im saying this but im going to do the opposite cunning shit said the captain ill take great delight in personally running over him watch him he may still have an igla the captain buttoned up his tunic and tapped on his throat mike ivan lets roll we have yankees to kill the captain wasnt worried about iglas they would bring down aircraft no problem but hed seen them fired against a ts glacis plate and its top where armor was thinnest and the he charge just hit the tank and made a hell of a bang but no penetration whatsoever ivan he asked his driver you watch all that tv shit whats that english phrase those yankee game show hosts use ivan was thinking come on down nyet said that captain thats not it you know the one bush junior used against his enemies in his election campaign ivan didnt know ah i have it the captain declared jubilantly bring it on dont freak melissa thomas told herself dont freak out it was difficult not to when she saw the huge black blob moving through the high reeds especially when she realized it was a russian stateoftheart infraredlasertargetingequipped main battle tank and when she didnt know whether general freeman would emerge from the pitchblack square that had been the exit door which she had seen him enter shortly after the last evac chopper had left down there now the general would have only his infraredkeyed night vision goggles by which to see all the lighting from the snippets shed heard as the team had come up from the tunnel taken out in the firefight general she said on open channel a ts coming out of the minefield if he heard her maybe that would bring him up i say again a t is coming out of the minefield heading our way freeman froze in shock by now hed descended the ninetyfootlong stairway into the bowels of the tunnel complex melissa where the hell was she and more to the point why hadnt she evaced he didnt dare answer immediately someone near or amongst the dead bodies of the terrorists must have somehow severed the det cord and might hear him reply his right hand grasping his mm h k handgun he was on his knees using his left hand to feel along the cord of the middle tunnel for a break general are you reading me again he said nothing and squelched the volume button ahead of him through the infrared lenses he was concentrating on the long assembly line of the middle tunnel but it was slow meticulous work for no matter that freeman had his night vision goggles functioning the line of bodies he saw ahead was still a threat during the firefight a terrorist could have faked it hiding in some nook or antechamber in one of the three tunnels which the team felt confident had been swept clean of the violently coughing terrorists who were trying to flee what they had thought was poison gas no one else had come out of the exit since the team had gone in to take out the garbage as aussie had put it and the explosionbuckled entrance doors at the far end of the tunnel were impassable maybe freeman told himself no one had severed the det cord perhaps it could have been cut by something heavy such as a box of manpads falling from one of the stacks along the tunnel walls in the dank darkness all about him fetid with the stench of human waste he could hear a faint dripping then he saw darts of white light crossing his nvgs field of vision rats intuitively he wanted to hurry up go topside and try to position himself well enough so that he could trigger his identification friend or foe beacon realizing there might still be a risk of rogue terrorist elements still prowling around after the marines first evac wave and the general prayed that melissa thomas would be all right until the second evac wave freeman had been touched that shed stayed behind offering him backup but on an op like this searching for just one det cord break one soldier was enough besides though shed come out of her semicomatose state she had the awful pain of a broken rib and he was unsure how steady she was on her feet the tunnels werent the place to find out silently he asked god to protect the young woman who had stayed behind he had prayed a lot over the past twentyfour hours never more for absolution as theyd gunned down the terrorists after only one at the most three had fired at the team and wildly at that suddenly a body moved then another freeman swung his sidearm in their direction and stayed his trigger finger it had been rigor mortis setting in an arm jerk of one of the dead terrorists enough to produce movement but no threat lord he was tired now he could hear moaning but was sure from his long experience of combat that it was no more than the sounds of bowel stomach and throats changing volume after death bad air expelled get a grip on yourself he silently ordered himself general freeman youre tired keep alert but dont overreact he moved forward again slowly his left hand cautiously sliding along the det cord when melissa thomas saw the t slowing about five hundred yards beyond the perimeter of the minefield she had hoped it would stop coming eastward and turn about westward and go away the rain was still heavy and she knew that despite her thermal clothing shed soon be in the early stages of hypothermia unless she started to move her body despite one morphine jab was throbbing with the sharp needlestabbing pain of hundreds of ant bites and her broken rib she saw the tanks cupola open sighting it through her mas scope resting the rifle on the gnarled tree branch at the edge of a clump of reed grass just beyond the wood she could see a mans head or more accurately a mans bearded face enclosed in the peculiarly antiquated thick ribbedleather helmet favored by both modern russian and old soviet bloc tank commanders and crews the bearded face looked about quickly then disappeared now marine thomas was cursing herself in terms that would have shocked a longshoreman why hadnt she got away a quick slap shot because she told herself truthfully you werent ready you silly bitch you were so full of poor me and your antbitten cold ass that you werent on the ball but at least the tank was now moving southward reminding her in the neurotic manner of its sudden and abrupt change of course of some mad bird dog fast right then left fast right again as it passed through the shoulderhigh reeds at times only its turret visible in the central tunnel still moving slowly one of a soldiers most difficult disciplines feeling his way along the det cord to find the break the generals breathing echoed inside his gas mask and he could detect faint whiffs of tear gas probably the filter needed to be changed or more likely his head strap had slipped his neck aching from the unusual strain of having to simultaneously stay alert for danger in the tunnel and outside if the fingers of his hand missed even one millimeterwide break he would have to repeat the whole process unable to contain the itch in his throat from the whiff of tear gas he coughed you okay general melissas voice so startled him he lost his place on the det cord quickly raising his handgun for a doublehanded shot before he realized it was thomass voice in his earpiece yes he said having a great time it was the most sarcastic voice shed heard since her dis immediately followed by a more compassionate question from him how you doing im holding she said tanks sniffing around think its looking for us by us she meant not only her and the general but those other marines still dug in throughout the area of reeds and swampbordered woods but us gave freeman the impression that the tank was specifically looking for him and thomas a main battle tank with a mm main gun and machine guns tended to make things very personal freemans left hand resumed its feel of the detonation cord suddenly his nvgs view was of a white jumble of bodies that looked like a long pile of clothes waiting to be ironed the heat given off by the bodies sufficiently warm to register as thermals on his nvgs general abramov reached up like a man doing his morning calisthenics and took a firm hold wrapping both arms around the muzzle of nureyevs ts main gun once before abramov had told nureyev this shit freeman had caused trouble as leader of the usled peace intervention in sirbir well now he was going to pay for it all legends die whether those who embrace the legend wish to concede the point or not after having carefully followed the gps route and running over five antipersonnel mines so they could get safely to him the tank now backed out of the minefield nureyev having reversed the gun when marine thomas saw this second tank with abramov hanging from its main gun moving slowly away east of the mad bird dog tank that was busily sniffing in the reeds beyond the minefield she estimated the distance between it and her to be about a mile though in the downpour that obscured lenses and made a constant hiss in the reeds it was difficult to gauge even using the scopes range finder but she knew she had to move the cold in her bones now making her feel she imagined like her greatgrandfather who suffered from the curse of fibromyalgia from the despair of which nothing short of narcotic painkillers and the good book could help him every bone in her body was heavy with the ague every muscle taut with strain only one more disposable jab of morphine left she forced herself to think of the second evac wave which would surely be back within the hour please god as dusk settled on this strangely beautiful but for melissa godforsaken reedworld west of the huge lake she remembered the specwar guy aussie lewis telling her it was nearly four times bigger than oahu and she remembered stepping off the plane there and how warm it was before the marines began their long haul to japan she was starting to drift for a blessed moment her painracked brain was able to conjure up the fragrant kiss of the trade winds the sound of crashing lacy surf and the sun of those blessed healing isles her brief reverie was broken by the bass bellow of the first t bursting out of the reeds no less than a quarter of a mile away heading straight for her or she guessed the tunnel exit and now she understood why the mad bird dog tank wasnt so mad and indecisive as it had seemed while the other t melissa had seen had stopped in the minefield only its cupola visible its more agile comrade had no doubt been sent to scour east and west of the minefield exit to make sure there were no more tankdestroying predator javelin or tow units whose marines might be tempted to fire and to hell with the presidents timeline for evac that had passed already no doubt about it now this mad bird dog tank was racing doing at least forty miles per hour running parallel to the minefield charging through the reeds like a bull elephant in a surge of uncontrollable sexual must leaving a thick shower of tangled vegetation reeds birds nests dead birds euriale leaves and splintered ice in its wake simultaneously firing its coaxial and mm machine guns like some thundering giant savagely obliterating any impediments before it its exhaust pipes all the while vomiting filthy brown clouds over the hitherto pristine clean greens of reeds and lotus when this monster came to a halt it did so so abruptly that a wave of broken ice reeds and feathers surged forward from its wake along the midline of the tank just as the turret slewed to bring the main gun in line with the tunnels exit which for melissa was two hundred yards away at two oclock but only fifty yards dead ahead for the tank melissa heard the telltale rotor slap of cobra gunships then a few seconds later the much bigger airpummeling noise of super stallions and other helos she couldnt identify her heart pounding she was elated confused yorktowns angels couldnt possibly have returned so soon or could they it must she reasoned be the pain of the multiple insect bites that was momentarily stupefying her brain until her mind in excited overdrive she realized the obvious truth that yorktown had managed to scramble an ad hoc second wave of helos from all around the fleet any helo that could carry drop tanks of extra fuel to cover the distance to lake khanka had no doubt been pressed into service once satpix or humint indicated to mccains blue tile boys that there was still terrorist tank movement after the ceasefire deadline and such terrorist movement posed an undeniably clear and present danger to whatever elements of yorktowns meu remained to be evacuated melissa saw the t belch recoil like a drunken garbage truck the boom of its big mm gun frightening her more than anything since the water facility at parris island the crash of the high explosive round echoing back from the base of the exit stairway ninety feet below the surface was gutpunching and deafening the blast wave hurled cement forward into the tunnels as well as spewing dirty clouds up the exit hitting the t the din momentarily drowning what had been the soft drumming of the rain while melissa thomas had started with fright freeman was knocked flat as if some huge invisible fist had slammed him down winding him so severely that in order to breathe he rolled onto his back tore off his gas mask and gulped for air in the dustthick darkness his right pistol hand flung out in a desperate effort to take in as much air as possible as well as muchneeded oxygen he also inhaled more residual tear gas still on his back he put the mask back on and saw a white rain coming down onto his nvgs sodden peat as well as redhot pieces of floor grating falling indiscriminately about him a brick striking his helmet another hitting the chest area of his kevlar vest and yet another fragment striking his face or rather the eyepiece of his gas mask with such force that it spiderwebbed the hardened glass of the right lens ramming the whole mask so hard against his face that the general felt as if hed been in a barroom brawl he could taste blood and it was a moment or two before he recovered his senses realizing that what had saved him from a worse fate was that as hed rolled over the det cord most of his head had been covered not only by the gas mask and helmet but by the overhang afforded by the edge of the long metallic manpad assembly table now he could smell smoke ninety feet above what had been the tunnels guard antechamber at the base of the exit steps the cupola of the t opened terrifyingly close to melissa who no more than thirty feet away was hunkered down near the fallen twisted branch and sea of reeds and realized that what she was looking at was not a regular t but an upgraded version reminiscent of the brilliant israeli merkava main battle tank with its troop squad section added to the rear of the tank that contained a commander gunner loader and driver she saw the tank commander appear babbling excitedly his torso above the cupola and she could hear raucous laughter from the tank crew before she realized it her weapon stock was hard into her shoulder her left eye closed the right cupped by the mas scope only part of the commanders head filling her waterstreaked telescopic sight she held a half breath to steady and didnt fire the commander was getting out of the tank followed by another crew member then another which told her that something must be wrong with the automatic loader it was being replaced by a third crew member but why were the terrorists exiting the tank the cupola banged shut the tank buttoned up the commander huddled momentarily in the downpour then drew his pistol turning to one of the other two terrorists one of whom handed him a flashlight why on earth wondered melissa would they bother venturing down the tunnel after the one he round did they know freeman was down there oh shit shed been talking to him on their throatmike radios a scanner could have located them pretty accurately if not with pinpoint precision now she could hear louder distant sounds of cobras and other helos of the second evac wave even given the normal confusion that characterizes the most elementary shipshoreship exercise surely someone must remember to revisit the exit area on the other hand it was quite possible that as yet no one of authority in the fleet had heard about freemans absence but they knew that there were dozens of marines still spread throughout the marshes waiting and did the terrorists want to kill freeman so badly that theyd violate the twentyfourhour deadline she immediately berated herself for such an asinine question excusing it as the product of her exhaustion here was a man already a legend amongst men at arms who had humiliated his opposition from one side of the globe to the other even his critics had conceded that he had been the soldier who more than any other had faced down the homegrown terrorist camps of white supremacists riding what he referred to and was nearly fired for saying it as the understandable antiimmigrant mood of the us southwestern border states melissa fighting the cold in her sodden uniform began shivering violently her body assaulted by paroxysms of uncontrollable muscle spasms all she had to cling to was the image of her di at the water facility his peaked hat trouser crease sharp as a knife arms akimbo standing like the one and only god declaring simply but with the steel voice of utter conviction cadet thomas you will prevail water is your friend not your enemy the chemical soup of your mothers womb was the same as the sea you are in your element marine swim swim swim for the corps shed hated him for it the badgering but now it was his image his immaculate sense of order and calm in the face and fear of chaos that made her fight the three russians walked toward the exit then hesitated dust and debris still issuing forth too thick to breathe through the commander returned to the tank banged on the cupola and shouted the cupola opened and a crewman in a leatherribbed helmet emerged and began passing down three biochem masks melissa took a half breath and squeezed the trigger there was a bullwhiplike crack and the crewmans head jerked sideways his body slumping half in and half out of the cupola thomas worked the bolt action on her sniper rifle upbackforwarddown so fast she had the tank commander in sight before he could step back off the tanks front glacis plate his hands dropping two of the biochem masks as he hit the ground where he died instantly from melissas chest shot unable to get back into the tank because of the terrorist slumped in the cupola the other two men started to run for the tunnel exit she felled one of them the other running blindly into the exits thick haze she ignored him her open sight back on the cupola her brain simply bullied her pain and cold aside adrenaline alone stoking her determination as she smartly assessed the situation the tank wouldnt move yet an open cupola with cobra gunships around was guaranteed death all she needed was a hand in her scope a second would be plenty someone was going to have to pull or push the dead man out of the cupola so they could close the thing before a grenade came their way they had no idea whether melissas fire had come from one marine or more she could hear panic in the tank then the turret suddenly slewed the coaxial machine gun opening up the turret moving through degrees but marine thomas kept her cool it was something the marine corps held in contempt wild unfocused fire at parris they called it hollywood firewasting ammunition a marines shot on the other hand was always aimed to kill the fire from the was too high the bullets zipped overhead she saw the mans body that was slumped half in half out of the cupola suddenly noisily fall down back into the tank then a hand shot up to grab hold of the cupola lids inside hand grip and she fired heard a scream and fell to the ground as the mm rounds began chopping into the wood close right and damn she hadnt warned freeman she flicked on her mike general its marine thomas theres a terrorist in the tunnel and there was came the generals nasal reply she heard the general laugh damned fool switched on a flashlight those stupid leather helmets they wear idd him straightaway freeman couldnt hear any more machine gun fire in the background the only sound now was the muffled rotor slap of the helos secondwave evacuation it was the sound of promise of getting out of freedom in its most literal easytounderstand manifestation the freedom of a human being able to go from one place to another at will not subject to some order from a totalitarian regime where terrorists such as the taliban ruled forcing himself back to the task at hand the general felt for the det cord again resumed his crawl and after a few more yards realized why half of what had earlier been a more or less continuous line of terrorist bodies was now partially obscured a crate of heavy manpad parts had fallen in the melée from the top of a stack of crates that had been piled high in the middle tunnel the impact of the crates sharp edge against the metal grid severing the det cord he pushed the box of manpad parts off the det cord then using his knife he quickly cut the cord and overlapped the two ends by about a foot and attached det cord clips he then took out his timedelay pencil initiator and crushed the vial releasing the acid that in five minutes would eat away a thin restraining wire that would in turn release the springheld firing pin the pin then striking a percussion cap which would initiate the final sequence in the explosive train the general now quickly moved back toward the exit his nvgs picked up a speckled bloom of light caused by stillfalling dust particles whose radiant heat from the tank round was still enough to faintly illuminate the exit stairs suddenly he felt then heard the earth trembling above him it was the fortyseventon t crewless except for the driver who was screaming in agony from a bulletsmashed right hand with three minutes to go in the tunnel freeman easily cleared the body of a terrorist whose flashlight was still on the general then crashing into a folding card table that against all odds was still standing albeit with one severed leg but the general was up and running with two minutes to go as he reached the last five stairs to the top of the exit he was aware of a flash of light blooming out his nvgs with overload though virtually blind for the next few seconds he felt the wet draft of air on his hands and on the skin between his battle jacket and the bottom of the gas mask he remembered to turn hard left away from the mined area running into an uneven patch of tankmashed reeds falling getting up his feet unable to gain purchase the ground shifting then he heard the whoomp the roiling of the explosion knocking him off his feet as if a ballistic missile had been launched from its silo a huge v of dirt and debris shot out and up from the exit toward the higher ground falling near the edge of the wood where hed last seen melissa thomas but now all was a cloud of dark gray dust over sodden earth the clouds of burned chemicals and noxious fumes from the incinerated terrorists dungeon now spreading out unable to see more than a foot in front of him all douglas freeman could identify with certainty was the eardunning sound of the cobra gunships chain guns the cobras tracers if his sense of direction was intact streaming toward the hblock it was a maelstrom of fire being delivered as punishment for the terrorists having violated the twentyfourhour agreement a venting of the americans outrage against what the gunships pilots had clearly seen themselves and heard from rescued marine stragglers who had alerted the marine forces to the presence and activity of the t tanks freeman flicked on his mike to contact the pilots but he could tell immediately that that bastard murphy had struck again all he could hear was static and he was worried about melissa thomas at least the rain was easing and a fragrant wind was rushing in from the wanda shan to replace the harsh hot air of the detonation an explosion which freeman knew had completely destroyed the three tunnels assembly lines and the terrorists entire stock of shoulderfired manpads hypersonic small rounds and torpedo prototypes boosting the generals weary yet decidedly effusive mood was the rapid withdrawal of the t that had fired pointblank into the exit and was now paying for it by being attacked by the cobras who had initially come into khanka as nothing more than escorts for the evac stallions the generals celebratory high was quickly punctured however by his growing concern for melissa thomas with the radio out no flare gun and the air around him thick with debris how could he communicate his and her situation to the missions air arm wait a minute he scolded himself run you bastard run out of this crap cloud no one can see you here run and he did until he saw the two dead tank crewmen whom he immediately checked for flares nothing he ran on until his knees seemed to be on fire and he burst out into relatively clear air and the reeds the choppers were gone their gas tanks loiter times exhausted the general morphed into an angry savage cursing with such force and volume that he dared any damned russian terrorists who hadnt had enough to show themselves and hed personally shoot them and when he ran out of ammunition hed go strangle the bastards with his bare hands battle fatigue he told himself he saw a white blur coming at him and fired two quick shots it was a small mansized parachute one of half a dozen dropped either by either the unseen cobra gunships or the super stallions theyre message chutes ive opened one he swung around startled by her voice relieved fatigued and enormously embarrassed for having been caught firing at a parachute and a small one at that freeman hurried over to the voice and found melissa thomas shivering violently whereas he was perspiring profusely underneath the layers of kevlar and battle tunic with heat to spare he embraced her in a bear hug the message in the milkpailsized canister attached to the chute was enclosed infrared x for satellite overflight stop mother will then execute star stop good luck ive she was shivering so badly she could hardly speak spread the x over there her hand shaking melissa was pointing to a flattened area of reeds freeman could see her face was tinged with the telltale bluish hue of impending hypothermia she pointed to the word star i havent a clue what dont talk youll waste energy he advised her while simultaneously trying not to show his alarm at the gross violation of operational procedure exhibited by whomever it was who had sent a message especially one with such specific instructions what if the enemy had picked it up the fact that hq had taken such a risk however told freeman just how desperate operational hq must be the message indeed the drop itself stark evidence that time was quickly running out for him and melissa thomas weve got to get you warm he told her dont worry about star its an acronym for a recovery system ill tell you more about it if and when they see that x they may wait till dark in case any of these terrorist bastards are wandering around he paused for breath though i expect by now they know their money machines kaput so whats the point he looked around at the wood and marsh everything was soaking wet weve got to get you under cover well go into the tunnel exit we can get dry clothes down there wrap ourselves in those and snuggle if youve no objection warm you up well hear mother when she comes he meant if a rescue plane comes but thomas didnt need discouragement on top of her plummeting body temperature once in the driest least bloodstained clothes he could bring her dressing himself only after hed helped her they set up an improvised machine gun nest just in from the tunnels exit he dragging in the dead t captain and crewman to use as an ad hoc barricade on which to rest his ak and her sniper rifle he down to his last clip of thirty rounds he embraced her with his left arm leaving his right holding the kalashnikov ready to fire no time to be shy marine he told her im old enough to be your grandfather he joked come in close ive got enough hot air to thaw a frozen turkey she tried to smile but her mouth wouldnt respond her teeth literally chattering but she did feel a suggestion of warmth as freeman held the young woman like other soldiers who had saved their comrades in the same manner from perishing of cold he became aware of a smell other than their body odor and the reek of charred equipment and burnt flesh in the tunnels it was the faint but very definite smell of a woman and he thought of his first wife catherine and margaret it was so distant as if their lovemaking had been a dream long ago dont you ever tell anyone he told melissa that i shot at a damned parachute she said nothing barely hearing him over the soft moan of the china wind whistling about the tunnel exit the warmth of his closeness seeping into her no one at parris would believe it and she sure as hell wasnt going to tell anyone for the sake of both their reputations she felt the general start something had spooked him what is it she whispered a vehicle he answered maybe a truck not the plane no ifwhenthat comes well know it theyll use a fourengined herk for our pickup although warming melissa still felt desperately cold it was as if the cogs in a wheel in her brain had slowed with the precipitous drop in her temperature for a moment she was confused by him mentioning our pickup she thought hed mentioned a plane not a pickup truck it was a pickup truck the general had heard and it was being driven by a sallowskinned man in the navy blue padded uniform of chinese and russian workers and peasants along the border between the two countries the map line separating the two running across the top quarter of the lake about forty miles north of the tunnel exit next to the man in the small jinlin pickup whose motor sounded like nothing much more than a twostroke lawn mower sat a blueeyed boy of about twelve his skin so fair that he was often thought by the others in wadi elhages cell to be a european on missions he and elhage never spoke arabic only english the worlds language of business elhage pronouncing it in a halting schoolboylike fashion the blueeyed boy with the fluency and colloquialisms of an educated american schoolboy a youngster who at hamass expense had spent five of his years in a tightly controlled madrassa in the us there the boy had grown up in a north american cultural sea his task as he was reminded daily to immerse himself to learn as much as he could about the infidel nation you must be happy said elhage to be so soon in paradise yes said the boy i am ready think of azzah elhage told him recalling the woman hed used to help indoctrinate the blueeyed boy she taught you the pleasure a woman can give a young man in paradise there will be seventytwo virgins like her yes all waiting to pleasure you most men much older than to you older than you said the boy dispassionately not older to you elhage always made such elementary grammatical mistakes what oh yes i am sorry jamal older than you well you see not even those older than you obtain such pleasuring elhage saw yet another parachute canister this one poking out from a clump of bushes that were barely visible amid the encroaching reeds he and the boy had seen several of the milkpailsized canisters which attached to small parachutes had floated down from the infidels giant helicopters before they all left the pilots and crew unable to see any more survivors in the thick smoke that had spewed out from the tunnel explosion and soon filled the evening sky elhage had already stopped several times on the narrow raised roadway through the lowlying marshes and had waded in kneehigh water to retrieve one of the canisters and thrown it into the back of the jinlin though even the boy could not tell elhage what to make of star in the canisters written directions but whatever it was the phrase pickup he told elhage meant just that and indicated that this infidel general and some soldier called thomas were still missing if they saw an infidel cross spread out no doubt a signal for the infidels rescue it would also locate freeman for elhage and the boy there it is said the boy sitting abruptly forward pointing to a spot almost a quarter of a mile to his left the light was fading and while neither he nor elhage could see a parachute the white cross could be seen atop a reed island yes yes now remember elhage though he had switched to english was speaking more quickly than he normally did when giving his hamas cell its instructions you are looking for help for your poor father a pond fisherman who is ill and i know said the boy sharply also in english i know our engine has broken down could he please help us yes and i will stand by the engines hood and look into the engine and i will appear elhage now allowed himself a small laugh i will i will appear how the word you taught me mystified the boy told him yes very mystified the boy laughed and elhage saw the imperturbable courage the cool determination in the boys eyes this time the boy unlike other martyrs of islam would not be wearing a bomb belt the americans the british and other degenerates had grown wise to the dynamitebelted bombers since the infidels occupation of iraq do not speak english very well advised elhage for the umpteenth time otherwise they will too well the boy corrected him i know i must sound like a peasant i am begging the american for help he adopted a forlorn look his pleading snuffling manner in keeping with the rumpled russian garb selected and dirtied for the mission by elhage himself please you help my father his car no go it no good you help please good said elhage but remember if they ask how it is you know a little english at school yes said the boy in the exasperated tone of a much older more mature boy who had learned not only of the pleasures of the beautiful azzah but english as well whos that melissa asked freeman the voice coming down the exit shaft from above was that of a child it wasnt loud but its hello was persistent and melissa whispered to the general that it sounded as if whoever it was must be very near the spot where they put the cross melissa felt resentful then ashamed the marine in her wanted to help anyone in trouble especially a child but the woman in her wanted more warmth and the safe protected feeling she had while being held by the general telling her she was alive coming back from the brink of hypothermia to the present the insect bites that had saved her now starting to itch so badly that all she wanted to do was rip off the clothes and scratch till there was no tomorrow quiet dammit said freeman his ill temper surprising him almost as much as it did melissa but he had a soldiers sixth sense of danger for an instant much of his earlier life the times of maximum danger flashed through his mind with a vividness hed not experienced before but which other soldiers had spoken to him about moments before their death for all his selfconfidence douglas freeman was not a man who had lived with the belief that things always work out for the best for him that was demonstrably false in the utterance of one word holocaust and he knew someday would be his day to die the best anyone could do was try to avoid it but if you couldnt then for him there was only one way to deal with it bravely extracting himself from the layers of nowwarm clothing and picking up his weapon trigger finger on the guard he walked up through the malodorous tunnel up into the pale square of evening he heard two things a boys voice calling help please and melissa thomas coming out behind him when freeman saw the jinlin with its hood up apparently conked out about a hundred yards away he was surprised to see a peasant in the ubiquitous quilted blue jacket pants and thick fur cap either chinese or russian it was difficult to tell staring into the motor as if he didnt know what to make of it all only now did freeman notice the boy probably russian freeman thought off to his left the boy who must have walked around the large marshy depression nearby was now waving at the general and asking please you help my father he sick and truck no go it no good you help please my english not good but you you understand i understand said freeman trying to quickly assay the situation but you just stay where you are for a jiff jiff asked the blueeyed boy what does this jiff mean it means stay still from almost a mile away abramov was watching his nerves rattled by his neardeath experiences in the shotup transport helo and the minefield he could barely move so tightly stuffed was his battle uniform and backpack with three different currencies and a back brace belt hed personally ordered to be altered so that it would carry a bag of ten bigcandybarsized ingots of gold a walking bank the crew of nureyevs tank had called him as theyd fished him out of the minefield whats the american doing abramov demanded angrily standing atop the tank next to its cupola with two other bonushungry terrorists abramov was using the cupola to brace himself his legs and arms still spasming in reaction to his having had to stand perfectly still and then bear his own weight and that of the gold while dangling from the huge mm gun general abramov called out the tanks radio operator our crew in tank has been badly mauled only one survivor hes withdrawing to hblock what for abramov snarled theres nothing left for him there doesnt he know what the cobras did theyve destroyed hblock its burning computers and everything gone sir nureyev cut in the american must be telling the boy to take off his jacket why is he making the boy shut up ordered abramov the weight of his binoculars straining his wrists the boys in my employ his guardians a big customer of ours paid half your wages this freeman bastard must be suspicious looks like he is telling the kid to turn around said nureyev despite his nervous state or perhaps because of it abramov gave a short guttural laugh he suspects the blueeyed boy thinks he might be wired with explosives is he nureyev dared to ask he as well as his crew were exhausted by the everpresent threat of being taken out like the others at the beginning of the us raid he hasnt got a bomb belt on said nureyev watching through his binoculars and still waiting for abramovs confirmation of whether or not the boy was wired maybe a grenade proffered nureyev no abramov said having to lower his binoculars hands atremble but hes freemans death warrant freeman glimpsed movement side right it was melissa thomas coming closer still in russian garb but wearing her american helmet hunched over from the weight of the clothing she looked like a crone the boy started with fright when he saw her the suddenness of her appearance rather than her russian uniform and american helmet surprising him now take off your pants freeman told the boy slowly but mister i wish to tell i am not russian soldier i am no soldier i am only twelve years be quiet snapped freeman take them off the boy first took off his boots then the trousers revealing khaki cotton long johns i am cold he complained so am i the legendary general told him everybodys cold now take off your long johns general said thomas i hear aircraft she was right there were three of them two were less loud than the other which seemed slower and was out of sight above the gray threethousandfoothigh stratus night was almost upon them and the man melissa saw purportedly this boys father was still visible by the jinlin but becoming more difficult to see in the fastdescending dusk joint strike fighters freeman answered without turning toward her watching the boy taking off his underwear and shivering melissa didnt avert her eyes shed been trained not to not after the number of marines lost in iraq to innocentlooking children who had wandered up to us soldiers with a smile and a hi mac then blown themselves and the marines to pieces the blueeyed boy had no grenades tucked into the crotch of his long johns he was shivering violently the rule was not to let them speak to chat you up as the brits called it chat you up all friendly and innocent and then the grenade all right freeman said put your long johns on and pull your jacket and trousers inside out pockets as well and pat them down so i can see to help the boy understand freeman still holding his ak in his right hand patted his left leg with his left hand miming what he wanted the boy to do the kid seemed smart enough older than his young blueeyed innocence would suggest melissa thomas saw the first two planes black specks beneath the gray stratus the thunder and speed of their passing so fast she had only a few seconds to see they were in fact two american joint strike fighters the third plane the one the jsfs were obviously protecting sounded higher and was still hidden by the clouds of stratus its drone much heavier and slower than the lowlevel scream of the two jsfs freeman hadnt seen the planes total focus as he used to tell aussie and co being the necessity of the moment freeman still felt there was something weird yes theyd seen the road track when they landed and he himself had told the meu force on yorktown they might see the occasional rice farmer who spent the winters huddled in the hamlets around the lake using bundled dried reeds collected during the summer for fuel but he was cautious nevertheless all right said freeman pointing down at the boys pile of insideout clothes put your hands up like this spread fingers and walk back from the clothes sir said melissa thomas hes going to die of chill hell die of dynamite if hes got a stick or two sown into that quilting though the general could see that none of the quilted segments was big enough to conceal a stick of dynamite but you could kill a man with much less melissa thomas had heard just how meticulous the elite forces such as the sas seals spetsnaz and freemans specfor were and shed heard the story about aussie and the woman with the baby freeman was quickly but gingerly feeling the quilted clothing fur cap and then the boys boots upending and smacking them det cord could by itself cripple and maim sir said thomas theres a container coming down it wasnt one of the small ones holding white infrared x cloths but was much larger about twice the size of a fortyfivegallon drum under a fullsize chute freeman figured correctly that this was all being coordinated by mccains signals exploitation space via satellite theyd homed in on the points of the x that melissa thomas had spread out and had now given the big plane which sounded like a herk the xs exact gps address freemans concentration on the boy and the indistinct man down by the jinlin truck didnt falter for a second the general didnt even look in the direction of the descending chute but as he began patting down the boys quilted trousers he could see the peasant by the truck was standing motionless why wouldnt the father be over here by now to see whats going on the general asked himself his son had been made to strip and still he hadnt moved but the general could not feel any explosive or triggering device or any unusual heaviness as he lifted the jacket and pants up to gauge their weight they felt just about right okay he told the boy pointing down at the clothes put those back on okay said the boy yes its okay you help my father now yes freeman turned to melissa thomas who was watching the big canister float down keeping the scope eye of her ma on abramovs unmoving tank the tanks crew was no doubt wondering what to do now that there were two stateoftheart manpadinvulnerable joint strike fighters in the area with tankbusting rockets and cannon lets go help your dad said freeman marine thomas sir inside the canister youll find two dry insulated boilersuits a fivehundredfoot cord of reinforced nylex rope and a seamans kit bag its the rolledup balloondirigible bladder and a tank of helium with an easytorelease suddenly his voice was lost in a thunderous roar as the two jsfs screamed out of the stratus in a tight turn and swept over them rocking wings to say hello and assuring them that if yonder t tank was to cause any trouble there would be no more t the boy was zipping up his jacket as freeman continued therell be two body harnesses put one on should i start filling the balloon just enough to get it off the ground said freeman no more till i get back fully inflated the dirigibles like a housesized goodyear blimp he smiled but no gondola he turned to the boy okay lets go help your father thank you im sorry about making you cold freeman apologized you understand sometimes bad people use children do you understand me oh yes said the blueeyed boy thats why i want to tell you that this man were walking toward is the regional hamas leader wadi elhage and they told me all this bullshit about how americans were evil and sent me to school over there to learn english he paused and where i found that american kids were great freeman was stunned by the boys mature selfconfidence and sudden switch from the halting vocabulary one would expect of a peasant to the kind of aplus high school student he himself had been the general almost stopped walking he was so surprised but the boy continued walking and talking but these hamas assholes have kept me like a prisoner and told me that if i ever left them theyd hunt me down and kill me no matter where i went my pants and jacket are padded with explosive with what hamas call spun semtex you know what that is semtex yes but not spun the detonator is a fine wire and a tiny watch battery in the jacket in a seam tucked into the collar label the theory is that i tear it and you and i go to paradise i dont believe any of it the boy paused now and looked knowingly at freeman in the middle east girls can marry at twelve i know about women theres paradise here if youre alive hamas is nuts if i went with you general theyd chase me down but if you take elhage and me prisoner peoplell think were both locked up you can take me back to america where ill be safe im young and you have the worlds best plastic surgeons in your witness protection programs the boys unemotional businesslike tone was alarming chilling the child had a cold calculating heart beyond his years the inheritance of the terrorist heartlessness is he armed freeman asked ready to bring up his ak from its casual barreldown position by his right side a pistol in his waistband the boy told him hes lefthanded elhage was still standing by the truck as if frozen in time wait a minute thought freeman slowing what if the kid was lying a sucker ploy to get him away from the sniper thomas her shooters eye resting in the scopes reticule a nomiss shot with elhage in her scope elhage suddenly ran to the other side of the truck and snatched up an ak freeman immediately dropped to the ground firing as he did so underneath the jinlin he heard a cry of pain the arabs legs out from under him and the man fell his ak clattering on the jinlinflattened reeds the general unleashed another long burst and the hamas leader was grossly spastic in his death throes he tried to say something to the boy but only bright arterial blood issued from his mouth and he was dead freeman heard the rifles crack and wheeled thomas still too weak to shout loudly had fired a warning shot into the air from her sniper rifle and was now pointing at the t a half a mile away in the minefield its gun lowering to slightly below the azimuth which meant it was about to engage a shortrange target run freeman told the boy who needed no encouragement having sized up the situation as quickly as the general they heard the boom of the mm cannon and felt a great rush of air down freeman yelled as the jinlin somersaulted ten feet into the air and became a ball of tangled metal and flame crashing to the ground melissa now had the scope on abramov his head and that of the other two crewmen by the cupola in her crosshairs the tank was coming straight for her below the russians were winks of orange light the ts machine guns sweeping the raindrenched reeds that freeman and the boy were racing for so enraged was abramov kneeling on the tank with one hand on the cupola that despite the ts superb suspension his head kept bobbing around in melissas ir scope the furious terrorists instructions to his driver didnt allow for any zigzag pattern during the ts charge he wanted to run freeman down melissa lowered the ma for a seventyyard chest shot and fired abramov flew off the tank into its wake the impact of thomass sniper round against abramovs kevlar vest such that while it didnt penetrate all the way through it knocked him assovertit verkh dnom as the russians say his moneyfilled backpack leaking a trail of assorted currencies as his body wrapped in gold rolled in the tanks wake though badly wounded and bleeding abramov rose in feral rage screaming at the nowstopped tank from which nureyev his driver and two other terrorists escaped risking all to get his money for themselves the general was waving his mm makarov menacingly at them as freeman emerging from the reeds fired a long burst abramovs body was sent reeling back his face a bloody pulp the four terrorists wouldbe millionaires held up their hands one with a green signal flag frantically called dont shoot no shooting youll take the money and leave shouted freeman his ak aimed at the four russians sure said one of them no problem without taking his eyes off the four russian terrorists freeman told the boy to climb quickly up on the t and drop his jacket in the russians mesmerized by the brightly colored euros and thousanddollar us bills still falling out of abramovs torn knapsack and being sucked away by the faint but frigid breeze we get the money now asked the man who had been waving the maneuver flag sure said freeman its yours the boy had taken off his jacket and without a glance at freeman tore the collar label dropped the jacket into the hole with his right hand and slammed the cupola lid down with his left there was a noticeably soft whoomp in the tank as the boy jumped off slipped on the wet reeds and banged his head hard against the tanks track the russian terrorists turned as one and freeman cut them down with one long burst his aks barrel steaming in the cold grab that backpack he told the boy pointing to abramov the boy obeyed quickly picking up the belt of gold bullion as well here said freeman stuffing the backpack and gold into a plastic garbage bag hed taken from his darpa goodies waist pouch weve got to get a move on got a plane to catch they were running toward the x you okay son freeman saw fresh blood in the boys hair the boy didnt answer but kept running with freeman and never looked back at the burning tank and river of spilled fuel that by now was incinerating the dead radio operator whod remained inside boy seemed to freeman a misnomer for someone so mature but then hamas had had him they were a tough outfit and douglas freeman knew it would take some deprogramming at home a place which at the moment freeman knew in his gut they had only a fiftyfifty chance of reaching to straighten the kid out the star or surfacetoair recovery technique was known throughout special forces and special ops command as a last resort indeed it was the riskiest extraction method ever devised by man you afraid of heights freeman asked the boy as they sprinted to where marine thomas now barely visible in the dusk had begun preparations as per the instructions in the container as the herk and its two joint strike fighters loitered overhead fill it freeman shouted at her time to go give the valve its head what a moment before had been the size of a giant jellyfish now quickly expanded into a carsized and then a small but definite goodyear blimpshaped dirigible as the helium silently inflated it and it rose high into the icy air unraveling the first one hundred feet of the fivehundredfootlong specially treated nylon rope that lay coiled at freemans and melissa thomass feet as they hurriedly donned the multilayered thermal boilersuits complete with hoods skydiver helmets and rescue harnesses for each of them youre going to have to hold on to me tightly son said freeman whats your name blue eyes jamal all right jamal now the big hercules that plane up there is going to come down pretty low to get us three out of here first well go up like a general marine thomas interjected the dirigibles at full height were the only ones holding it down the herkll pick it up or she had no time to finish the hercules its four turboprop engines roaring was coming at them at about five hundred feet a big metal horizontal v sticking out from the nose like a forked tongue which in theory should snag the nylon rope suspended from above by the blimp if the v snagged the rope an automatic clamp would lock the base of the vs jaw onto the line the dirigible still attached to the flex rope now high above the plane and trailing well behind it the strain would soon be taken up by the rope if it worked ever been on a swing jamal freeman shouted against the roar of the herk as he and melissa thomas strapped their harnesses together yes ive been on lots of swings freeman took the boy in a bear hug not like this one kid you hang on to me no matter what okay o and they were off the planes vshaped proboscis having snagged the line whisking them straight up for feet before the big pendulum swing began their initial acceleration from the sitting position to more than a hundred feet surprisingly smooth if very fast like being whipped up through the air at the end of a fivehundredfootlong elastic band the sensation of speed was so frightening and exhilarating that freeman felt it in his loins as the three of them in an experience for which not even top gun graduates volunteered went hurtling through frigid air the lake already far below and behind them a silver sheen in the moonlight slipping away westward the black herk entering cloud the easy part was over above the herk now traveling at miles per hour the dirigibles breakaway cords snapped from the sheer stress of the air buffeting its huge volume inside the plane at the herks rear ramp door one of two volunteer crewmen set about lowering a hook line to catch the lift line which now arced back from the nose of the herk now traveling at miles per hour meantime a second volunteer crewman began working the telescopic arm which would it was hoped reach out and grab the lift line so it could be brought closer to the underside of the plane and freeman jamal and melissa winched safely into the planes belly the booms hook missed on the first pass but snagged the line on the backswing the winch began its high whine then suddenly freeman jamal and melissa thomas felt an armripping jolt so severe that melissa thought their harnesses had split apart her shout of alarm ripped away by the herculess roaring slipstream while the jolt which freeman thought hed readied for failed to loosen his grip on the boy the general heard something snap probably he thought one of the many wire cables that ran through the aircraft looming two hundred feet above them the noise of its big engines reverberating in every bone three minutes and fifty seconds after the enormous jolt they were being winched into the plane the night ahead filled with stars the plane having climbed and increased speed to miles per hour was now an hour and half out of sapporo japan chipper armstrong and rhino manowski put their escorting joint strike fighters through a synchronized barrel roll for victory as they crossed over cape titova and to the southeast saw the metallic glints in the moonlight that were the ships of mccains battle group another two jsfs already aloft to take over escort duty for the herk but apart from the jsfs barrel rolls no signal came up to greet the herk or its passengers who like those in the carrier battle group were on strict radio silence with no running lights showing the united states was still in a state of war against terror one of the two volunteer marine crewmen coiling the lift rope greeted the general with a hearty welcome aboard general it was a few seconds before a grateful and exhausted freeman recognized peter norton his courage reincarnated his newfound selfrespect purchased during the final hours of the evac when hed repeatedly risked his own life under fire to help injured marines aboard is began melissa then stopped i cant remember his name the noise in the cavernous herk was giving her a severe headache and in her utter exhaustion she told the general what marines told one another on a long fatigueplagued mission im dumbed out can hardly remember my name freeman wasnt listening he was bending low over jamal he was unable to hear the boys breathing which the general knew shouldnt be surprising given the thundering noise of the big transport he stared hard at jamal to see whether his chest was moving but it was difficult to tell sometimes particularly with children jamal said freeman there was no response jamal he said louder giving the boy a shake nothing chapter twenty in sapporo the media frenzy engulfed freeman and marine thomas reporters clamoring to be heard now that washington dc had declared lake khankas abc terrorist munitions factory destroyed after reports from the marine corps colonel jack tibbet and from satellite reconnaissance which had picked up the dense pollution debris over siberias southeastern primorski region general general freeman came the shouts from the frenetic horde as flashes of varying intensity went off all around like so many flares and tracer coming at him adding to the charged atmosphere was the increasing cacophony of yelled questions lens shutters clicking clacking and whirring all pressing in like some unstoppable ambush every major newspaper tv and radio conglomerate on the globe was seeking the money shot and the pattonlike quote from the legendary general who had led the american task force into what one bbc correspondent accurately called the worlds most dangerous terrorist enclave outside of iran it was all too unnerving for marine melissa thomas who on freemans request was whisked away by a marine corps chaplain and airport security guard to the us consulates policeringed limousine freeman a man not known for any unwillingness to help the media celebrate his true grit and daring was however unduly subdued as had been melissa thomas her mood exacerbated by the bruises scratches and insect bites that covered her face and hands injuries which she had no inclination to either explain or complain about the general though smartly turned out in a fresh uniform that had been rushed to sapporo looked tired and drawn taking questions on the dais especially so to marte price who having had to elbow and fight her way through the japanese press scrum was close enough to see the creases of worry lines on freemans face finally he held up his hands to quell the din of the media frenzy and when several taiwanese reporters ignored his request he refused pointblank to begin speaking until the room fell silent though shutters continued to click and whirr and the bright tv lights remained forcing him to blink more than was either normal or comfortable ladies and gentlemen ill be brief colonel tibbet and his marines have done an outstanding job of ridding the world of the terrorist filth who make weapons for other terrorist filth to paraphrase a man who fought nazi filth this is not the end but it is the beginning of the end for terrorists all over the world as we and our allies keep fighting no matter how long and hard the road may be until every stain of such scum as hamas and company is expunged from the earth he paused as one of the two us consulate officials behind him leaned forward whispering advice easy on the scum and hamas dont want to offend the muslims freeman nodded politely its been suggested to me that i might be offending our muslim brothers and sisters nothing could be further from my mind or from american policy our war isnt against muslims our war is against scum like hamas who use whatever organization they can to spread hatred of the west in general and of america in particular freeman now looked grim today a young boy a young muslim boy his name was jamal died en route to sapporo from a mishap which i must admit i thought was relatively minor when we left lake khanka but a mishap that due to the stress experienced in our hasty but necessary evacuation quickly proved fatal that boy a young boy a young muslim boy was lost to us because of some scumbag in hamas who managed to steal this boys young life and turn him into a potential weapon the general stopped speaking momentarily taking in a deep breath his unsmiling expression now one of strong resolve i dedicate the memory of this mission and all who made the ultimate sacrifice to all those young people of whatever race or belief who have been killed used consumed by the blind hatred of hamas and other scumbag fundamentalists that is all a barrage of questions went unanswered as general douglas freeman strode off the dais and out into the waiting consulate limousine around which immaculately turnedout japanese motorcycle police and plainclothes security personnel had formed a cordon sanitaire but the cigarette smoke was anything but sanitary and he was coughing before he entered the limo melissa thomas also in a fresh uniform was sitting on the jump seat the general indicated that the consular official take the jump seat and melissa thomas sit by him you drink marine he asked her not much besides im on duty sir so am i said the general who now turned to the consular official as the limousine eased away from yet another frenzy of camera flashes to the accompaniment of the police motorcycle sirens you have a coke in there son he asked tapping his combat boot against the polished cocktailbar cupboard coke ah i dont think so general thats a multichannel tv the general frowned at the official you people better get on the ball yes general said the consular official apologetically failing to see the smirk on the marines face well the general asked melissa were you watching the tv yes sir you think they bought it i dont understand japanese general said marine thomas but i heard some of what you said beneath the voiceover i believed you and i saw him thirty minutes ago he was sucking on that milk shake you ordered like it was his last meal it will be began the general get them to turn off those damned sirens he told the consular official were not going to a fire yes sir in the relative quiet of the limousine freeman continued it will be his last meal if those hamas bastards get a whiff of the fact that he helped us he turned to the official again i want everything im going to be debriefed on sent in code eyes only by diplomatic pouch the only other people than us to know hes alive will be the witness protection folk wholl have to give him the usual new name new identity otherwise those scumbagsll hunt him if they hell be all right interjected melissa the consular official surprised at the ease with which this marine private was addressing the famous general freeman though still concerned sank back in the plush leather seat you think so general she said may i speak freely of course none of this she told the official leaves this car okay fine well she began somewhat uneasily that suddenly she grabbed the hold strap her legs stiffening for impact both the general and consular official were on the edge of their seats looking for the unseen danger as quickly as it had begun it was over melissa thomas burying her head in her hands in acute embarrassment oh iim sorry i thought wed crossed over to the wrong side of the road i forgot they drove on the left side over here it gave the three of them a muchneeded laugh and it made it easier for melissa to reassure freeman about jamal general that boy she said he asked me if id you know youre kidding me freeman said no way sir no im not kidding he said things not dirty stuff but things only a i think that only a fullgrown man should know about freeman thought about it for a second so we should tell him he cant do that in america not yet i mean when he gets well i melissa thomas saw that the legend was embarrassed freeman could only imagine what catherine or margaret would have said well i guess well have to reeducate him its one thing for damned terrorists and oil sheiks to have twelveyearold brides but he cant the general made a vague gesture which marine thomas took to be a standin for the phrase sexual relations he just cant thats all he needs melissa suggested a strong male figure to look up to someone wholl tell him whats what and not take any cra nonsense who can get his respect someone like that guy on your team lewis isnt that his name aussie said the general nodding yes maybe he could keep a sort of uncles eye on him during the relocation program and perhaps jamal may be able to modify some of aussies antipodean phrases hes a polite boy continued melissa i didnt mean to suggest hes well you know vulgar he just knows too much if you know what i mean general for his age i understand ill speak to aussie when the team regroups aussies wife is a refugee from the jar jewish autonomous region in the old soviet union and she and aussie dont have kids she might help the more freeman thought about thomass suggestion the better he liked it good idea marine dont worry well straighten him out the general smiled already got him started on the milk shakes oh he knew about those she said smiling back there was a tap on the partition the consular official pressed a button the glass sliding down to reveal the other consular official whod been on the dais hed been working his laptop and micro printer and now passed back a sheaf of twobyfourinch pieces of paper messages for you general ive prioritized them for you the general leaned forward as he reached for them if there was one new age expression he disliked more than the grammatically ugly you did good instead of you did well it was prioritize it reeked of suit psychobabble thank you he said and sat back the first message was from the president a quotation from the inimitable winston churchill ending with well done freeman smiled at the vicissitudes of life after priest lake he was a bum now he was a hero good the second message was from the state department furious that hed linked the term hamas with scumbags hamas foggy bottom reminded him also served as a charitable arm to the palestinians and the generals use of scumbag in connection with it was unnecessarily inflammatory and an affront to all muslims freeman screwed the message into a tiny ball handing it to the consular official round file this will you the consular official informed him that scores of congratulations were pouring in but that there was one message from home he might like to see immediately the consular official was right it was from margaret cannot work new dvd player will you help a damsel in distress
