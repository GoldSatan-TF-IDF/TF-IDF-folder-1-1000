ken follett eye of the needle preface early in german intelligence was piecing together evidence of a huge army in southeastern england reconnaissance planes brought back photographs of barracks and airflelds and fleets of ships in the wash general george s patton was seen in his unmistakable pink jodhpurs walking his white bulldog there were bursts of wireless activity signals between regiments in the area confirming signs were reported by german spies in britain there was no army of course the ships were rubberandtimber fakes the barracks no more real than a movie set patton did not have a single man under his command the radio signals were meaningless the spies were double agents the object was to fool the enemy into preparing for an invasion via the pas de calais so that on dday the normandy assault would have the advantage of surprise it was a huge nearimpossible deception literally thousands of people were involved in perpetrating the trick it would have been a miracle if none of hitlers spies ever got to know about it were there any spies at the time people thought they were surrounded by what were then called fifth columnists after the war a myth grew up that mi had rounded up the lot by christmas the truth seems to be that there were very few mi did capture nearly all of them but it only needs one it is known that the germans saw the signs they were meant to see in east anglia it is also known that they suspected a trick and that they tried very hard to discover the truth that much is history what follows is fiction still and all one suspects something like this must have happened the germans were almost completely deceived only hitler guessed right and he hesitated to back his hunch a j p taylor english history part one it was the coldest winter for fortyfive years villages in the english countryside were cut off by the snow and the thames froze over one day in january the glasgowlondon train arrived at euston twentyfour hours late the snow and the blackout combined to make motoring perilous road accidents doubled and people told jokes about how it was more risky to drive an austin seven along piccadilly at night than to take a tank across the siegfried line then when the spring came it was glorious barrage balloons floated majestically in bright blue skies and soldiers on leave flirted with girls in sleeveless dresses on the streets of london the city did not look much like the capital of a nation at war there were signs of course and henry faber cycling from waterloo station toward highgate noted them piles of sandbags outside important public buildings anderson shelters in suburban gardens propaganda posters about evacuation and air raid precautions faber watched such thingshe was considerably more observant than the average railway clerk he saw crowds of children in the parks and concluded that evacuation had been a failure he marked the number of motor cars on the road despite petrol rationing and he read about the new models announced by the motor manufacturers he knew the significance of nightshift workers pouring into factories where only months previously there had been hardly enough work for the day shift most of all he monitored the movement of troops around britains railway network all the paperwork passed through his office one could learn a lot from that paperwork today for example he had rubberstamped a batch of forms that led him to believe that a new expeditionary force was being gathered he was fairly sure that it would have a complement of about men and that it was for finland there were signs yes but there was something jokey about it all radio shows satirised the red tape of wartime regulations there was community singing in the air raid shelters and fashionable women carried their gas masks in couturierdesigned containers they talked about the bore war it was at once largerthanlife and trivial like a moving picture show all the air raid warnings without exception had been false alarms faber had a different point of view but then he was a different kind of person he steered his cycle into archway road and leaned forward a little to take the uphill slope his long legs pumping as tirelessly as the pistons of a railway engine he was very fit for his age which was thirtynine although he lied about it he lied about most things as a safety precaution he began to perspire as he climbed the hill into highgate the building in which he lived was one of the highest in london which was why he chose to live there it was a victorian brick house at one end of a terrace of six the houses were high narrow and dark like the minds of the men for whom they had been built each had three stories plus a basement with a servants entrancethe english middle class of the nineteenth century insisted on a servants entrance even if they had no servants faber was a cynic about the english number six had been owned by mr harold garden of gardens tea and coffee a small company that went broke in the depression having lived by the principle that insolvency is a mortal sin the bankrupt mr garden had no option but to die the house was all he bequeathed to his widow who was then obliged to take in boarders she enjoyed being a landlady although the etiquette of her social circle demanded that she be a little ashamed of it faber had a room on the top floor with a dormer window he lived there from monday to friday and told mrs garden that he spent his weekends with his mother in erith in fact he had another landlady in blackheath who called him mr baker and believed he was a travelling salesman for a stationery manufacturer and spent all week on the road he wheeled his cycle up the garden path under the disapproving frown of the tall frontroom windows he put his bike in the shed and padlocked it to the lawn mowerit was against the law to leave a vehicle unlocked the seed potatoes in boxes all around the shed were sprouting mrs garden had turned her flower beds over to vegetables for the war effort faber entered the house hung his hat on the hallstand washed his hands and went in to tea three of the other lodgers were already eating a pimply boy from yorkshire who was trying to get into the army a confectionery salesman with receding sandy hair and a retired naval officer who faber was convinced was a degenerate faber nodded to them and sat down the salesman was telling a joke so the squadron leader says youre back early and the pilot turns round and says yes i dropped my leaflets in bundles wasnt that right so the squadron leader says good god you mightve hurt somebody the naval officer cackled and faber smiled mrs garden came in with a teapot good evening mr faber we started without you i hope you dont mind faber spread margarine thinly on a slice of wholemeal bread and momentarily yearned for a fat sausage your seed potatoes are ready to plant he told her faber hurried through his tea the others were arguing over whether chamberlain should be sacked and replaced by churchill mrs garden kept voicing opinions then looking at faber for a reaction she was a blowsy woman a little overweight about fabers age she wore the clothes of a woman of thirty and he guessed she wanted another husband he kept out of the discussion mrs garden turned on the radio it hummed for a while then an announcer said this is the bbc home service its that man again faber had heard the show it regularly featured a german spy called funf he excused himself and went up to his room mrs garden was left alone after its that man again the naval officer went to the pub with the salesman and the boy from yorkshire who was religious went to a prayer meeting she sat in the parlour with a small glass of gin looking at the blackout curtain and thinking about mr faber she wished he wouldnt spend so much time in his room she needed company and he was the kind of company she needed such thoughts made her feel guilty to assuage the guilt she thought of mr garden her memories were familiar but blurred like an old print of a movie with worn sprocket holes and an indistinct soundtrack so that although she could easily remember what it was like to have him here in the room with her it was difficult to imagine his face or the clothes he might be wearing or the comment he would make on the days war news he had been a small dapper man successful in business when he was lucky and unsuccessful when he was not undemonstrative in public and insatiably affectionate in bed she had loved him a lot there would be many women in her position if this war ever got going properly she poured another drink mr faber was a quiet one that was the trouble he didnt seem to have any vices he didnt smoke she had never smelled drink on his breath and he spent every evening in his room listening to classical music on his radio he read a lot of newspapers and went for long walks she suspected he was quite clever despite his humble job his contributions to the conversation in the dining room were always a shade more thoughtful than anyone elses he surely could get a better job if he tried he seemed not to give himself the chance he deserved it was the same with his appearance he was a fine figure of a man tall quite heavy around the neck and shoulders not a bit fat with long legs and he had a strong face with a high forehead and a long jaw and bright blue eyes not pretty like a film star but the kind of face that appealed to a woman except for the mouth that was small and thin and she could imagine him being cruel mr garden had been capable of cruelty and yet at first sight he was not the kind of a man a woman would look at twice the trousers of his old worn suit were never pressedshe would have done that for him and gladly but he never askedand he always wore a shabby raincoat and a flat dockers cap he had no moustache and his hair was trimmed short every fortnight it was as if he wanted to look like a nonentity he needed a woman there was no doubt of that she wondered for a moment whether he might be what people called effeminate but she dismissed the idea quickly he needed a wife to smarten him up and give him ambition she needed a man to keep her company and forwelllove yet he never made a move sometimes she could scream with frustration she was sure she was attractive she looked in a mirror as she poured another gin she had a nice face and fair curly hair and there was something for a man to get hold of she giggled at that thought she must be getting tiddly she sipped her drink and considered whether she ought to make the first move mr faber was obviously shychronically shy he wasnt sexless she could tell by the look in his eyes on the two occasions he had seen her in her nightdress perhaps she could overcome his shyness by being brazen what did she have to lose she tried imagining the worst just to see what it felt like suppose he rejected her well it would be embarrassing even humiliating it would be a blow to her pride but nobody else need know it had happened he would just have to leave the thought of rejection had put her off the whole idea she got to her feet slowly thinking im just not the brazen type it was bedtime if she had one more gin in bed she would be able to sleep she took the bottle upstairs her bedroom was below mr fabers and she could hear violin music from his radio as she undressed she put on a new nightdresspink with an embroidered neckline and no one to see itand made her last drink she wondered what mr faber looked like undressed he would have a flat stomach and hairs on his nipples and you would be able to see his ribs because he was slim he probably had a small bottom she giggled again thinking im a disgrace she took her drink to bed and picked up her book but it was too much effort to focus on the print besides she was bored with vicarious romance stories about dangerous love affairs were fine when you yourself had a perfectly safe love affair with your husband but a woman needed more than barbara cartland she sipped her gin and wished mr faber would turn the radio off it was like trying to sleep at a tea dance she could of course ask him to turn it off she looked at her bedside clock it was past ten she could put on her dressing gown which matched the nightdress and just comb her hair a little then step into her slippersquite dainty with a pattern of rosesand just pop up the stairs to the next landing and just well tap on his door he would open it perhaps wearing his trousers and undershirt and then he would look at her the way he had looked when he saw her in her nightdress on the way to the bathroom silly old fool she said to herself aloud youre just making excuses to go up there and then she wondered why she needed excuses she was a grownup and it was her house and in ten years she had not met another man who was just right for her and what the hell she needed to feel someone strong and hard and hairy on top of her squeezing her breasts and panting in her ear and parting her thighs with his broad flat hands for tomorrow the gas bombs might come over from germany and they would all die choking and gasping and poisoned and she would have lost her last chance so she drained her glass and got out of bed and put on her dressing gown and just combed her hair a little and stepped into her slippers and picked up her bunch of keys in case he had locked the door and couldnt hear her knock above the sound of the radio there was nobody on the landing she found the stairs in the darkness she intended to step over the stair that creaked but she stumbled on the loose carpet and trod on it heavily but it seemed that nobody heard so she went on up and tapped on the door at the top she tried it gently it was locked the radio was turned down and mr faber called out yes he was wellspoken not cockney or foreignnot anything really just a decently neutral voice she said can i have a word with you he seemed to hesitate then he said im undressed so am i she giggled and she opened the door with her duplicate key he was standing in front of the radio with some kind of screwdriver in his hand he wore his trousers and no undershirt his face was white and he looked scared to death she stepped inside and closed the door behind her not knowing what to say suddenly she remembered a line from an american film and she said would you buy a lonely girl a drink it was silly really because she knew he had no drink in his room and she certainly wasnt dressed to go out but it sounded vampish it seemed to have the desired effect without speaking he came slowly toward her he did have hair on his nipples she took a step forward and then his arms went around her and she closed her eyes and turned up her face and he kissed her and she moved quietly in his arms and then there was a terrible awful unbearable sharp pain in her back and she opened her mouth to scream he had heard her stumble on the stairs if shed waited another minute he would have had the radio transmitter back in its case and the code books in the drawer and there would have been no need for her to die but before he could conceal the evidence he had heard her key in the lock and when she opened the door the stiletto had been in his hand because she moved slightly in his arms faber missed her heart with the first jab of the weapon and he had to thrust his fingers down her throat to stop her crying out he jabbed again but she moved again and the blade struck a rib and merely slashed her superficially then the blood was spurting and he knew it would not be a clean kill it never was when you missed with the first stroke she was wriggling too much to be killed with a jab now keeping his fingers in her mouth he gripped her jaw with his thumb and pushed her back against the door her head hit the woodwork with a loud bump and he wished he had not turned the radio down but how could he have expected this he hesitated before killing her because it would be much better if she died on the bedbetter for the coverup that was already taking shape in his mindbut he could not be sure of getting her that far in silence he tightened his hold on her jaw kept her head still by jamming it against the door and brought the stiletto around in a wide slashing arc that ripped away most of her throat for the stiletto was not a slashing knife and the throat was not fabers favoured target he jumped back to avoid the first horrible gush of blood then stepped forward again to catch her before she hit the floor he dragged her to the bed trying not to look at her neck and laid her down he had killed before so he expected the reaction it always came as soon as he felt safe he went over to the sink in the corner of the room and waited for it he could see his face in the little shaving mirror he was white and his eyes were staring he looked at himself and thought killer then he threw up when that was over he felt better he could go to work now he knew what he had to do the details had come to him even while he was killing her he washed his face brushed his teeth and cleaned the washbasin then he sat down at the table beside his radio he looked at his notebook found his place and began tapping the key it was a long message about the mustering of an army for finland and he had been halfway through when he was interrupted it was written down in cipher on the pad when he had completed it he signed off with regards to willi the transmitter packed away neatly into a specially designed suitcase faber put the rest of his possessions into a second case he took off his trousers and sponged the bloodstains then washed himself all over at last he looked at the corpse he was able to be cold about her now it was wartime they were enemies if he had not killed her she would have caused his death she had been a threat and all he felt now was relief that the threat had been nullified she should not have frightened him nevertheless his last task was distasteful he opened her robe and lifted her nightdress pulling it up around her waist she was wearing knickers he tore them so that the hair of her pubis was visible poor woman she had wanted only to seduce him but he could not have got her out of the room without her seeing the transmitter and the british propaganda had made these people alert for spiesridiculously so if the abwehr had as many agents as the newspapers made out the british would have lost the war already he stepped back and looked at her with his head on one side there was something wrong he tried to think like a sex maniac if i were crazed with lust for a woman like una garden and i killed just so that i could have my way with her what would i then do of course that kind of lunatic would want to look at her breasts faber leaned over the body gripped the neckline of the nightdress and ripped it to the waist her large breasts sagged sideways the police doctor would soon discover that she had not been raped but faber did not think that mattered he had taken a criminology course at heidelberg and he knew that many sexual assaults were not consummated besides he could not have carried the deception that far not even for the fatherland he was not in the ss some of them would queue up to rape the corpse he put the thought out of his mind he washed his hands again and got dressed it was almost midnight he would wait an hour before leaving it would be safer later he sat down to think about how he had gone wrong there was no question that he had made a mistake if his cover were perfect he would be totally secure if he were totally secure no one could discover his secret mrs garden had discovered his secretor rather she would have if she had lived a few seconds longertherefore he had not been totally secure therefore his cover was not perfect therefore he had made a mistake he should have put a bolt on the door better to be thought chronically shy than to have landladies with duplicate keys sneaking in in their nightclothes that was the surface error the deep flaw was that he was too eligible to be a bachelor he thought this with irritation not conceit he knew that he was a pleasant attractive man and that there was no apparent reason why he should be single he turned his mind to thinking up a cover that would explain this without inviting advances from the mrs gardens of this world he ought to be able to find inspiration in his real personality why was he single he stirred uneasily he did not like mirrors the answer was simple he was single because of his profession if there were deeper reasons he did not want to know them he would have to spend tonight in the open highgate wood would do in the morning he would take his suitcases to a railway station checkroom then tomorrow evening he would go to his room in blackheath he would shift to his second identity he had little fear of being caught by the police the commercial traveller who occupied the room at blackheath on weekends looked rather different from the railway clerk who had killed his landlady the blackheath persona was expansive vulgar and flashy he wore loud ties bought rounds of drinks and combed his hair differently the police would circulate a description of a shabby little pervert who would not say boo to a goose until he was inflamed with lust and no one would look twice at the handsome salesman in the striped suit who was obviously the type that was more or less permanently inflamed with lust and did not have to kill women to get them to show him their breasts he would have to set up another identityhe always kept at least two he needed a new job fresh papers passport identity card ration book birth certificate it was all so risky damn mrs garden why couldnt she have drunk herself asleep as usual it was one oclock faber took a last look around the room he was not concerned about leaving clueshis fingerprints were obviously all over the house and there would be no doubt in anyones mind about who was the murderer nor did he feel any sentiment about leaving the place that had been his home for two years he had never thought of it as home he had never thought of anywhere as home he would always think of this as the place where he had learned to put a bolt on a door he turned out the light picked up his cases and went down the stairs and out of the door into the night henry ii was a remarkable king in an age when the term flying visit had not yet been coined he flitted between england and france with such rapidity that he was credited with magical powers a rumour that understandably he did nothing to suppress in either the june or the september depending upon which secondary source one favourshe arrived in england and left for france again so quickly that no contemporary writer ever found out about it later historians discovered the record of his expenditure in the pipe rolls at the time his kingdom was under attack by his sons at its northern and southern extremes the scottish border and the south of france but what precisely was the purpose of his visit whom did he see why was it secret when the myth of his magical speed was worth an army what did he accomplish this was the problem that taxed percival godliman in the summer of when hitlers armies swept across the french cornfields like a scythe and the british poured out of the dunkirk bottleneck in bloody disarray professor godliman knew more about the middle ages than any man alive his book on the black death had upended every convention of medievalism it had also been a bestseller and published as a penguin book with that behind him he had turned to a slightly earlier and even more intractable period at on a splendid june day in london a secretary found godliman hunched over an illuminated manuscript laboriously translating its mediaeval latin making notes in his own even less legible handwriting the secretary who was planning to eat her luncheon the garden of gordon square did not like the manuscript room because it smelled dead you needed so many keys to get in there it might as well have been a tomb godliman stood at a lectern perched on one leg like a bird his face lit bleakly by a spotlight abovehe might have been the ghost of the monk who wrote the book standing a cold vigil over his precious chronicle the girl cleared her throat and waited for him to notice her she saw a short man in his fifties with round shoulders and weak eyesight wearing a tweed suit she knew he could be perfectly sensible once you dragged him out of the middle ages she coughed again and said professor godliman he looked up and when he saw her he smiled and then he did not look like a ghost more like someones dotty father hello he said in an astonished tone as if he had just met his nextdoor neighbour in the middle of the sahara desert you asked me to remind you that you have lunch at the savoy with colonel terry oh yes he took his watch out of his waistcoat pocked and peered at it if im going to walk it id better leave now she nodded i brought your gas mask you are thoughtful he smiled again and she decided he looked quite nice he took the mask from her and said do i need my coat you didnt wear one this morning its quite warm shall i lock up after you thank you thank you he jammed his notebook into his jacket pocket and went out the secretary looked around shivered and followed him colonel andrew terry was a redfaced scot pauperthin from a lifetime of heavy smoking with sparse darkblond hair thickly brilliantined godliman found him at a corner table in the savoy grill wearing civilian clothes there were three cigarette stubs in the ashtray he stood up to shake hands godliman said morning uncle andrew terry was his mothers baby brother how are you percy im writing a book about the plantagenets godliman sat down are your manuscripts still in london im surprised why terry lit another cigarette move them to the country in case of bombing should i half the national gallery has been shoved into a bloody big hole in the ground somewhere up in wales young kenneth clark is quicker off the mark than you might be sensible to take yourself off out of it too while youre about it i dont suppose youve many students left thats true godliman took a menu from a waiter and said i dont want a drink terry did not look at his menu seriously percy why are you still in town godlimans eyes seemed to clear like the image on a screen when the projector is focused as if he had to think for the first time since he walked in its all right for children to leave and national institutions like bertrand russell but for me well its a bit like running away and letting other people fight for you i realise thats not a strictly logical argument its a matter of sentiment not logic terry smiled the smile of one whose expectations have been fulfilled but he dropped the subject and looked at the menu after a moment he said good god le lord wool pie godliman grinned im sure its still just potatoes and vegetables when they had ordered terry said what do you think of our new prime minister the mans an ass but then hitlers a fool and look how well hes doing you we can live with winston at least hes bellicose godliman raised his eyebrows we are you back in the game l never really left it you know but you said percy cant you think of a department whose staff all say they dont work for the army well im dammed all this time their first course came and they started a bottle of white bordeaux godliman ate potted salmon and looked pensive eventually terry said thinking about the last lot godliman nodded young days you know terrible time but his tone was almost wistful this war isnt the same at all my chaps dont go behind enemy lines and count bivouacs like you did well they do but that side of the thing is much less important this time nowadays we just listen to the wireless dont they broadcast in code terry shrugged codes can be broken candidly we get to know just about everything we need these days godliman glanced around but there was no one within earshot and it was hardly for him to tell terry that careless talk costs lives terry went on in fact my job is to make sure they dont have the information they need about us they both had chicken pie to follow there was no beef on the menu godliman fell silent but terry talked on canaris is a funny chap you know admiral wilhelm canaris head of the abwehr i met him before this lot started likes england my guess is hes none too fond of hitler anyway we know hes been told to mount a major intelligence operation against us in preparation for the invasion but hes not doing much we arrested their best man in england the day after war broke out hes in wandsworth prison now useless people canaris spies old ladies in boardinghouses mad fascists petty criminals godliman said look here old boy this is too much he trembled slightly with a mixture of anger and incomprehension all this stuff is secret i dont want to know terry was unperturbed would you like something else he offered im having chocolate ice cream godliman stood up i dont think so im going to go back to my work if you dont mind terry looked up at him coolly the world can wait for your reappraisal of the plantagenets percy theres a war on dear boy i want you to work for me godliman stared down at him for a long moment what on earth would i do terry smiled wolfishly catch spies walking back to the college godliman felt depressed despite the weather he would accept colonel terrys offer no doubt about that his country was at war it was a just war and if he was too old to fight he was still young enough to help but the thought of leaving his workand for how many yearsdepressed him he loved history and he had been totally absorbed in mediaeval england since the death of his wife ten years ago he liked the unravelling of mysteries the discovery of faint clues the resolution of contradictions the unmasking of lies and propaganda and myth his new book would be the best on its subject written in the last hundred years and there would not be one to equal it for another century it had ruled his life for so long that the thought of abandoning it was almost unreal as difficult to digest as the discovery that one is an orphan and no relation at all to the people one has always called mother and father an air raid warning stridently interrupted his thoughb he contemplated ignoring itso many people did nowand he was only two minutes walk from the college but he had no real reason to return to his study he knew he would do no more work today so he hurried into a tube station and joined the solid mass of londoners crowding down the staircases and on to the grimy platform he stood close to the wall staring at a bovril poster and thought but its not just the things im leaving behind going back into the game depressed him too there were some things he liked about it the importance of little things the value of simply being clever the meticulousness the guesswork but he hated the blackmail the deceit the desperation and the way one always stabbed the enemy in the back the platform was becoming more crowded godliman sat down while there was still room and found himself leaning against a man in bus drivers uniform the man smiled and said oh to be in england now that summers here know who said that now that aprils there godliman corrected him it was browning i heard it was adolf hitler the driver said a woman next to him squealed with laughter and he turned his attention to her did you hear what the evacuee said to the farmers wife godliman tuned out and remembered an april when he had longed for england crouching on a high branch of a plane tree peering through a cold mist across a french valley behind the german lines he could see nothing but vague dark shapes even through his telescope and he was about to slide down and walk a mile or so further when three german soldiers came from nowhere to sit around the base of the tree and smoke after a while they took out cards and began to play and young percival godliman realised they had found a way of stealing off and were here for the day he stayed in the tree hardly moving until he began to shiver and his muscles knotted with cramp and his bladder felt as if it would burst then he took out his revolver and shot the three of them one after another through the tops of their closecropped heads and three people laughing and cursing and gambling their pay had simply ceased to exist it was the first time he killed and all he could think was just because i had to pee godliman shifted on the cold concrete of the station platform and let the memory fade away there was a warm wind from the tunnel and a train came in the people who got off found spaces and settled to wait godliman listened to the voices did you hear churchill on the wireless we was listeningin at the duke of wellington old jack thornton cried silly old bugger havent had fillet steak on the menu for so long ive forgotten the bally taste wine committee saw the war coming and bought in twenty thousand dozen thank god yes a quiet wedding but whats the point in waiting when you dont know what the next days going to bring no peter never came back from dunkirk the bus driver offered him a cigarette godliman refused and took out his pipe someone started to sing a blackout warden passing yelled ma pull down that blind just look at what youre showing and she shouted never mind oh knees up mother brown the song spread through the crowd until everyone was singing godliman joined in knowing that this was a nation losing a war and singing to hide its fear as a man will whistle past the graveyard at night knowing that the sudden affection he felt for london and londoners was an ephemeral sentiment akin to mob hysteria mistrusting the voice inside hnn that said this this is what the war is about this is what makes it worth fighting knowing but not caring because for the first time in so many years he was feeling the sheer physical thrill of comradeship and he liked it when the allclear sounded they went up the staircase and into the street and godliman found a phone box and called colonel terry to ask how soon he could start faber godliman twothirds of a triangle that one day would be crucially completed by the principals david and lucy of a ceremony proceeding at this moment in a small country church it was old and very beautiful a drystone wall enclosed a graveyard where wildflowers grew the church itself had been therewell bits of it hadthe last time britain was invaded almost a millennium ago the north wall of the nave several feet thick and pierced with only two tiny windows could remember that last invasion it had been built when churches were places of physical as well as spiritual sanctuary and the little roundheaded windows i were better for shooting arrows out of than for letting the lords sunshine in indeed the local defence volunteers had detailed plans for using the church if and when the current bunch of european thugs crossed the channel but no jackboots sounded in the tiled choir in this august of not yet the sun glowed through stained glass windows that had survived cromwells iconoclasts and henry viiis greed and the roof resounded to the notes of an organ that had yet to yield to woodworm and dry rot it was a lovely wedding lucy wore white of course and her five sisters were bridesmaids in apricot dresses david wore the mess uniform of a flying officer in the royal air force all crisp and new for it was the first time he had put it on they sang psalm the lord is my shepherd to the tune crimond lucys father looked proud as a man will on the day his eldest and most beautiful daughter marries a fine boy in a uniform he was a farmer but it was a long time since he had sat on a tractor he rented out his arable land and used the rest to raise racehorses although this winter of course his pasture would go under the plough and potatoes would be planted although he was really more gentleman than farmer he nevertheless had the openair skin the deep chest and the big stubby hands of agricultural people most of the men on that side of the church bore him a resemblance barrelchested men with weathered red faces those not in tail coats favouring tweed suits and stout shoes the bridesmaids had something of that look too they were country girls but the bride was like her mother her hair was a dark dark red long and thick and shining and glorious and she had wideapart amber eyes and an oval face and when she looked at the vicar with that clear direct gaze and said i will in that firm clear voice the vicar was startled and thought by god she means it which was an odd thought for a vicar to have in the middle of a wedding the family on the other side of the nave had a certain look about them too davids father was a lawyer his permanent frown was a professional affectation and concealed a sunny nature he had been a major in the army in the last war and thought all this business about the raf and war in the air was a fad that would soon pass but nobody looked like him not even his son who stood now at the altar promising to love his wife until death which might not be far away god forbid no they all looked like davids mother who sat beside her husband now with almostblack hair and dark skin and long slender limbs david was the tallest of the lot he had broken highjump records last year at cambridge university he was rather too goodlooking for a manhis face would have been feminine were it not for the dark ineradicable shadow of a heavy beard he shaved twice a day he had long eyelashes and he looked intelligent which he was and sensitive the whole thing was idyllic two happy handsome people children of solid comfortably off backboneofenglandtype families getting married in a country church in the finest summer weather britain can offer when they were pronounced man and wife both the mothers were dryeyed and both the fathers cried kissing the bride was a barbarous custom lucy thought as yet another middleaged pair of champagnewet lips smeared her cheek it was probably descended from even more barbarous customs in the dark ages when every man in the tribe was allowed towell anyway it was time we got properly civilised and dropped the whole business she had known she would not like this part of the wedding she liked champagne but she was not crazy about chicken drumsticks or dollops of caviar on squares of cold toast and as for the speeches and the photographs and the honeymoon jokes well but it could have been worse if it had been peacetime father would have hired the albert hall so far nine people had said may all your troubles be little ones and one person with scarcely more originality had said i want to see more than a fence running around your garden lucy had shaken countless hands and pretended not to hear remarks like i wouldnt mind being in davids pyjamas tonight david had made a speech in which he thanked lucys parents for giving him their daughter and lucys father actually said that he was not losing a daughter but gaining a son it was all hopelessly gaga but one did it for ones parents a distant uncle loomed up from the direction of the bar swaying slightly and lucy repressed a shudder she introduced him to her husband david this is uncle norman uncle norman pumped davids bony hand well mboy when do you take up your commission tomorrow sir what no honeymoon just twentyfour hours but youve only just fished your training so i gather yes but i could fly before you know i learned at cambridge besides with an this going on they cant spare pilots i expect i shall be in the air tomorrow lucy said quietly david dont but uncle norman persevered whatll you fly uncle norman asked with schoolboy enthusiasm spitfire i saw her yesterday shes a lovely kite david had already fallen into the raf slang kites and crates and the drink and bandits at two oclock shes got eight guns she does three hundred and fifty knots and shell turn around in a shoebox marvellous marvellous you boys are certainly knocking the stuffing out of the luftwaffe what we got sixty yesterday for eleven of our own david said as proudly as if he had shot them all down himself the day before when they had a go at yorkshire we sent the lot back to norway with their tails between their legs and we didnt lose a single kite uncle norman gripped davids shoulder with tipsy fervour never he quoted pompously was so much owed by so many to so few churchill said that the other day david tried a modest grin he must have been talking about the mess bills lucy hated the way they trivialised bloodshed and destruction she said david we should go and change now they went in separate cars to lucys home her mother helped her out of the wedding dress and said now my dear i dont quite know what youre expecting tonight but you ought to know oh mother this is you know her mother coloured slightly very well dear she said mildly but if there is anything you want to talk about later on it occurred to lucy that to say things like this cost her mother considerable effort and she regretted her sharp reply thank you she said she touched her mothers hand i will ill leave you to it then call me if you want anything she kissed lucys cheek and went out lucy sat at the dressing table in her slip and began to brush her hair she knew exactly what to expect tonight she felt a faint glow of pleasure as she remembered it happened in june a year after they had met at the glad rag ball they were seeing each other every week by this time and david had spent part of the easter vacation with lucys people mother and father approved of him he was handsome clever and gentlemanly and he came from precisely the same stratum of society as they did father thought he was a shade too opinionated but mother said the landed gentry had been saying that about undergraduates for six hundred years and she thought david would be kind to his wife which was the most important thing in the long run so in june lucy went to davids family home for a weekend the place was a victorian copy of an eighteenthcentury grange a squareshaped house with nine bedrooms and a terrace with a vista what impressed lucy about it was the realisation that the people who planted the garden must have known they would be long dead before it reached maturity the atmosphere was very easy and the two of them drank beer on the terrace in the afternoon sunshine that was when david told her that he had been accepted for officer training in the raf along with four pals from the university flying club he wanted to be a fighter pilot i can fly all right he said and theyll need people once this war gets goingthey say itll be won and lost in the air this time arent you afraid she said quietly not a bit he said then he looked at her and said yes i am she thought he was very brave and held his hand a little later they put on swimming suits and went down to the lake the water was clear and cool but the sun was still strong and the air was warm as they splashed about gleefully are you a good swimmer he asked her better than you all right race you to the island she shaded her eyes to look into the sun she held the pose for a minute pretending she did not know how desirable she was in her wet swimsuit with her arms raised and her shoulders back the island was a small patch of bushes and trees about three hundred yards away in the centre of the lake she dropped her hands shouted go and struck out in a fast crawl david won of course with his enormously long arms and legs lucy found herself in difficulty when she was still fifty yards from the island she switched to breaststroke but she was too exhausted even for that and she had to roll over on to her back and float david who was already sitting on the bank blowing like a walrus slipped back into the water and swam to meet her he got behind her held her beneath the arms in the correct lifesaving position and pulled her slowly to shore his hands were just below her breasts im enjoying this he said and she giggled despite her breathlessness a few moments later he said i suppose i might as well tell you what she panted the lake is only four feet deep you she wriggled out of his arms spluttering and laughing and found her footing he took her hand and led her out of the water and through the trees he pointed to an old wooden rowing boat rotting upsidedown beneath a hawthorn when i was a boy i used to row out here in that with one of papas pipes a box of matches and a pinch of st bruno in a twist of paper this is where i used to smoke it they were in a clearing completely surrounded by bushes the turf underfoot was clean and springy lucy flopped on the ground wed swim back slowly david said lets not even talk about it just yet she replied he sat beside her and kissed her then pushed her gently backwards until she was lying down he stroked her hip and kissed her throat and soon she stopped shivering when he laid his hand gently nervously on the soft mound between her legs she arched upwards willing him to press harder she pulled his face to hers and kissed him openmouthed and wetly his hands went to the straps of her swimsuit and he pulled them down over her shoulders she said no he buried his face between her breasts lucy please no he looked at her it might be my last chance she rolled away from him and stood up then because of the war and because of the pleading look on his flushed young face and because of the glow inside her which would not go away she took off her costume with one swift movement and removed her bathing cap so that her darkred hair shook out over her shoulders she knelt in front of him taking his face in her hands and guiding his lips to her breast she lost her virginity painlessly enthusiastically and only a little too quickly the spice of guilt made the memory more pleasant not less even if it had been a wellplanned seduction then she had been a willing not to say eager victim especially at the end she began to dress in her goingaway outfit she had startled him a couple of times that afternoon on the island once when she wanted him to kiss her breasts and again when she had guided him inside her with her hands apparently such things did not happen in the books he read like most of her friends lucy read d h lawrence for information about sex she believed in his choreography and mistrusted the sound effectsthe things his people did to one another sounded nice but not that nice she was not expecting trumpets and thunderstorms and the clash of cymbals at her sexual awakening david was a little more ignorant than she but he was gentle and he took pleasure in her pleasure and she was sure that was the important thing they had done it only once since the first time exactly a week before their wedding they had made love again and it caused their first row this time it was at her parents house in the morning after everyone else had left he came to her room in his robe and got into bed with her she almost changed her mind about lawrences trumpets and cymbals david got out of bed immediately afterward dont go she said somebody might come in ill chance it come back to bed she was warm and drowsy and comfortable and she wanted him beside her he put on his robe it makes me nervous you werent nervous five minutes ago she reached for him lie with me i want to get to know your body her directness obviously embarrassed him and he turned away she flounced out of bed her lovely breasts heaving youre making me feel cheap she sat on the edge of the bed and burst into tears david put his arms around her and said im sorry sorry sorry youre the first for me too and i dont know what to expect and i feel confused i mean nobody tells you anything about this do they she snuffled and shook her head in agreement and it occurred to her that what was really unnerving him was the knowledge that in eight days time he had to take off in a flimsy aircraft and fight for his life above the clouds so she forgave him and he dried her tears and they got back into bed he was very sweet after that she was just about ready she examined herself in a fulllength mirror her suit was faintly military with square shoulders and epaulettes but the blouse beneath it was feminine for balance her hair fell in sausage curls beneath a natty pillbox hat it would not have been right to go away gorgeously dressed not this year but she felt she had achieved the kind of briskly practical yet attractive look that was rapidly becoming fashionable david was waiting for her in the hall he kissed her and said you look wonderful mrs rose they were driven back to the reception to say goodbye to everyone they were going to spend the night in london at claridges then david would drive on to biggin hill and lucy would come home again she was going to live with her parents she had the use of a cottage for when david was on leave there was another halfhour of handshakes and kisses then they went out to the car some of davids cousins had got at his opentop mg there were tin cans and an old boot tied to the bumpers with string the runningboards were awash with confetti and just married was scrawled all over the paintwork in bright red lipstick they drove away smiling and waving the guests filling the street behind them a mile down the road they stopped and cleaned up the car it was dusk when they got going again davids headlights were fitted with blackout masks but he drove very fast just the same lucy felt very happy david said theres a bottle of bubbly in the glove compartment lucy opened the compartment and found the champagne and two glasses carefully wrapped in tissue paper it was still quite cold the cork came out with a loud pop and shot off into the night david lit a cigarette while lucy poured the wine were going to be late for supper he said who cares she handed him a glass she was too tired to drink really she became sleepy the car seemed to be going terribly fast she let david have most of the champagne he began to whistle st louis blues driving through england in the blackout was a weird experience one missed lights that one hadnt realised were there before the war lights in cottage porches and farmhouse windows lights on cathedral spires and inn signs and most of all the luminous glow low in the distant sky of the thousand lights of a nearby town even if one had been able to see there were no signposts to look at they had been removed to confuse the german parachutists who were expected any day just a few days ago in the midlands farmers had found parachutes radios and maps but since there were no footprints leading away from the objects it had been concluded that no men had landed and the whole thing was a feeble nazi attempt to panic the population anyway david knew the way to london they climbed a long hill the little sports car took it nimbly lucy gazed through halfclosed eyes at the blackness ahead the downside of the hill was steep and winding lucy heard the distant roar of an approaching lorry the mgs tires squealed as david raced around the bends i think youre going too fast lucy said mildly the back of the car skidded on a left curve david changed down afraid to brake in case he skidded again on either side the hedgerows were dimly picked out by the shaded headlights there was a sharp righthand curve and david lost the back again the curve seemed to go on and on forever the little car slid sideways and turned through degrees so that it was going backwards then continued to turn in the same direction david lucy screamed the moon came out suddenly and they saw the lorry it was struggling up the hill at a snails pace with thick smoke made silvery by the moonlight pouring from its snoutshaped bonnet lucy glimpsed the drivers face even his cloth cap and his moustache his mouth was open as he stood on his brakes the car was travelling forward again now there was just room to pass the lorry if david could regain control of the car he heaved the steering wheel over and touched the accelerator it was a mistake the car and the lorry collided headon foreigners have spies britain has military intelligence as if that were not euphemism enough it is abbreviated to mi in mi was part of the war offlce it was spreading like crab grass at the timenot surprisinglyand its different sections were known by numbers mi ran the escape routes from prisonerofwar camps through occupied europe to neutral countries mi monitored enemy wireless traffic and was of more value than six regiments mi sent agents into france it was mi that professor percival godliman joined in the autumn of he turned up at the war office in whitehall on a cold september morning after a night spent putting out fires all over the east end the blitz was at its height and he was an auxiliary fireman military intelligence was run by soldiers in peacetime when in godlimans opinion espionage made no difference to anything anyhow but now he found it was populated by amateurs and he was delighted to discover that he knew half the people in mi on his first day he met a barrister who was a member of his club an art historian with whom he had been to college an archivist from his own university and his favourite writer of detective stories he was shown into colonel terrys office at am terry had been there for several hours there were two empty cigarette packets in the wastepaper basket godliman said should i call you sir now theres not much bull around here percy uncle andrew will do fine sit down all the same there was a briskness about terry that had not been present when they had lunch at the savoy godliman noticed that he did not smile and his attention kept wandering to a pile of unread messages on the desk terry looked at his watch and said im aching to put you in the picture briefly finish the lecture i started over lunch godliman smiled this time i wont get up on my high horse terry lit another cigarette canaris spies in britain were useless people terry resumed as if their conversation had been interrupted five minutes rather than three months ago dorothy ogrady was typical we caught her cutting military telephone wire on the isle of wight she was writing letters to portugal in the kind of secret ink you buy in joke shops a new wave of spies began in september their task was to reconnoitre britain in preparation for the invasion to map beaches suitable for landings fields and roads that could be used by troopcarrying gliders tank traps and road blocks and barbedwire obstacles they seem to have been badly selected hastily mustered inadequately trained and poorly equipped typical were the four who came over on the night of september meier kieboom pons and waldberg kieboom and pons landed at dawn near hythe and were arrested by private tollervey of the somerset light infantry who came upon them in the sand dunes hacking away at a dirty great wurst waldberg actually managed to send a signal to hamburg arrived safely document destroyed english patrol metres prom coast beach with brown nets and railway sleepers at a distance op metres no mines few soldiers unfinished blockhouse new road waldberg clearly he did not know where he was nor did he even have a code name the quality of his briefing is indicated by the fact that he knew nothing of english licencing laws he went into a pub at nine oclock in the morning and asked for a quart of cider godliman laughed at this and terry said wait it gets funnier the landlord told waldberg to come back at ten he could spend the hour looking at the village church he suggested amazingly waldberg was back at ten sharp whereupon two policemen on bicycles arrested him its like a script for its that man again said godliman meier was found a few hours later eleven more agents were picked up over the next few weeks most of them within hours of landing on british soil almost all of them were destined for the scaffold almost all said godliman terry said yes a couple have been handed over to our section bla ill come back to that in a minute others landed in eire one was ernst weberdrohl a wellknown acrobat who had two illegitimate children in ireland he had toured music houses there as the worlds strongest man he was arrested by the garde siochana fined three pounds and turned over to b a another was hermann goetz who parachuted into ulster instead of eire by mistake was robbed by the ira swam the boyne in his fur underwear and eventually swallowed his suicide pill he had a flashlight marked made in dresden if its so easy to pick these bunglers up terry said why are we taking on brainy types like yourself to catch them two reasons one weve got no way of knowing how many we havent picked up two its what we do with the ones we dont hang that matters this is where bla comes in but to explain that i have to go back to alfred george owens was an electrical engineer with a company that had a few government contracts he visited germany several times during the s and voluntarily gave to the admiralty odd bits of technical information he picked up there eventually naval intelligence passed him on to mi who began to develop him as an agent the abwehr recruited him at about the same time as mi discovered when they intercepted a letter from him to a known german cover address clearly he was a man totally without loyalty he just wanted to be a spy we called him snow the germans called him johnny in january snow got a letter containing instructions for the use of a wireless transmitter and a ticket from the checkroom at victoria station he was arrested the day after war broke out and he and his transmitter which he had picked up in a suitcase when be presented the checkroom ticket were locked up in wandsworth prison he continued to communicate with hamburg but now all the messages were written by section bla of mi the abwehr put him in touch with two more german agents in england whom we immediately nabbed they also gave him a code and detailed wireless procedure all of which was invaluable snow was followed by charlie rainbow summer biscuit and eventually a small army of enemy spies all in regular contact with canaris an apparently trusted by him and all totally controlled by the british counterintelligence apparatus at that point mi began dimly to glimpse an awesome and tantalising prospect with a bit of luck they could control and manipulate the entire german espionage network in britain turning agents into double agents instead of hanging them has two crucial advantages terry wound up since the enemy thinks his spies are still active he doesnt try to replace them with others who may not get caught and since we are supplying the information the spies tell their controllers we can deceive the enemy and mislead his strategists it cant be that easy said godliman certainly not terry opened a window to let out the fug of cigarette and pipe smoke to work the system has to be very near total if there is any substantial number of genuine agents here their information will contradict that of the double agents and the abwehr will smell a rat it sounds exciting godliman said his pipe had gone out terry smiled for the first time that morning the people here will tell you its hard work long hours high tension frustration but yes of course its exciting he looked at his watch now i want you to meet a very bright young member of my staff let me walk you to his offlce they went out of the room up some stairs and along several corridors his name is frederick bloggs and he gets annoyed if you make jokes about it terry continued we pinched him from scotland yardhe was an inspector with special branch if you need arms and legs use him youll rank above him of course but i shouldnt make too much of that we dont here i suppose i hardly need to say that to you they entered a small bare room that looked out on to a blank wall there was no carpet a photograph of a pretty girl hung on the wall and there was a pair of handcuffs on the hatstand terry said frederick bloggs percival godliman ill leave you to it the man behind the desk was blond stocky and short he must have been only just tall enough to get into the police force godliman thought his tie was an eyesore but he had a pleasant open face and an attractive grin his handshake was firm tell you what percy i was just going to nip home for lunch he said why dont you come along the wife makes a lovely sausage and chips he had a broad cockney accent sausage and chips was not godlimans favourite meal but he went along they walked to trafalgar square and caught a bus to brixton bloggs said i married a wonderful girl but she cant cook for nuts i have sausage and chips every day east london was still smoking from the previous nights air raid they passed groups of firemen and volunteers digging through rubble playing hoses over dying fires and clearing debris from the streets they saw an old man carry a precious radio out of a halfruined house godliman made conversation so were to catch spies together well have a go perce bloggs home was a threebedroom semidetached house in a street of exactly similar houses the tiny front gardens were all being used to grow vegetables mrs bloggs was the pretty girl in the photograph on the office wall she looked tired she drives an ambulance during the raids dont you love bloggs said he was proud of her her name was christine she said every morning when i come home i wonder if the house will still he here notice its the house shes worried about not me bloggs said godliman picked up a medal in a presentation case from the mantelpiece how did you get this christine answered he took a shotgun off a villain who was robbing a post offlce youre quite a pair godliman said you married percy bloggs asked im a widower sorry my wife died of tuberculosis in we never had any children were not having any yet bloggs said not while the worlds in this state christine said oh fred hes not interested in that shs went out to the kitchen they sat around a square table in the canter of the room to eat godliman was touched by this couple and the domestic scene and found himself thinking of his eleanor that was unusual he had been immune to sentiment for some years perhaps the nerves were coming alive again at last war did funny things christines cooking was truly awful the sausages were burned bloggs drowned his meal in tomato ketchup and godliman cheerfully followed suit when they got back to whitehall bloggs showed godliman the file on unidentified enemy agents thought still to be operating in britain there were three sources of information about such people the first was the immigration records of the home office passport control had long been an arm of military intelligence and there was a list going back to the last war of aliens who had entered the country but had not left or been accounted for in other ways such as death or naturalisation at the outbreak of war they had all gone before tribunals that classified them in three groups at first only a class aliens were interned but by july of after some scaremongering by fleet street the b and c classes were taken out of circulation there was a small number of immigrants who could not be located and it was a fair amgumption that some of them were spies their papers were in bloggs file the second source was wireless transmissions section c of mi patrolled the airwaves nightly recorded everything they did not know for certain to be theirs and passed it to the government code and cipher school this outfit which had recently been moved from londons berkeley street to a country house at bletchley park was not a school at all but a collection of chess champions musicians mathematicians and crossword puzzle enthusiasts dedicated to the belief that if a man could invent a code a man could crack it signals originating in the british isles that could not be accounted for by any of the services were assumed to be messages from spies the decoded messages were in bloggs file finally there were the double agents but their value was largely hopedfor rather than actual messages to them from the abwehr had warned of several incoming agents and had given away one resident spymrs matilda krafft of bournemouth who had sent money to snow by post and was subsequently incarcerated in holloway prison but the doubles had not been able to reveal the identity or locations of the kind of quietly effective professional spies most valuable to a secret intelligence service no one doubted that there were such people there were clues someone for example had brought snows transmitter over from germany and deposited it in the cloakroom at victoria station for him to collect but either the abwehr or the spies themselves were too cautious to be caught by the doubles however the clues were in bloggs file other sources were being developed the experts were working to improve methods of triangulation the directional pinpointing of radio transmitters and mi were trying to rebuild the networks of agents in europe that had sunk beneath the tidal wave of hitlers armies what little information there was was in bloggs file it can be infuriating at times he told godliman look at this he took from the file a long radio intercept about british plans for an expeditionary force for finland this was picked up early in the year the information is impeccable they were trying to get a fix on him when he broke off in the middle for no apparent reason perhaps he was interrupted he resumed a few minutes later but he was off the air again before our people had a chance to plug in godliman said whats this regards to willi now thats important said bloggs he was getting enthusiastic heres a scrap of another message quite recent look regards to willi this time there was a reply hes addressed as die nadel the needle this ones a pro look at his message terse economical but detailed and completely unambiguous godliman studied the fragment of the second message it appears to be about the effects of the bombing hes obviously toured the east end a pro a pro what else do we know about die nadel bloggs expression of youthful eagerness collapsed thats it im afraid his code name is die nadel he signs off regards to willi and he has good information and thats it fraid so godliman sat on the edge of the desk and stared out of the window on the wall of the opposite building underneath an ornate window sill he could see the nest of a housemarten on that basis what chance have we of catching him bloggs shrugged on that basis none at all it is for places like this that the word bleak has been invented the island is a jshaped lump of rock rising sullenly out of the north sea it lies on the map like the top half of a broken cane parallel with the equator but a long long way north its curved handle toward aberdeen its broken jagged stump pointing threateningly at distant denmark it is ten miles long around most of its coast the cliffs rise out of the cold sea without the courtesy of a beach angered by this rudeness the waves pound on the rock in impotent rage a tenthousandyear fit of bad temper that the island ignores with impunity in the cup of the j the sea is calmer there it has provided itself with a more pleasant reception its tides have thrown into that cup so much sand and seaweed driftwood and pebbles and seashells that there is now between the foot of the cliff and the waters edge a crescent of something closely resembling dry land a moreorless beach each summer the vegetation at the top of the cliff drops a handful of seeds on to the beach the way a rich man throws loose change to beggars if the winter is mild and the spring comes early a few of the seeds take feeble root but they are never healthy enough to flower themselves and spread their own seeds so the beach exists from year to year on handouts on the land itself the proper land held out of the seas reach by the cliffs green things do grow and multiply the vegetation is mostly coarse grass only just good enough to nourish the few bony sheep but tough enough to bind the topsoil to the islands bedrock there are some bushes all thorny that provide homes for rabbits and a brave stand of conifers on the leeward slope of the dip at the eastern end the higher land is ruled by heather every few years the manyes there is a man heresets fire to the heather and then the grass will grow and the sheep can graze here too but after a couple of years the heather comes back god knows from where and drives the sheep away until the man burns it again the rabbits are here because they were born here the sheep are here because they were brought here and the man is here to look after the sheep but the birds are here because they like it there are hundreds of thousands of them longlegged rock pipits whistling peep peep peep as they soar and pepepepe as they dive like a spitfire coming at a messerschmidt out of the sun coracrakes which the man rarely sees but he knows they are there because their bark keeps him awake at night ravens and carrion crows and kittiwakes and countless gulls and a pair of golden eagles that the man shoots at when he sees them for he knowsregardless of what naturalists and experts from edinburgh may tell himthat they do prey on live lambs and not just the carcasses of those already dead the islands most constant visitor is the wind it comes mostly from the northeast from really cold places where there are fjords and glaciers and icebergs often bringing with it unwelcome gifts of snow and driving rain and cold cold mist sometimes arriving emptyhanded just to howl and whoop and raise hell tearing up bushes and bending trees and whipping the intemperate ocean into fresh paroxysms of foamflecked rage it is tireless this wind and that is its mistake if it came occasionally it could take the island by surprise and do some real damage but because it is almost always here the island has learned to live with it the plants put down deep roots and the rabbits hide far inside the thickets and the trees grow up with their backs readybent for the flogging and the birds nest on sheltered ledges and the mans house is sturdy and squat built with a craftsmanship that knows this old wind this house is made of big grey stones and grey slate the colour of the sea it has small windows and closefitting doors and a chimney in its pipe end it stands at the top of the hill at the eastern end of the island close to the splintered stub of the broken walkingstick it crowns the hill defying the wind and the rain not out of bravado but so that the man can see the sheep there is another house very similar ten miles away at the opposite end of the island near the moreorless beach but nobody lives there there was once another man he thought he knew better than the island he thought he could grow oats and potatoes and keep a few cows he battled for three years with the wind and the cold and the soil before he admitted he was wrong when he had gone nobody wanted his home this is a hard place only hard things survive here hard rock coarse grass tough sheep savage birds sturdy houses and strong men it is for places like this that the word bleak has been invented its called storm island said alfred rose i think youre going to like it david and lucy rose sat in the prow of the fishing boat and looked across the choppy water it was a fine november day cold and breezy yet clear and dry a weak sun sparkled off the wavelets i bought it in papa rose continued when we thought there was going to be a revolution and wed need somewhere to hide from the working class its just the place for a convalescence lucy thought he was being suspiciously hearty but she had to admit it looked lovely all windblown and natural and fresh and it made sense this move they had to get away from their parents and make a new start at being married and there was no point in moving to a city to be bombed not when neither of them was really well enough to help and then davids father had revealed that he owned an island off the coast of scotland and it seemed too good to be true i own the sheep too papa rose said shearers come over from the mainland each spring and the wool brings in just about enough money to pay tom mcavitys wages old toms the shepherd how old is he lucy asked good lord he must be oh seventy i suppose hes eccentric the boat turned into the bay and lucy could see two small figures on the jetty a man and a dog eccentric no more than youd be if youd lived alone for twenty years he talks to his dog lucy turned to the skipper of the small boat how often do you call once a fortnight missus i bring toms shopping which isna much and his mail which is even less you just give me your list every other monday and if it can be bought in aberdeen ill bring it he cut the motor and threw a rope to tom the dog barked and ran around in circles beside himself with excitement lucy put one foot on the gunwale and sprang out on to the jetty tom shook her hand he had a face of leather and a huge pipe with a lid he was shorter than she but wide and he looked ridiculously healthy he wore the hairiest tweed jacket she had ever seen with a knitted sweater that must have been made by an elderly sister somewhere plus a checked cap and army boots his nose was huge red and veined pleased to meet you he said politely as if she was his ninth visitor today instead of the first human face he had seen in fourteen days here yare tom said the skipper he handed two cardboard boxes out of the boat no eggs this time but theres a letter from devon itll be from ma niece lucy thought that explains the sweater david was still in the boat the skipper stood behind him and said are you ready tom and papa rose leaned into the boat to assist and the three of them lifted david in his wheelchair on to the jetty if i dont go now ill have to wait a fortnight for the next bus papa rose said with a smile the house has been done up quite nicely youll see all your stuff is in there tom will show you where everything is he kissed lucy squeezed davids shoulder and shook toms hand have a few months of rest and togetherness get completely fit then come back there are important war jobs for both of you they would not be going back lucy knew not before the end of the war but she had not told anyone about that yet papa got back into the boat it wheeled away in a tight circle lucy waved until it disappeared around the headland tom pushed the wheelchair so lucy took his groceries between the landward end of the jetty and the clifftop was a long steep narrow ramp rising high above the beach like a bridge lucy would have had trouble getting the wheelchair to the top but tom managed without apparent exertion the cottage was perfect it was small and grey and sheltered from the wind by a little rise in the ground all the woodwork was freshly painted and a wild rose bush grew beside the doorstep curls of smoke rose from the chimney to be whipped away by the breeze the tiny windows looked over the bay lucy said i love it the interior had been cleaned and aired and painted and there were thick rugs on the stone floors it had four rooms downstairs a modernised kitchen and a living room with a stone fireplace upstairs two bedrooms one end of the house had been carefully remodelled to take modern plumbing with a bathroom above and a kitchen extension below their clothes were in the wardrobes there were towels in the bathroom and food in the kitchen tom said theres something in the barn ive to show you it was a shed not a barn it lay hidden behind the cottage and inside it was a gleaming new jeep mr rose says its been specially adapted for young mr rose to drive tom said its got automatic gears and the throttle and brake are operated by hand thats what he said he seemed to be repeating the words parrotfashion as if he had very little idea of what gears brakes and throttles might be lucy said isnt that super david tophole but where shall i go in it tom said youre always welcome to visit me and share a pipe and a drop of whisky ive been looking forward to having neighbours again thank you said lucy this heres the generator tom said turning around and pointing ive got one just the same you put the fuel in here it delivers alternating current thats unusual small generators are usually direct current david said aye i dont really know the difference but they tell me this is safer true a shock from this would throw you across the room but direct current would kill you they went back to the cottage tom said well youll want to settle in and ive sheep to tend so ill say goodday oh i ought to tell you in an emergency i can contact the mainland by wireless radio david was surprised youve got a radio transmitter aye tom said proudly im an enemy aircraft spotter in the royal observer corps ever spotted any david asked lucy flashed her disapproval of the sarcasm in davids voice but tom seemed not to notice not yet he replied jolly good show when tom had gone lucy said he only wants to do his bit there are lots of us who want to do our bit david said and that lucy reflected was the trouble she dropped the subject and wheeled her crippled husband into their new home when lucy had been asked to visit the hospital psychologist she had immediately assumed that david had brain damage it was not so all thats wrong with his head is a nasty bruise on the left temple the psychologist said she went on however the loss of both his legs is a trauma and theres no telling how it will affect his state of mind did he want very much to be a pilot lucy pondered he was afraid but i think he wanted it very badly all the same well hell need all the reassurance and support that you can give him and patience too one thing we can predict is that he will be resentful and illtempered for a while he needs love and rest however during their first few months on the island he seemed to want neither he did not make love to her perhaps because he was waiting until his injuries were fully healed but he did not rest either he threw himself into the business of sheep farming tearing about the island in his jeep with the wheelchair in the back he built fences along the more treacherous cliffs shot at the eagles helped tom train a new dog when betsy began to go blind and burned off the heather and in the spring he was out every night delivering lambs one day he felled a great old pine tree near toms cottage and spent a fortnight stripping it hewing it into manageable logs and carting them back to the house for firewood he relished really hard manual labour he learned to strap himself tightly to the chair to keep his body anchored while he wielded an axe or a mallet he carved a pair of indian clubs and exercised with them for hours when tom could find nothing more for him to do the muscles of his arms and back became neargrotesque like those of men who win bodybuilding contests lucy was not unhappy she had been afraid he might sit by the fire all day and brood over his bad luck the way he worked was faintly worrying because it was so obsessive but at least he was not vegetating she told him about the baby at christmas in the morning she gave him a gasolinedriven saw and he gave her a bolt of silk tom came over for dinner and they ate a wild goose he had shot david drove the shepherd home after tea and when he came back lucy opened a bottle of brandy then she said i have another present for you but you cant open it until may he laughed what on earth are you talking about how much of that brandy did you drink while i was out im having a baby he stared at her and all the laughter went out of his face good god thats all we bloody well need david well for gods sake when the hell did it happen thats not too difficult to figure out is it she said it must have been a week before the wedding its a miracle it survived the crash have you seen a doctor huh when so how do you know for sure oh david dont be so boring i know for sure because my periods have stopped and my nipples hurt and i throw up in the mornings and my waist is four inches bigger than it used to be if you ever looked at me you would know for sure all right whats the matter with you youre supposed to be thrilled oh sure perhaps well have a son and then i can take him for walks and play football with him and hell grow up wanting to be like his father the war hero a legless fucking joker oh david david she whispered she knelt in front of his wheelchair david dont think like that he will respect you hell look up to you because you put your life together again and because you can do the work of two men from your wheelchair and because you carried your disability with courage and cheerfulness and dont be so damned condescending he snapped you sound like a sanctimonious priest she stood up well dont act as if its my fault men can take precautions too you know not against invisible trucks in the blackout it was a silly exchange and they both knew it so lucy said nothing the whole idea of christmas seemed utterly trite now the bits of coloured paper on the walls and the tree in the corner and the remains of a goose in the kitchen waiting to be thrown away none of it had anything to do with her life she began to wonder what she was doing on this bleak island with a man who seemed not to love her having a baby he didnt want why shouldnt she why not well she could then she realised she had nowhere else to go nothing else to do with her life nobody else to be other than mrs david rose eventually david said well im going to bed he wheeled himself to the hall and dragged himself out of the chair and up the stairs backwards she heard him scrape across the floor heard the bed creak as he hauled himself on to it heard his clothes hit the corner of the room as he undressed then heard the final groaning of the springs as he lay down and pulled the blankets up over him and still she would not cry she looked at the brandy bottle and thought if i drink all of this now and have a bath perhaps i wont be pregnant in the morning she thought about it for a long time until she came to the conclusion that life without david and the island and the baby would be even worse because it would be empty so she did not cry and she did not drink the brandy and she did not leave the island but instead she went upstairs and got into bed and lay awake beside her sleeping husband listening to the wind and trying not to think until the gulls began to call and a grey rainy dawn crept over the north sea and filled the little bedroom with a cold pale light and at last she went to sleep a kind of peace settled over her in the spring as if all threats were postponed until after the baby was born when the february snow had thawed she planted flowers and vegetables in the patch of ground between the kitchen door and the barn not really believing they would grow she cleaned the house thoroughly and told david that if he wanted it done again before august he would have to do it himself she wrote to her mother and did a lot of knitting and ordered nappies by mail they suggested she go home to have the baby but she knew was afraid that if she went she would never come back she went for long walks over the moors with a bird book under her arm until her weight became too much for her to carry very far she kept the bottle of brandy in a cupboard david never used and whenever she felt depressed she went to look at it and remind herself of what she had almost lost three weeks before the baby was due she got the boat into aberdeen david and tom waved from the jetty the sea was so rough that both she and the skipper were terrified she might give birth before they reached the mainland she went into the hospital in aberdeen and four weeks later brought the baby home on the same boat david knew none of it he probably thought that women gave birth as easily as ewes she decided he was oblivious to the pain of contractions and that awful impossible stretching and the soreness afterward and the bossy knowitall nurses who didnt want you to touch your baby because you werent brisk and efficient and trained and sterile like they were he just saw you go away pregnant and come back with a beautiful whitewrapped healthy baby boy and said well call him jonathan they added alfred for davids father and malcolm for lucys and thomas for old tom but they called the boy jo because he was too tiny for jonathan let alone jonathan alfred malcolm thomas rose david learned to give him his bottle and burp him and change his nappy and he even dandled him in his lap occasionally but his interest seemed distant uninvolved he had a problemsolving approach like the nurses it was not for him as it was for lucy tom was closer to the baby than david lucy would not let him smoke in the room where the baby was and the old boy would put his great briar pipe with the lid in his pocket for hours and gurgle at little jo or watch him kick his feet or help lucy bathe him lucy suggested mildly that he might be neglecting the sheep tom said they did not need him to watch them feed he would rather watch jo feed he carved a rattle out of driftwood and filled it with small round pebbles and was overjoyed when jo grabbed it and shook it first time without having to be shown how david and lucy still did not make love first there had been his injuries and then she had been pregnant and then she had been recovering from childbirth but now the reasons had run out one night she said im back to normal now how do you mean after the baby my body is normal ive healed oh i see thats good she made sure to go to bed with him so that he could watch her undress but he always turned his back as they lay there dozing off she would move so that her hand or her thigh or her breast brushed against him a casual but unmistakable invitation there was no response she believed firmly that there was nothing wrong with her she wasnt a nymphomaniac she didnt simply want sex she wanted sex with david she was sure that even if there had been another man under seventy on the island she would not have been tempted she wasnt a sexstarved tart she was a lovestarved wife the crunch came on one of those nights when they lay on their backs side by side both wide awake listening to the wind outside and the small sounds of jo from the next room it seemed to lucy that it was time he either did it or came right out and said why not and that he was going to avoid the issue until she forced it and that she might as well force it now so she brushed her arm across his thighs and opened her mouth to speak and almost cried out with shock to discover that he had an erection so he could do it and he wanted to or why else and her hand closed triumphantly around the evidence of his desire and she shifted closer to him and sighed david he said oh for gods sake and gripped her wrist and pushed her hand away from him and turned onto his side but this time she was not going to accept his rebuff in modest silence david why not jesus christl he threw the blankets off swung himself to the floor grabbed the eiderdown with one hand and dragged himself to the door lucy sat up in bed and screamed at him why not jo began to cry david pulled up the empty legs of his cutoff pyjama trousers pointed to the pursed white skin of his stumps and said thats why not thats why not he slithered downstairs to sleep on the sofa and lucy went into the next bedroom to comfort jo it took a long time to lull him back to sleep probably because she herself was so much in need of comfort the baby tasted the tears on her cheeks and she wondered if he had any inkling of their meaning wouldnt tears be one of the first things a baby came to understand she could not bring herself to sing to him or murmur that everything was all right so she held him tight and rocked him and when he had soothed her with his warmth and his clinging he went to sleep in her arms she put him back in the cot and stood looking at him for a while there was no point in going back to bed she could hear davids deepsleep snoring from the living room he had to take powerful pills otherwise the old pain kept him awake lucy needed to get away from him where she could neither see nor hear him where he couldnt find her for a few hours even if he wanted to she put on trousers and sweater a heavy coat and boots and crept downstairs and out there was a swirling mist damp and bitterly cold the kind the island specialised in she pulled up the collar of her coat thought about going back inside for a scarf and decided not to she squelched along the muddy path welcoming the bite of the fog in her throat the small discomfort of the weather taking her mind off the larger hurt inside her she reached the cliff top and walked gingerly down the steep narrow ramp placing her feet carefully on the slippery boards at the bottom she jumped off on to the sand and walked to the edge of the sea the wind and the water were carrying on their perpetual quarrel the wind swooping down to tease the waves and the sea hissing and spitting as it crashed against the land the two of them doomed to bicker forever lucy walked along the hard sand letting the noise and the weather fill her head until the beach ended in a sharp point where the water met the cliff when she turned and walked back she paced the shore all night toward dawn a thought came to her unbidden it is his way of being strong as it was the thought was not much help holding its meaning in a tightly clenched fist but she worked on it for a while and the fist opened to reveal what looked like a small pearl of wisdom nestling in its palm perhaps davids coldness to her was of one piece with his chopping down trees and undressing himself and driving the jeep and throwing the indian clubs and coming to live on a cold cruel island in the north sea what was it he had said his father the war hero a legless joke he had something to prove something that would sound trite if it were put into words something he could have done as a fighter pilot but now had to do with trees and fences and indian clubs and a wheelchair they wouldnt let him take the test and he wanted to be able to say i could have passed it anyway just look how i can suffer it was cruelly screamingly unjust he had had the courage and he had suffered the wounds but he could take no pride in it if a messerschmidt had taken his legs the wheelchair would have been like a medal a badge of courage but now all his life he would have to say it was during the war but no i never saw any action this was a car crash i did my training and i was going to fight the very next day i had seen my kite she was a beauty and yes it was his way of being strong and perhaps she could be strong too she might find ways of patching up the wreck of her life david had once been good and kind and loving and she might now learn to wait patiently while he battled to become the complete man he used to be she could find new hopes new things to live for other women had found the strength to cope with bereavement and bombedout houses and husbands in prisonerofwar camps she picked up a pebble drew back her arm and threw it out to sea with all her might she did not see or hear it land it might have gone on forever circling the earth like a satellite in a space story she shouted i can be strong too damn it and then she turned around and started up the ramp to the cottage it was almost time for jos first feed it looked like a mansion and up to a point that was what it was a large house in its own grounds in the leafy town of wohldorf just outside north hamburg it might have been the home of a mine owner or a successful importer or an industrialist however it was in fact owned by the abwehr it owed its fate to the weathernot here but two hundred miles southeast in berlin where atmospheric conditions were unsuitable for wireless communication with england it was a mansion only down to ground level below that were two huge concrete shelters and several million reichsmarks worth of radio equipment the electronics system had been put together by a major werner trautmann and he did a good job each hall had twenty neat little soundproof listening posts occupied by radio operators who could recognise a spy by the way he tapped out his message as easily as you can recognise your mothers handwriting on an envelope the receiving equipment was built with quality in mind for the transmitters sending the messages had been designed for compactness rather than power most of them were the small suitcasesets called klamotten which had been developed by telefunken for admiral wilhelm canaris the head of the abwehr on this night the airways were relatively quiet so everyone knew when die nadel came through the message was taken by one of the older operators he tapped an acknowledgment transcribed the signal quickly tore the sheet off his note pad and went to the phone he read the message over the direct line to abwshr headquarters at sophien terrasse in hamburg then came back to his booth for a smoke he offered a cigarette to the youngster in the next booth and the two of them stood together for a few minutes leaning against the wall and smoking the youngster said anything the older man shrugged theres always something when he calls but not much this time the luftwaffe missed st pauls cathedral again no reply for him we dont think he waits for replies hes an independent bastardalways was i trained him in wireless you know and once id finished he thought he knew it better than me youve met die nadel whats he like about as much fun as a dead fish all the same hes the best agent weve got some say the best ever theres a story that he spent five years working his way up in the nkvd in russia and ended up one of stalins most trusted aides i dont know whether its true but its the kind of thing hed do a real pro and the fuehrer knows it hitler knows him the older man nodded at one time he wanted to see all die nadels signals i dont know if he still does not that it would make any difference to die nadel nothing impresses that man you know something he looks at everybody the same wayas if hes figuring out how hell kill you if you make a wrong move im glad i didnt have to train him he learned quickly ill give him that worked at it twentyfour hours a day then when hed mastered it he wouldnt give me a goodmorning it takes him all his time to remember to salute canaris he always signs off regards to willi thats how much he cares about rank they finished their cigarettes dropped them on the floor and trod them out then the older man picked up the stubs and pocketed them because smoking was not really permitted in the dugout the radios were still quiet yes he wont use his code name the older man went on von braun gave it to him and hes never liked it hes never liked von braun either do you remember the timeno it was before you joined us braun told nadel to go to the airfield in farnborough kent the message came back there is no airfield in farnborough kent there is one at farnborough hampshire fortunately the luftwaffes geography is better than yours you cunt just like that i suppose its understandable when we make mistakes we put their lives on the line the older man frowned he was the one who delivered such judgments and he did not like his audience to weigh in with opinions of its own perhaps he said grudgingly but why doesnt he like his code name he says it has a meaning and a code word with a meaning can give a man away von braun wouldnt listen a meaning the needle what does it mean but at that moment the oldtimers radio chirped and he returned quickly to his station so the explanation never came part two the message annoyed faber because it forced him to face issues that he had been avoiding hamburg had made damn sure the message reached him he had given his callsign and instead of the usual acknowledge proceed they had sent back make rendezvous one he acknowledged the order transmitted his report and packed the wireless set back into its suitcase then he wheeled his bicycle out of brith marsheshis cover was a birdwatcherand got on the road to blackheath as he cycled back to his cramped tworoom flat he wondered whether to obey the order he had two reasons for disobedience one professional one personal the professional reason was that rendezvous one was an old code set up by canaris back in it meant he was to go to the doorway of a certain shop between leicester square and piccadilly circus to meet another agent the agents would recognise each other by the fact that they both carried a bible then there was a patter what is todays chapter one kings thirteen then if they were certain they were not being followed they would agree that the chapter was most inspiring otherwise one would say im afraid i havent read it yet the shop doorway might not be there any more but it was not that that troubled faber he thought canaris had probably given the code to most of the bumbling amateurs who had crossed the channel in and landed in the arms of mi faber knew they had been caught because the hangings had been publicised no doubt to reassure the public that something was being done about fifth columnists they would certainly have given away secrets before they died so the british now probably knew the old rendezvous code if they had picked up the message from hamburg that shop doorway must by now be swarming with wellspoken young englishmen carrying bibles and practising saying most inspiring in a german accent the abwehr had thrown professionalism to the wind back in those heady days when the invasion seemed so close faber had not trusted hamburg since he would not tell them where he lived he refused to communicate with their other agents in britain he varied the frequency he used for transmission without caring whether he stepped all over someone elses signal if he had always obeyed his masters he would not have survived so long at woolwich faber was joined by a mass of other cyclists many of them women as the workers came streaming out of the munitions factory at the end of the day shift their cheerful weariness reminded faber of his personal reason for disobedience he thought his side was losing the war they certainly were not winning the russians and the americans had joined in africa was lost the italians had collapsed the allies would surely invade france this year faber did not want to risk his life to no purpose he arrived home and put his bicycle away while he was washing his face it dawned on him that against all logic he wanted to make the rendezvous it was a foolish risk taken in a lost cause but he was itching to get to it and the simple reason was that he was unspeakably bored the routine transmissions the birdwatching the bicycle the boarding house teas it was four years since he had experienced anything remotely like action he seemed to be in no danger whatsoever and that made him jumpy because he imagined invisible threats he was happiest when every so often he could identify a threat and take steps to neutralise it yes he would make the rendezvous but not in the way they expected there were still crowds in the west end of london despite the war faber wondered whether it was the same in berlin he bought a bible at hatchards bookshop in piccadilly and stuffed it into his inside coat pocket out of sight it was a mild damp day with intermittent drizzle and faber was carrying an umbrella this rendezvous was timed for either between nine and ten oclock in the morning or between five and six in the afternoon and the arrangement was that one went there every day until the other party turned up if no contact was made for five successive days one went there on alternate days for two weeks after that one gave up faber got to leicester square at ten past nine the contact was there in the tobacconists doorway with a blackbound bible under his arm pretending to shelter from the rain faber spotted him out of the corner of his eye and hurried past head down the man was youngish with a blond moustache and a wellfed look he wore a black doublebreasted raincoat and he was reading the daily express and chewing gum he was not familiar when faber walked by the second time on the opposite side of the street he spotted the tail a short stocky man wearing the trenchcoat and trilby hat beloved of english plainclothes policemen was standing just inside the foyer of an office building looking through the glass doors across the street to the man in the doorway there were two possibilities if the agent did not know he had been followed faber had only to get him away from the rendezvous and lose the tail however the alternative was that the agent had been captured and the man in the doorway was a substitute in which case neither he nor the tail must be allowed to see fabers face faber assumed the worst then thought of a way to deal with it there was a telephone booth in the square faber went inside and memorised the number then he found i kings in the bible tore out the page and scribbled in the margin go to the phone booth in the square he walked around the back streets behind the national gallery until he found a small boy aged about ten or eleven sitting on a doorstep throwing stones at puddles faber said do you know the tobacconist in the square yerst do you like chewing gum yerst faber gave him a page torn from the bible theres a man in the doorway of the tobacconists if you give him this hell give you some gum all right the boy said he stood up is this geezer a yank yerst faber said the boy ran off faber followed him as the boy approached the agent faber ducked into the doorway of the building opposite the tail was still there peering through the glass faber stood just outside the door blocking the tails view of the scene across the street and opened his umbrella he pretended to be struggling with it he saw the agent give something to the boy and walk off he ended his charade with the umbrella and walked in the direction opposite to the way the agent had gone he looked back over his shoulder to see the tail run into the street looking for the vanished agent faber stopped at the nearest telephone and dialled the number of the booth in the square it took a few minutes to get through at last a deep voice said hello what is todays chapter faber said one kings thirteen most inspiring yes isnt it the fool has no idea of the trouble hes in faber thought aloud he said well i must see you that is impossible but i must there was a note in the voice that faber thought edged on despair the message comes from the very top do you understand faber pretended to waver all right then i will meet you in one weeks time under the arch at euston station at am cant you make it sooner faber hung up and stepped outside walking quickly he rounded two corners and came within sight of the phone booth in the square he saw the agent walking in the direction of piccadilly there was no sign of the tail faber followed the agent the man went into piccadilly circus underground station and bought a ticket to stockwell faber immediately realised he could get there by a more direct route he came out of the station walked quickly to leicester square and got on a northern line train the agent would have to change trains at waterloo whereas fabers train was direct so faber would reach stockwell first or at the worst they would arrive on the same train in fact faber had to wait outside the station at stockwell for twentyfive minutes before the agent emerged faber followed him again he went into a café there was absolutely nowhere nearby where a man could plausibly stand still for any length of time no shop windows to gaze into no benches to sit on or parks to walk around no bus stops or taxi ranks or public buildings faber had to walk up and down the street always looking as if he were going somewhere carrying on until he was just out of sight of the café then returning on the opposite side while the agent sat in the warm steamy café drinking tea and eating hot toast he came out after half an hour faber tailed him through a succession of residential streets the agent knew where he was going but seemed in no hurry he walked like a man who is going home with nothing to do for the rest of the day he did not look back and faber thought another amateur at last he went into a house one of the poor anonymous inconspicuous lodging houses used by spies and errant husbands everywhere it had a dormer window in the roof that would be the agents room high up for better wireless reception faber walked past scanning the opposite side of the street yesthere a movement behind an upstairs window a glimpse of a jacket and tie a watching face withdrawn the opposition was here too the agent must have gone to the rendezvous yesterday and allowed himself to be followed home by mi unless of course he was mi faber turned the corner and walked down the next parallel street counting the houses almost directly behind the place the agent had entered there was the bombdamaged shell of what had been a pair of semidetached houses good as he walked back to the station his step was springier his heart beat a shade faster and he looked around him with brighteyed interest it was good the game was on he dressed in black that night a woollen hat a turtleneck sweater under a short leather flying jacket trousers tucked into socks rubbersoled shoes all black he would be almost invisible for london too was blacked out he cycled through the quiet streets with dimmed lights keeping off main roads it was after midnight and he saw no one he left the bike a quarter of a mile away from his destination padlocking it to the fence in a pub yard he went not to the agents house but to the bombedout shell in the next street he picked his way carefully across the rubble in the front garden entered the gaping doorway and went through the house to the back it was very dark a thick screen of low cloud hid the moon and stars faber had to walk slowly with his hands in front of him he reached the end of the garden jumped over the fence and crossed the next two gardens in one of the houses a dog barked for a moment the garden of the lodging house was unkempt faber walked into a blackberry bush and stumbled the thorns scratched his face he ducked under a line of washingthere was enough light for him to see that he found the kitchen window and took from his pocket a small tool with a scoopshaped blade the putty around the glass was old and brittle and already flaking away in places after twenty minutes silent work he took the pane out of the frame and laid it gently on the grass he shone a flashlight through the empty hole to make sure there were no noisy obstacles in his way opened the catch raised the window and then climbed in the darkened house smelled of boiled fish and disinfectant faber unlocked the back doora precaution for fast exitbefore entering the hall he flashed his pencil light on and off quickly once in that instant of light he took in a tiled hallway a kidney table he must circumvent a row of coats on hooks and a staircase to the right carpeted he climbed the stairs silently he was halfway across the landing to the second flight when he saw the light under the door a splitsecond later there was an asthmatic cough and the sound of a toilet flushing faber reached the door in two strides and froze against the wall light flooded the landing as the door opened faber slipped his stiletto out of his sleeve the old man came out of the toilet and crossed the landing leaving the light on at his bedroom door he grunted turned and came back he must see me faber thought he tightened his grip on the handle of his knife the old mans halfopen eyes were directed to he floor he looked up as he reached for the light cord and faber almost killed him then but the man fumbled for the switch and faber realised he was so sleepy he was practically somnambulating the light died the old man shuffled back to bed and faber breathed again there was only one door at the top of the second flight of stairs faber tried it gently it was locked he took another tool from the pocket of his jacket the noise of the toilet tank filling covered the sound of faber picking the lock he opened the door and listened he could hear deep regular breathing he stepped inside the sound came from the opposite corner of the room he could see nothing he crossed the pitchdark room very slowly feeling the air in front of him at each step until he was beside the bed he had the flashlight in his left hand the stiletto loose in his sleeve and his right hand free he switched on the flashlight and grabbed the sleeping mans throat in a strangling grip the agents eyes snapped open but he could make no sound faber straddled the bed and sat on him then he whispered one kings thirteen and relaxed his grip the agent peered into the flashlight trying to see fabers face he rubbed his neck where fabers hand had squeezed be still faber shone the light into the agents eyes and with his right hand drew the stiletto arent you going to let me get up i prefer you in bed where you can do no more damage damage more damage you were watched in leicester square and you let me follow you here and they are observing this house should i trust you to do anything my god im sorry why did they send you the message had to be delivered personally the orders come from the top the very top the agent stopped well what orders i have to be sure its you how can you be sure i must see your face faber hesitated then shone the flashlight at himself briefly satisfied die nadel and who are you major friedrich kaldor sir i should call you sir oh no sir youve been promoted twice in your absence you are now a lieutenantcolonel have they really nothing better to do in hamburg arent you pleased i should be pleased to go back and put major von braun on latrine duty may i get up sir certainly not what if major kaldor is held in wandsworth jail and you are a substitute waiting to give a signal to your watching friends in the house opposite now what are these orders from the very top well sir we believe there will be an invasion of france this year brilliant brilliant go on they believe that general patton is massing the first united states army group in the part of england known as eeast anglia if that army is the invasion force then it follows that they will attack via the pas de calais that makes sense but i have seen no sign of this army of pattons there is some doubt in the highest circles in berlin the fuehrers astrologer what yes sir he has an astrologer who tells him to defend normandy my god are things that bad there he gets plenty of earthbound advice too i personally believe he uses the astrologer as an excuse when he thinks the generals are wrong but he cant fault their arguments faber sighed he had been afraid of news like this go on your assignment is to assess the strength of fusag numbers of troops artillery air support i know how to measure armies of course he paused i am instructed to emphasise the importance of the mission sir and you have done so tell me are things that bad in berlin the agent hesitated no sir morale is high output of munitions increases every month the people spit at the raf bombers never mind i can get the propaganda from my radio the younger man was silent faber said do you have anything else to tell me officially i mean yes for the duration of the assignment you have a special bolthole they do think its important faber said you rendezvous with a uboat in the north sea ten miles due east of a town called aberdeen just call them in on your normal radio frequency and they will surface as soon as you or i have told hamburg that the orders have been passed from me to you the route will be open the boat will be there every friday and monday at pm and will wait until am aberdeen is a big town do you have an exact map reference yes the agent recited the numbers and faber memorised them is that everything major yes sir what do you plan to do about the gentlemen from mi in the house across the road the agent shrugged ill have to give them the slip faber thought its no good what are your orders after you have seen me do you have a bolthole no i am to go to a town called weymouth and steal a boat to return to france that was no plan at all so faber thought canaris knew how it would be very well and if you are caught by the british and tortured he said i have a suicide pill and you will use it most certainly faber looked at him i think you might he said he placed his left hand on the agents chest and put his weight on it as if he were about to get off the bed that way he was able to feel exactly where the rib cage ended and the soft belly began he thrust the point of the stiletto in just under the ribs and stabbed upward to the heart the agents eyes widened for an instant a noise came to his throat but did not get out his body convulsed faber pushed the stiletto an inch further in the eyes closed and the body went limp you saw my face faber said i think weve lost control of it said percival godliman frederick bloggs nodded agreement and added its my fault the man looked weary godliman thought he had had that look for almost a year ever since the night they had dragged the crushed remains of his wife from underneath the rubble of a bombed house in hoxton im not interested in apportioning blame godliman said the fact is that something happened in leicester square during the few seconds you lost sight of blondie do you think the contact was made possibly when we picked him up again in stockwell i thought he had simply given up for the day if that were the case he would have made the rendezvous again yesterday and today godliman was making patterns with matchsticks on his desk a thinking habit he had developed still no movement at the house nothing hes been in there for fortyeight hours bloggs repeated its my fault dont be a bore old chap godliman said it was my decision to let him run so that he would lead us to someone else and i still think it was the right move bloggs sat motionless his expression blank his hands in the pockets of his raincoat if the contact has been made we shouldnt delay picking blondie up and finding out what his mission was that way we lose whatever chance we have of following blondie to somebody more important your decision godliman had made a church with his matches he stared at it for a moment then took a halfpenny from his pocket and tossed it tails he observed give him another twentyfour hours the landlord was a middleaged irish republican from lisdoonvarna county clare who harboured a secret hope that the germans would win the war and thus free the emerald isle from english oppression forever he limped arthritically around the old house collecting his weekly rents thinking how much he would be worth if those rents were allowed to rise to their true market value he was not a rich man he owned only two houses this and the smaller one in which he lived he was permanently badtempered on the first floor he tapped on the door of the old man this tenant was always pleased to see him he was probably pleased to see anybody he said hello mr riley would you like a cup of tea no time today oh well the old man handed over the money i expect youve seen the kitchen window no i didnt go in there oh well theres a pane of glass out i patched it over with blackout curtain but of course there is a draught who smashed it the landlord asked funny thing it aint broke just lying there on the grass i expect the old putty just gave way ill mend it myself if you can get hold of a bit of putty you old fool the landlord thought aloud he said i dont suppose it occurred to you that you might have been burgled the old man looked astonished i never thought of that nobodys missing any valuables nobodys said so to me the landlord went to the door all right ill have a look when i go down the old man followed him out i dont think the new bloke is in upstairs he said i havent heard a sound for a couple of days the landlord was sniffing has he been cooking in his rooms i wouldnt know mr riley the two of them went up the stairs the old man said hes very quiet if he is in there whatever hes cooking hell have to stop it smells bloody awful the landlord knocked on the door there was no answer he opened it and went in and the old man followed him well well well the old sergeant said heartily i think youve got a dead one he stood in the doorway surveying the room you touched anything paddy no the landlord replied and the names mr riley the policeman ignored this not long dead though ive smelled worse his survey took in the old chest of drawers the suitcase on the low table the faded square of carpet the dirty curtains on the dormer window and the rumpled bed in the corner there were no signs of a struggle he went over to the bed the young mans face was peaceful his hands clasped over his chest id say heart attack if he wasnt so young there was no empty sleepingpill bottle to indicate suicide he picked up the leather wallet on top of the chest and looked through its contents there was an identity card and a ration book and a fairly thick wad of notes papers in order and he aint been robbed hes only been here a week or so the landlord said i dont know much about him at all he came from north wales to work in a factory well the sergeant observed if he was as healthy as he looked hed be in the army he opened the suitcase on the table bloody hell whats this lot the landlord and the old man had edged their way into the room now the landlord said its a radio at the same time as the old man said hes bleeding dont touch that body the sergeant said hes had a knife in the guts the old man persisted the sergeant gingerly lifted one of the dead hands from the chest to reveal a small trickle of dried blood he was bleeding he said wheres the nearest phone five doors down the landlord told him lock this room and stay out until i get back the sergeant left the house and knocked at the door of the neighbour with the phone a woman opened it good morning madam may i use your telephone come in she showed him the phone on a stand in the hall whats happened anything exciting a tenant died in a lodging house just up the road he told her as he dialled murdered she asked wideeyed i leave that to the experts hello superintendent jones please this is canter he looked at the woman might i ask you just to pop in the kitchen while i talk to my governor she went disappointed hello super this bodys got a knife wound and a suitcase radio whats the address again sarge sergeant canter told him yes thats the one theyve been watching this is an mi job sarge go to number and tell the surveillance team there what youve found ill get on to their chief off you go canter thanked the woman and crossed the road he was quite thrilled this was only his second murder in thirtyone years as a metropolitan policeman and it turned out to involve espionage he might make inspector yet he knocked on the door of number it opened and two men stood there sergeant canter said are you the secret agents from mi bloggs arrived at the same time as a special branch man detectiveinspector harris whom he had known in his scotland yard days canter showed them the body they stood still for a moment looking at the peaceful young face with its blond moustache harris said who is he codename blondie bloggs told him we think he came in by parachute a couple of weeks ago we picked up a radio message to another agent arranging a rendezvous we knew the code so we were able to watch the rendezvous we hoped blondie would lead us to the resident agent who would be a much more dangerous specimen so what happened here damned if i know harris looked at the wound in the agents chest stiletto something like that a very neat job under the ribs and straight up into the heart quick would you like to see the method of entry he led them downstairs to the kitchen they looked at the windowframe and the unbroken pane of glass lying on the lawn canter said also the lock on the bedroom door had been picked they sat down at the kitchen table and canter made tea bloggs said it happened the night after i lost him in leicester square i fouled it all up harris said dont be so hard on yourself they drank their tea in silence for a while harris said how are things with you anyway you dont drop in at the yard busy hows christine killed in the bombing harris eyes widened you poor bastard you all right lost my brother in north africa did you ever meet johnny no he was a lad drink youve never seen anything like it spent so much on booze he could never afford to get marriedwhich is just as well the way things turned out most have lost somebody i spose if youre on your own come round our place for dinner on sunday thanks i work sundays now harris nodded well whenever you feel like it a detectiveconstable poked his bead around the door and addressed harris can we start baggingup the evidence guv harris looked at bloggs ive finished bloggs said all right son carry on harris told him bloggs said suppose he made contact after i lost him and arranged for the resident agent to come here the resident may have suspected a trapthat would explain why he came in through the window and picked the lock it makes him a devilish suspicious bastard harris observed that might be why weve never caught him anyway he gets into blondies room and wakes him up now he knows it isnt a trap right right so why does he kill blondie maybe they quarrelled there were no signs of a struggle harris frowned into his empty cup perhaps he realised that blondie was being watched and he was afraid wed pick the boy up and make him spill the beans bloggs said that makes him a ruthless bastard that too might be why weve never caught him come in sit down ive just had a call from mi canaris has been fired bloggs went in sat down and said is that good news or bad very bad said godliman its happened at the worst possible moment do i get told why godliman looked at him intently then said i think you need to know at this moment we have forty double agents broadcasting to hamburg false information about allied plans for the invasion of france bloggs whistled i didnt know it was quite that big i suppose the doubles say were going in at cherbourg but really it will be calais or vice versa something like that apparently i dont need to know the details anyway they havent told me however the whole thing is in danger we knew canaris we knew we had him fooled we felt we could have gone on fooling him a new broom may mistrust his predecessors agents theres more weve had some defections from the other side people who could have betrayed the abwehrs people over here if they hadnt been betrayed already its another reason for the germans to begin to suspect our doubles then theres the possibility of a leak literally thousands of people now know about the doublecross system there are doubles in iceland canada and ceylon we ran a doublecross in the middle east and we made a bad mistake last year by repatriating a german called erich carl we later learned he was an abwehr agenta real oneand that while he was in internment on the isle of man he may have learned about two doubles mutt and jeff and possibly a third called tate so were on thin ice if one decent abwehr agent in britain gets to know about fortitudethats the code name for the deception planthe whole strategy will be endangered not to mince words we could lose the fucking war bloggs suppressed a smile he could remember a time when professor godliman did not know the meaning of such words the professor went on the twenty committee has made it quite clear that they expect me to make sure there arent any decent abwehr agents in britain last week we would have been quite confident that there werent bloggs said now we know theres at least one and we let him slip through our fingers so now we have to find him again i dont know bloggs said gloomily we dont know what part of the country hes operating from we havent the faintest idea what he looks like hes too crafty to be pinpointed by triangulation while hes transmitting otherwise we would have nabbed him long ago we dont even know his code name so where do we start unsolved crimes said godliman look a spy is bound to break the law he forges papers he steals petrol and ammunition he evades checkpoints he enters restricted areas he takes photographs and when people rumble him he kills them the police are bound to get to know of some of these crimes if the spy has been operating for any length of time if we go through the unsolved crimes files since the war well find traces dont you realise that most crimes are unsolved bloggs said incredulously the files would fill the albert hall godliman shrugged so we narrow it down to london and we start with murders they found what they were looking for on the very first day of their search it happened to be godliman who came across it and at first he did not realise its significance it was the file on the murder of a mrs una garden in highgate in her throat had been cut and she had been sexuallv molested although not raped she had been found in the bedroom of her lodger with considerable alcohol in her bloodstream the picture was fairly clear she had had a tryst with the lodger he had wanted to go further than she was prepared to let him they had quarrelled he had killed her and the murder had neutralised his libido but the police had never found the lodger godliman had been about to pass over the filespies did not get involved in sexual assaults but he was a meticulous man with records so he read every word and consequently discovered that the unfortunate mrs garden had received stiletto wounds in her back as well as the fatal wound to her throat godliman and bloggs were on opposite sides of a wooden table in the records room at old scotland yard godliman tossed the file across the table and said i think this is it bloggs glanced through it and said the stiletto they signed for the file and walked the short distance to the war office when they returned to godlimans room there was a decoded signal on his desk he read it casually then thumped the table in excitement its him bloggs read orders received regards to willi remember him godliman said die nadel yes bloggs said hesitantly the needle but theres not much information here think think a stiletto is like a needle its the same man the murder of mrs garden all those signals in that we couldnt trace the rendezvous with blondie possibly bloggs looked thoughtful i can prove it godliman said remember the transmission about finland that you showed me the first day i came here the one that was interrupted yes bloggs went to the file to find it if my memory serves me well the date of that transmission is the same as the date of this murder and ill bet the time of death coincides with the interruption bloggs looked at the signal in the file right both times there hes been operating in london for at least five years and its taken us until now to get on to him bloggs reflected he wont be easy to catch godliman suddenly looked wolfish he may be clever but hes not as clever as me he said tightly i am going to nail him to the fucking wall bloggs laughed out loud my god youve changed professor godliman said do you realise thats the first time youve laughed for a year the supply boat rounded the headland and chugged into the bay at storm island under a blue sky there were two women in it one was the skippers wifehe had been called up and now she ran the businessand the other was lucys mother mother got out of the boat wearing a utility suit a mannish jacket and an abovetheknee skirt lucy hugged her mightily mother what a surprise but i wrote to you the letter was with the mail on the boat mother had forgotten that the post only came once a fortnight on storm island is this my grandson isnt he a big boy little jo almost three years old turned bashful and hid behind lucys skirt he was darkhaired pretty and tall for his age mother said isnt he like his father yes lucy said you must be freezing come up to the house where did you get that skirt they picked up the groceries and began to walk up the ramp to the cliff top mother chattered as they went its the fashion dear it saves on material but it isnt as cold as this on the mainland such a wind i suppose its all right to leave my case on the jettynobody to steal it jane is engaged to an american soldiera white one thank god he comes from a place called milwaukee and he doesnt chew gum isnt that nice ive only got four more daughters to marry off now your father is a captain in the home guard did i tell you hes up half the night patrolling the common waiting for german parachutists uncle stephens warehouse was bombedi dont know what hell do its an act of war or something dont rush mother youve got fourteen days to tell me the news lucy laughed they reached the cottage mother said isnt this lovely they went in i think this is just lovely lucy parked mother at the kitchen table and made tea tom will get your case up hell be here for his lunch shortly the shepherd yes does he find things for david to do then lucy laughed its the other way round im sure hell tell you all about it himself you havent told me why youre here my dear its about time i saw you i know youre not supposed to make unnecessary journeys but once in four years isnt extravagant is it they heard the jeep outside and a moment later david wheeled himself in he kissed his motherinlaw and introduced tom lucy said tom you can earn your lunch today by bringing mothers case up as she carried your groceries david was warming his hands at the stove its raw today youre really taking sheepfarming seriously then mother said the flock is double what it was three years ago david told her my father never farmed this island seriously ive fenced miles of the cliff top improved the grazing and introduced modern breeding methods not only do we have more sheep but each animal gives us more meat and wool mother said tentatively i suppose tom does the physical work and you give the orders david laughed equal partners mother they had hearts for lunch and both men ate mountains of potatoes mother commented favourably on jos table manners afterwards david lit a cigarette and tom stuffed his pipe mother said what i really want to know is when youre going to give us more grandchildren she smiled brightly there was a long silence well i think its wonderful the way david copes said mother lucy said yes they were walking along the cliff top the wind had dropped on the third day of mothers visit and it was mild enough to go out they took jo dressed in a fishermans sweater and a fur coat they had stopped at the top of a rise to watch david tom and the dog herding sheep lucy could see in mothers face an internal struggle between concern and discretion she decided to save her mother the effort of asking he doesnt love me she said mother looked quickly to make sure jo was out of earshot im sure its not that bad dear different men show their love in diff mother we havent been man and wife properly since we were married but she indicated jo with a nod that was a week before the wedding oh oh dear is it you know the accident yes but not in the way you mean its nothing physical he just wont lucy was crying quietly the tears trickling down her windbrowned cheeks have you talked about it ive tried perhaps with time its been almost four years there was a pause they began to walk on across the heather into the weak afternoon sun jo chased gulls mother said i almost left your father once it was lucys turn to be shocked when it was soon after jane was born we werent so welloff in those days you know father was still working for his father and there was a slump i was expecting for the third time in three years and it seemed that a life of having babies and making ends meet stretched out in front of me with nothing to relieve the monotony then i discovered he was seeing an old flame of hisbrenda simmonds you never knew her she went to basingstoke suddenly i asked myself what i was doing it for and i couldnt think of a sensible answer lucy had dim patchy memories of those days her grandfather with a white moustache her father in a more slender edition extended family meals in the great farmhouse kitchen a lot of laughter and sunshine and animals even then her parents marriage had seemed to represent solid contentment happy permanence she said why didnt you leave i mean oh people just didnt in those days there wasnt all this divorce and a woman couldnt get a job women work at all sorts of things now they did in the last war but everything changed afterward with a bit of unemployment i expect it will be the same this time men get their way you know generally speaking and youre glad you stayed it was not a question people my age shouldnt make pronouncements about life but my life has been a matter of makingdo and the same goes for most of the women i know steadfastness always looks like a sacrifice but usually it isnt anyway im not going to give you advice you wouldnt take it and if you did youd blame your problems on me i expect oh mother lucy smiled mother said shall we turn around i think weve gone far enough for one day in the kitchen one evening lucy said to david id like mother to stay another two weeks if she will mother was upstairs putting jo to bed telling him a story isnt a fortnight long enough for you to dissect my personality david said dont be silly david he wheeled himself over to her chair are you telling me you dont talk about me of course we talk about youyoure my husband what do you say to her why are you so worried lucy said not without malice what are you so ashamed of damn you ive nothing to be ashamed of no one wants his personal life talked about by a pair of gossiping women we dont gossip about you what do you say arent you touchy answer my question i say i want to leave you and she tries to talk me out of it he spun round and wheeled away tell her not to bother for my sake she called do you mean that he stopped i dont need anybody do you understand i can manage alone and what about me she said quietly perhaps i need somebody what for to love me mother came in and sensed the atmosphere hes fast asleep she said dropped off before cinderella got to the ball i think ill pack a few things not to leave it all until tomorrow she went out again do you think it will ever change david lucy asked i dont know what you mean will we ever be the way we were before the wedding my legs wont grow back if thats what you mean oh god dont you know that doesnt bother me i just want to be loved david shrugged thats your problem he went out before she started to cry mother did not stay the second fortnight lucy walked with her down to the jetty the next day it was raining hard and they both wore macintoshes they stood in silence waiting for the boat watching the rain pit the sea with tiny craters mother held jo in her arms things will change in time you know she said four years is nothing in a marriage lucy said i dont know but theres not much i can do theres jo and the war and davids condition how can i leave the boat arrived and lucy exchanged her mother for three boxes of groceries and five letters the water was choppy mother sat in the boats tiny cabin they waved her around the headland lucy felt very lonely jo began to cry i dont want gran to go away nor do i said lucy godliman and bloggs walked side by side along the pavement of a bombdamaged london shopping street they were a mismatched pair the stooped birdlike professor with pebblelensed spectacles and a pipe not looking where he was going taking short scurrying steps and the flatfooted youngster blond and purposeful in his detectives raincoat and melodramatic hat a cartoon looking for a caption godliman was saying i think die nadel is wellconnected why the only way he could be so insubordinate with impunity its this regards to willi line it must refer to canaris you think he was pals with canaris hes pals with somebodyperhaps someone more powerful than canaris was i have the feeling this is leading somewhere people who are wellconnected generally make those connexions at school or university or staff college look at that they were outside a shop that had a huge empty space where once there had been a plateglass window a rough sign handpainted and nailed to the windowframe said even more open than usual bloggs laughed i saw one outside a bombed police station be good we are still open its become a minor art form they walked on bloggs said so what if die nadel did go to school with someone high in the wehrmacht people always have their pictures taken at school middleton down in the basement at kensingtonthat house where mi used to be before the warhes got a collection of thousands of photographs of german officers school photos binges in the mess passingout parades shaking hands with adolf newspaper pictures everything i see bloggs said so if youre right and die nadel has been through germanys equivalent of eton and sandhurst weve probably got a picture of him almost certainly spies are notoriously camerashy but they dont become spies in school it will be a youthful die nadel that well find in middletons files they skirted a huge crater outside a barbers the shop was intact but the traditional redandwhitestriped pole lay in shards on the pavement the sign in the window said weve had a close shavecome and get one yourself how will we recognise him no one has ever seen him bloggs said yes they have at mrs gardens boarding house in highgate they know him quite well the victorian house stood on a hill overlooking london it was built of red brick and bloggs thought it looked angry at the damage hitler was doing to its city it was high up a good place from which to broadcast die nadel would have lived on the top floor bloggs wondered what secrets he had transmitted to hamburg from this place in the dark days of map references for aircraft factories and steelworks details of coastal defences political gossip gas masks and anderson shelters and sandbags british morale bomb damage reports well done boys you got christine bloggs at last shut up the door was opened by an elderly man in a black jacket and striped trousers good morning im inspector bloggs from scotland yard id like a word with the householder please bloggs saw fear come to the mans eyes then a young woman appeared in the doorway behind him and said come in please the tiled hall smelled of wax polish bloggs hung his hat and coat on a stand the old man disappeared into the depths of the house and the woman led bloggs into a lounge it was expensively furnished in a rich oldfashioned way there were bottles of whisky gin and sherry on a trolley all the bottles were unopened the woman sat on a floral armchair and crossed her legs why is the old man frightened of the police bloggs said my fatherinlaw is a german jew he came here in to escape hitler and in you put him in a concentration camp his wife killed herself at the prospect he has just been released from the isle of man he had a letter from the king apologising for the inconvenience to which he had been put bloggs said we dont have concentration camps we invented them in south africa didnt you know we go on about our history but we forget bits were so good at blinding ourselves to unpleasant facts perhaps its just as well what in we blinded ourselves to the unpleasant fact that we alone couldnt win a war with germany and look what happened thats what my fatherinlaw says hes not as cynical as i what can we do to assist scotland yard bloggs had been enjoying the debate and now it was with reluctance that he turned his attention to work its about a murder that took place here four years ago so long some new evidence may have come to light i know about it of course the previous owner was killed by a tenant my husband bought the house from her executorshe had no heirs i want to trace the other people who were tenants at that time yes the womans hostility had gone now and her intelligent face showed the effort of recollection when we arrived there were three who had been here before the murder a retired naval officer a salesman and a young boy from yorkshire the boy joined the army he still writes to us the salesman was called up and he died at sea i know because two of his five wives got in touch with us and the commander is still here still here that was a piece of luck id like to see him please surely she stood up hes aged a lot ill take you to his room they went up the carpeted stairs to the first floor she said while youre talking to him ill look up the last letter from the boy in the army she knocked on the door it was more than bloggs landlady would have done he thought wryly a voice called its open and bloggs went in the commander sat in a chair by the window with a blanket over his knees he wore a blazer a collar and a tie and spectacles his hair was thin his moustache grey his skin loose and wrinkled over a face that might once have been strong the room was the home of a man living on memories there were paintings of sailing ships a sextant and a telescope and a photograph of himself as a boy aboard hms winchester look at this he said without turning round tell me why that chap isnt in the navy bloggs crossed to the window a horsedrawn bakers van was at the curb outside the house the elderly horse dipping into its nosebag while the deliveries were made that chap was a woman with short blonde hair in trousers she had a magnificent bust bloggs laughed its a woman in trousers he said bless my soul so it is the commander turned around cant tell thee days you know women in trousers bloggs introduced himself weve reopened the case of a murder committed here in i believe you lived here at the same time as the main suspect one henry faber indeed what can i do to help how well do you remember faber perfectly tall chap dark hair wellspoken quiet rather shabby clothes if you were the kind who judges by appearances you might well mistake him i didnt dislike him wouldnt have minded getting to know him better but he didnt want that i suppose he was about your age bloggs suppressed a smilehe was used to people assuming he must be older simply because he was a detective the commander added im sure he didnt do it you know i know a bit about character you cant command a ship without learning and if that man was a sex maniac im hermann goering bloggs suddenly connected the blonde in trousers with the mistake about his age and the conclusion depressed him he said you know you should always ask to see a policemans warrant card the commander was slightly taken aback all right then lets have it bloggs opened his wallet and folded it to display the picture of christine here the commander studied it for a moment then said a very good likeness bloggs sighed the old man was very nearly blind he stood up thats all for now he said thank you any time whatever i can do to help im not much value to england these days youve got to be pretty useless to get invalided out of the home guard you know goodbye bloggs went out the woman was in the hall downstairs she handed bloggs a letter the boys address is a forces box number she said parkins his name no doubt youll be able to find out where he is you knew the commander would be no use bloggs said i suppose not but a visitor makes his day she opened the door on impulse bloggs said will you have dinner with me a shadow crossed her face my husband is still on the isle of man im sorry i thought its all right im flattered i wanted to convince you were not the gestapo i know youre not a woman alone just gets bitter bloggs said i lost my wife in the bombing then you know how it makes you hate yes said bloggs it makes you hate he went down the steps the door closed behind him it had started to rain it had been raining then too bloggs was late home he had been going over some new material with godliman now he was hurrying so that he would have half an hour with christine before she went out to drive her ambulance it was dark and the raid had already started the things christine saw at night were so awful she had stopped talking about them bloggs was proud of her proud the people she worked with said she was better than two men she hurtled through blackedout london driving like a veteran taking corners on two wheels whistling and cracking jokes as the city turned to flame around her fearless they called her bloggs knew better she was terrified but she would not let it show he knew because he saw her eyes in the morning when he got up and she went to bed when her guard was down and it was over for a few hours he knew it was not fearlessness but courage and he was proud it was raining harder when he got off the bus he pulled down his hat and put up his collar in a tobacconists he bought cigarettes for christine she had started smoking recently like a lot of women the shopkeeper would let him have only five because of the shortage he put them in a woolworths bakelite cigarette case a policeman stopped him and asked for his identity card another two minutes wasted an ambulance passed him similar to the one christine drove a requisitioned fruit truck painted grey he began to get nervous as he approached home the explosions were sounding closer and he could hear the aircraft clearly the east end was in for another bruising tonight he would sleep in the morrison shelter there was a big one terribly close and he quickened his step he would eat his supper in the shelter too he turned into his own street saw the ambulances and the fire engines and broke into a run the bomb had landed on his side of the street around the middle it must be close to his own home jesus in heaven not us no there had been a direct hit on the roof and the house was literally flattened he raced up to the crowd of people neighbours and firemen and volunteers is my wife all right is she out is she in there a fireman looked at him nobodys come out of there mate rescuers were picking over the rubble suddenly one of them shouted over here then he said jesus its fearless bloggs frederick dashed to where the man stood christine was underneath a huge chunk of brickwork her face was visible the eyes were closed the rescuer called lifting gear boys sharps the word christine moaned and stirred shes alive bloggs said he knelt down beside her and got his hand under the edge of the lump of rubble the rescuer said you wont shift that son the brickwork lifted god youll kill yourself the rescuer said and bent down to help when it was two feet off the ground they got their shoulders under it the weight was off christine now a third man joined in and a fourth they all straightened up together bloggs said ill lift her out he crawled under the sloping roof of brick and cradled his wife in his arms fuck meits slipping someone shouted bloggs scurried out from under with christine held tightly to his chest as soon as he was clear the rescuers let go of the rubble and jumped away it fell back to earth with a sickening thud and when bloggs realised that that had landed on christine he knew she was going to die he carried her to the ambulance and it took off immediately she opened her eyes again once before she died and said youll have to win the war without me kiddo more than a year later as he walked downhill from highgate into the bowl of london with the rain on his face mingling with the tears again he thought the woman in the spys house had said a mighty truth it makes you hate in war boys become men and men become soldiers and soldiers get promoted and this is why bill parkin aged eighteen late of a boarding house in highgate who should have been an apprentice in his fathers tannery at scarborough was believed by the army to be twentyone promoted to sergeant and given the job of leading his advance squad through a hot dry forest toward a dusty whitewashed italian village the italians had surrendered but the germans had not and it was the germans who were defending italy against the combined britishamerican invasion the allies were going to rome and for sergeant parkins squad it was a long walk they came out of the forest at the top of a hill and lay flat on their bellies to look down on the village parkin got out his binoculars and said what wouldnt i fookin give for a fookin cup of fookin tea he had taken to drinking and cigarettes and women and his language was like that of soldiers everywhere he no longer went to prayer meetings some of these villages were defended and some were not parkin recognised that as sound tactics you didnt know which were undefended so you approached them all cautiously and caution cost time the downside of the hill held little cover just a few bushesand the village began at its foot there were a few white houses a river with a wooden bridge then more houses around a little piazza with a town hall and a clock tower there was a clear line of sight from the tower to the bridge if the enemy were here at all they would be in the town hall a few figures worked in the surrounding fields god knew who they were they might be genuine peasants or any one of a host of factions fascists mafia corsos partigianos communisti or even germans you didnt know whose side they would be on until the shooting started parkin said all right corporal corporal watkins disappeared back into the forest and emerged five minutes later on the dirt road into the village wearing a civilian hat and a filthy old blanket over his uniform he shambled rather than walked and over his shoulder was a bundle that could have been anything from a bag of onions to a dead rabbit he reached the near edge of the village and vanished into the darkness of a low cottage after a moment he came out standing close to the wall where he could not be seen from the village he looked toward the soldiers on the hilltop and waved one two three the squad scrambled down the hillside into the village all the houses empty sarge watkins said parkin nodded it meant nothing they moved through the houses to the edge of the river parkin said your turn smiler swim the mississippi here private smiler hudson put his equipment in a neat pile took off his helmet boots and tunic and slid into the narrow stream he emerged on the far side climbed the bank and disappeared among the houses this time there was a longer wait more area to check finally hudson walked back across the wooden bridge if theyre ere theyre iding he said he retrieved his gear and the squad crossed the bridge into the village they kept to the sides of the street as they walked toward the piazza a bird flew off a roof and startled parkin some of the men kicked open a few doors as they passed there was nobody they stood at the edge of the piazza parkin nodded at the town hall did you go inside that place smiler yes sir looks like the village is ours then yes sir parkin stepped forward to cross the piazza and then it broke there was a crash of rifles and bullets hailed all around them someone screamed parkin was running dodging ducking watkins in front of him shouted with pain and clutched his leg parkin picked him up bodily a bullet clanged off his tin hat he raced for the nearest house charged the door and fell inside the shooting stopped parkin risked a look outside one man lay wounded in the piazza hudson hudson moved and a solitary shot rang out then he was still parkin said fookin bastards watkins was doing something to his leg cursing bullet still in there parkin said watkins yelled ouch then grinned and held something up not any more parkin looked outside again theyre in the clock tower you wouldnt think there was room cant be many of them they can shoot though yes theyve got us pinned parkin frowned got any fireworks aye lets have a look parkin opened watkins pack and took out the dynamite here fix me a tensecond fuse the others were in the house across the street parkin called out hey a face appeared at the door sarge im going to throw a tomato when i shout give me covering fire right now parkin lit a cigarette watkins handed him a bundle of dynamite parkin shouted fire he lit the fuse with the cigarette stepped into the street drew back his arm and threw the bomb at the clock tower he ducked back into the house the fire of his own men ringing in his ears a bullet shaved the woodwork and he caught a splinter under his chin he heard the dynamite explode before he could look someone across the street shouted bullseye parkin stepped outside the ancient clock tower had crumbled a chime sounded incongruously as dust settled over the ruins watkins said you ever play cricket that was a bloody good shot parkin walked to the centre of the piazza there seemed to be enough human spare parts to make about three germans the tower was pretty unsteady anyway he said it would probably have fallen down if wed ave sneezed at it together he turned away another day another dollar it was a phrase hed heard the yanks use sarge radio it was the rt operator parkin walked back and took the handset from him sergeant parkin major roberts youre discharged from active duty as of now sergeant why parkins first thought was that they had discovered his true age the brass want you in london dont ask me why because i dont know leave your corporal in charge and make your way back to base a car will meet you on the road yes sir the orders also say that on no account are you to risk your life got that parkin grinned thinking of the clock tower and the dynamite got it all right on your way you lucky sod everyone had called him a boy but they had known him before he joined the army bloggs thought there was no doubt he was a man now he walked with confidence and grace looked about him sharply and was respectful without being ill at ease in the company of superior officers bloggs knew that he was lying about his age not because of his looks or manner but because of the small signs that appeared whenever age was mentionedsigns that bloggs an experienced interrogator picked up out of habit he had been amused when they told him they wanted him to look at pictures now on his third day in mr middletons dusty kensington vault the amusement had gone and tedium had set in what irritated him most was the nosmoking rule it was even more boring for bloggs who had to sit and watch him at one point parkin said you wouldnt call me back from italy to help in a fouryearold murder case that could wait until after the war also these pictures are mostly of german officers if this case is something i should keep quiet about youd better tell me its something you should keep quiet about said bloggs parkin went back to his pictures they were all old mostly browned and fading many were out of books magazines and newspapers sometimes parkin picked up a magnifying glass mr middleton had thoughtfully provided to peer more closely at a tiny face in a group and each time this happened bloggs heart raced only to slow down when parkin put the glass to one side and picked up the next photograph they went to a nearby pub for lunch the ale was weak like most wartime beer but bloggs still thought it wise to restrict young parkin to two pints on his own he would have sunk a gallon mr faber was the quiet sort parkin said you wouldnt think he had it in him mind you the landlady wasnt bad looking and she wanted it looking back i think i could have had her myself if id known how to go about it there i was only eighteen they ate bread and cheese and parkin swallowed a dozen pickled onions when they went back they stopped outside the house while parkin smoked another cigarette mind you he said he was a biggish chap goodlooking wellspoken we all thought he was nothing much because his clothes were poor and he rode a bike and hed no money i suppose it could have been a subtle kind of disguise his eyebrows were raised in a question it could have been bloggs said that afternoon parkin found not one but three pictures of faber one of them was only nine years old and mr middleton had the negative heinrich rudolph hans von müllergüder also known as faber was born on may at a village called oln in west prussia his fathers family had been substantial landowners in the area for generations his father was the second son so was heinrich all the second sons were army officers his mother the daughter of a senior official of the second reich was born and raised to be an aristocrats wife and that was what she was at the age of thirteen heinrich went to the karlsrühe cadet school in baden two years later he was transferred to the more prestigious grosslichterfelde near berlin both places were hard disciplinarian institutions where the minds of the pupils were improved with canes and cold baths and bad food however heinrich learned to speak english and french and studied history and passed the final examinations with the highest mark recorded since the turn of the century there were only three other points of note in his school career one bitter winter he rebelled against authority to the extent of sneaking out of the school at night and walking miles to his aunts house he broke the arm of his wrestling instructor during a practice bout and he was flogged for insubordination he served briefly as an ensigncadet in the neutral zone of friedrichsfeld near wesel in did token officer training at the war school at metz in and was commissioned second lieutenant in what was the phrase you used godliman asked bloggs german equivalent of eton and sandhurst over the next few years he did short tours of duty in half a dozen places in the manner of one who is being groomed for the general staff he continued to distinguish himself as an athlete specialising in longdistance running he made no close friendships never married and refused to join the national socialist party his promotion to lieutenant was somewhat delayed by a vague incident involving the pregnancy of the daughter of a lieutenant colonel in the defence ministry but eventually came about in his habit of talking to superior officers as if they were equals came to be accepted as pardonable in one who was both a rising young officer and a prussian aristocrat in the late s admiral wilhelm canaris became friendly with heinrichs uncle otto his fathers elder brother and spent several holidays at the family estate at oln in adolf hitler not yet chancellor of germany was a guest there in heinrich was promoted to captain and went to berlin for unspecified duties this is the date of the last photograph about then according to published information he seems to have ceased to exist we can conjecture the rest said percival godliman the abwehr trains him in wireless transmission codes mapmaking burglary blackmail sabotage and silent killing he comes to london in about with plenty of time to set himself up with a solid cover perhaps two his loner instincts are honed sharp by the spying game when war breaks out he considers himself licenced to kill he looked at the photograph on his desk hes a handsome fellow it was a picture of the metres running team of the th hanoverian jaeger battalion faber was in the middle holding a cup he had a high forehead with cropped hair a long chin and a small mouth decorated with a narrow moustache godliman passed the picture to billy parkin has he changed much he looked a lot older but that might have been his bearing he studied the photograph thoughtfully his hair was longer and the moustache was gone he passed dhe picture back across the desk but its him all right there are two more items in the file both of them conjectural godliman said first they say he may have gone into intelligence in thats the routine assumption when an officers record just stops for no apparent reason the second item is a rumour unconfirmed by any reliable source that he spent some years as a confidential advisor to stalin using the name vasily zankov thats incredible bloggs said i dont believe that godliman shrugged somebody persuaded stalin to execute the cream of his officer corps during the years hitler rose to power bloggs shook his head and changed the subject where do we go from here godliman considered lets have sergeant parkin transferred to us hes the only man we know who has actually seen die nadel besides he knows too much for us to risk him in the front line he could get captured and interrogated next make a firstclass print of this photo and have the hair thickened and the moustache obliterated by a retouch artist then we can distribute copies do we want to start a hue and cry bloggs said doubtfully no for now lets tread softly if we put the thing in the newspapers hell get to hear of it and vanish just send the photo to police forces for the time being is that all i think so unless youve got other ideas parkin cleared his throat sir yes i really would prefer to go back to my unit im not really the administrative type if you see what i mean youre not being offered a choice sergeant at this stage one italian village more or less makes relatively little difference but this man faber could lose us the war truly faber had gone fishing he was stretched out on the deck of a thirtyfoot boat enjoying the spring sunshine moving along the canal at about three knots one lazy hand held the tiller the other rested on a rod that trailed its line in the water behind the boat he hadnt caught a thing all day as well as fishing he was birdwatching both out of interest he was actually getting to know quite a lot about the damn birds and as an excuse for carrying binoculars earlier today he had seen a kingfishers nest the people at the boatyard in norwich had been delighted to rent him the vessel for a fortnight business was bad they had only two boats nowadays and one of them had not been used since dunkirk faber had haggled over the price just for the sake of form in the end they had thrown in a locker full of tinned food he had bought bait in a shop nearby the fishing tackle he had brought from london they had observed that he had nice weather for it and wished him good fishing nobody asked to see his identity card so far so good the difficult bit was to come for assessing the strength of an army was difficult first for example you had to find it in peacetime the army would put up its own road signs to help you now they had been taken down not only the armys but everyone elses road signs the simple solution would be to get in a car and follow the first military vehicle you saw until it stopped however faber had no car it was close to impossible for a civilian to hire one and even if you got one you couldnt get petrol for it besides a civilian driving around the countryside following army vehicles and looking at army camps was likely to be arrested hence the boat some years ago before it had become illegal to sell maps faber had discovered that britain had thousands of miles of inland waterways the original network of rivers had been augmented during the nineteenth century by a spider web of canals in some areas there was almost as much waterway as there was road norfolk was one of these areas the boat had many advantages on a road a man was going somewhere on a river he was just sailing sleeping in a parked car was conspicuous sleeping in a moored boat was natural the waterway was lonely and who ever heard of a canalblock there were disadvantages airfields and barracks had to be near roads but they were located without reference to access by water faber had to explore the countryside at night leaving his moored boat and tramping the hillsides by moonlight exhausting fortymile round trips during which he could easily miss what he was looking for because of the darkness or because he simply did not have enough time to check every square mile of land when he returned a couple of hours after dawn he would sleep until midday then move on stopping occasionally to climb a nearby hill and check the outlook at locks isolated farmhouses and riverside pubs he would talk to people hoping for hints of a military presence so far there had been none he was beginning to wonder whether he was in the right area he had tried to put himself in general pattons place thinking if i were planning to invade france east of the seine from a base in eastern england where would i locate that base norfolk was obvious a vast expanse of lonely countryside plenty of flat ground for aircraft close to the sea for rapid departure and the wash was a natural place to gather a fleet of ships however his guesswork might be wrong for reasons unknown to him soon he would have to consider a rapid move across country to a new areaperhaps the fens a lock appeared ahead of him and he trimmed his sails to slow his pace he glided gently into the lock and bumped softly against the gates the lockkeepers house was on the bank faber cupped hands around his mouth and helloed then he settled down to wait he had learned that lockkeepers were a breed that could not be hurried moreover it was tea time and at tea time they could hardly be moved at all a woman came to the door of the house and beckoned faber waved back then jumped onto the bank tied up the boat and went into the house the lockkeeper was in his shirtsleeves at the kitchen table he said not in a hurry are you faber smiled not at all pour him a cup of tea mavis no really faber said politely its all right weve just made a pot thank you faber sat down the little kitchen was airy and clean and his tea came in a pretty china cup fishing holiday the lockkeeper asked fishing and birdwatching faber answered im thinking of tying up quite soon and spending a couple of days on land oh aye well best keep to the far side of the canal then restricted area this side really i didnt know there was army land hereabouts aye it starts about half a mile from here as to whether its army i wouldnt know they dont tell me well i suppose we dont need to know faber said aye drink up then and ill see you through the lock thanks for letting me finish my tea they left the house and faber got into the boat and untied it the gates behind him closed slowly and then the keeper opened the sluices the boat gradually sank with the level of the water in the lock then the keeper opened the front gates faber made sail and moved out the lockkeeper waved he stopped again about four miles away and moored the boat to a stout tree on the bank while he waited for night to fall he made a meal of tinned sausage meat dry biscuits and bottled water he dressed in his black clothes put into a shoulder bag his binoculars camera and copy of rare birds of east anglia pocketed his compass and picked up his flashlight he was ready he doused the hurricane lamp locked the cabin door and jumped onto the bank consulting his compass by flashlight he entered the belt of woodland along the canal he walked due south from his boat for about half a mile until he came to the fence it was six feet high chicken wire with coiled barbed wire on top he backtracked into the wood and climbed a tall tree there was scattered cloud above the moon showed through fitfully beyond the fence was open land a gentle rise faber had done this sort of thing before at biggin hill aldershot and a host of military areas all over southern england there were two levels of security a mobile patrol around the perimeter fence and stationary sentries at the installations both he felt could be evaded by patience and caution faber came down the tree and returned to the fence he concealed himself behind a bush and settled down to wait he had to know when the mobile patrol passed this point if they did not come until dawn he would simply return the following night if he was lucky they would pass shortly from the apparent size of the area under guard he guessed they would only make one complete tour of the fence each night he was lucky soon after ten oclock he heard the tramp of feet and three men marched by on the inside of the fence five minutes later faber crossed the fence he walked due south when all directions are equal a straight line is best he did not use his flashlight he kept close to hedges and trees when he could and avoided high ground where he might be silhouetted against a sudden flash of moonlight the sparse countryside was an abstract in black grey and silver the ground underfoot was a little soggy as if there might be marshes nearby a fox ran across a field in front of him as fast as a greyhound as graceful as a cat it was pm when he came across the first indications of military activity and very odd indications they were the moon came out and he saw perhaps a quarter of a mile ahead several rows of onestory buildings laid out with the unmistakable precision of an army barracks he dropped to the ground immediately but he was already doubting the reality of what he apparently saw for there were no lights and no noise he lay still for ten minutes to give explanations a chance to emerge but nothing happened except that a badger lumbered into view saw him and made off faber crawled forward as he got closer he realised that the barracks were not just unoccupied but unfinished most of them were little more than a roof supported by cornerposts some had one wall a sudden sound stopped him a mans laugh he lay still and watched a match flared briefly and died leaving two glowing red spots in one of the unfinished huts guards faber touched the stiletto in his sleeve then began to crawl again making for the side of the camp away from the sentries the halfbuilt huts had no floors and no foundations there were no construction vehicles around no wheelbarrows concrete mixers shovels or piles of bricks a mud track led away from the camp across the fields but spring grass was growing in the ruts it had not been used much lately it was as if someone had decided to billet men here then changed his mind a few weeks after building started yet there was something about the place that did not quite fit that explanation faber walked around softly alert lest the sentries should take it into their heads to make a patrol there was a group of military vehicles in the centre of the camp they were old and rusting and had been degutted none had an engine or any interior components but if one was going to cannibalise obsolete vehicles why not take the shells for scrap those huts which did have a wall were on the outermost rows and their walls faced out it was like a film set not a building site faber decided he had learned all he could from this place he walked to the east edge of the camp then dropped to his hands and knees and crawled away until he was out of sight behind a hedge half a mile further on near the top of a rise he looked back now it looked exactly like a barracks again the glimmer of an idea formed in his mind he gave it time the land was still relatively flat relieved only by gentle folds there were patches of woodland and marshy scrub that faber took advantage of once he had to detour around a lake its surface a silver mirror under the moon he heard the hoot of an owl and looked in that direction to see a tumbledown barn in the distance five miles on he saw the airfield there were more planes here than he thought were possessed by the entire royal air force there were pathfinders to drop flares lancasters and american bs for softeningup bombing hurricanes and spitfires and mosquitoes for reconnaissance and strafing enough planes for an invasion without exception their undercarriages had sunk into the soft earth and they were up to their bellies in mud once again there were no lights and no noise faber followed the same procedure crawling flat toward the planes until he located the guards in the middle of the airfield was a small tent the faint glow of a lamp shone through the canvas two men perhaps three as faber approached the planes they seemed to become flatter as if they had all been squashed he reached the nearest and touched it in amazement it was a piece of halfinch plywood cut out in the outline of a spitfire painted with camouflage and roped to the ground every other plane was the same there were more than a thousand of them faber got to his feet watching the tent from the corner of his eye ready to drop to the ground at the slightest sign of movement he walked all around the phony airfield looking at the phony fighters and bombers connecting them with the movieset barracks reeling at the implications of what he had found he knew that if he continued to explore he would find more airfields like this more halfbuilt barracks if he went to the wash he would find a fleet of plywood destroyers and troop ships it was a vast meticulous costly outrageous trick of course it could not possibly fool an onlooker for very long but it was not designed to deceive observers on the ground it was meant to be seen from the air even a lowflying reconnaissance plane equipped with the latest cameras and fast film would come back with pictures that indisputably showed an enormous concentration of men and machines no wonder the general staff was anticipating an invasion east of the seine there would be other elements to the deception he guessed the british would refer to fusag in signals using codes they knew to be broken there would be phony espionage reports channelled through the spanish diplomatic bag to hamburg the possibilities were endless the british had had four years to arm themselves for this invasion most of the german army was fighting russia once the allies got a toehold on french soil they would be unstoppable the germans only chance was to catch them on the beaches and annihilate them as they came off the troop ships if they were waiting in the wrong place they would lose that one chance the whole strategy was immediately clear it was simple and it was devastating faber had to tell hamburg he wondered whether they would believe him war strategy was rarely altered on the word of one man his own standing was high but was it that high that idiot von braun would never believe him hed hated faber for years and would grab at the opportunity to discredit him canaris von roenne he had no faith in them and there was another thing the radio he didnt want to trust this to the radio hed had the feeling for weeks now that the radio code wasnt safe anymore if the british found out that their secret was blown there was only one thing to do he had to get proof and he had to take it himself to berlin he needed photographs he would take photographs of this gigantic dummy army then he would go to scotland and meet the uboat and he would deliver the pictures personally to the fuehrer he could do no more no less for photography he needed light he would have to wait until dawn there had been a ruined barn a little way back he could spend the rest of the night there he checked his compass and set off the barn was further than he thought and the walk took him an hour it was an old wooden building with holes in the roof the rats had long ago deserted it for lack of food but there were bats in the hayloft faber lay down on some planks but he could not sleep not with the knowledge that he was now personally capable of altering the course of the war dawn was due at at faber left the barn although he had not slept the two hours had rested his body and calmed his mind and he was now in fine spirits the cloud was clearing with a west wind so although the moon had set there was starlight his timing was good the sky was growing perceptibly brighter as he came in sight of the airfield the sentries were still in their tent with luck they would be sleeping faber knew from his own experience of such duties that it was hardest to stay awake during the last few hours but if they did come out he would have to kill them he selected his position and loaded the leica with a frame roll of mm fast agfa film he hoped the films lightsensitive chemicals had not spoiled it had been stored in his suitcase since before the war and you couldnt buy film in britain nowadays it should be all right he had kept it in a lightproof bag away from any heat when the red rim of the sun edged over the horizon he began shooting he took a series of shots from different vantage points and various distances finishing with a closeup of one dummy plane the pictures would show both the illusion and the reality as he took the last he saw movement from the corner of his eye he dropped flat and crawled under a plywood mosquito a soldier emerged from the tent walked a few paces and urinated on the ground the man stretched and yawned then lit a cigarette he looked around the airfield shivered and returned to the tent faber got up and ran a quarter of a mile away he looked back the airfield was out of sight he headed west toward the barracks this would be more than an ordinary espionage coup hitler had had a life of being the only one in step the man who brought the proof that yet again the fuehrer was right and all the experts were wrong could look for more than a pat on the back faber knew that already hitler rated him the abwehrs best agent this triumph might well get him canaris job if he made it he increased his pace jogging twenty yards walking the next twenty and jogging again so that he reached the barracks by it was bright daylight now and he could not approach close because these sentries were not in a tent but in one of the wallless huts with a clear view all around them he lay down by the hedge and took his pictures from a distance ordinary prints would just show a barracks but big enlargements ought to reveal the details of the deception when he headed back toward the boat he had exposed thirty frames again he hurried because he was now terribly conspicuous a blackclad man in the open fields of a restricted area he reached the fence an hour later having seen nothing but wild geese as he climbed over the wire he felt a great release of tension inside the fence the balance of suspicion had been against him outside it was in his favour he could revert to his birdwatching fishing sailing role the period of greatest risk was over he strolled through the belt of woodland catching his breath and letting the strain of the nights work seep away he would sail a few miles on he decided before mooring again to catch a few hours sleep he reached the canal it was over the boat looked pretty in the morning sunshine as soon as he was under way he would make some tea a man in uniform stepped out of the cabin of the boat and said well well and who might you be faber stood still letting the icy calm and the old instincts come into play the intruder wore the uniform of a captain in the home guard he had some kind of handgun in a holster with a buttoned flap he was tall and rangy but he looked to be in his late fifties white hair showed under his cap he made no move to draw his gun faber took all this in as he said you are on my boat so i think it is i who should ask who you are captain stephen langham home guard james baker faber stayed on the bank a captain did not patrol alone and what are you doing im on holiday where have you been birdwatching since before dawn cover him watson a youngish man in denim uniform appeared on fabers left carrying a shotgun faber looked around there was another man to his right and a fourth behind him the captain called which direction did he come from corporal the reply came from the top of an oak tree from the restricted area sir faber was calculating odds four to one until the corporal came down from the tree they had only two guns the shotgun and the captains pistol and they were basically amateurs the boat would help too he said restricted area all i saw was a bit of fence look do you mind pointing that blunderbuss away it might go off nobody goes birdwatching in the dark the captain said if you set up your hide under cover of darkness youre concealed by the time the birds wake up its the accepted way to do it now look the home guard is jolly patriotic and keen and all that but lets not take it too far dont you just have to check my papers and file a report the captain was looking a shade doubtful whats in that canvas bag binoculars a camera and a reference book fabers hand went to the bag no you dont the captain said look inside it watson there it was the amateurs watson said raise your hands faber raised his hands above his head his right hand close to the left sleeve of his jacket faber choreographed the next few seconds there must be no gunfire watson came up on fabers left side pointing the shotgun at him and opened the flap of fabers canvas bag faber drew the stiletto from his sleeve moved inside watsons guard and plunged the knife into watsons neck up to the hilt fabers other hand twisted the shotgun out of the young mans grasp the other two soldiers on the bank moved toward him and the corporal began to crash down through the branches of the oak faber tugged the stiletto out of watsons neck as the man collapsed to the ground the captain was fumbling at the flap of his holster faber leaped into the well of the boat it rocked sending the captain staggering faber struck at him with the knife but the man was too far away for an accurate thrust the point caught in the lapel of his uniform jacket then jerked up slashing his chin his hand came away from the holster to clutch the wound faber whipped around to face the bank one of the soldiers jumped faber stepped forward and held his right arm out rigidly the leaping soldier impaled himself on the eightinch stiletto the impact knocked faber off his feet and he lost his grip on the stiletto the soldier fell on top of the weapon faber got to his knees there was no time to retrieve the stiletto the captain was opening his holster faber jumped at him his hands going for the offlcers face the gun came out fabers thumbs gouged at the eyes of the captain who screamed in pain and tried to push fabers arms aside there was a thud as the fourth guardsman landed in the well of the boat faber turned from the captain who would now be unable to see to fire his pistol even if he could get the safety off the fourth man held a policemans truncheon he brought it down hard faber shifted to the right so that the blow missed his head and caught his left shoulder his left arm momentarily went nerveless he chopped the mans neck with the side of his handa powerful accurate blow amazingly the man survived it and brought his truncheon up for a second swipe faber closed in the feeling returned to his left arm and it began to hurt mightily he took the soldiers face in both his hands pushed twisted and pushed again there was a sharp crack as the mans neck broke at the same instant the truncheon landed again this time on fabers head he reeled away dazed the captain bumped into him still staggering faber pushed him his cap went flying as he stumbled backward over the gunwale and fell into the canal with a huge splash the corporal jumped the last six feet from the oak tree onto the ground faber retrieved his stiletto from the impaled guard and leaped to the bank watson was still alive but it would not be for long blood was pumping out of the wound in his neck faber and the corporal faced each other the corporal had a gun he was understandably terrified in the seconds it had taken him to climb down the oak tree this man had killed three of his mates and thrown the fourth into the canal faber looked at the gun it was old almost like a museum piece if the corporal had any confidence in it he would already have fired it the corporal took a step forward and faber noticed that he favoured his right leg perhaps he had hurt it coming out of the tree faber stepped sideways forcing the corporal to put his weight on the weak leg as he swung to keep his gun on the target faber got the toe of his shoe under a stone and kicked upward the corporals attention flicked to the stone and faber moved the corporal pulled the trigger nothing happened the old gun had jammed even if it had fired he would have missed faber his eyes were on the stone he stumbled on the weak leg and faber had moved faber killed him with a neck stab only the captain was left faber looked and saw the man clambering out of the water on the far bank he found a stone and threw it it hit the captains head but the man heaved himself onto dry land and began to run faber ran to the bank dived in swam a few strokes and came up on the far side the captain was a hundred yards away and running but he was old faber gained steadily until he could hear the mans agonised ragged breathing the captain slowed then collapsed into a bush faber came up to him and turned him over the captain said youre a devil you saw my face faber said and killed him the jus trimotor transport plane with swastikas on the wings bumped to a halt on the rainwet runway at rastenburg in the east prussian forest a small man with big featuresa large nose a wide mouth big earsdisembarked and walked quickly across the tarmac to a waiting mercedes car as the car drove through the gloomy damp forest field marshal erwin rommel took off his cap and rubbed a nervous hand along his receding hairline in a few weeks time he knew another man would travel this route with a bomb in his briefcase a bomb destined for the fuehrer himself meanwhile the fight must go on so that the new leader of germanywho might even be himselfcould negotiate with the allies from a reasonably strong position at the end of a tenmile drive the car arrived at the wolfsschanze the wolfs lair headquarters now for hitler and the increasingly tight neurotic circle of generals who surrounded him there was a steady drizzle and raindrops dripped from the tall conifers in the compound at the gate to hitlers personal quarters rommel put on his cap and got out of the car oberfuehrer rattenhuber the chief of the ss bodyguard wordlessly held out his hand to receive rommels pistol the conference was to be held in the underground bunker a cold damp airless shelter lined with concrete rommel went down the steps and entered there were a dozen or so there already waiting for the noon meeting himmler goering von ribbentrop keitel rommel nodded greetings and sat on a hard chair to wait they all stood when hitler entered he wore a grey tunic and black trousers and rommel observed he was becoming increasingly stooped he walked straight to the far end of the bunker where a large wall map of northwestern europe was tacked to the concrete he looked tired and irritable he spoke without preamble there will be an allied invasion of europe it will come this year it will be launched from britain with english and american troops they will land in france we will destroy them at the highwater mark on this there is no room for discussion he looked around as if daring his staff to contradict him there was silence rommel shivered the bunker was as cold as death the question is where will they land von roenne your report colonel alexis von roenne who had taken over effectively from canaris got to his feet a mere captain at the outbreak of war he had distinguished himself with a superb report on the weaknesses of the french armya report that had been called a decisive factor in the german victory he had become chief of the army intelligence bureau in and that bureau had absorbed the abwehr on the fall of canaris rommel had heard that he was proud and outspoken but able von roenne said our information is extensive but by no means complete the allies code name for the invasion is overlord troop concentrations in britain are as follows he picked up a pointer and crossed the room to the wall map first along the south coast second here in the district known as east anglia third in scotland the east anglian concentration is by far the greatest we conclude that the invasion will be threepronged first a diversionary attack on normandy second the main thrust across the strait of dover to the calais coast third a flanking invasion from scotland across the north sea to norway all intelligence sources support this prognosis he sat down hitler said comments rommel who was commander of army group b which controlled the north coast of france said i can report one confirming sign the pas de calais has received by far the greatest tonnage of bombs goering said what intelligence sources support your prognosis von roenne von roenne stood up again there are three air reconnaissance monitoring of enemy wireless signals and the reports of agents he sat down hitler crossed his hands protectively in front of his genitals a nervous habit that was a sign that he was about to make a speech i shall now tell you he began how i would be thinking if i were winston churchill two choices confront me east of the seine or west of the seine east has one advantage it is nearer but in modern warfare there are only two distances within fighter range and outside fighter range both of these choices are within fighter range therefore distance is not a consideration west has a great portcherbourgbut east has none and most important east is more heavily fortified than west the enemy too has air reconnaissance so i would choose west and what would i do then i would try to make the germans think the opposite i would send two bombers to the pas de calais for every one to normandy i would try to knock out every bridge over the seine i would put out misleading wireless signals send false intelligence reports dispose my troops in a misleading fashion i would deceive fools like rommel and von roenne i would hope to deceive the fuehrer himself goering spoke first after a lengthy silence my fuehrer i believe you flatter churchill by crediting him with ingenuity equal to your own there was a noticeable easing of tension in the uncomfortable bunker goering had said exactly the right thing managing to voice his disagreement in the form of a compliment the others followed him each stating the case a little more strongly the allies would choose the shorter sea crossing for speed the closer coast would allow the covering fighter aircraft to refuel and return in shorter time the southeast was a better launch pad with more estuaries and harbours it was unlikely that all the intelligence reports would be wrong hitler listened for half an hour then held up his hands for silence he picked up a yellowing sheaf of papers from the table and waved them in he said i issued my directive construction of coastal defences in which i forecast that the decisive landing of the allies would come at the protruding parts of normandy and brittany where the excellent harbours would make ideal beachheads that was what my intuition told me then and that is what it tells me now a fleck of foam appeared on the fuehrers lower lip von roenne spoke up he has more courage than i rommel thought my puehrer our investigations continue quite naturally and there is one particular line of enquiry that you should know about i have in recent weeks sent an emissary to england to contact the agent known as die nadel hitlers eyes gleamed ah i know the man go on die nadels orders are to assess the strength of the first united states army group under general patton in east anglia if he finds that this has been exaggerated we must surely reconsider our prognosis if however he reports that the army is as strong as we presently believe there can be little doubt that calais is the target goering looked at von roenne who is this nadel hitler answered the question the only decent agent canaris ever recruited because he recruited him at my direction i know his family strong loyal upright germans and die nadel a brilliant man brilliant i see all his reports he has been in london since von roenne interrupted my fuehrer hitler glared at him well von roenne said tentatively then you will accept die nadels report hitler nodded that man will discover the truth part three faber leaned against a tree shivering and threw up then he considered whether he should bury the five dead men it would take between thirty and sixty minutes he estimated depending on how well he concealed the bodies during that time he might be caught he had to weigh that risk against the precious hours he might gain by delaying the discovery of the deaths the five men would be missed very soon there would be a search under way by around nine oclock assuming they were on a regular patrol their route would be known the searchers first move would be to send a runner to cover the route if the bodies were left as they were he would see them and raise the alarm otherwise he would report back and a fullscale search would be mounted with bloodhounds and policemen beating the bushes it might take them all day to discover the corpses by that time faber could be in london it was important for him to be out of the area before they knew they were looking for a murderer he decided to risk the additional hour he swam back across the canal with the elderly captain across his shoulder dumped him unceremoniously behind a bush then retrieved the two bodies from the well of the boat and piled them on top of the captain next he added watson and the corporal to the heap he had no spade and he needed a big grave he found a patch of loose earth a few yards into the wood the ground there was slightly hollowed to give him an advantage he got a saucepan from the boats tiny galley and began to dig for a couple of feet there was just leaf mould and the going was easy then he got down to clay and digging became extremely difficult in half an hour he had added only another eighteen inches of depth to the hole it would have to do he carried the bodies to the hole one by one and threw them in then he took off his muddy bloodstained clothes and dropped them on top he covered the grave with loose earth and a layer of foliage ripped from nearby bushes and trees it should be good enough to pass that first superficial inspection he kicked earth over the patch of ground near the bank where the lifeblood of watson had poured out there was blood in the boat too where the impaled soldier had lain faber found a rag and swabbed down the deck then he put on clean clothes made sail and moved off he did not fish or watch birds this was no time for pleasant embellishments to his cover instead he piled on the sail putting as much distance as possible between himself and the grave he had to get off the water and into some faster transport as soon as possible he reflected as he sailed on the relative merits of catching a train and stealing a car a car was faster if one could be found to steal but the search for it might start quite soon regardless of whether the theft was connected with the missing home guard patrol finding a railway station might take a long time but it seemed safer if he were careful he could escape suspicion for most of the day he wondered what to do about the boat ideally he would scuttle it but he might be seen doing so if he left it in a harbour somewhere or simply moored at the canalside the police would connect it with the murders that much sooner and that would tell them in which direction he was moving he postponed the decision unfortunately he was not sure where he was his map of englands waterways gave every bridge harbour and lock but it did not show railway lines he calculated he was within an hour or twos walk of half a dozen villages but a village did not necessarily mean a station the two problems were solved at once the canal went under a railway bridge he took his compass the film from the camera his wallet and his stiletto all his other possessions would go down with the boat the towpath on both sides was shaded with trees and there were no roads nearby he furled the sails dismantled the base of the mast and laid the pole on the deck then he removed the bunghole stopper from the keel and stepped on to the bank holding the rope gradually filling with water the boat drifted under the bridge faber hauled on the rope to hold the vessel in position directly under the brick arch as it sank the afterdeck went under first the prow followed and finally the water of the canal closed over the roof of the cabin there were a few bubbles then nothing the outline of the boat was hidden from a casual glance by the shadow of the bridge faber threw the rope in the railway line ran northeast to southwest faber climbed the embankment and walked southwest which was the direction in which london lay it was a twoline track probably a rural branch line there would be a few trains but they would stop at all stations the sun grew stronger as he walked and the exertion made him hot when he had buried his bloodstained black clothes he had put on a doublebreasted blazer and heavy flannel trousers now he took off the blazer and slung it over his shoulder after forty minutes he heard a distant chuffchuffchuff and hid in a bush beside the line an old steam engine went slowly by heading northeast puffing great clouds of smoke and hauling a train of coal trucks if one came by in the opposite direction he could jump it should he it would save him a long walk on the other hand he would get conspicuously dirty and he might have trouble disembarking without being seen no it was safer to walk the line ran straight as an arrow across the flat countryside faber passed a farmer ploughing a field with a tractor there was no way to avoid being seen the farmer waved to him without stopping in his work he was too far away to get a good sight of fabers face he had walked about ten miles when he saw a station ahead it was half a mile away and all he could see was the rise of the platforms and a cluster of signals he left the line and cut across the fields keeping close to borders of trees until he met a road within a few minutes he entered the village there was nothing to tell him its name now that the threat of invasion was a memory signposts and placenames were being reerected but this village had not got around to it there was a post office a corn store and a pub called the bull a woman with a pram gave him a friendly good morning as he passed the war memorial the little station basked sleepily in the spring sunshine faber went in a timetable was pasted to a noticeboard faber stood in front of it from behind the little ticket window a voice said i shouldnt take any notice of that if i were you its the biggest work of fiction since the forsyte saga faber had known the timetable would be out of date but he had needed to establish whether the trains went to london they did he said any idea what time the next train leaves for liverpool street the clerk laughed sarcastically sometime today if youre lucky ill buy a ticket anyway single please fiveandfourpence they say the italian trains run on time the clerk said not anymore faber remarked anyway id rather have bad trains and our politics the man shot him a nervous look youre right of course do you want to wait in the bull youll hear the train or if not ill send for you faber did not want more people to see his face no thanks id only spend money he took his ticket and went on to the platform the clerk followed him a few minutes later and sat on the bench beside him in the sunshine he said you in a hurry faber shook his head ive written today off i got up late i quarrelled with the boss and the truck that gave me a lift broke down one of those days ah well the clerk looked at his watch she went up on time this morning and what goes up must come down they say you might be lucky he went back into his office faber was lucky the train came twenty minutes later it was crowded with farmers families businessmen and soldiers faber found a space on the floor close to a window as the train lumbered away he picked up a discarded twodayold newspaper borrowed a pencil and started to do the crossword he was proud of his ability to do crosswords in englishit was the acid test of fluency in a foreign language after a while the motion of the train lulled him into a shallow sleep and he dreamed it was a familiar dream the dream of his arrival in london he had crossed from france carrying a belgian passport that said he was jan van gelder a representative for phillips which would explain his suitcase radio if customs opened it his english then was fluent but not colloquial the customs had not bothered him he was an ally he had caught the train to london in those days there had been plenty of empty seats in the carriages and you could get a meal faber had dined on roast beef and yorkshire pudding it amused him he had talked with a history student from cardiff about the european political situation the dream was like the reality until the train stopped at waterloo then it turned into a nightmare the trouble started at the ticket barrier like all dreams it had its own weird illogicality the document they queried was not his forged passport but his perfectly legitimate railway ticket the collector said this is an abwehr ticket no it is not said faber speaking with a ludicrously thick german accent what had happened to his dainty english consonants they would not come i have it in dover gekauft damn that did it but the ticket collector who had turned into a london policeman complete with helmet seemed to ignore the sudden lapse into german he smiled politely and said id better just check your klamotte sir the station was crowded with people faber thought that if be could get into the crowd he might escape he dropped the suitcase radio and fled pushing his way through the crowd suddenly he realised he had left his trousers on the train and there were swastikas on his socks he would have to buy trousers at the very first shop before people noticed the trouserless running man with nazi hose then someone in the crowd said ive seen your face before and tripped him and he fell with a bump and landed on the floor of the railway carriage where he had gone to sleep he blinked yawned and looked around him he had a headache for a moment he was filled with relief that it was all a dream then he was amused by the ridiculousness of the symbolism swastika socks for gods sake a man in overalls beside him said you had a good sleep faber looked up sharply he was always afraid of talking in his sleep and giving himself away i had an unpleasant dream he said the man made no comment it was getting dark he had slept for a long time the carriage light came on suddenly a single blue bulb and someone drew the blinds peoples faces turned into pale featureless ovals the workman became talkative again you missed the excitement he told faber faber frowned what happened it was impossible he should have slept through some kind of police check one of them yank trains passed us it was going about ten miles an hour nigger driving it ringing its bell with a bloody great cowcatcher on the front talk about the wild west faber smiled and thought back to the dream in fact his arrival in london had been without incident he had checked into a hotel at first still using his belgian cover within a week he had visited several country churchyards taken the names of men his age from the gravestones and applied for three duplicate birth certificates then he took lodgings and found humble work using forged references from a nonexistent manchester firm he had even got on to the electoral register in highgate before the war he voted conservative when rationing came in the ration books were issued via householders to every person who had slept in the house on a particular night faber contrived to spend part of that night in each of three different houses and so obtained papers for each of his personae he burned the belgian passport in the unlikely event he should need a passport he could get three british ones the train stopped and from the noise outside the passengers guessed they had arrived when faber got out he realised how hungry and thirsty he was his last meal had been sausagemeat dry biscuits and bottled water twentyfour hours ago he went through the ticket barrier and found the station buffet it was full of people mostly soldiers sleeping or trying to sleep at the tables faber asked for a cheese sandwich and a cup of tea the food is reserved for servicemen said the woman behind the counter just the tea then got a cup faber was surprised no i havent neither have we chum faber contemplated going into the great eastern hotel for dinner but that would take time he found a pub and drank two pints of weak beer then bought a bag of chips at a fishandchip shop and ate them from the newspaper wrapping standing on the pavement they made him feel surprisingly full now he had to find a chemists shop and break in he wanted to develop his film to make sure the pictures came out he was not going to risk returning to germany with a roll of spoiled useless film if the pictures were no good he would have to steal more film and go back the thought was unbearable it would have to be a small independent shop not a branch of a chain that would process film centrally it must be in an area where the local people could afford cameras or could have afforded them before the war the part of east london in which liverpool street station stood was no good he decided to head toward bloomsbury the moonlit streets were quiet there had been no sirens so far tonight two military policemen stopped him in chancery lane and asked for his identity card faber pretended to be slightly drunk and the mps did not ask what he was doing out of doors he found the shop he was looking for at the north end of southampton row there was a kodak sign in the window surprisingly the shop was open he went in a stooped irritable man with thinning hair and glasses stood behind the counter wearing a white coat he said were only open for doctors prescriptions thats all right i just want to ask whether you develop photographs yes if you come back tomorrow do you do them on the premises faber asked i need them quickly you see yes if you come back tomorrow could i have the prints the same day my brothers on leave and he wants to take some back twentyfour hours is the best we can do come back tomorrow thank you i will on his way out he noticed that the shop was due to close in ten minutes he crossed the road and stood in the shadows waiting promptly at nine oclock the chemist came out locking the shop behind him and walked off down the road faber went in the opposite direction and turned two corners there seemed to be no direct access to the back of the shop and faber did not want to break in the front way in case the unlocked door was noticed by a patrolling policeman while he was in there he walked along the parallel street looking for a way through apparently there was none still there had to be a wall of some kind at the back the two streets were too far apart for the buildings to be joined backtoback finally he came across a large old house with a nameplate marking it as a residence hall for a nearby college the front door was unlocked faber went in and walked quickly through to a communal kitchen a lone girl sat at a table drinking coffee and reading a book faber muttered college blackout check she nodded and returned to her text faber went out of the back door he crossed a yard bumping into a cluster of dustbins on the way and found a door to a lane in seconds he was at the rear of the chemists shop this entrance was obviously never used he clambered over some tyres and a discarded mattress and threw his shoulder at the door the rotten wood gave easily and faber was inside he found the darkroom and shut himself in the light switch operated a dim red lamp in the ceiling the place was quite well equipped with neatly labelled bottles of developing fluid an enlarger and even a dryer for prints faber worked quickly but carefully getting the temperature of the tanks exactly right agitating the fluids to develop the film evenly timing the processes by the hands of a large electric clock on the wall the negatives were perfect he let them dry then fed them through the enlarger and made one complete set of tenbyeight prints he felt a sense of elation as he saw the images gradually appear in the bath of developer damn he had done a good job there was now a major decision to be made the problem had been in his mind all day and now that the pictures had come out he was forced to confront it what if he did not make it home the journey ahead of him was to say the least hazardous he was more than confident of his own ability to make the rendezvous in spite of travel restrictions and coastal security but he could not guarantee that the uboat would be there or that it would get back across the north sea and of course he might walk out of here and get run over by a bus the possibility that having discovered the most important secret of the war he might die and his secret die with him was too awful to think about he had to have a fallback stratagem a second method of trying to ensure that the evidence of the allied deception reached the abwehr there was of course no postal service between england and germany mail had to go via a neutral country and all such mail was sure to be censored he could write in code but there was no point he had to send the pictures they were the evidence that counted there was a route and a good one hed been told at the portuguese embassy in london there was an official sympathetic to germanypartly for political reasons and partly faber worried because he was well bribedwho would pass messages via the diplomatic bag to the german embassy in neutral lisbon from there it was safe the route had been opened early in but faber had used it only once before when canaris had asked for a routine test communication it would do it would have to do faber felt angry he hated to place his faith in others they were all such bumbling still he couldnt take the chance he had to have a backup for this information it was a lesser risk than using the radio and certainly less than the risk if germany never learned at all fabers mind was clear the balance of argument indisputably favoured the portuguese embassy contact he sat down to write a letter frederick bloggs had spent an unpleasant afternoon in the countryside when five worried wives had contacted their local police station to say their husbands had not come home a rural policeconstable had exercised his limited powers of deduction and concluded that a whole patrol of the home guard had not gone awol he was fairly sure they had simply got lost they were all a bit daft otherwise they would have been in the army but all the same he notified his constabulary headquarters just to cover himself the operationsroom sergeant who took the message realised at once that the missing men had been patrolling a particularly sensitive military area and he notified his inspector who notified scotland yard who sent a special branch man down there and notified mi which sent bloggs the special branch man was harris who had been on the stockwell murder he and bloggs met on the train which was one of the wild west locomotives lent to britain by the americans because of the shortage of trains harris repeated his invitation to sunday dinner and bloggs told him again that he worked most sundays when they got off the train they borrowed bicycles to ride along the canal towpath until they met up with the search party harris ten years older than bloggs and fiftyfive pounds heavier found the ride a strain they met a section of the search party under a railway bridge harris welcomed the opportunity to get off the bicycle what have you found he said bodies no a boat said a policeman who are you they introduced themselves a constable stripped to his underwear was diving down to examine the vessel he came up with a bung in his hand bloggs looked at harris deliberately scuttled looks like it harris turned to the diver notice anything else she hasnt been down there for long shes in good condition and the mast has been taken down not broken harris said thats a lot of information from a minute under water im a weekend sailor the diver said harris and bloggs mounted their cycles and moved on when they met up with the main party the bodies had been found murdered all five said the uniformed inspector in charge captain langham corporal lee and privates watson dayton and forbes daytons neck was broken the rest were killed with some kind of a knife langhams body had been in the canal all found together in a shallow grave bloody murder he was quite shaken harris looked closely at the five bodies laid out in a line ive seen wounds like this before fred he said bloggs looked closely jesus christ it looks like harris nodded stiletto the inspector said in astonishment you know who did it we can guess harris said we think hes killed twice before if its the same man we know who he is but not where he is what with the restricted area so close the inspector said and special branch and m arriving on the scene so quick is there anything else i need to know about this case harris answered just that you keep very quiet until your chief constable has talked to our people found anything else inspector bloggs asked were still going over the area and in everwidening circles but nothing so far there were some clothes in the grave he pointed bloggs touched them gingerly black trousers a black sweater a short black leather jacket rafstyle clothes for night work harris said to fit a big man bloggs added how tall is your man over six foot the inspector said did you pass the men who found the sunken boat yes bloggs frowned wberes the nearest lock four miles upstream if our man was in a boat the lockkeeper must have seen him mustnt he must have the inspector agreed bloggs said wed better talk to him he returned to his bicycle not another four miles harris complained work off some of those sunday dinners bloggs told him the fourmile ride took them most of an hour the towpath was made for horses not wheels and it was uneven muddy and mined with loose boulders and tree roots harris was sweating and cursing by the time they reached the lock the lockkeeper was sitting outside his little house smoking a pipe and enjoying the mild afternoon air he was a middleaged man of slow speech and slower movements he regarded the two cyclists with some amusement bloggs spoke because harris was out of breath were police officers he said is that so said the lockkeeper whats the excitement he looked as excited as a cat in front of a fire bloggs took the photograph of die nadel out of his wallet and gave it to the man have you ever seen him the lockkeeper put the picture on his lap while he held a fresh match to his pipe then he studied the photograph for a while and handed it back well harris said aye he was here about this time yesterday came in for a cup of tea nice enough chap whats he done shown a light after blackout bloggs sat down heavily that clinches it he said harris thought aloud he moors the boat downstream from here and goes into the restricted area after dark he spoke quietly so that the lockkeeper would not hear when he comes back the home guard has his boat staked out he deals with them sails a bit further to the railway scuttles his boat and hops a train bloggs said to the lockkeeper the railway line that crosses the canal a few miles downstreamwhere does it go london bloggs said oh shit bloggs got back to the war office in whitehall at midnight godliman and billy parkin were there waiting for him bloggs said its him all right and told them the story parkin was excited godliman just looked tense when bloggs had finished godliman said so now hes back in london and were looking for in more ways than one a needle in a haystack again he was playing with matches forming a picture with them on his desk do you know every time i look at that photograph i get the feeling ive actually met the damn fellow well think for gods sake bloggs said where godliman shook his head in frustration it must have been only once and somewhere strange its like a face ive seen in a lecture audience or in the background at a cocktail party a fleeting glimpse a casual encounter when i remember it probably wont do us any good parkin said whats in that area i dont know which means its probably highly important godliman said there was a silence parkin lit a cigarette with one of godlimans matches bloggs looked up we could print a million copies of his picture give one to every policeman arp warden member of the home guard serviceman railway porter paste them up on boardings and publish them in the papers godliman shook his head too risky what if hes already talked to hamburg about whatever hes seen if we make a public fuss about the man theyll know that his information is good wed only be lending credence to him weve got to do something well circulate his picture to police officers well give his description to the press and say hes just a conventional murderer we can give the details of the highgate and stockwell murders without saying that security is involved parkin said what youre saying is we have to fight with one hand tied behind our back for now anyway ill start the ball rolling with the yard bloggs said he picked up the phone godliman looked at his watch theres not much more we can do tonight but i dont feel like going home i shant sleep parkin stood up in that case im going to find a kettle and make some tea he went out the matches on godlimans desk made a picture of a horse and carriage he took away one of the horses legs and lit his pipe with it have you got a girl fred he asked conversationally no not since no godliman puffed at his pipe there has to be an end to bereavement you know bloggs made no reply godliman said look perhaps i shouldnt talk to you like a dutch uncle but i know how you feel ive been through it myself the only difference was that i didnt have anyone to blame you didnt remarry bloggs said not looking at godliman no and i dont want you to make the same mistake when you reach middle age living alone can be very depressing did i ever tell you they called her fearless bloggs yes you did bloggs finally looked at godliman tell me where in the world will i find another girl like that does she have to be a hero after christine england is full of heroes fred at that moment colonel terry walked in dont get up gentlemen this is important listen carefully whoever killed those five home guards has learned a vital secret theres an invasion coming you know that you dont know when or where needless to say our objective is to keep the germans in that same state of ignorance most of all about where the invasion will come we have gone to some extreme lengths to ensure that the enemy be misled in this matter now it seems certain he will not be if their man gets through he has it is definitely established found out our deception unless we stop him from delivering his news the entire invasionand therefore one can safely say the waris compromised ive already told you more than i wanted to but its imperative that you understand the urgency and precise consequences of failure to stop the intelligence from getting through he did not tell them that normandy was the invasion site nor that the pas de calais via eeast anglia the diversionary one though he realised godliman would surely conclude the latter once he had debriefed bloggs on his efforts to trail the murderer of the home guardsmen bloggs said excuse me but why are you so sure their man found out terry went to the door come in rodriguez a tall handsome man with jetblack hair and a long nose entered the room and nodded politely to godliman and bloggs terry said senhor rodriguez is our man at the portuguese embassy tell them what happened rodriguez the man stood by the door as you know we have been watching senhor francisco of the embassy staff for some time today he went to meet a man in a taxi and received an envelope we relieved him of the envelope shortly after the man in the taxi drove off we were able to get the licence number of the taxi im having the cabbie traced terry said all right rodriguez youd better get back and thank you the tall portuguese left the room terry handed godliman a large yellow envelope addressed to manuel francisco godliman opened it it had already been unsealedand withdrew a second envelope marked with a meaningless series of letters presumably a code within the inner envelope were several sheets of paper covered with handwriting and a set of tenbyeight photographs godliman examined the letter it looks like a very basic code he said you dont need to read it terry said impatiently look at the photographs godliman did so there were about thirty of them and he looked at each one before speaking he handed them to bloggs this is a catastrophe bloggs glanced through the pictures then put them down godliman said this is only his backup hes still got the negatives and hes going somewhere with them the three men sat still in the little office like a tableau the only illumination came from a spotlight on godlimans desk with the cream walls the blackedout window the spare furniture and the worn civil service carpet it was a prosaic backdrop for dramatics terry said im going to have to tell churchill the phone rang and the colonel picked it up yes good bring him here right away please but before you do ask him where he dropped the passenger what thank you get here fast he hung up the taxi dropped our man at university college hospital bloggs said perhaps he was injured in the fight with the home guard terry said where is the hospital about five minuses walk from euston station godliman said trains from euston go to holyhead liverpool glasgow all places from which you can catch a ferry to ireland liverpool to belfast bloggs said then a car to the border across into eire and a uboat on the atlantic coast somewhere he wouldnt risk holyheadtodublin because of the passport control and there would be no point in going beyond liverpool to glasgow godliman said fred youd better go to the station and show the picture of faber around see if anyone noticed him getting on a train ill phone the station and warn them youre coming and at the same time find out which trains have left since about ten thirty bloggs picked up his hat and coat im on my way godliman lifted the phone yes were on our way there were still plenty of people at euston station although in normal times the station closed around midnight wartime delays were such that the last train often had not left before the earliest milk train of the morning arrived the station concourse was a mass of kitbags and sleeping bodies bloggs showed the picture to three railway policemen none of them recognised the face he tried ten women porters nothing he went to every ticket barrier one of the guards said we look at tickets not faces he tried half a dozen passengers without result finally he went into the ticket office and showed the picture to each of the clerks a very fat bald clerk with illfitting false teeth recognised the face i play a game he told bloggs i try to spot something about a passenger that tells me why hes catching a train like he might have a black tie for a funeral or muddy boots means hes a farmer going home or there might be a college scarf or a white mark on a womans finger where shes took off her wedding ring know what i mean everybody got something this is a dull job not that im complaining what did you notice about this fellow bloggs interrupted him nothing that was it seei couldnt make him out at all almost like he was trying to be inconspicuous know what i mean i know what you mean bloggs paused now i want you to think very carefully where was he going can you remember yes said the fat clerk inverness that doesnt mean hes going there said godliman hes a professionalhe knows we can ask questions at railway stations i expect he automatically buys a ticket for the wrong destination he looked at his watch he must have caught the that train is now pulling into stafford i checked with the railway they checked with the signalmen theyre going to stop the train this side of crewe ive got a plane standing by to fly you two to stokeontrent parkin youll board the train where its stopped outside crewe youll be dressed as a ticket inspector and youll look at every ticket and every face on that train when youve spotted faber just stay close to him bloggs youll be waiting at the ticket barrier at crewe just in case faber decides to hop off there but he wont youll get on the train and be first off at liverpool and waiting at the ticket barrier for parkin and faber to come off it half the local constabulary will be there to back you up thats all very well if he doesnt recognise me parkin said what if he remembers my face from highgate godliman opened a desk drawer took out a pistol and gave it to parkin if he recognises you shoot him parkin pocketed the weapon without comment godliman said you heard colonel terry but i want to emphasise the importance of all this if we dont catch this man the invasion of europe will have to be postponed possibly for a year in that year the balance of war could turn against us the time may never be this right again bloggs said do we get told how long it is to dday godliman decided they were at least as entitled as he they were going into the field after all all i know is that its probably a matter of weeks parkin was thinking itll be june then the phone rang and godliman picked it up after a moment he looked up your cars here bloggs and parkin stood up godliman said wait a minute they stood by the door looking at the professor he was saying yes sir certainly i will goodbye sir bloggs could not think of anyone godliman called sir he said who was that godliman said churchill what did he have to say parkin asked awestruck godliman said he wishes you both good luck and godspeed the carriage was pitch dark faber thought of the jokes people made take your hand off my knee no not you you the british would make jokes out of anything their railways were now worse than ever but nobody complained any more because it was in a good cause faber preferred the dark it was anonymous there had been singing earlier on three soldiers in the corridor had started it and the whole carriage had joined in they had been through be like the kettle and sing therell always be an england followed by glasgow belongs to me and land of my fathers for ethnic balance and appropriately dont get around much any more there had been an air raid warning and the train slowed to thirty miles an hour they were all supposed to lie on the floor but of course there was no room an anonymous female voice had said oh god im frightened and a male voice equally anonymous except that it was cockney had said youre in the safest place girl they cant it a moving target then everyone laughed and nobody was scared any more someone opened a suitcase and passed around a packet of driedegg sandwiches one of the sailors wanted to play cards how can we play cards in the dark peel the edges all harrys cards are marked the train stopped unaccountably at about am a cultured voice the driedeggsandwich supplier faber thoughtsaid my guess is were outside crewe knowing the railways we could be anywhere from bolton to bournemouth said the cockney the train jerked and moved off and everyone cheered where faber wondered was the caricature englishman with his icy reserve and his stiff upper lip not here a few minutes later a voice in the corridor said tickets please faber noted the yorkshire accent they were in the north now he fumbled in his pockets for his ticket he had the corner seat near the door so he could see into the corridor the inspector was shining a flashlight onto the tickets faber saw the mans silhouette in the reflected light it looked vaguely familiar he settled back in his seat to wait he remembered the nightmare this is an abwehr ticket and smiled in the dark then he frowned the train stopped unaccountably shortly afterward a ticket inspection began the inspectors face was vaguely familiar it might be nothing but faber stayed alive by worrying about things that might be nothing he looked into the corridor again but the man had entered a compartment the train stopped brieflythe station was crewe according to informed opinion in fabers compartmentand moved off again faber got another look at the inspectors face and now he remembered the boarding house in highgate the boy from yorkshire who wanted to get into the army faber watched him carefully his flashlight moved across the face of every passenger he was not just looking at the tickets no faber told himself dont jump to conclusions how could they possibly have got on to him they could not have found out which train he was on got hold of one of the few people in the world who knew what he looked like and got the man on the train dressed as a ticket inspector in so short a time parkin that was his name billy parkin somehow he looked much older now he was coming closer it must be a lookalike perhaps an elder brother this had to be a coincidence parkin entered the compartment next to fabers there was no time left faber assumed the worst and prepared to deal with it he got up left the compartment and went along the corridor picking his way over suitcases and kitbags and bodies to the lavatory it was vacant he went in and locked the door he was only buying time even ticket inspectors did not fail to check the toilets he sat on the seat and wondered how to get out of this the train had speeded up and was travelling too fast for him to jump off besides someone would see him go and if they were really searching for him they would stop the train all tickets please parkin was getting close again faber had an idea the coupling between the carriages was a tiny space like an airlock enclosed by a bellowslike cover between the cars of the train shut off at both ends by doors because of the noise and draughts he left the lavatory fought his way to the end of the carriage opened the door and stepped into the connecting passage he closed the door behind him it was freezing cold and the noise was terrific faber sat on the floor and curled up pretending to sleep only a dead man could sleep here but people did strange things on trains these days he tried not to shiver the door opened behind him tickets please he ignored it he heard the door close wake up sleeping beauty the voice was unmistakable faber pretended to stir then got to his feet keeping his back to parkin when he turned the stiletto was in his hand he pushed parkin up against the door held the point of the knife at his throat and said be still or ill kill you with his left hand he took parkins flashlight and shone it into the young mans face parkin did not look as frightened as he ought to be faber said well well billy parkin who wanted to join the army and ended up on the railways still its a uniform parkin said you you know damn well its me little billy parkin you were looking for me why he was doing his best to sound vicious i dont know why i should be looking for you im not a policeman faber jerked the knife melodramatically stop lying to me honest mr faber let me goi promise i wont tell anyone ive seen you faber began to have doubts either parkin was telling the truth or he was overacting as much as faber himself parkins body shifted his right arm moving in the darkness faber grabbed the wrist in an iron grip parkin struggled for an instant but faber let the needle point of the stiletto sink a fraction of an inch into parkins throat and the man was still faber found the pocket parkin had bees reaching for and pulled out a gun ticket inspectors do not go armed he said who are you with parkin we all carry guns now theres a lot of crime on trains because of the dark parkin was at least lying courageously and creatively faber decided that threats were not going to be enough to loosen his tongue his movement was sudden swift and accurate the blade of the stiletto leaped in his fist its point entered a measured half inch into parkins left eye and came out again fabers hand covered parkins mouth the muffled scream of agony was drowned by the noise of the train parkins hands went to his ruined eye save yourself the other eye parkin who are you with military intelligence oh god please dont do it again who menzies masterman oh god godliman godliman godliman faber knew the name but this was no time to search his memory for details what have they got a picture i picked you out from the files what picture what picture a racing team running with a cup the army faber remembered christ where had they got hold of that it was his nightmare they had a picture people would know his face his face he moved the knife closer to parkins right eye how did you know where i was i dont do it please the embassy took your letter the cab euston please not the other eye he covered both his eyes with his hands goddamn that idiot francisco now he said whats the plan where is the trap glasgow theyre waiting for you at glasgow the train will be emptied there faber lowered the knife to the level of parkins belly to distract him he said how many men then he pushed hard inward and upward to the heart parkins one eye stared in horror and he did not die it was the drawback to fabers favoured method of killing normally the shock of the knife was enough to stop the heart but if the heart was strong it did not always workafter all surgeons sometimes stuck a hypodermic needle directly into the heart to inject adrenalin if the heart continued to pump the motion would work a hole around the blade from which the blood would leak it was just as fatal but longer at last parkins body went limp faber held him against the wall for a moment thinking there had been something a flicker of courage the ghost of a smile before the man died it meant something such things always did he let the body fall to the floor then arranged it in a sleeping position with the wounds hidden from view he kicked the railway cap into a corner he cleaned his stiletto on parkins trousers and wiped the ocular liquid from his hands it had been a messy business he put the knife away in his sleeve and opened the door to the car he made his way back to his compartment in the dark as he sat down the cockney said you took your time is there a queue faber said it must have been something i ate probably a driedegg sandwich the cockney laughed faber was thinking about godliman he knew the name he could even put a vague face to it a middleaged bespectacled face with a pipe and an absent professional air that was it he was a professor it was coming back in his first couple of years in london faber had had little to do the war had not yet started and most people believed it would not come faber was not among the optimists he had been able to do a little useful workmostly checking and revising the abwehrs outofdate maps plus general reports based on his own observations and his reading of the newspapersbut not much to fill in time to improve his english and to flesh out his cover he had gone sightseeing his purpose in visiting canterbury cathedral had been innocent although he did buy an aerial view of the town and the cathedral which he sent back for the luftwaffe not that it did much good they spent most of missing it faber had taken a whole day to see the building reading the ancient initials carved in walls distinguishing the different architectural styles reading the guidebook line by line as he walked slowly around he had been in the south ambulatory of the choir looking at the blind arcading when he became conscious of another absorbed figure by his side an older man fascinating isnt it the man said and faber asked him what he meant the one pointed arch in an arcade of round ones no reason for itthat section obviously hasnt been rebuilt for some reason somebody just altered that one i wonder why faber saw what he meant the choir was romanesque the nave gothic yet here in the choir was a solitary gothic arch perhaps he said the monks demanded to see what the pointed arches would look like and the architect did this to show them the older man stared at him what a splendid conjecture of course thats the reason are you an historian faber laughed no just a clerk and an occasional reader of history books people get doctorates for inspired guesses like that are youan historian i mean yes for my sins he stuck out his hand percy godliman was it possible faber thought as the train rattled on through lancashire that that unimpressive figure in a tweed suit could be the man who had discovered his identity spies generally claimed they were civil servants or something equally vague not historians that lie could be too easily found out yet it was rumoured that military intelligence had been bolstered by a number of academics faber had imagined them to be young fit aggressive and bellicose as well as clever godliman was clever but none of the rest unless he had changed faber had seen him once again although he had not spoken to him on the second occasion after the brief encounter in the cathedral faber had seen a notice advertising a public lecture on henry ii to be given by professor godliman at his college he had gone along out of curiosity the talk had been erudite lively and convincing godliman was still a faintly comic figure prancing about behind the lectern getting enthusiastic about his subject but it was clear his mind was as sharp as a knife so that was the man who had discovered what die nadel looked like an amateur well he would make amateur mistakes sending billy parkin had been one faber had recognised the boy godliman should have sent someone faber did not know parkin had a better chance of recognising faber but no chance at all of surviving the encounter a professional would have known that the train shuddered to a halt and a muffled voice outside announced that this was liverpool faber cursed under his breath he should have been spending the time working out his next move not remembering percival godliman they were waiting at glasgow parkin had said before he died why glasgow their inquiries at euston would have told them he was going to inverness and if they suspected inverness to be a red herring they would have speculated that he was coming here to liverpool this was the nearest link point for an irish ferry faber hated snap decisions whichever he had to get off the train he stood up opened the door stepped out and headed for the ticket barrier he thought of something else what was it that had flashed in billy parkins eyes before he died not hatred not fear not pain although all those had been present it was more like triumph faber looked up past the ticket collector and understood waiting on the other side dressed in a hat and raincoat was the blond young tail from leicester square parkin dying in agony and humiliation had deceived faber at the last the trap was here the man in the raincoat had not yet noticed faber in the crowd faber turned and stepped back onto the train once inside he pulled aside the blind and looked out the tail was searching the faces in the crowd he had not noticed the man who got back on the train faber watched while the passengers filtered through the gate until the platform was empty the blond man spoke urgently to the ticket collector who shook his head the man seemed to insist after a moment he waved to someone out of sight a police officer emerged from the shadows and spoke to the collector the platform guard joined the group followed by a man in a civilian suit who was presumably a more senior railway official the engine driver and his fireman left the locomotive and went over to the barrier there was more waving of arms and shaking of heads finally the railwaymen shrugged turned away or rolled their eyes upward all telegraphing surrender the blond and the police officer summoned other policemen and they moved on to the platform they were obviously going to search the train all the railway officials including the engine crew had disappeared in the opposite direction no doubt to seek out tea and sandwiches while the lunatic tried to search a jampacked train which gave faber an idea he opened the door and jumped out of the wrong side of the train the side opposite the platform concealed from the police by the cars he ran along the tracks stumbling on the ties and slipping on the gravel toward the engine it had to be bad news of course from the moment he realised billy parkin was not going to saunter off that train frederick bloggs knew that die nadel had slipped through their fingers again as the uniformed police moved onto the train in pairs two men to search each car bloggs thought of several possible explanations of parkins nonappearance and all the explanations were depressing he turned up his coat collar and paced the draughty platform he wanted very badly to catch die nadel and not only for the sake of the invasion although that was reason enough of course but for percy godliman and for the five home guards and for christine and for himself he looked at his watch four oclock soon it would be day bloggs had been up all night and he had not eaten since breakfast yesterday but until now he had kept going on adrenalin the failure of the traphe was quite sure it had faileddrained him of energy hunger and fatigue caught up with him he had to make a conscious effort not to daydream about hot food and a warm bed sir a policeman was leaning out of a car and waving at him sir bloggs walked toward him then broke into a run what is it it might be your man parkin bloggs climbed into the car what the hell do you mean might be youd better have a look the policeman opened the communicating door between the cars and shone his flashlight inside it was parkin bloggs could tell by the ticket inspectors uniform he was curled up on the floor bloggs took the policemans light knelt down beside parkin and turned him over he saw parkins face looked quickly away oh dear god i take it this is parkin the policeman said bloggs nodded he got up very slowly without looking again at the body well interview everybody in this car and the next he said anyone who saw or heard anything unusual will be detained for further questioning not that it will do us any good the murderer must have jumped off the train before it got here bloggs went back out on the platform all the searchers had completed their tasks and were gathered in a group he detailed six of them to help with the interviewing the policeinspector said your mans hopped it then almost certainly youve looked in every toilet and the guards van yes and on top of the train and under it and in the engine and the coal tender a passenger got off the train and approached bloggs and the inspector he was a small man who wheezed badly excuse me he said yes sir the inspector said i was wondering are you looking for somebody why do you ask well if you are i was wondering would he be a tall chap why do you ask bloggs interrupted impatiently yes a tall man come on spit it out well its just that a tall chap got out the wrong side of the train when a minute or two after the train pulled into the station he got on like then he got off on the wrong side jumped down onto the track only he had no luggage you see which was another odd thing and i just thought the inspector said balls he must have spotted the trap bloggs said but how he doesnt know my face and your men were out of sight something made him suspicious so he crossed the line to the next platform and went out that way wouldnt he have been seen the inspector shrugged not too many people about this late and if he was seen he could just say he was too impatient to queue at the ticket barrier didnt you have the other ticket barriers covered afraid i didnt think of it well we can search the surrounding area and later on we can check various places in the city and of course well watch the ferry yes please do bloggs said but somehow he knew faber would not be found it was more than an hour before the train started to move faber had a cramp in his left calf and dust in his nose he heard the engineer and fireman climb back into their cab and caught snatches of conversation about a body being found on the train there was a metallic rattle as fireman shovelled coal then the hiss of steam a clanking of pistons a jerk and a sigh of smoke as the train moved off gratefully faber shifted his position and indulged in a smothered sneeze he felt better he was at the back of the coal tender buried deep in the coal where it would take a man with a shovel ten minutes hard work to expose him as he had hoped the police search of the tender had consisted of one good long look and no more he wondered whether he could risk emerging now it must be getting light would he be visible from a bridge over the line he thought not his skin was now quite black and in a moving train in the pale light of dawn he would just be a dark blur on a dark background yes he would chance it slowly and carefully he dug his way out of his grave of coal he breathed deeply of the cool air the coal was shovelled out of the tender via a small hole in the front end later perhaps the fireman would have to enter the tender when the pile of coal got lower but he was safe for now as the light strengthened he looked himself over he was covered from head to toe in coal dust like a miner coming up from the pit somehow he had to wash and change his clothes he chanced a look over the side of the tender the train was still in the suburbs passing factories and warehouses and rows of grimy little houses he had to think about his next move his original plan had been to get off the train at glasgow and there catch another train to dundee and up the east coast to aberdeen it was still possible for him to disembark at glasgow he could not get off at the station of course but he might jump off either just before or just after however there were risks in that the train was sure to stop at intermediate stations between liverpool and glasgow and at those stops he might be spotted no he had to get off the train soon and find another means of transport the ideal place would be a lonely stretch of track just outside a city or village it had to be lonelyhe must not be seen leaping from the coal tenderbut it had to be fairly near houses so that he could steal clothes and a car and it needed to be an uphill grade of track so that the train would be travelling slowly enough for him to jump right now its speed was about forty miles an hour faber lay back on the coal to wait he could not keep a permanent watch on the country through which he was passing for fear of being seen he decided he would look out whenever the train slowed down otherwise he would lie still after a few minutes he caught himself dropping off to sleep despite the discomfort of his position he shifted and reclined on his elbows so that if he did sleep he would fall and be wakened by the impact the train was gathering speed between london and liverpool it had seemed to be stationary more than moving now it steamed through the country at a fine pace to complete his discomfort it started to rain a cold steady drizzle that soaked right through his clothes and seemed to turn to ice on his skin another reason for getting off the train he could die of exposure before they reached glasgow after half an hour at high speed he was contemplating killing the engine crew and stopping the train himself a signal box saved their lives the train slowed suddenly as brakes were applied it decelerated in stages faber guessed the track was marked with descending speed limits he looked out they were in the countryside again he could see the reason for the slowdown they were approaching a track junction and the signals were against them faber stayed in the tender while the train stood still after five minutes it started up again faber scrambled up the side of the tender perched on the edge for a moment and jumped he landed on the embankment and lay face down in the overgrown weeds when the train was out of earshot he got to his feet the only sign of civilisation nearby was the signal box a twostory wooden structure with large windows in the control room at the top an outside staircase and a door at groundfloor level on the far side was a cinder track leading away faber walked in a wide circle to approach the place from the back where there were no windows he entered a groundfloor door and found what he had been expecting a toilet a washbasin and as a bonus a coat hanging on a peg he took off his soaking wet clothes washed his hands and face and rubbed himself vigorously all over with a grubby towel the little cylindrical film can containing the negatives was still taped securely to his chest he put his clothes back on but substituted the signalmans overcoat for his own sopping wet jacket now all he needed was transport the signalman must have got here somehow faber went outside and found a bicycle padlocked to a rail on the other side of the small building he snapped the little lock with the blade of his stiletto moving in a straight line away from the blank rear wall of the signal box he wheeled the cycle until he was out of sight of the building then he cut across until he reached the cinder track climbed on the cycle and pedalled away percival godliman had brought a small camp bed from his home he lay on it in his office dressed in trousers and shirt trying without success to sleep he had not suffered insomnia for almost forty years not since he took his final exams at the university he would gladly swap the anxieties of those days for the worries that kept him awake now he had been a different man then he knew not just younger but also considerably less abstracted he had been outgoing aggressive ambitious he planned to go into politics he was not studious then he had reason to be anxious about the exams his two mismatched enthusiasms in those days had been debating and ballroom dancing he had spoken with distinction at the oxford union and had been pictured in the tatler waltzing with debutantes he was no great womaniser he wanted sex with a woman he loved not because he believed in any highminded principles to that effect but because that was the way he felt about it and so he had been a virgin until he met eleanor who was not one of the debutantes but a brilliant graduate mathematician with grace and warmth and a father dying of lung disease after forty years as a coal mine worker he had taken her to meet his people his father was lord lieutenant of the county and the house had seemed a mansion to eleanor but she had been natural and charming and not in the least awestruck and when percys mother had been disgracefully condescending to her at one point she had reacted with merciless wit for which he loved her all the more he had taken his masters degree then after the great war he taught in a public school and stood in three byelections they were both disappointed when they discovered they could not have children but they loved each other totally and they were happy and her death was the most appalling tragedy godliman ever knew it had ended his interest in the real world and he had retreated into the middle ages it had drawn him and bloggs together this common bereavement and the war had brought him back to life revived in him those characteristics of dash and aggression and fervour that had made him a fine speaker and teacher and the hope of the liberal party he wished very much for something in bloggs life to rescue him from an existence of bitterness and introspection at the moment he was in godlimans thoughts bloggs phoned from liverpool to say that die nadel had slipped through the net and parkin had been killed godliman sitting on the edge of the camp bed to speak on the phone closed his eyes i should have put you on the train thanks bloggs said only because he doesnt know your face i think he may bloggs said we suspect he spotted the trap and mine was the only face visible to him as he got off the train but where could he have seen you oh leicester square i dont see how but then we seem to underestimate him godliman asked impatiently have you got the ferry covered yes he wont use it of coursetoo obvious hes more likely to steal a boat on the other hand he may still be heading for inverness ive alerted the police up there good but look i dont think we can make any assumptions about his destination lets keep an open mind yes godliman stood picked up the phone and began to pace the carpet also dont assume it was he who got off the train on the wrong side work on the premise that he got off before at or after liverpool godlimans brain was in gear again sorting permutations and possibilities let me talk to the chief superintendent hes here there was a pause then a new voice said chief superintendent anthony speaking godliman said do you agree with me that our man got off this train somewhere in your area that seems likely yes all right now the first thing he needs is transport so i want you to get details of every car boat bicycle or donkey stolen within a hundred miles of liverpool during the next twentyfour hours keep me informed but give the information to bloggs and work closely with him following up the leads yes sir keep an eye on other crimes that might be committed by a fugitive theft of food or clothing unexplained assaults identity card irregularities and so on right now mr anthony you realise this man is more than just a conventional murderer i assume so sir from the fact of your involvement however i dont know the details its a matter of national security important enough to keep the prime minister in hourly contact with this office yes uh mr bloggs would like a word sir bloggs came back on have you remembered how you know his face you said you thought you did oh yes and its of no value as i predicted i met him by chance at canterbury cathedral and we had a conversation about the architecture all it tells us is that hes clever he made some perceptive remarks as i recall we knew he was clever as i said it does us no good chief superintendent anthony a determined member of the middle class with a carefully softened liverpool accent did not know whether to be peeved at the way mi ordered him about or thrilled at the chance to save england on his own manor bloggs recognised the mans conflicthed met with it before when working with local police forcesand he knew how to tip the balance in his own favour he said im grateful for your helpfulness chief superintendent these things dont go unnoticed in whitehall you know only doing our duty anthony was not sure whether he was supposed to call bloggs sir still theres a big difference between reluctant assistance and willing help yes well itll likely be a few hours before we pick up this mans scent again do you want to catch forty winks yes bloggs said gratefully if youve got a chair in a corner somewhere stay here anthony said indicating his office ill be down in the operations room ill wake you as soon as weve got something make yourself comfortable anthony went out and bloggs moved to an easy chair and sat back with his eyes closed immediately he saw godlimans face as if projected onto the backs of his eyelids like a film saying there has to be an end to bereavement i dont want you to make the same mistake bloggs reaized suddenly that he did not want the war to end that would make him face issues like the one godliman had raised the war made life simple he knew why he hated the enemy and he knew what he was supposed to do about it afterward but the thought of another woman seemed disloyal he yawned and slumped further into his seat his thinking becoming woolly as sleep crept up on him if christine had died before the war he would have felt very differently about remarrying he had always been fond of her and respected her of course but after she took that ambulance job respect had turned to nearawestruck admiration and fondness turned to love then they had something special something they knew other lovers did not share now more than a year later it would be easy for bloggs to find another woman he could respect and be fond of but he knew that would no longer be enough for him an ordinary marriage an ordinary woman would always remind him that once he a rather ordinary man had had the most extraordinary of women he stirred in his chair trying to shake off his thoughts so that he could sleep england was full of heroes godliman had said well if die nadel got away first things first someone shook him he was in a very deep sleep dreaming that he was in a room with die nadel but could not pick him out because die nadel had blinded him with a stiletto when he awoke he still thought he was blind because he could not see who was shaking him until he realised he simply had his eyes closed he opened them to see the large uniformed figure of superintendent anthony above him bloggs raised himself to a more upright position and rubbed his eyes got something he asked lots of things anthony said question is which of em counts heres your breakfast he put a cup of tea and a biscuit on the desk and went to sit on the other side of it bloggs left his easy chair and pulled a hard chair up to the desk he sipped the tea it was weak and very sweet lets get to it he said anthony handed him a sheaf of five or six slips of paper bloggs said dont tell me these are the only crimes in your area of course not anthony said were not interested in drunkenness domestic disputes blackout violations traffic offences or crimes for which arrests have already been made sorry bloggs said im still waking up let me read these there were three house burglaries in two of them valuables had been taken jewellery in one case furs in another bloggs said he might steal valuables just to throw us off the scent mark these on the map will you they may show some pattern he handed the two slips back to anthony the third burglary had only just been reported and no details were available anthony marked the location on the map a food office in manchester had been robbed of hundreds of ration books bloggs said he doesnt need ration books he needs food he set that one aside there was a bicycle theft just outside preston and a rape in birkenhead i dont think hes a rapist but mark it anyway bloggs told anthony the bicycle theft and the third of the house burglaries were close together bloggs said the signal box that the bike was stolen fromis that on the main line yes i think so anthony said suppose faber was hiding on that train and somehow we missed him would the signal box be the first place the train stopped at after it left liverpool it might be bloggs looked at the sheet of paper an overcoat was stolen and a wet jacket left in its place anthony shrugged could mean anything no cars stolen nor boats nor donkeys anthony replied we dont get many car thefts these days cars are easy to come by its petrol people steal i felt sure hed steal a car in liverpool bloggs said he thumped his knee in frustration a bicycle isnt much use to him surely i think we should follow it up anyway anthony pressed its our best lead all right but meanwhile doublecheck the burglaries to see whether food or clothing was pinched the victims might not have noticed at first show fabers picture to the rape victim too and keep checking all crimes can you fix me transport to preston ill get you a car anthony said how long will it take to get details of this third burglary theyre probably interviewing at this minute anthony said by the time you reach the signal box i should have the complete picture dont let them drag their feet bloggs reached for his coat ill check with you the minute i get there anthony this is bloggs im at the signal box dont waste any time there the third burglary was your man sure unless there are two buggers running around threatening people with stiletto knives who two old ladies living alone in a little cottage oh god dead not unless they died of excitement eh get over there youll see what i mean im on my way it was the kind of cottage that is always inhabited by two elderly ladies living alone it was small and square and old and around the door grew a wild rose bush fertilised by thousands of pots of used tea leaves rows of vegetables sprouted tidily in a little front garden with a trimmed hedge there were pinkandwhite curtains at the leaded windows and the gate creaked the front door had been painted painstakingly by an amateur and its knocker was made from a horseshoe bloggs knock was answered by an octogenarian with a shotgun he said good morning im from the police no youre not she said theyve been already now get going before i blow your head off bloggs regarded her she was less than five feet tall with thick white hair in a bun and a pale wrinkled face her hands were matchstickthin but her grasp on the shotgun was firm the pocket of her apron was full of clothespegs bloggs looked down at her feet and saw that she was wearing a mans working boots he said the police you saw this morning were local im from scotland yard how do i know that she said bloggs turned and called to his police driver the constable got out of the car and came to the gate bloggs said to the old lady is the uniform enough to convince you all right she said and stood aside for him to enter he stepped down into a lowceilinged room with a tiled floor the room was crammed with heavy old furniture and every surface was decorated with ornaments of china and glass a small coal fire burned in the grate the place smelled of lavender and cats a second old lady got out of a chair she was like the first but about twice as wide two cats spilled from her lap as she rose she said hello im emma parton my sister is jessie dont take any notice of that shotgunits not loaded thank god jessie loves drama will you sit down you look so young to be a policeman im surprised scotland yard is interested in our little robbery have you come from london this morning make the boy a cup of tea jessie bloggs sat down if were right about the identity of the burglar hes a fugitive from justice he said i told you jessie said we might have been done in slaughtered in cold blood dont be silly emma said she turned to bloggs he was such a nice man tell me what happened bloggs said well id gone out the back emma began i was in the hen coop hoping for some eggs jessie was in the kitchen he surprised me jessie interrupted i didnt have time to go for me gun you see too many cowboy films emma admonished her theyre better than your love films all tears and kisses bloggs took the picture of faber from his wallet is this the man jessie scrutinised it thats him arent you clever emma marvelled if we were so clever wed have caught him by now bloggs said what did he do jessie said he held a knife to my throat and said one false move and ill slit your gizzard i believe he meant it oh jessie you told me he said i wont harm you if you do as i say words to that effect emma bloggs said what did he want food a bath dry clothes and a car well we gave him the eggs of course we found some clothes that belonged to jessies late husband norman would you describe them yes a blue donkey jacket blue overalls a check shirt and he took poor normans car i dont know how well be able to go to the pictures without it thats our only vice you know the pictures what sort of car a morris norman bought it in its served us well that little car jessie said he didnt get his hot bath though well emma said i had to explain to him that two ladies living alone can hardly have a man taking a bath in their kitchen jessie said youd rather have your throat slit than see a man in his combinations wouldnt you you silly fool bloggs said what did he say when you refused he laughed emma said but i think he understood our position bloggs could not help but smile i think youre very brave he said i dont know about that im sure so he left here in a morris wearing overalls and a blue jacket what time was that about halfpast nine bloggs absently stroked a red tabby cat it blinked and purred was there much petrol in the car a couple of gallons but he took our coupons how do you ladies qualify for a petrol rations agricultural purposes emma said defensively she blushed jessie snorted and were isolated and were elderly of course we qualify we always go to the corn stores at the same time as the pictures emma added we dont waste petrol bloggs smiled and held up a hand all right dont worry rationing isnt exactly my department how fast does the car go emma said we never exceed thirty miles per hour bloggs looked at his watch even at that speed he could be seventyfive miles away by now he stood up i must phone the details to liverpool you dont have a telephone do you no what kind of morris is it a cowley norman used to call it a bullnose colour grey registration number mln bloggs wrote it all down emma said will we ever get our car back do you think i expect so but it may not be in very good condition when someone is driving a stolen car he generally doesnt take good care of it he walked to the door i hope you catch him emma called jessie saw him out she was still clutching the shotgun at the door she caught bloggs sleeve and said in a stage whisper tell me what is he escaped convict murderer rapist bloggs looked down at her her small green eyes were bright with excitement he bent his head to speak quietly in her ear dont tell a soul he murmured but hes a german spy she giggled with delight obviously she thought he saw the same films she did faber crossed the sark bridge and entered scotland shortly after midday he passed the sark toll bar house a low building with a signboard announcing that it was the first house in scotland and a tablet above the door bearing some legend about marriages which he could not read a quarter of a mile further on he understood when he entered the village of gretna he knew this was a place runaways came to get married the roads were still damp from the early rain but the sun was drying them rapidly signposts and nameboards had been reerected since the relaxation of invasion precautions and faber sped through a series of small lowland villages kirkpatrick kirtlebridge ecclefechan the open countryside was pleasant the green moor sparkling in the sunshine he had stopped for petrol in carlisle the pump attendant a middleaged woman in an oily apron had not asked any awkward questions faber had filled the tank and the spare can fixed to the offside running board he was very pleased with the little twoseater it would still do fifty miles an hour despite its age the fourcylinder cc sidevalve engine worked smoothly and tirelessly as he climbed and descended the scottish hills the leather upholstered bench seat was comfortable he squeezed the bulb horn to warn a straying sheep of his approach he went through the little market town of lockerbie crossed the river annan by the picturesque johnstone bridge and began the ascent to beattock summit he found himself using the threespeed gearbox more and more he had decided not to take the most direct route to aberdeen via edinburgh and the coast road much of scotlands east coast either side of the firth of forth was a restricted area visitors were prohibited from a tenmilewide strip of land of course the authorities could not seriously police such a long border nevertheless faber was less likely to be stopped and questioned while he stayed outside the security zone he would have to enter it eventuallylater rather than soonerand he turned his mind to the story he would tell if he were interrogated private motoring for pleasure had virtually ceased in the last couple of years because of the everstricter petrol rationing and people who had cars for essential journeys were liable to be prosecuted for going a few yards off their necessary route for personal reasons faber had read of a famous impresario jailed for using petrol supplied for agricultural purposes to take several actors from a theatre to the savoy hotel endless propaganda told people that a lancaster bomber needed gallons to get to the ruhr nothing would please faber more than to waste petrol that might otherwise be used to bomb his homeland in normal circumstances but to be stopped now with the information he had taped to his chest and arrested for a rationing violation would be an unbearable irony it was difficult most traffic was military but he had no military papers he could not claim to be delivering essential supplies because he had nothing in the car to deliver he frowned who travelled these days sailors on leave officials rare holidaymakers skilled workmen that was it he would be an engineer a specialist in some esoteric field like hightemperature gearbox oils going to solve a manufacturing problem in a factory at inverness if he were asked which factory he would say it was classified his fictitious destination had to be a long way from the real one so that he would never be questioned by someone who knew for certain there was no such factory he doubted whether consulting engineers ever wore overalls like the ones he had stolen from the elderly sisters but anything was possible in wartime having figured this out he felt he was reasonably safe from any random spot checks the danger of being stopped by someone who was looking specifically for henry faber fugitive spy was another problem they had that picture they knew his face he feared that before long they would have a description of the car in which he was travelling he did not think they would set up roadblocks as they had no way of guessing where he was headed but he was sure that every policeman in the land would be on the lookout for the grey morris cowley bullnose registration number mln if he were spotted in the open country he would not be captured immediately country policemen had bicycles not cars but a policeman would telephone his headquarters and cars would be after faber within minutes if he saw a policeman he decided he would have to ditch this car steal another and divert from his planned route however in the sparsely populated scottish lowlands there was a good chance he could get all the way to aberdeen without passing a country policeman the towns would be different there the danger of being chased by a police car was very great he would be unlikely to escape his car was old and relatively slow and the police were generally good drivers his best chance would be to get out of the vehicle and hope to lose himself in crowds or backstreets he contemplated ditching the car and stealing another each time he was forced to enter a major town the problem there was that he would be leaving a trail a mile wide for mi to follow perhaps the best solution was a compromise he would drive into the towns but try to use only the backstreets he looked at his watch he would reach glasgow around dusk and thereafter he would benefit from the darkness well it wasnt very satisfactory but the only way to be totally safe was not to be a spy as he topped the thousandfoothigh beattock summit it began to rain faber stopped the car and got out to raise the canvas roof the air was oppressively warm faber looked up the sky had clouded over very quickly thunder and lightning were promised as he drove on he discovered some of the little cars shortcomings wind and rain leaked in through several tears in the canvas roof and the small wiper sweeping the top half of the horizontally divided windscreen provided only a tunnellike view of the road ahead as the terrain became progressively more hilly the engine note began to sound faintly ragged it was hardly surprising the twentyyearold car was being pushed hard the shower ended the threatened storm had not arrived but the sky remained dark and the atmosphere foreboding faber passed through crawford nestling in green hills abington a church and a post office on the west bank of the river clyde and lesmahagow on the edge of a heathery moor half an hour later he reached the outskirts of glasgow as soon as he entered the builtup area he turned north off the main road hoping to circumvent the city he followed a succession of minor roads crossing the major arteries into the citys east side until he reached cumbernauld road where he turned east again and sped out of the city it had been quicker than he expected his luck was holding he was on the a road passing factories mines and farms more scots placenames drifted in and out of his consciousness millerston stepps muirhead mollinburn condorrat his luck ran out between cumbernauld and stirling he was accelerating along a straight stretch of road slightly downhill with open fields on either side as the speedometer needle touched fortyfive there was a sudden very loud noise from the engine a heavy rattle like the sound of a large chain pulling over a cog he slowed to thirty but the noise did not get perceptibly quieter clearly some large and important piece of the mechanism had failed faber listened carefully it was either a cracked ballbearing in the transmission or a hole in a big end certainly it was nothing so simple as a blocked carburetor or a dirty spark plug nothing that could be repaired outside a workshop he pulled up and looked under the bonnet there seemed to be a good deal of oil everywhere but otherwise he could see no clues he got back behind the wheel and drove off there was a definite loss of power but at least the car would still go three miles further on steam began to billow out of the radiator faber realised that the car would soon stop altogether he looked for a place to dump it and found a mud track leading off the main road presumably to a farm one hundred yards from the road the track curved behind a blackberry bush faber parked the car close to the bush and killed the engine the hiss of escaping steam gradually subsided he got out and locked the door he felt a twinge of regret for emma and jessie who would find it very difficult to get their car repaired before the end of the war he walked back to the main road from there the car could not be seen it might be a day or even two before the abandoned vehicle aroused suspicion by then faber thought i may be in berlin he began to walk sooner or later he would hit a town where he could steal another vehicle he was doing well enough it was less than twentyfour hours since he had left london and he still had a whole day before the uboat arrived at the rendezvous at six pm tomorrow the sun had set long ago and now darkness fell suddenly faber could hardly see fortunately there was a painted white line down the middle of the roada safety innovation made necessary by the blackoutand he was just able to follow it because of the night silence he would hear an oncoming car in ample time in fact only one car passed him he heard its deepthroated engine in the distance and went off the road a few yards to lie out of sight until it had gone it was a large car a vauxhall ten faber guessed and it was travelling at speed he let it go by then got up and resumed walking twenty minutes later he saw it again parked by the roadside he would have taken a detour across the field if he had noticed the car in time but its lights were off and its engine silent and he almost bumped into it in the darkness before he could consider what to do a flashlight shone up toward him from under the cars bonnet and a voice said i say is anybody there faber moved into the beam and asked having trouble ill say the light was pointed down and as faber moved closer he could see by the reflected light the moustached face of a middleaged man in a doublebreasted coat in his other hand the man held rather uncertainly a large wrench seeming unsure of what to do with it faber looked at the engine whats wrong loss of power the man said pronouncing it lorse of par one moment she was going like a top the next she started to hobble im afraid im not much of a mechanic he shone the light at faber again are you he finished hopefully not exactly faber said but i know a disconnected lead when i see one he took the flashlight from the man reached down into the engine and plugged the stray lead back onto the cylinder head try her now the man got into the car and started the engine perfect he shouted over the noise youre a genius hop in it crossed fabers mind that this might be an elaborate mi trap but he dismissed the thought in the unlikely event they knew where he was why should they tread softly they could as easily send twenty policemen and a couple of armoured cars to pick him up he got in the driver pulled away and moved rapidly up through the gears until the car was travelling at a good speed faber made himself comfortable the driver said by the way im richard porter faber thought quickly of the identity card in his wallet james baker how do you do i must have passed you on the road back there didnt see you faber realised the man was apologising for not picking him up everyone picked up hitchhikers since the petrol shortage its okay faber said i was probably off the road behind a bush answering a call of nature i did hear a car have you come far porter offered a cigar its good of you but i dont smoke faber said yes ive come from london hitchhiked all the way no my car broke down in edinburgh apparently it requires a spare part which isnt in stock so i had to leave it at the garage hard luck well im going to aberdeen so i can drop you anywhere along the way this was indeed a piece of good fortune he closed his eyes and pictured the map of scotland thats marvellous he said im going to banff so aberdeen would be a great help except i was planning to take the high road i didnt get myself a pass is aberdeen a restricted area only the harbour porter said anyway you neednt worry about that sort of thing while youre in my carim a jp and a member of the watch committee hows that faber smiled in the darkness thank you is that a fulltime job being a magistrate i mean porter put a match to his cigar and puffed smoke not really im semiretired yknow used to be a solicitor until they discovered my weak heart ah faber tried to put some sympathy into his voice hope you dont mind the smoke porter waved the fat cigar not a bit what takes you to banff im an engineer theres a problem in a factory actually the job is sort of classified porter held up his hand dont say another word i understand there was a silence for a while the car flashed through several towns porter obviously knew the road very well to drive so fast in the blackout the big car gobbled up the miles its smooth progress was soporific faber smothered a yawn damn you must be tired porter said silly of me dont be too polite to have a nap thank you said faber i will he closed his eyes the motion of the car was like the rocking of a train and faber had his arrival nightmare again only this time it was slightly different instead of dining on the train and talking politics with the fellowpassenger he was obliged for some unknown reason to travel in the coal tender sitting on his suitcase radio with his back against the hard iron side of the truck when the train arrived at waterloo everyone including the disembarking passengers was carrying a little duplicated photograph of faber in the running team and they were all looking at each other and comparing the faces they saw with the face in the picture at the ticket barrier the collector took his shoulder and said youre the man in the photo arent you faber found himself speechless all he could do was stare at the photograph and remember the way he had run to win that cup god how he had run he had peaked a shade too early started his final burst a quarter of a mile sooner than he had planned and for the last metres hed wanted to die and now perhaps he would die because of that photograph in the ticket collectors hand the collector was saying wake up wake up and suddenly faber was back in richard porters vauxhall ten and it was porter who was telling him to wake up his right hand was half way to his left sleeve where the stiletto was sheathed in the splitsecond before he remembered that as far as porter was concerned james baker was an innocent hitchhiker his hand dropped and he relaxed you wake up like a soldier porter said with amusement this is aberdeen faber noted that soldier had been pronounced soljuh and recalled that porter was a magistrate and a member of the police authority faber looked at the man in the dull light of early day porter had a red face and a waxed moustache his camelcoloured overcoat looked expensive he was wealthy and powerful in this town faber guessed if he were to disappear he would be missed almost immediately faber decided not to kill him faber said good morning he looked out of the window at the granite city they were moving slowly along a main street with shops on either side there were several early workers about all moving purposefully in the same direction fishermen faber reckoned it seemed a cold windy place porter said would you like to have a shave and a bit of breakfast before you continue your journey youre welcome to come to my place youre very kind not at all if it werent for you i should still be on the a at stirling waiting for a garage to open but i wont thank you i want to get on with the journey porter did not insist and faber suspected that he was relieved not to have his offer taken up the man said in that case ill drop you at george streetthats the start of the a and its a straight road to banff a moment later he stopped the car at a corner here you are faber opened the door thanks for the lift a pleasure porter offered a handshake good luck faber got out closed the door and the car pulled away he had nothing to fear from porter he thought the man would go home and sleep all day and by the time he realised he had helped a fugitive it would be too late to do anything about it he watched the vauxhall out of sight then crossed the road and entered the promisingly named market street shortly thereafter he found himself at the docks and following his nose arrived at the fish market he felt safely anonymous in the bustling noisy smelly market where everyone was dressed in working clothes as he was wet fish and cheerful profanities flew through the air and faber found it hard to understand the clipped guttural accents at a stall he bought hot strong tea in a chipped halfpint mug and a large bread roll with a slab of white cheese he sat on a barrel to eat and think this evening would be the time to steal a boat it was galling to have to wait all day and it left him with the problem of concealing himself for the next twelve hours but he was too close now to take risks and stealing a boat in broad daylight was much more risky than at the twilight end of the day he finished his breakfast and stood up it would be a couple of hours before the rest of the city came to life he would use the time to pick out a good hiding place he made a circuit of the docks and the tidal harbour the security was perfunctory and he noted several places where he could slip past the checkpoints he worked his way around to the sandy beach and set off along the twomile esplanade at the far end of which a couple of pleasure yachts were moored at the mouth of the river don they would have suited fabers purpose very well but they would have no fuel a thick ceiling of cloud hid the sunrise the air became very warm and thundery again a few determined holidaymakers emerged from seafront hotels and sat stubbornly on the beach waiting for sunshine faber doubted they would get it today the beach might be the best place to hide the police would check the railway station and the bus depot but they would not mount a fullscale search of the city they might check a few hotels and guest houses it was unlikely they would approach everyone on the beach he decided to spend the day in a deck chair he bought a newspaper from a stall and hired a chair he removed his shirt and put it back on over his overalls he left his jacket off he would see a policeman if one came well before he reached the spot where faber sat there would be plenty of time to leave the beach and vanish into the streets he began to read the paper there was a new allied offensive in italy the newspaper headlined faber was skeptical anzio had been a shambles the paper was badly printed and there were no photographs he read that the police were searching for one henry faber who had murdered two people in london with a stiletto a woman in a bathing suit walked by looking hard at faber his heart missed a beat then he realised she was being flirtatious for an instant he was tempted to speak to her it had been so long he shook himself mentally patience patience tomorrow he would be home she was a small fishing boat fifty or sixty feet long and broad in the beam with an inboard motor the aerial told of a powerful radio most of the deck was taken up with hatches to the small hold below the cabin was aft and only large enough to hold two men standing plus the dashboard and controls the hull was clinkerbuilt and newly caulked and the paintwork looked fresh two other boats in the harbour would have done as well but faber had stood on the quay and watched the crew of this one tie her up and refuel before they left for their homes he gave them a few minutes to get well away then walked around the edge of the harbour and jumped onto the boat she was called marie ii he found the wheel chained up he sat on the floor of the little cabin out of sight and spent ten minutes picking the lock darkness was coming early because of the cloud layer that still blanketed the sky when he had freed the wheel he raised the small anchor then jumped back onto the quay and untied the ropes he returned to the cabin primed the diesel engine and pulled the starter the motor coughed and died he tried again this time it roared to life he began to manoeuvre out of the mooring he got clear of the other craft at the quayside and found the main channel out of the harbour marked by buoys he guessed that only boats of much deeper draught really needed to stick to the channel but he saw no harm in being overcautious once outside the harbour he felt a stiff breeze and hoped it was not a sign that the weather was about to break the sea was surprisingly rough and the stout little boat lifted high on the waves faber opened the throttle wide consulted the dashboard compass and set a course he found some charts in a locker below the wheel they looked old and little used no doubt the boats skipper knew the local waters too well to need charts faber checked the map reference he had memorised that night in stockwell set a more exact course and engaged the wheelclamp the cabin windows were obscured by water faber could not tell whether it was rain or spray the wind was slicing off the tops of the waves now he poked his head out of the cabin door for a moment and got his face thoroughly wet he switched on the radio it hummed for a moment then crackled he moved the frequency control wandering the airwaves and picked up a few garbled messages the set was working perfectly he tuned to the uboats frequency then switched off it was too soon to make contact the waves increased in size as he progressed into deeper waters now the boat reared up like a bucking horse with each wave then teetered momentarily at the top before plunging sickeningly down into the next trough faber stared blindly out of the cabin windows night had fallen and he could see nothing at all he felt faintly seasick each time he convinced himself that the waves could not possibly get bigger a new monster taller than the rest lifted the vessel toward the sky they started to come closer together so that the boat was always lying with its stern pointed either up at the sky or down at the sea bed in a particularly deep trough the little boat was suddenly illuminated as clearly as if it were day by a flash of lightning faber saw a greygreen mountain of water descend on the prow and wash over the deck and the cabin where he stood he could not tell whether the terrible crack that sounded a second afterward was the thunderclap or the noise of the timbers of the boat breaking up frantically he searched the cabin for a life jacket there was none the lightning came repeatedly then faber held the locked wheel and braced his back against the cabin wall to stay upright there was no point in operating the controls now the boat would go where the sea threw it he kept telling himself that the boat must be built to withstand such sudden summer gales he could not convince himself experienced fishermen probably would have seen the signs of such a storm and refrained from leaving shore knowing their vessel could not survive such weather he had no idea where he was now he might be almost back in aberdeen or he might be at his rendezvous he sat on the cabin floor and switched on the radio the wild rocking and shuddering made it difficult to operate the set when it warmed up he experimented with the dials but could pick up nothing he turned the volume to maximum still no sound the aerial must have been broken off its fixing on the cabin roof he switched to transmit and repeated the simple message come in please several times then left the set on receive he had little hope of his signal getting through he killed the engine to conserve fuel he was going to have to ride out the storm if he could then find a way to repair or replace the aerial he might need his fuel the boat slid terrifyingly sideways down the next big wave and faber realised he needed the engine power to ensure that the vessel met the waves headon he pulled the starter nothing happened he tried several times then gave up cursing himself for switching it off the boat now rolled so far onto its side that faber fell and cracked his head on the wheel he lay dazed on the cabin floor expecting the vessel to turn turtle at any minute another wave crashed on the cabin shattering the glass in the windows and suddenly faber was under water certain the boat was sinking he struggled to his feet and broke surface all the windows were out but the vessel was still floating he kicked open the cabin door and the water gushed out he clutched the wheel to prevent himself being washed into the sea incredibly the storm continued to get worse one of fabers last coherent thoughts was that these waters probably did not see such a storm more than once in a century then all his concentration and will were focused on the problem of keeping hold of the wheel he should have tied himself to it but now he did not dare to let go long enough to find a piece of rope he lost all sense of up and down as the boat pitched and rolled on waves like cliffs galeforce winds and thousands of gallons of water strained to pull him from his place his feet slipped continually on the wet floor and walls and the muscles of his arms burned with pain he sucked air when he found his head above water but otherwise held his breath several times he came close to blacking out and only vaguely realised that the flat roof of the cabin had disappeared he got brief nightmarish glimpses of the sea whenever the lightning flashed he was always surprised to see where the wave was ahead below rearing up beside him or completely out of sight he also discovered with a shock that he could not feel his hands and looked down to see that they were still locked to the wheel frozen in a grip like rigour mortis there was a continuous roar in his ears the wind indistinguishable from the thunder and the sea the power of intelligent thought slipped slowly away from him in something that was less than a hallucination but more than a daydream he saw the girl who had stared at him earlier on the beach she walked endlessly toward him over the bucking deck of the fishing boat her swimsuit clinging to her body always getting closer but never reaching him he knew that when she came within touching distance he would take his dead hands from the wheel and reach for her but he kept saying not yet not yet as she walked and smiled and swayed her hips he was tempted to leave the wheel and close the gap himself but something in the back of his mind told him that if he moved he would never reach her so he waited and watched and smiled back at her from time to time and even when he closed his eyes he could see her still he was slipping in and out of consciousness now his mind would drift away the sea and the boat disappearing first then the girl fading until he would jerk awake to find that incredibly he was still standing still holding the wheel still alive then for a while he would will himself to stay conscious but eventually exhaustion would take over again in one of his last clear moments he noticed that the waves were moving in one direction carrying the boat with them lightning flashed again and he saw to one side a huge dark mass an impossibly high wave no it was not a wave it was a cliff the realisation that he was close to land was swamped by the fear of being hurled against the cliff and smashed stupidly he pulled the starter then hastily returned his hand to the wheel but it would no longer grip a new wave lifted the boat and threw it down like a discarded toy as he fell through the air still clutching the wheel with one hand faber saw a pointed rock like a stiletto sticking up out of the trough of the wave it seemed certain to impale the boat but the hull of the craft scraped the edge of the rock and was carried past the mountainous waves were breaking now the next one was too much for the vessels timbers the boat hit the trough with a solid impact and the sound of the hull splitting cracked in his ears like an explosion faber knew the boat was finished the water had retreated and faber realised that the hull had broken because it had hit land he stared in dumb astonishment as a new flash of lightning revealed a beach the sea lifted the ruined boat off the sand as water crashed over the deck again knocking faber to the floor but he had seen everything with daylight clarity in that moment the beach was narrow and the waves were breaking right up to the cliff but there was a jetty over to his right and a bridge of some kind leading from the jetty to the cliff top he knew that if he left the boat for the beach the next wave would kill him with tons of water or break his head like an egg against the cliff but if he could reach the jetty in between waves he might scramble far enough up the bridge to be out of reach of the water the next wave split the deck open as if the seasoned wood were no stronger than a banana skin the boat collapsed under faber and he found himself sucked backward by the receding surf he scrambled upright his legs like jelly beneath him and broke into a run splashing through the shallows toward the jetty running those few yards was the hardest physical thing he had ever done he wanted to stumble so that he could rest in the water and die but he stayed upright just as he had when he won the metre race until he crashed into one of the pillars of the jetty he reached up and grabbed the boards with his hands willing them to come back to life for a few seconds and lifted himself until his chin was over the edge then swung his legs up and rolled over the wave came as he got to his knees he threw himself forward the wave carried him a few yards then flung him against the wooden planking he swallowed water and saw stars when the weight lifted from his back he summoned the will to move again it would not come he felt himself being dragged inexorably back and a sudden rage took hold of him he would not allow it not now goddamn it he screamed at the fucking storm and the sea and the british and percival godliman and suddenly he was on his feet and running running away from the sea and up the ramp running with his eyes shut and his mouth open a crazy man daring his lungs to burst and his bones to break running with no sense of a destination but knowing he would not stop until he lost his mind the ramp was long and steep a strong man might have run all the way to the top if he were in training and rested an olympic athlete if he were tired might have got half way the average fortyyear old man would have managed a yard or two faber made it to the top a yard from the end of the ramp he felt a sharp pain like a slight heart attack and lost consciousness but his legs pumped twice more before he hit the sodden turf he never knew how long he lay there when he opened his eyes the storm still raged but day had broken and he could see a few yards away from him a small cottage that looked inhabited he got to his knees and began the long interminable crawl to the front door the u wheeled in a tedious circle her powerful diesels chugging slowly as she nosed through the depths like a grey toothless shark lieutenant commander werner heer her master was drinking ersatz coffee and trying not to smoke any more cigarettes it had been a long day and a long night he disliked his assignment he was a combat man and there was no combat to be had here and he thoroughly disliked the quiet abwehr officer with storybooksly blue eyes who was an unwelcome guest aboard his submarine the intelligence man major wohl sat opposite the captain the man never looked tired damn him those blue eyes looked around taking things in but the expression in them never changed his uniform never got rumpled despite the rigours of underwater life and he lit a new cigarette every twenty minutes on the dot and smoked it to a quarterinch stub heer would have stopped smoking just so that he could enforce regulations and prevent wohl from enjoying tobacco but he himself was too much of an addict heer had never liked intelligence people hed always had the feeling they were gathering intelligence on him nor did he like working with the abwehr his vessel was made for battle not for skulking around the british coast waiting to pick up secret agents it seemed to him plain madness to risk a costly piece of fighting machinery not to mention its skilled crew for the sake of one man who might well fail to show up he emptied his cup and made a face damn coffee he said tastes vile wohls expressionless gaze rested on him for a moment then moved away he said nothing forever cryptic to hell with him heer shifted restlessly in his seat on the bridge of a ship he would have paced up and down but men on submarines learn to avoid unnecessary movement he finally said your man wont come in this weather you know wohl looked at his watch we will wait until am he said easily it was not an orderwohl could not give orders to heerbut the bald statement of fact was still an insult to a superior officer heer told him so we will both follow our orders wohl said as you know they originate from a very high authority indeed heer controlled his anger the young man was right of course heer would follow his orders but when they returned to port he would report wohl for insubordination not that it would do much good fifteen years in the navy had taught heer that headquarters people were a law unto themselves well even if your man is fool enough to venture out tonight he is certainly not seaman enough to survive wohls only reply was the same blank gaze heer called to the radio operator weissman nothing sir wohl said i have a feeling that the murmurs we heard a few hours ago were from him if they were he was a long way from the rendezvous sir the radio operator said to me it sounded more like lightning heer added if it was not him it was not him if it was him he is now drowned you dont know this man wohl said and this time there was actually a trace of emotion in his voice heer didnt answer the engine note altered slightly and he thought he could distinguish a faint rattle if it increased on the journey home he would have it looked at in port he might do that anyway just to avoid another voyage with the unspeakable major wohl a seaman looked in coffee sir heer shook his head if i drink any more ill be pissing coffee wohl said i will please he took out a cigarette which made heer look at his watch it was ten past six the subtle major wohl had delayed his six oclock cigarette to keep the uboat there a few extra minutes heer said set a course for home one moment wohl said i think we should take a look on the surface before we leave dont be a fool heer said he knew that he was on safe ground now do you realise what kind of storm is raging up there we wouldnt he able to open the hatch and the periscope will show up nothing that is more than a few yards away how can you tell what the storm is like from this depth experience then at least send a signal to base telling them that our man has not made contact they may order us to stay here heer gave an exasperated sigh its not possible to make radio contact from this depth not with base wohls calm finally broke commander heer i strongly recommend you surface and radio home before leaving this rendezvous the man we are to pick up has vital information the fuehrer is waiting for his report heer looked at him thank you for letting me have your opinion major he said he turned away full ahead both he ordered the sound of the twin diesels rose to a roar and the uboat began to pick up speed part four when lucy woke up the storm that had broken out the evening before was still raging she leaned over the edge of the bed moving cautiously so that she would not disturb david and picked up her wristwatch from the floor it was just after six the wind was howling around the roof david could sleep on little work would be done today she wondered whether they had lost any slates off the roof during the night she would need to check the loft the job would have to wait until david was out otherwise he would be angry that she had not asked him to do it she slipped out of bed it was very cold the warm weather of the last few days had been a phony summer the buildup to the storm now it was as cold as november she pulled the flannel nightdress off over her head and quickly got into her underwear trousers and sweater david stirred she looked at him he turned over but did not wake she crossed the tiny landing and looked into jos room the threeyearold had graduated from a cot to a bed and he often fell out during the night without waking this morning he was on his bed lying asleep on his back with his mouth wide open lucy smiled he looked truly adorable when he was asleep she went quietly downstairs wondering briefly why she had awakened so early perhaps jo had made a noise or maybe it was the storm she knelt in front of the fireplace pushing back the sleeves of her sweater and began to make the fire as she swept out the grate she whistled a tune she had heard on the radio is you is or is you aint my baby she raked the cold ashes using the biggest lumps to form the base for todays fire dried bracken provided the tinder and wood and then coal went on top sometimes she just used wood but coal was better in this weather she held a page of newspaper across the fireplace for a few minutes to create an updraft in the chimney when she removed it the wood was burning and the coal glowing red she folded the paper and placed it under the coal scuttle for use tomorrow the blaze would soon warm the little house but a hot cup of tea would help meanwhile lucy went into the kitchen and put the kettle on the electric cooker she put two cups on a tray then found davids cigarettes and an ashtray she made the tea filled the cups and carried the tray through the hall to the stairs she had one foot on the lowest stair when she heard the tapping sound she stopped frowned decided it was the wind rattling something and took another step the sound came again it was like someone knocking on the front door that was ridiculous of course there was no one to knock on the front dooronly tom and he always came to the kitchen door and never knocked the tapping again she came down the stairs and balancing the tea tray on one hand opened the front door she dropped the tray in shock the man fell into the hall knocking her over lucy screamed she was frightened only for a moment the stranger lay prone beside her on the hall floor plainly incapable of attacking anyone his clothes were soaking wet and his hands and face were stonewhite with cold lucy got to her feet david slid down the stairs on his bottom saying what is it what is it him lucy said and pointed david arrived at the foot of the stairs clad in pyjamas and hauled himself into his wheelchair i dont see what there is to scream about he said he wheeled himself closer and peered at the man on the floor im sorry he startled me she bent over and taking the man by his upper arms dragged him into the living room david followed lucy laid the man in front of the fire david stared at the unconscious body where the devil did he come from he must have been shipwrecked the storm but he was wearing the clothes of a workman not a sailor lucy noticed she studied him he was quite a big man longer than the sixfoot hearth rug and heavy round the neck and shoulders his face was strong and fineboned with a high forehead and a long jaw he might be handsome she thought if he were not such a ghastly colour he stirred and opened his eyes at first he looked terribly frightened like a small boy waking in strange surroundings but very quickly his expression became relaxed and he looked about him sharply his gaze resting briefly on lucy david the window the door and the fire lucy said we must get him out of these clothes fetch a pair of pyjamas and a robe david david wheeled himself out and lucy knelt beside the stranger she took off his boots and socks first there almost seemed to be a hint of amusement in his eyes as he watched her but when she reached for his jacket he crossed his arms protectively over his chest youll die of pneumonia if you keep these clothes on she said in her best bedside manner let me take them off the man said i really dont think we know each other well enough after all we havent been introduced it was the first time he had spoken his voice was so confident his words so formal that the contrast with his terrible appearance made lucy laugh out loud youre shy she said i just think a man should preserve an air of mystery he was grinning broadly but his smile collapsed suddenly and his eyes closed in pain david came back with clean nightclothes over his arm you two seem to be getting on remarkably well already he said youll have to undress him lucy said he wont let me davids look was unreadable the stranger said ill manage on my own thanks if its not too awfully ungracious of me suit yourself david said he dumped the clothes on a chair and wheeled out ill make some more tea lucy said as she followed she closed the living room door behind her in the kitchen david was already filling the kettle a lighted cigarette dangling from his lips lucy quickly cleared up the broken china in the hall then joined him five minutes ago i wasnt at all sure the chap was alive and now hes dressing himself david said lucy busied herself with a teapot perhaps he was shamming the prospect of being undressed by you certainly brought about a rapid recovery i cant believe anyone could be that shy your own lack in that area may lead you to underestimate its power in others lucy rattled cups lets not quarrel today david weve got something more interesting to do for a change she picked up the tray and walked into the living room the stranger was buttoning his pyjama jacket he turned his back to her as she walked in she put the tray down and poured tea when she turned back he was wearing davids robe youre very kind he said his gaze was direct he really didnt seem the shy type lucy thought however he was some years older than sheabout forty she guessed that might account for it he was looking less of a castaway every minute sit close to the fire she told him she handed him a cup of tea im not sure i can manage the saucer he said my fingers arent functioning he took the cup from her stiffhanded holding it between both palms and carried it carefully to his lips david came in and offered him a cigarette he declined the stranger emptied the cup where am i he asked this place is called storm island david told him the man showed a trace of relief i thought i might have been blown back to the mainland david pointed the mans toes at the fire to warm his bare feet you were probably swept into the bay david said things usually are thats how the beach was formed jo came in blearyeyed trailing a onearmed panda as big as himself when he saw the stranger he ran to lucy and hid his face ive frightened your little girl the man smiled hes a boy i must cut his hair lucy lifted jo onto her lap im sorry the strangers eyes closed again and he swayed in his seat lucy stood up dumping jo on the sofa we must put the poor man to bed david just a minute david said he wheeled himself closer to the man might there be any other survivors he asked the mans face looked up i was alone he muttered he was very nearly all in david lucy began one more question did you notify the coastguard of your route what does it matter lucy said it matters because if he did there may be men out there risking their lives looking for him and we can let them know hes safe the man said slowly i did not thats enough lucy told david she knelt in front of the man can you make it upstairs he nodded and got slowly to his feet lucy looped his arm over her shoulders and began to walk him out ill put him in jos bed she said they took the stairs one at a time pausing on each when they reached the top the little colour that the fire had restored to the mans face had drained away again lucy led him into the smaller bedroom he collapsed onto the bed lucy arranged the blankets over him tucked him in and left the room closing the door quietly relief washed over faber in a tidal wave for the last few minutes the effort of selfcontrol had been superhuman he felt limp defeated and ill after the front door had opened he had allowed himself to collapse for a while the danger had come when the beautiful girl had started to undress him and he had remembered the can of film taped to his chest dealing with that had restored his alertness for a while he had also been afraid they might call for an ambulance but that had not been mentioned perhaps the island was too small to have a hospital at least he was not on the mainland there it would have been impossible to prevent the reporting of the shipwreck however the trend of the husbands questions had indicated that no report would be made immediately faber had no energy to speculate about problems further ahead he seemed to be safe for the time being and that was as far as he could go in the meantime he was warm and dry and alive and the bed was soft he turned over reconnoitring the room door window chimney the habit of caution survived everything but death itself the walls were pink as if the couple had hoped for a baby girl there was a train set and a great many picture books on the floor it was a safe domestic place a home he was a wolf in a sheepfold a lame wolf he closed his eyes despite his exhaustion he had to force himself to relax muscle by muscle gradually his head emptied of thought and he slept lucy tasted the porridge and added another pinch of salt they had got to like it the way tom made it the scots way without sugar she would never go back to making sweet porridge even when sugar became plentiful and unrationed again it was funny how you got used to things when you had to brown bread and margarine and salt porridge she ladled it out and the family sat down to breakfast jo had lots of milk to cool his david ate vast quantities these days without getting fat it was the outdoor life she looked at his hands on the table they were rough and permanently brown the hands of a manual worker she had noticed the strangers hands his fingers were long the skin white under the blood and the bruising he was unaccustomed to the abrasive work of crewing a boat you wont get much done today lucy said the storm looks like its staying makes no difference sheep still have to be cared for whatever the weather where will you be toms end ill go up there in the jeep jo said can i come not today lucy told him its too wet and cold but i dont like the man lucy smiled dont be silly he wont do us any harm hes almost too ill to move who is he we dont know his name hes been shipwrecked and we have to look after him until hes well enough to go back to the mainland hes a very nice man is he my uncle just a stranger jo eat up jo looked disappointed he had met an uncle once in his mind uncles were people who gave out candy which he liked and money which he had no use for david finished his breakfast and put on his macintosh a tentshaped garment with sleeves with a hole for his head and that covered most of his wheelchair as well as him he put a souwester on his head and tied it under his chin kissed jo said goodbye to lucy a minute or two later she heard the jeep start up and went to the window to watch david drive off into the rain the rear wheels of the vehicle slithered about in the mud he would have to take care she turned to jo he said this is a dog he was making a picture on the tablecloth with porridge and milk lucy slapped his hand what a horrid mess the boys face took on a grim sulky look and lucy thought how much he resembled his father they had the same dark skin and nearlyblack hair and they both had a way of withdrawing when they were cross but jo laughed a lot he had inherited something from lucys side of the family thank god jo mistook her contemplative stare for anger and said im sorry she washed him at the kitchen sink then cleared away the breakfast things thinking about the stranger upstairs now that the immediate crisis was past and it seemed the man was not going to die she was eaten with curiosity about him who was he where was he from what had he been doing in the storm did he have a family why did he have workmans clothes a clerks hands and a home counties accent it was rather exciting it occurred to her that if she had lived anywhere else she would not have accepted his sudden appearance so readily he might she supposed be a deserter or a criminal or even an escaped prisoner of war but one forgot living on the island that other human beings could be threatening instead of companionable it was so nice to see a new face that to harbour suspicions seemed ungrateful maybeunpleasant thoughtshe more than most people was ready to welcome an attractive man she pushed the thought out of her mind silly silly he was so tired and ill that he could not possibly threaten anyone even on the mainland who could have refused to take him in bedraggled and unconscious when he felt better they could question him and if his story of how he got here was less than plausible they could radio the mainland from toms cottage when she had washed up she crept upstairs to look at him he slept facing the door and when she looked in his eyes opened instantly again there was that initial splitsecond flash of fear its all right lucy whispered just making sure youre okay he closed his eyes without speaking she went downstairs again she dressed herself and jo in oilskins and wellingtqn boots and they went out the rain was still coming down in torrents and the wind was terrific she glanced up at the roof they had lost some slates leaning into the wind she headed for the cliff top she held jos hand tightly he might quite easily be blown away two minutes later she was wishing she had stayed indoors rain came in under her raincoat collar and over the tops of her boots jo must be soaked too but now that they were wet they might as well stay wet for a few minutes more lucy wanted to go to the beach however when they reached the top of the ramp she realised it was impossible the narrow wooden walkway was slippery with rain and in this wind she might lose her balance and fall off to plunge sixty feet to the beach below she had to content herself with looking it was quite a sight vast waves each the size of a small house were rolling in rapidly close on each others heels crossing the beach the wave would rise even higher its crest curling in a question mark then throw itself against the foot of the cliff in a rage spray rose over the cliff top in sheets causing lucy to step back hurriedly and jo to squeal with delight lucy could hear her sons laughter only because he had climbed into her arms and his mouth was now close to her ear the noise of the wind and the sea drowned more distant sounds there was something terribly thrilling in watching the elements spit and sway and roar in fury in standing fractionally too close to the cliff edge feeling threatened and safe at the same time shivering with cold and perspiring in fear it was thrilling and there were few thrills in her life she was about to go back mindful of jos health when she saw the boat it was not a boat any more of course that was what was so shocking about it all that was left were the large timbers of the deck and the keel they were scattered on the rocks below the cliffs like a dropped handful of matches it had been a big boat lucy realised one man might have piloted it alone but not easily and the damage the sea had wrought on it was awesome it was hard to detect two bits of wood still joined together how in heavens name had their stranger come out of it alive she shuddered when she thought of what those waves and those rocks might have done to a human body jo caught her sudden change of mood and said into her ear go home now she turned quickly away from the sea and hurried along the muddy path to the cottage back inside they took off their wet coats hats and boots and hung them in the kitchen to dry lucy went upstairs and looked in on the stranger again this time he did not open his eyes he seemed to be sleeping very peacefully yet she had a feeling that he had awakened and recognised her tread on the stairs and closed his eyes again before she opened the door she ran a hot bath she and the boy were soaked to the skin she undressed jo and put him in the tub then on impulse took off her own clothes and got in with him the heat was blissful she closed her eyes and relaxed this was good too to be in a house feeling warm while the storm beat impotently at the strong stone walls life had turned interesting all of a sudden in one night there had been a storm a shipwreck and a mystery man this after three years of she hoped the stranger would wake up soon so that she could find out about him meanwhile it was time she started cooking lunch for the men she had some breast of lamb to make a stew she got out of the bath and towered herself gently jo was playing with his bath toy a muchchewed rubber cat lucy looked at herself in the mirror examining the stretchmarks on her belly left by pregnancy they were fading slowly but they would never completely disappear an allover suntan would help though she smiled to herself fat chance of that besides who was interested in her tummy nobody but herself jo said can i stay in a minute more it was a phrase he used a minute more and it could mean anything up to a half a day just while i get dressed she told him and hung the towel on a rail and moved toward the door the stranger stood in the doorway looking at her they stared at each other it was odd lucy thought later that she felt not a bit afraid it was the way he looked at her there was no threat in his expression no lewdness no smirk he was not looking at her pubis or even her breasts but at her face into her eyes she looked back a bit shocked but not embarrassed with just a tiny part of her mind wondering why she did not squeal cover herself with her hands and slam the door on him something did come into his eyes at last perhaps she was imagining it but she saw admiration and a faint twinkle of honest humour and a trace of sadness and then the hold was broken and he turned away and went back into his bedroom closing the door a moment later lucy heard the springs creak as his weight settled onto the bed and for no good reason at all she felt dreadfully guilty percival godliman had by now pulled out all the stops every policeman in the united kingdom had a copy of the photograph of faber and about half of them were engaged full time in the search in the cities they were checking hotels and guest houses railway stations and bus terminals cafés and shopping cantres and the bridges arches and bombed lots where derelicts hung out in the country they were looking in barns and silos empty cottages and ruined castles thickets and clearings and cornfields they were showing the photograph to ticket clerks petrol station staff ferry hands and toll collectors all the passenger ports and airfields were covered with the picture pinned behind a board at every passport control desk the police of course still thought they were looking for a straightforward murderer the cop on the street knew that the man in the picture had killed two people with a knife in london senior officers knew a bit more that one of the murders had been a sexual assault another apparently motiveless and a thirdwhich their men were not to know ofwas an unexplained but bloody attack on a soldier on the eustontoliverpool train only chief constables and a few officers at scotland yard knew that the soldier had been on temporary attachment to mi and that all the murders were somehow connected with security the newspapers too thought it was an ordinary murder hunt the day after godliman had released details most of them had carried the story in their later editions the first editions bound for scotland ulster and north wales had missed it so they carried a shortened version a day later the stockwell victim had been identified as a labourer and given a false name and a vague london background godlimans press release had connected that murder with the death of mrs una garden in but had been vague about the nature of the link the murder weapon was said to be a stiletto the two liverpool newspapers heard very quickly of the body on the train and both wondered whether the london knife murderer was responsible both made enquiries with the liverpool police the editors of both papers received phone calls from the chief constable neither paper carried the story a total of one hundred and fiftyseven tall dark men were arrested on suspicion of being faber all but twentynine of them were able to prove that they could not possibly have committed the murders interviewers from mi talked to the twentynine twentyseven called in parents relatives and neighbours who affirmed that they had been born in britain and had been living there during the s when faber had been in germany the last two were brought to london and interviewed again this time by godliman both were bachelors living alone with no surviving relatives leading a transient existence the first was a welldressed confident man who claimed implausibly that his way of life was to travel the country taking odd jobs as a manual labourer godliman explained that unlike the police he had the power to incarcerate anyone for the duration of the war and no questions asked furthermore he was not in the least interested in ordinary peccadilloes and any information given him here at the war office was strictly confidential and would go no further the prisoner promptly confessed to being a confidence trickster and gave the address of nineteen elderly ladies whom he had cheated out of their old jewellery during the past three weeks godliman turned him over to the police he felt no obligation to be honest with a professional liar the last suspect also cracked under godlimans treatment his secret was that he was not a bachelor at all not by a long way he had a wife in brighton and in solihull birmingham and in colchester newbury and exeter all five were able to produce marriage certificates later that day the bigamist went to jail to await trial godliman slept in his office while the hunt went on bristol temple meads railway

i think i have served him when day before yesterday in the morning how sure are you well he was older than the picture but im pretty sure what was he driving a grey car im no good on makes this is my husbands business really but hes in the navy now well what did it look like it was the old sort with a canvas roof that comes up a twoseater sporty it had a spare petrol tank bolted to the running board and i filled that too do you remember what he was wearing not really working clothes i think a tall man yes taller than you have you got a telephone william duncan was twentyfive years old fivefeetten weighed a trim pounds and was in firstclass health his openair life and total lack of interest in tobacco drink late nights and loose living kept him that way yet he was not in the armed services he had seemed to be a normal child if a little backward until the age of eight when his mind had lost the ability to develop any further there had been no trauma that anyone knew about no physical damage to account for sudden breakdown indeed it was some years before anyone noticed that there was anything wrong for at the age of ten he was no more than a little backward and at twelve he was just dimwitted but by fifteen he was obviously simple and by eighteen he was known as daft willie his parents were both members of an obscure fundamentalist religious group whose members were not allowed to marry outside the church which may or may not have had anything to do with willies daftness they prayed for him of course but they also took him to a specialist in stirling the doctor an elderly man did several tests and then told them over the tops of his goldrimmed halfglasses that the boy had a mental age of eight and his mind would grow no older ever they continued to pray for him but they suspected that the lord had sent this to try them so they made sure willie was saved and looked forward to the day when they would meet him in the glory and he would be healed meanwhile he needed a job an eightyearold can herd cows but herding cows is nevertheless a job so daft willie became a cowherd and it was while herding cows that he saw the car for the first time he assumed there were lovers in it willie knew about lovers that is to say he knew that lovers existed and that they did unmentionable things to one another in dark places like copses and cinemas and cars and that one did not speak of them so he hurried the cows quickly past the bush beside which was parked the morris cowley bullnose twoseater he knew about cars too like any eightyearold and tried very hard not to look inside it in case he should behold sin he took his little herd into the cowshed for milking went by a roundabout route to his home ate supper read a chapter from leviticus to his father aloud painstakingly then went to bed to dream about lovers the car was still there on the evening of the next day for all his innocence willie knew that lovers did not do whatever it was that they did to one another for twentyfour hours at a stretch so this time he went right up to the car and looked inside it was empty the ground beneath the engine was black and sticky with oil willie devised a new explanation the car had broken down and had been abandoned by its driver it did not occur to him to wonder why it had been semiconcealed in a bush when he arrived at the cowshed he told the farmer what he had seen theres a brokendown car on the path up by the main road the farmer was a big man with heavy sandcoloured eyebrows which drew together when he was thinking was there nobody about no and it was there yesterday why did you not tell me yesterday then willie blushed i thought it was maybe you know lovers the farmer realised that willie was not being coy but was genuinely embarrassed he patted the boys shoulder well away home and leave it to me to deal with after the milking the farmer went to look for himself it did occur to him to wonder why the car was semiconcealed he had heard about the london stiletto murderer and while he did not jump to the conclusion that the car had been abandoned by the killer all the same he thought there might be a connexion between the car and some crime or other so after supper he sent his eldest son into the village on horseback to telephone the police in stirling the police arrived before his son got back from the phone there were at least a dozen of them every one apparently a nonstop tea drinker the farmer and his wife were up half the night looking after them daft willie was summoned to tell his story again repeating that he had first seen the car the previous evening blushing again when he explained that he had assumed it contained lovers all in all it was their most exciting night of the war that evening percival godliman facing his fourth consecutive night in the office went home to bathe change and pack a suitcase he had a service flat in a block in chelsea it was small though big enough for a single man and it was clean and tidy except for the study which the cleaning lady was not allowed to enter and as a consequence was littered with books and papers the furniture was all prewar of course but it was rather well chosen and the flat had a comfortable air there were leather club chairs and a gramophone in the iiving room and the kitchen was full of hardly used laboursaving devices while his bath was filling he smoked a cigarettehe had taken to them lately a pipe was too much fussand looked at his most valuable possession a grimly fantastic medieva scene that was probably by hieronymous bosch it was a family heirloom and godliman had never sold it even when he needed the money in the bath he thought about barbara dickens and her son peter he had not told anyone about her not even bloggs although he had been about to mention her during their conversation about remarrying but colonel terry had interrupted she was a widow her husband had been killed in action at the very beginning of the war godliman did not know how old she was but she looked about forty which was young for the mother of a twentytwoyearold boy she worked on decoding intercepted enemy signals and she was bright amusing and very attractive she was also rich godliman had taken her to dinner three times before the present crisis blew up he thought she was in love with him she had contrived a meeting between godliman and her son peter who was a captain godliman liked the boy but he knew something that neither barbara nor her son was aware of peter was going to france on dday and whether or not the germans were there waiting for him depended on whether they caught die nadel he got out of the bath and took a long careful shave and asked himself am i in love with her he was not sure what love ought to feel like in middle age not surely the burning passion of youth affection admiration tenderness and a trace of uncertain lust if they amounted to love he loved her and he needed to share his life now for years he had wanted only solitude and his research now the camaraderie of military intelligence was sucking him in the parties the allnight sessions when something big broke the spirit of dedicated amateurism the frantic pleasureseeking of people to whom death is always close and never predictable all these bad infected him it would vanish after the war he knew but other things would remain the need to talk to someone close about his disappointment and his triumphs the need to touch someone else at night the need to say there look at that isnt it fine war was gruelling and oppressive and frustrating and uncomfortable but one had friends if peace brought back loneliness godliman thought he would not be able to live with it right now the feel of clean underwear and a crisply ironed shirt was the ultimate luxury he put more fresh clothes in a case then sat down to enjoy a glass of whisky before returning to the office the military chauffeur in the commandeered daimler outside could wait a little longer he was filling a pipe when the phone rang he put down the pipe and lit a cigarette instead his phone was connected to the war office switchboard the operator told him that a chief superintendent dalkeith was calling from stirling he waited for the click of the connexion godliman speaking weve found your morris cowley dalkeith said without preamble where on the a just south of stirling empty aye broken down its been there at least twentyfour hours it was driven a few yards off the main road and hidden in a bush a halfwitted farm boy found it is there a bus stop or railway station within walking distance of the spot no so its likely our man had to walk or hitchhike after leaving the car aye in that case will you ask around were already trying to find out whether anyone local saw him or gave him a lift good let me know meanwhile ill pass the news to the yard thank you dalkeith well keep in touch goodbye sir godliman put the phone on the hook and went into his study he sat down with an atlas open to the road map of northern britain london liverpool carlisle stirling faber was heading for northeast scotland godliman wondered whether he should reconsider the theory that faber was trying to get out the best way out was west via neutral eire scotlands east coast however was the site of all sorts of military activity was it possible that faber had the nerve to continue his reconnaissance knowing that m was on his tail it was possible godliman decidedhe knew faber had a lot of gutsbut nevertheless unlikely nothing the man might discover in scotland could be as important as the information he already had therefore faber was getting out via the east coast godliman ran over the methods of escape which were open to the spy a light plane landing on a lonely moor a oneman voyage across the north sea in a stolen vessel a rendezvous with a uboat as bloggs had speculated off the coast a passage in a merchant ship via a neutral country to the baltic disembarking in sweden and crossing the border to occupied norway there were too many ways in any case the yard must be told of the latest development they would ask all scots police forces to try to find someone who had picked up a hitchhiker outside stirling godliman returned to the living room to phone but the instrument rang before he got there he picked it up godliman speaking a mr richard porter is calling from aberdeen oh godliman had been expecting bloggs to check in from carlisle put him on please hello godliman speaking ah richard porter here im on the local watch committee up here yes what can i do for you well actually old boy its terribly embarrassing godliman controlled his impatience go on this chappie youre looking forknife murders and so on well im pretty sure i gave the bally fellow a lift in my own car godliman gripped the receiver more tightly when night before last my car broke down on the a just outside stirling middle of the bally night along comes this chappie on foot and mends it just like that so naturally where did you drop him right here in aberdeen said he was going on to banff thing is i slept most of yesterday so it wasnt until this afternoon dont reproach yourself mr porter thank you for calling well goodbye godliman jiggled the receiver and the war office operator came back on the line godliman said get mr bloggs for me would you hes in carlisle hes holding on for you right now sir good hello percy what news were on his trail again fred he was identified in a garage in carlisle and he abandoned the morris just outside stirling and hitched a lift to aberdeen aberdeen he must be trying to get out through the east door when did he reach aberdeen probably early yesterday morning in that case he wont have had time to get out unless he was very quick indeed theyre having the worst storm in living memory up here it started last night and its still going on no ships are going out and its certainly too rough to land a plane good get up there as fast as you can ill start the local police moving in the meantime call me when you reach aberdeen im on my way when faber woke up it was almost dark through the bedroom window he could see the last streaks of grey being inked out of the sky by the encroaching night the storm had not eased rain drummed on the roof and overflowed from a gutter and the wind howled and gusted tirelessly he switched on the little lamp beside the bed the effort tired him and he slumped back onto the pillow it frightened him to be this weak those who believe that might is right must always be mighty and faber was sufficiently selfaware to know the implications of his own ethics fear was never far from the surface of his emotions perhaps that was why he had survived so long he was chronically incapable of feeling safe he understood in that vague way in which one sometimes understands the most fundamental things about oneself that his very insecurity was the reason he chose the profession of spy it was the only way of life which could permit him instantly to kill anyone who posed him the slightest threat the fear of being weak was part of the syndrome that included his obsessive independence his insecurity and his contempt for his military superiors he lay on the childs bed in the pinkwalled bedroom and inventoried his body he seemed to be bruised just about everywhere but apparently nothing was broken he did not feel feverish his constitution had withstood bronchial infection despite the night on the boat there was just the weakness he suspected it was more than exhaustion he remembered a moment as he had reached the top of the ramp when he had thought he was going to die and he wondered whether he had inflicted on himself some permanent damage with the last mindbending uphill dash he checked his possessions too the can of photographic negatives was still taped to his chest the stiletto was strapped to his left arm and his papers and money were in the jacket pocket of his borrowed pyjamas he pushed the blankets aside and swung himself into a sitting position with his feet on the floor a moment of dizziness came and went he stood up it was important not to permit himself the psychological attitudes of an invalid he put on the dressing gown and went into the bathroom when he returned his own clothes were at the foot of the bed clean and pressed underwear overalls and shirt suddenly he remembered getting up sometime during the morning and seeing the woman naked in the bathroom it had been an odd scene and he was not sure what it meant she was very beautiful he recalled he was sure of that he dressed slowly he would have liked a shave but he decided to ask his hosts permission before borrowing the blade on the bathroom shelf some men were as possessive of their razors as they were of their wives however he did take the liberty of using the childs bakelite comb he found in the top drawer of the chest he looked into the mirror without pride he had no conceit he knew that some women found him attractive and others did not and he assumed this was so for most men of course he had had more women than most men but he attributed this to his appetite not to his looks his reflection told him he was presentable which was all he needed to know he left the bedroom and went slowly down the stairs again he felt a wave of weakness and again he willed himself to overcome it gripping the bannister rail and placing one foot deliberately before the other until he reached the ground floor he paused outside the living room door and hearing no noise went on to the kitchen he knocked and went in the young couple were at the table finishing supper the woman stood up when he entered you got up she said are you sure you should faber permitted himself to be led to a chair thank you he said you really mustnt encourage me to pretend to be ill i dont think you realise what a terrible experience youve been through she said do you feel like food im imposing on you not at all dont be silly i kept some soup hot for you faber said youre so kind and i dont even know your names david and lucy rose she ladled soup into a bowl and placed it on the table in front of him cut some bread david would you im henry baker faber did not know why he had said that he had no papers in that name henry faber was the man the police were hunting so he was right to have used his james baker identity but somehow he wanted this woman to call him henry the nearest english equivalent of his real name heinrich he took a sip of the soup and suddenly he was ravenously hungry he ate it all quickly then the bread when hed finished lucy laughed she looked lovely when she laughed her mouth opened wide showing lots of even white teeth and her eyes crinkled merrily at the corners more she offered thank you very much i can see it doing you good the colour is coming back to your cheeks faber realised he felt physically better he forced himself to eat his second helping more slowly out of courtesy but he still relished it david said how did you happen to be out in this storm it was the first time he had spoken dont badger him david its all right faber said quickly i was foolish thats all this is the first fishing holiday ive been able to have since before the war and i just refused to let the weather spoil it are you a fisherman david shook his head sheep farmer do you have many employees just one old tom i suppose there are other sheep farms on the island no we live at this end tom lives at the other end and in between theres nothing but sheep faber nodded good very good a woman a cripple a child and an old man and he was already feeling much stronger how do you contact the mainland faber said theres a boat once a fortnight its due this monday but it wont come if the storm keeps up theres a radio transmitter in toms cottage but we can only use that in emergencies if i thought people might be searching for you or if you needed urgent medical help i should use it but as things are i dont feel its necessary theres little point nobody can come to fetch you off the island until the storm clears and when that happens the boat will come anyway of course fabers tone concealed his delight the problem of how to contact the uboat on monday had been nagging at the back of his mind he had seen an ordinary wireless set in the roses living room and he would if necessary have been able to rig up a transmitter from that but the fact that this tom had a proper radio made everything so much simpler what does tom need a transmitter for hes a member of the royal observer corps aberdeen was bombed in july of there was no air raid warning there were fifty casualties that was when they recruited tom its a good thing his hearing is better than his eyesight i suppose the bombers come from norway i suppose so lucy stood up lets go into the other room the two men followed her faber felt no weakness no dizziness he held the living room door for david who wheeled himself close to the fire lucy offered faber brandy he declined she poured one for her husband and herself faber sat back and allowed himself to study them lucy was really quite striking she had an oval face wideset eyes of an unusual catlike amber colour and an abundance of rich darkred hair under the mannish fishermans sweater and baggy trousers there was the suggestion of her very good fullish figure dressed up in silk stockings and say a cocktail sort of dress she might be very glamorous david was also handsome almost pretty except for the shadow of a very dark beard his hair was nearly black and his skin looked mediterranean he would have been tall if he had had legs in proportion to his arms faber suspected that those arms might be powerful muscled from years of pushing the wheels of the chair an attractive couple but there was something badly wrong between them faber was no expert on marriage but his training in interrogation techniques had taught him to read the silent language of the body to know from small gestures when someone was frightened confident hiding something or lying lucy and david rarely looked at one another and never touched they spoke to him more than to each other they circled one another like turkeys trying to keep in front of them a few square feet of vacant territory the tension between them was enormous they were like churchill and stalin obliged temporarily to fight side by side fiercely suppressing a deeper enmity faber wondered what the trauma was that lay at the back of their distance this cosy little house must be an emotional pressure cooker despite its rugs and its bright paintwork its floral armchairs and blazing fires and framed watercolours to live alone with only an old man and a child for company with this thing between them it reminded him of a play he had seen in london by an american called tennessee something abruptly david swallowed his drink and said i must turn in my backs playing up faber got to his feet im sorry ive been keeping you up david waved him down not at all youve been asleep all dayyou wont want to go back to bed right away besides lucy would like to chat im sure its just that i mistreat my backbacks were designed to share the load with the legs you know lucy said youd better take two pills tonight then she took a bottle from the top shelf of the bookcase shook out two tablets and gave them to her husband he swallowed them dry ill say good night he wheeled himself out good night david good night mr rose after a moment faber heard david dragging himself up the stairs and wondered just how he did it lucy spoke as if to cover the sound of david where do you live mr baker please call me henry i live in london i havent been to london for years theres probably not much of it left its changed but not as much as you might think when were you last there nineteenforty she poured herself another brandy since we came here ive only been off the island once and that was to have the baby one cant travel much these days can one what made you come here um she sat down sipped her drink and looked into the fire perhaps i shouldnt its all right we had an accident the day we got married thats how david lost his legs hed been training as a fighter pilot we both wanted to run away i think i believe it was a mistake but as they say it seemed like a good idea at the time its a reason for a healthy man to feel resentment she gave him a sharp look youre a perceptive man its obvious he spoke very quietly so is your unhappiness she blinked nervously you see too much its not difficult why do you continue if its not working i dont know quite what to tell youor herself for talking so openly to him do you want clichés the way he was before the vows of marriage the child the war if theres another answer i cant find good words for it maybe guilt faber said but youre thinking of leaving him arent you she stared at him slowly shaking her head how do you know so much youve lost the art of dissembling in four years on this island besides these things are so much simpler from the outside have you ever been married no thats what i mean why not i think you ought to be it was fabers turn to look away into the fire why not indeed his stock answer to himself was his profession but of course he could not tell her that and anyway it was too glib i dont trust myself to love anyone that much the words had come out without forethoughthe was astonished to noteand he wondered whether they were true a moment later he wondered how lucy had got past his guard when he had thought he was disarming her neither of them spoke for a while the fire was dying a few stray raindrops found their way down the chimney and hissed in the cooling coals the storm showed no sign of letting up faber found himself thinking of the last woman he had had what was her name gertrud it was seven years ago but he could picture her now in the flickering fire a round german face fair hair green eyes beautiful breasts muchtoowide hips fat legs bad feet the conversational style of an express train a wild inexhaustible enthusiasm for sex she had flattered him admiring his mind she said and adoring his body she had no need to tell him she wrote lyrics for popular songs and read them to him in a poor basement flat in berlin it was not a lucrative profession he visualised her now in that untidy bedroom lying naked urging him to do more bizarre and erotic things with her to hurt her to touch himself to lie completely still while she made love to him he shook his head slightly to brush away the memories he had not thought like that in all the years he had been celibate such visions were disturbing he looked at lucy you were far away she said with a smile memories he said this talk of love i shouldnt burden you youre not good memories very good and yours you were thinking too she smiled again i was in the future not the past what do you see there she seemed about to answer then changed her mind it happened twice there were signs of tension about her eyes i see you finding another man faber said as he spoke he was thinking why am i doing this he is a weaker man than david and less handsome but its at least partly for his weakness that you love him hes clever but not rich compassionate without being sentimental tender loving the brandy glass in her hand shattered under the pressure of her grip the fragments fell into her lap and onto the carpet and she ignored them faber crossed to her chair and knelt in front of her her thumb was bleeding he took her hand youve hurt yourself she looked at him she was crying im sorry he said the cut was superficial she took a handkerchief from her trousers pocket and staunched the blood faber released her hand and began to pick up the pieces of broken glass wishing he had kissed her when hed had the chance he put the shards on the mantel i didnt mean to upset you he said didnt he she took away the handkerchief and looked at her thumb it was still bleeding yes you did and god knows you have a bandage he suggested in the kitchen he found a roll of bandage a pair of scissors and a safety pin he filled a small bowl with hot water and returned to the living room in his absence she had somehow obliterated the evidence of tears on her face she sat passively limp while he bathed her thumb in the hot water dried it and put a small strip of bandage over the cut she looked all the time at his face not at his hands but her expression was unreadable he finished the job and stood back abruptly this was silly he had taken the thing too far time to disengage i think id better go to bed he said she nodded im sorry stop apologising she told him it doesnt suit you her tone was harsh he guessed that she too felt the thing had got out of hand are you staying up he asked she shook her head well he followed her through the hall and up the stairs and he watched her climb her hips moving gently at the top of the stairs on the tiny landing she turned and said in a low voice good night good night lucy she looked at him for a moment he reached for her hand but she turned quickly away entering her bedroom and closing the door without a backward look leaving him standing there wondering what was in her mind andmore to the pointwhat was really in his bloggs drove dangerously fast through the night in a commandeered sunbeam talbot with a soupedup engine the hilly winding scottish roads were slick with rain and in a few low places two or three inches deep in water the rain drove across the windscreen in sheets on the more exposed hilltops the galeforce winds threatened to blow the car off the road and into the soggy turf alongside for mile after mile bloggs sat forward in the seat peering through the small area of glass that was cleared by the wiper straining his eyes to make out the shape of the road in front as the headlights battled with the obscuring rain just north of edinburgh he ran over three rabbits feeling the sickening bump as the tyres squashed their small bodies he did not slow the car but for a while afterward he wondered whether rabbits normally came out at night the strain gave him a headache and his sitting position made his back hurt he also felt hungry he opened the window for a cold breeze to keep him awake but so much water came in that he was immediately forced to close it again he thought about die nadel or faber or whatever he was calling himself now a smiling young man in running shorts holding a trophy well so far faber was winning this race he was fortyeight hours ahead and he had the advantage that only he knew the route that had to be followed bloggs would have enjoyed a contest with that man if the stakes had not been so high so bloody high he wondered what he would do if he ever came face to face with the man id shoot him out of hand he thought before he killed me faber was a pro and you didnt mess with that type most spies were amateurs frustrated revolutionaries of the left or right people who wanted the imaginary glamour of espionage greedy men or lovesick women or blackmail victims the few professionals were very dangerous indeed they were not merciful men dawn was still an hour or two away when bloggs drove into aberdeen never in his life had he been so grateful for street lights dimmed and masked though they were he had no idea where the police station was and there was no one on the streets to give him direction so he drove around the town until he saw the familiar blue lamp also dimmed he parked the car and ran through the rain into the building he was expected godliman had been on the phone and godliman was now very senior indeed bloggs was shown into the office of alan kincaid a detective chiefinspector in his midfifties there were three other officers in the room bloggs shook their hands and instantly forgot their names kincaid said you made bloody good time from carlisle nearly killed myself doing it bloggs replied and sat down if you can rustle up a sandwich of course kincaid leaned his head out of the door and shouted something itll be here in two shakes he told bloggs the office had offwhite walls a plank floor and plain hard furniture a desk a few chairs and a filing cabinet it was totally unrelieved no pictures no ornaments no personal touches of any kind there was a tray of dirty cups on the floor and the air was thick with smoke it smelled like a place where men had been working all night kincaid had a small moustache thin grey hair and spectacles a big intelligentlooking man in shirtsleeves and braces he spoke with a local accent a sign that like bloggs he had come up through the ranks though from his age it was clear that his rise had been slower than bloggs bloggs said how much do you know about all this not much kincaid said but your governor godliman did say that the london murders are the least of this mans crimes we also know which department youre with so we can put two and two together about this faber what have you done so far bloggs asked kincaid put his feet on his desk he arrived here two days ago right that was when we started looking for him we had the pictures i assume every force in the country got them yes we checked the hotels and lodging houses the station and the bus depot we did it quite thoroughly although at the time we didnt know he had come here needless to say we had no results were checking again of course but my opinion is that he probably left aberdeen immediately a woman police constable came in with a cup of tea and a very thick cheese sandwich bloggs thanked her and greedily set about the sandwich kincaid went on we had a man at the railway station before the first train left in the morning same for the bus depot so if he left the town either he stole a car or he hitched a ride weve had no stolen cars reported so i figure he hitched he might have gone by sea bloggs said through a mouthful of wholemeal bread of the boats that left the harbour that day none was big enough to stow away on since then of course nothings gone out because of the storm stolen boats none reported bloggs shrugged if theres no prospect of going out the owners might not come to the harbour in which case the theft of a boat might go unnoticed until the storm ends one of the officers in the room said we missed that one chief we did kincaid said perhaps the harbourmaster could look around all the regular moorings bloggs suggested im with you kincaid said he was already dialling after a moment he spoke into the phone captain douglas kincaid aye i know civilised people sleep at this hour you havent heard the worst i want you to take a walk in the rain aye you heard me right kincaid put his hand over the mouthpiece you know what they say about seamens language its true he spoke into the phone again go round all the regular moorings and make a note of any vessels not in their usual spot ignoring those you know to be legitimately out of port give me the names and addresses and phone numbers if you have them of the owners aye aye i know ill make it a double all right a bottle and a good morning to you too old friend he hung up bloggs smiled salty if i did what he suggested i do with my truncheon id never be able to sit down again kincaid became serious itll take him about half an hour then well need a couple of hours to check all the addresses its worth doing although i still think he hitched a ride so do i bloggs said the door opened and a middleaged man in civilian clothes walked in kincaid and his officers stood up and bloggs followed kincaid said good morning sir this is mr bloggs mr bloggs richard porter they shook hands porter had a red face and a carefully cultivated moustache he wore a doublebreasted camelcoloured overcoat how do you do im the blighter that gave your chappie a lift to aberdeen most embarrassing he had no local accent bloggs said how do you do on first acquaintance porter seemed to be exactly the kind of silly ass who would give a spy a lift half across the country however bloggs realised the air of emptyheaded heartiness might also mask a shrewd mind he tried to be toleranthe too had made embarrassing mistakes in the last few hours i heard about the abandoned morris i picked him up at that very spot youve seen the picture yes of course i didnt get a good look at the chappie because it was dark for most of the journey but i saw enough of him in the light of the flashlight when we were under the hood and afterward when we entered aberdeen it was dawn by then if id only seen the picture id say it could have been him given the spot at which i picked him up so near to where the morris was found i say it was him i agree bloggs said he thought for a moment wondering what useful information he could get out of this man how did faber impress you porter said promptly he struck me as exhausted nervous and determined in that order also he was no scotsman how would you describe his accent neutral the accent minor public school home counties jarred with his clothes if you know what i mean he was wearing overalls another thing i didnt remark until afterwards kincaid interrupted to offer tea everyone accepted the policeman went to the door what did you talk about oh nothing much but you were together for hours he slept most of the way he mended the carit was only a disconnected lead but im afraid im helpless with machinesthen he told me his own car had broken down in edinburgh and he was going to banff said he didnt really want to go through aberdeen as he didnt have a restricted area pass im afraid i i told him not to worry about that said id vouch for him if we were stopped makes one feel such a bloody fool you know but i felt i owed him a favour he had got me out of a bit of a hole yknow nobodys blaming you sir kincaid said bloggs was but he didnt say so instead there are very few people who have met faber and can tell us what hes like can you think hard and tell me what kind of a man you took him to be he woke up like a soldier porter said he was courteous and seemed intelligent firm handshake i take notice of handshakes anything else something else about when he woke up porters florid face creased up in a frown his right hand went to his left forearm like this he demonstrated thats something bloggs said thatd be where he keeps the knife a sleevesheath nothing else im afraid and he said he was going to banff that means hes not i wager you told him where you were going before he told you where he was going i believe i did porter nodded well well either aberdeen was his destination or he went south after you dropped him since he said he was going north he probably didnt that kind of secondguessing could get out of hand kincaid said sometimes it does kincaid was definitely no fool did you tell him that youre a magistrate yes thats why he didnt kill you what good lord he knew youd be missed the door opened again the man who walked in said ive got your information and i hope it was fuckin worth it bloggs grinned this was undoubtedly the harbormaster a short man with cropped white hair smoking a large pipe and wearing a blazer with brass buttons kincaid said come in captain how did you get so wet you shouldnt go out in the rain fuck off the captain said bringing delighted expressions to the other faces in the room porter said morning captain good morning your worship kincaid said what have you got the captain took off his cap and shook drops of rain from its crown the marie ii has gone missing he said i saw her come in on the afternoon the storm began i didnt see her go out but i know she shouldnt have sailed again that day however it seems she did who owns her tam halfpenny i telephoned him he left her in her mooring that day and hasnt seen her since what kind of vessel is she bloggs asked a small fishing boat sixty feet and broad in the beam stout little craft inboard motor no particular stylethe fishermen round here dont follow the pattern book when they build boats let me ask you bloggs said could that boat have survived the storm the captain paused in the act of putting a match to his pipe with a very skillful sailor at the helm maybe maybe not how far might he have got before the storm broke not fara few miles the marie ii was not tied up until evening bloggs stood up walked around his chair and sat down again so where is he now at the bottom of the sea in all probability the bloody fool the captains statement was not without relish bloggs could take no satisfaction in the likelihood that faber was dead it was too inconclusive the discontent spread to his body and he felt restless itchy frustrated he scratched his chin he needed a shave ill believe it when i see it he said you wont please save your guesswork bloggs said we want your information not pessimism the other men in the room suddenly remembered that despite his youth he was the senior officer there lets if you dont mind review the possibilities one he left aberdeen by land and someone else stole the marie ii in that case he has probably reached his destination by now but he wont have left the country because of the storm we already have all the other police forces looking for him and thats all we can do about number one two hes still in aberdeen again we have this possibility covered were still looking for him three he left aberdeen by sea i think were agreed this is the strongest option lets break it down three a he found shelter somewhere or cracked up somewhere mainland or island three b he died he did not of course mention three c he transferred to another vesselprobably a uboatbefore the storm broke he probably didnt have time but he mightve and if he caught a uboat weve had it so might as well forget that one if he found shelter bloggs went on or was shipwrecked well find evidence sooner or latereither the marie ii or pieces of it we can search the coastline right away and survey the sea as soon as the weather clears sufficiently for us to get a plane up if hes gone to the bottom of the ocean we may still find bits of the boat floating so we have three courses of action to take we continue the searches already going on we mount a new search of the coastline working north and south from aberdeen and we prepare for an airsea search the minute the weather improves bloggs had begun to pace up and down as he spoke he stopped now and looked around comments the late hour had got to all of them bloggs sudden access of energy jerked them out of a creeping lethargy one leaned forward rubbing his hands another tied his shoelaces a third put his jacket on they wanted to go to work there were no comments no questions faber was awake his body probably needed sleep despite the fact that he had spent the day in bed but his mind was hyperactive turning over possibilities sketching scenarios thinking about women and about home now that he was so close to getting out his memories of home became near painfully sweet he thought of things like sausages fat enough to eat in slices and motor cars on the righthand side of the road and really tall trees and most of all his own language words with guts and precision hard consonants and pure vowels and the verb at the end of the sentence where it ought to be finality and meaning in the same climactic terminal thoughts of climaxes brought gertrud to mind again her face underneath his makeup washed away by his kisses eyes closing tight in pleasure then opening again to look with delight into his mouth stretched wide in a permanent gasp saying ja liebling ja it was silly he had led the life of a monk for seven years but she had no reason to do the same she would have bad a dozen men since faber she might even be dead bombed by the raf or murdered by the maniacs because her nose was half an inch too long or run over by a motor car in the blackout anyway she would hardly remember him he would probably never see her again but she was important she stood for something for him to think about he did not normally permit himself the indulgence of sentiment there was in his nature in any case a very cold streak and he cultivated it it protected him now though he was so close to success and he felt freenot to relax his vigilance but at least to fantasise a little the storm was his safeguard so long as it continued he would simply contact the uboat with toms radio on monday and its captain would send a dinghy into the bay as soon as the weather cleared if the storm ended before monday there was a slight complication the supply boat david and lucy would naturally expect him to take the boat back to the mainland lucy came into his thoughts in vivid fullcolour images he could not quite control he saw her striking amber eyes watching him as he made a bandage for her thumb her outline walking up the stairs in front of him even clad as she was in shapeless mans clothing her heavy rounded breasts as she stood naked in the bathroom and as the images developed into fantasy she leaned over the bandage and kissed his mouth turned back on the stairs and took him in her arms stepped out of the bathroom and placed his hands on her breasts he turned restlessly in the small bed cursing the imagination that sent him dreams the like of which he hadnt suffered since his schooldays at that time before hed experienced the reality of sex he had constructed elaborate sexual scenarios featuring the older women with whom he came into daily contact the starchy matron professor nagels dark thin intellectual wife the shopkeeper in the village who wore red lipstick and talked to her husband with contempt sometimes he put all three of them into one orgiastic fantasy when at age fifteen hed seduced classically a housemaids daughter in the twilight of a west prussian forest he let go of the imaginary orgies because they were so much better than the disappointing real thing as young heinrich he had been greatly puzzled by this where was the blinding ecstasy the sensation of soaring through the air like a bird the mystical fusion of two bodies into one the fantasies became painful reminding him of his failure to make them real later of course the reality improved and he formed the view that ecstasy came not from a mans pleasure in a woman but from each ones pleasure in each other he had voiced that opinion to his elder brother who seemed to think it banal a truism rather than a discovery and before long he saw it that way too he became a good lover eventually he found sex interesting as well as physically pleasant he was never a great seducer the thrill of conquest was not what he wanted but he was expert at giving and receiving sexual gratification without the experts illusion that technique was all for some women he was a highly desirable man and the fact that he didnt know this only served to make him even more attractive he tried to remember how many women he had had anna gretchen ingrid the american girl those two whores in stuttgart he could not recall them all but there could not have been more than about twenty and gertrud of course none of them he thought had been quite as beautiful as lucy he gave an exasperated sigh he had let this woman affect him just because he was close to home and had been so careful for so long he was annoyed with himself it was undisciplined he must not relax until the assignment was over and this was not over not quite not yet there was the problem of avoiding going back on the supply boat several solutions came to mind perhaps the most promising was to incapacitate the islands inhabitants meet the boat himself and send the boatman away with a cockandbull story he could say he was visiting the roses had come out on another boat that he was a relative or a birdwatcher anything it was too small a problem to engage his full attention at the moment later when and if the weather improved he would select something he really had no serious problems a lonely island miles off the coast with four inhabitants it was an ideal hideout from now on leaving britain was going to be as easy as breaking out of a babys playpen when he thought of the situations he had already come through the people he had killedthe five home guard men the yorkshire lad on the train the abwehr messengerhe considered himself now to be sitting pretty an old man a cripple a woman and a child killing them would be so simple lucy too lay awake she was listening there was a good deal to hear the weather was an orchestra rain drumming on the roof wind fluting in the eaves of the cottage sea performing glissandi with the beach the old house talked too creaking in its joints as it suffered the buffeting of the storm within the room there were more sounds davids slow regular breathing threatening but never quite achieving a snore as he slept deeply under the influence of a double dose of soporific and the quicker shallow breaths of jo sprawled comfortably across a camp bed beside the far wall the noise is keeping me awake lucy thought then immediately who am i trying to fool her wakefulness was caused by henry who had looked at her naked body and had touched her hands gently as he bandaged her thumb and who now lay in bed in the next room fast asleep probably he had not told her much about himself she realised only that he was unmarried she did not know where he had been born his accent gave no clue he had not even hinted at what he did for a living though she imagined he must be a professional man perhaps a dentist or a soldier he was not dull enough to be a solicitor too intelligent to be a journalist and doctors could never keep their profession secret for longer than five minutes he was not rich enough to be a barrister too selfeffacing to be an actor she would bet on the army did he live alone she wondered or with his mother or a woman what did he wear when he wasnt fishing did he have a motor car yes he would something rather unusual he probably drove very fast that thought brought back memories of davids twoseater and she closed her eyes tightly to shut out the nightmare images think of something else think of something else she thought of henry again and realisedacceptedthe truth she wanted to make love to him it was the kind of wish that in her scheme of things afflicted men but not women a woman might meet a man briefly and find him attractive want to get to know him better even begin to fail in love with him but she did not feel an immediate physical desire not unless she was abnormal she told herself that this was ridiculous that what she needed was to make love with her husband not to copulate with the first eligible man who came along she told herself she was not that kind all the same it was pleasant to speculate david and jo were fast asleep there was nothing to stop her from getting out of bed crossing the landing entering his room sliding nto bed next to him nothing to stop her except character good breeding and a respectable upbringing if she were going to do it with anybody she would do it with someone like henry he would be kind and gentle and considerate he would not despise her for offering herself like a soho streetwalker she turned over in the bed smiling at her own foolishness how could she possibly know whether he would despise her she had only known him for a day and he had spent most of that day asleep still it would be nice to have him look at her again his expression of admiration tinged with some kind of amusement it would be nice to feel his hands to touch his body to squeeze against the warmth of his skin she realised that her body was responding to the images in her mind she felt the urge to touch herself and resisted it as she had done for four years at least i havent dried up like an old crone she thought she moved her legs and sighed as a warm sensation spread through her this was getting unreasonable it was time to go to sleep there was just no way she would make love to henry or to anyone else tonight with that thought she got out of bed and went to the door faber heard a footfall on the landing and he reacted automaticalty his mind cleared instantly of the idle lascivious thoughts it had been occupied with he swung his legs to the floor and slid out from under the bedclothes in a single fluid movement then silently crossed the room to stand beside the window in the darkest corner the stiletto knife in his right hand he heard the door open heard the intruder step inside heard the door close again at that point he started to think rather than react an assassin would have left the door open for a quick escape and it occurred to him that there were a hundred reasons why it was impossible that an assassin should have found him here he ignored the thoughthe had survived this long by catering to the oneinathousand chance the wind dropped momentarily and he heard an indrawn breath a faint gasp from beside his bed enabling him to locate the intruders exact position he moved he had her on the bed face down with his knife at her throat and his knee in the small of her back before he accepted that the intruder was a woman and a splitsecond later acknowledged her identity he eased his grip reached out to the bedside table and switched on the light her face was pale in the dim glow of the lamp faber sheathed the knife before she could see it he took his weight off her body i am very sorry he said i she turned onto her back and looked up at him in astonishment as he straddled her it was outrageous but somehow the mans sudden reaction had excited her more than ever she began to giggle i thought you were a burglar faber said knowing he must sound ridiculous and where would a burglar come from may i ask the colour rushed back to her cheeks in a blush she was wearing a very loose oldfashioned flannel nightgown that covered her from her throat to her ankles her darkred hair spread across fabers pillow in disarray her eyes seemed very large and her lips were wet you are remarkably beautiful faber said quietly she closed her eyes faber bent over her and kissed her mouth her lips parted immediately and she returned his kiss with his fingertips he stroked her shoulders her neck and her ears she moved underneath him he wanted to kiss her for a long time to explore her mouth and savour the intimacy but he realised that she had no time for tenderness she reached inside his pyjama bottoms and squeezed she moaned softly and began to breathe hard still kissing her faber reached for the light and killed it he pulled away from her and took off his pyjama jacket quickly so that she would not wonder what he was doing he tugged at the can stuck to his chest ignoring the sting as the sticky tape was jerked away from his skin he slid the photographs under the bed he also unbuttoned the sheath on his left forearm and dropped that he pushed the skirt of her nightgown up to her waist quickly she said quickly faber lowered his body to hers she did not feel the least bit guilty afterward just content satisfied replete she had had what she so badly wanted she lay still eyes closed stroking the bristly hair at the back of his neck enjoying the rough tickling sensation on her hands after a while she said i was in such a rush its not over yet he told her she frowned in the dark didnt you she had been wondering no i didnt you hardly did she smiled i beg to differ he turned on the light and looked at her well see he slipped down the bed between her thighs and kissed her belly his tongue flicked in and out of her navel it felt quite nice she thought his head went lower surely he doesnt want to kiss me there he did and he did more than kiss his lips pulled at the soft folds of her skin she was paralysed by shock as his tongue began to probe in the crevices and then as he parted her lips with his fingers to thrust deep inside her finally his relentless tongue found a tiny sensitive place so small she had not known it existed so sensitive that his touch was almost painful at first she forgot her shock as she was overwhelmed by the most piercing sensation she had ever experienced unable to restrain herself she moved her hips up and down faster and faster rubbing her slippery flesh over his mouth his chin his nose his forehead totally absorbed in her own pleasure it built and built feeding on itself until she felt utterly possessed by joy and opened her mouth to scream at which point he clapped his hand over her face but she screamed in her throat as the climax went on and on ending in something that felt like an explosion and left her so drained that she thought she would never never be able to get up her mind seemed to go blank for a while she knew vaguely that he still lay between her legs his bristly cheek against the soft inside of her thigh his lips moving gently affectionately eventually she said now i know what lawrence means he lifted his head i dont understand she sighed i didnt realise it could be like that it was lovely was oh god ive no more energy he changed position kneeling astride her chest and she realised what he wanted her to do and for the second time she was frozen by shock it was just too big but suddenly she wanted to do it she needed to take him into her mouth she lifted her head and her lips closed around him and he gave a soft groan he held her head in his hands moving it to and fro moaning quietly she looked at his face he was staring at her drinking in the sight of what she was doing she wondered what she would do when he came and she decided she didnt care because everything else had been so good with him that she knew she would enjoy even that but it didnt happen when she thought he was to the point of losing control he stopped moved away lay on top of her and entered her again this time it was very slow and relaxed like the rhythm of the sea on the beach until he put his hands under her hips and grasped the mounts of her bottom and she looked at his face and knew that now now he was ready to shed his selfcontrol and lose himself in her and that excited her more than anything so that when he finally arched his back his face screwed up into a mask of pain and groaned deep in his chest she wrapped her legs around his waist and abandoned herself to the ecstasy of it and then after so long she heard the trumpets and cymbals that lawrence had promised they were quiet for a long time lucy felt warm as if she were glowing she had never felt so warm in all her life when their breathing subsided she could hear the storm outside henry was heavy on top of her but she did not want him to move she liked his weight and the faint tang of perspiration from his white skin from time to time he moved his head to brush his lips against her cheek he was the perfect man to have this with he knew more about her body than she did his own body was very beautiful broad and muscular at the shoulders narrow at the waist and hips with long strong hairy legs she thought he had some scars she was not sure strong gentle and handsome perfect she also knew she would never fall in love with him never want to run off with him marry him deep inside him she sensed there was also something quite cold and hard his reaction and explanation when she came into his room was extraordinary she wouldnt think about it some part of him that was committed elsewhere she would have to hold him at arms length and use him cautiously like an addictive drug not that she would have much time to become addicted he would after all be gone in little more than a day she stirred and he immediately rolled off her and onto his back she lifted herself on one elbow and looked at his naked body yes he did have scars a long one on his chest and a small mark like a starit might have been a burnon his hip she rubbed his chest with the palm of her hand its not very ladylike she said but i want to say thank you he reached out to touch her cheek and smiled youre very ladylike you dont know what youve done youve he put a finger over her lips i know what ive done she bit his finger then put his hand on her breast he felt for her nipple she said please do it again i dont think i can he said but he did she left him a couple of hours after dawn there was a small noise from the other bedroom and she seemed suddenly to remember that she had a husband and a son in the house faber wanted to tell her that it didnt matter that neither he nor she had the least reason to care what the husband knew or thought but he held his tongue and let her go she kissed him once more very wetly then she stood up smoothed her rumpled nightgown over her body and went out he watched her fondly shes quite something he thought he lay on his back and looked at the ceiling she was quite naive and very inexperienced but all the same she had been very good i could perhaps fall in love with her he thought he got up and retrieved the film can and the knife in its sheath from under the bed he wondered whether to keep them on his person he might want to make love to her in the day he decided to wear the knifehe would feel undressed without itand leave the can elsewhere he put it on top of the chest of drawers and covered it with his papers and his wallet he knew very well that he was breaking the rule but this was certain to be his last assignment and he felt entitled to enjoy a woman besides it would hardly matter if she or her husband saw the picturesassuming they understood their meaning which was unlikely what could they do he lay down on the bed then got up again years of training simply would not allow him to take such risks he put the can with his papers into the pocket of his jacket now he could relax better he heard the childs voice then lucys tread as she went down the stairs and then david dragging himself to the bathroom he would have to get up and have breakfast with the household it was all right he did not want to sleep now anyway he stood at the rainstreaked window watching the weather rage until he heard the bathroom door open then he put on his pyjama top and went in to shave he used davids razor without permission it did not seem to matter now erwin rommel knew from the start that he was going to quarrel with heinz guderian general guderian was exactly the kind of aristocratic prussian officer rommel hated he had known him for some time they had both in their early days commanded the goslar jaeger battalion and they had met again during the polish campaign when he left africa he had recommended guderian to succeed him knowing the battle was lost the manoeuvre was a failure because at that time guderian had been out of favour with hitler and the recommendation was rejected out of hand the general was rommel felt the kind of man who put a silk handkerchief on his knee to protect the crease in his trousers while he sat drinking in the herrenklub he was an officer because his father had been an officer and his grandfather had been rich rommel the schoolteachers son who had risen from lieutenant colonel to field marshal in only four years despised the military caste of which he had never been a member now he stared across the table at the general who was sipping brandy appropriated from the french rothschilds guderian and his sidekick general van geyr had come to rommels headquarters at la roche guyon in northern france to tell him how to deploy his troops rommes reactions to such visits ranged from impatience to fury in his view the general staff were there to provide reliable intelligence and regular supplies and he knew from his experience in africa that they were incompetent at both tasks guderian had a cropped lightcoloured moustache and the corners of his eyes were heavily wrinkled so that he always appeared to be grinning at you he was tall and handsome which did nothing to endear him to a short ugly balding man as rommel thought of himself he seemed relaxed and any german general who would relax at this stage of the war was surely a fool the meal they had just finishedlocal veal and wine from further southwas no excuse rommel looked out of the window and watched the rain dripping from the lime trees into the courtyard while he waited for guderian to begin the discussion when he finally spoke it was clear the general had been thinking about the best way to make his point and had decided to approach it sideways in turkey he began the british ninth and tenth armies with the turkish army are grouping at the border with greece in yugoslavia the partisans are also concentrating the french in algeria are preparing to invade the riviera the russians appear to be mounting an amphibious invasion of sweden in italy the allies are ready to march on rome there are smaller signals a general kidnapped in crete an intelligence officer murdered at lyon a radar post attacked at rhodes an aircraft sabotaged with abrasive grease and destroyed at athens a commando raid on sagvaag an explosion in the oxygen factory at boulognesurseine a train derailed in the ardennes a petrol dump fired at boussens i could go on the picture is clear in occupied territories there is everincreasing sabotage and treachery on our borders we see preparations for invasion everywhere none of us doubts that there will be a major allied offensive this summer and we can be equally sure that all this skirmishing is intended to confuse us about where the attack will come the general paused the lecture delivered in schoolmaster style was irritating rommel and he took the opportunity to interrupt this is why we have a general staff to digest such information evaluate enemy activity and forecast his future moves guderian smiled indulgently we must also be aware of the limitations of such crystalgazing you have your ideas about where the attack will come im sure we all do our strategy must take into account the possibility that our guesses are wrong rommel now saw where the generals roundabout argument was leading and he suppressed the urge to shout his disagreement before the conclusion was stated you have four armoured divisions under your command guderian continued the nd panzers at amiens the th at rouen the st at caen and the nd ss at toulouse general von geyr has already proposed to you that these should be grouped well back from the coast all together ready for fast retaliation at any point indeed this stratagem is a principle of okw policy nevertheless you have not only resisted van geyrs suggestion but have in fact moved the st right up to the atlantic coast and the other three must be moved to the coast as soon as possible rommel burst out when will you people learn the allies control the air once the invasion is launched there will be no further major movements of armour mobile operations are no longer possible if your precious panzers are in paris when the allies land on the coast they will stay in paris pinned down by the raf until the allies march along the boulevard stmichel i knowtheyve done it to me twice he paused to draw breath to group our armour as a mobile reserve is to make it useless there will be no counterattack the invasion must be met on the beaches when it is most vulnerable and pushed back into the sea the flush receded from his face as he began to expound his own defensive strategy i have created underwater obstacles strengthened the atlantic wall laid minefields and driven stakes into every meadow that might be used to land aircraft behind our lines all my troops are engaged in digging defences whenever theyre not actually training my armoured divisions must be moved to the coast the okw reserve should be redeployed in france the ninth and tenth ss divisions have to be brought back from the eastern front our whole strategy must be to prevent the allies from securing a beachhead because once they achieve that the battle is lost perhaps even the war guderian leaned forward his eyes narrowing in that infuriating halfgrin you want us to defend the european coastline from tromso in norway and around the iberian peninsula to rome where shall we get the armies from that question should have been asked in rommel muttered there was an embarrassed silence after this remark which was all the more shocking coming from the notoriously apolitical rommel von geyr broke the tension where do you believe the attack will come from field marshal rommel had been waiting for this until recently i was convinced of the pas de calais theory however last time i was with the fuehrer i was impressed by his arguments in favour of normandy i am also impressed by his instinct and even more by its record of accuracy therefore i believe our panzers should be deployed primarily along the normandy coast with perhaps one division at the mouth of the somme this last supported by forces outside my group guderian shook his head no no no its far too risky im prepared to take this argument to hitler rommel threatened then thats what you will have to do guderian said because i wont go along with your plan unless well rommel was surprised that the generals position might be qualified guderian shifted in his seat reluctant to give a concession to so stubborn an antagonist as rommel you may know that the fuehrer is waiting for a report from an unusually effective agent in england i remember rommel nodded die nadel yes he has been assigned to assess the strength of the first united states army group under pattons command in the eastern part of england if he findsas i am certain he willthat that army is large strong and ready to move then i shall continue to oppose you however if he finds that fusag is somehow a bluffa small army masquerading as an invasion forcethen i shall concede that you are right and you shall have your panzers will you accept that compromise rommel nodded his large head in assent it depends on die nadel then part five the cottage was terribly small lucy realised quite suddenly as she went about her morning chores lighting the stove making porridge tidying up dressing jo the walls seemed to press in on her after all it was only four rooms linked by a little passage with a staircase you couldnt move without bumping into someone else if you stood still and listened you could hear what everyone was doing henry was running water into the washbasin david sliding down the stairs jo chastising his teddy bear in the living room lucy would have liked some time on her own before meeting people time to let the events of the night settle into her memory recede from the forefront of her thoughts so that she could act normally without a conscious effort she guessed she was not going to be good at deception it did not come naturally to her she had no experience at it she tried to think of another occasion in her life when she had deceived someone close to her and she could not it was not that she lived by such lofty principles the thought of lying did not trouble her so much it was mostly that she had just never had reason for dishonesty david and jo sat down at the kitchen table and began to eat david was silent jo talked nonstop just for the pleasure of making words lucy did not want food arent you eating david asked casually ive had some there her first lie it wasnt so bad the storm made the claustrophobia worse the rain was so heavy that lucy could hardly see the barn from the kitchen window one felt even more shut in when to open a door or window was a major operation the low steelgrey sky and the wisps of mist created a permanent twilight in the garden the rain ran in rivers between the rows of potato plants and the herb patch was a shallow pond the sparrows nest under the disused outhouse roof had been washed away and the birds flitted in and out of the eaves panicking lucy heard henry coming down the stairs and she felt better for some reason she was quite sure that he was very good at deception good morning faber said heartily david sitting at the table in his wheelchair looked up and nodded pleasantly lucy busied herself at the stove there was guilt written all over her face faber noted and he groaned inwardly but david did not seem to notice his wifes expression faber began to think that david was rather obtuse at least about his wife lucy said sit down and have some breakfast thank you very much david said cant offer to take you to church im afraid hymnsinging on the wireless is the best we can do faber realised it was sunday are you churchgoing people no david said you no sunday is much the same as any other day for farmers david continued ill be driving over to the other end of the island to see my shepherd you could come if you feel up to it id like to faber told him it would give him a chance to reconnoitre he would need to know the way to the cottage where the transmitter was would you like me to drive you david looked at him sharply i can manage quite well there was a strained moment of silence in this weather the road is just a memory well be a lot safer with me at the wheel of course faber began to eat it makes no difference to me david persisted i dont want you to come if you think it would be too much really id be glad to did you sleep all right it didnt occur to me you might still be tired i hope lucy didnt keep you up too late farber willed himself not to look at lucy but out of the corner of his eye he could see that she was suddenly flushed i slept all day yesterday he said trying to fix davids eyes with his own it was no use david was looking at his wife he knew she turned her back david would be hostile now and antagonism was part way to suspicion it was not as hed decided before dangerous but it might be annoying david seemed to recover his composure quickly he pushed his chair away from the table and wheeled himself to the back door ill get the jeep out of the barn he said mostly to himself he took an oilskin off a hook and put it over his head then opened the door and rolled out in the few moments the door was open the storm blew into the little kitchen leaving the floor wet when it shut lucy shivered and began to mop the water from the tiles faber reached out and touched her arm dont she said nodding her head toward jo youre being silly faber told her i think he knows she said but if you reflect for a minute you dont really care whether he knows or not do you im supposed to faber shrugged the jeeps horn sounded impatiently outside lucy handed him an oilskin and a pair of wellington boots dont talk about me she said faber put on the waterproof clothes and went to the front door lucy followed him closing the kitchen door on jo with his hand on the latch faber turned and kissed her and she did what she wanted she kissed him back hard then turned and went into the kitchen faber ran through the rain across a sea of mud and jumped into the jeep beside david who pulled away immediately the vehicle had been specially adapted for the legless man to drive it had a hand throttle automatic gearshift and a handle on the rim of the wheel to enable the driver to steer onehanded the foldedup wheelchair slid into a special compartment behind the drivers seat there was a shotgun in a rack above the windscreen david drove competently he had been right about the road it was no more than a strip of heath worn bare by the jeeps tires the rain pooled in the deep ruts the car slithered about in the mud david seemed to enjoy it there was a cigarette between his lips and he wore an incongruous air of bravado perhaps faber thought this was his substitute for flying what do you do when youre not fishing he said around the cigarette civil servant faber told him what sort of work finance im just a cog in the machine treasury mainly interesting work he persisted fairly faber summoned up the energy to invent a story i know a bit about how much a given piece of engineering ought to cost and i spend most of my time making sure the taxpayer isnt being overcharged any particular sort of engineering everything from paper clips to aircraft engines ah well we all contribute to the war effort in our own way it was of course an intentionally snide remark and david would naturally have no idea why faber did not resent it im too old to fight faber said mildly were you in the first lot too young a lucky escape doubtless the track ran quite close to the cliff edge but david did not slow down it crossed fabers mind that he might want to kill them both he reached for a grab handle am i going too fast for you david asked you seem to know the road you look frightened faber ignored that and david slowed down a little apparently satisfied that he had made some kind of point the island was fairly flat and bare faber observed the ground rose and fell slightly but as yet he had seen no hills the vegetation was mostly grass with some ferns and bushes but few trees there was little protection from the weather david roses sheep must be hardy faber thought are you married david asked suddenly no wise man oh i dont know ill wager you do well for yourself in london not to mention faber had never liked the nudging contemptuous way some men talked about women he interrupted sharply i should think youre extremely fortunate to have your wife oh yes nothing like variety though eh i havent had the opportunity to discover the merits of monogamy faber decided to say no more anything he said was fuel to the fire no question david was becoming annoying i must say you dont look like a government accountant wheres the rolled umbrella and the bowler hat faber attempted a thin smile and you seem quite fit for a penpusher i ride a bicycle you must be quite tough to have survived that wreck thank you you dont look too old to be in the army either faber turned to look at david what are you driving at he asked calmly were there david said faber looked out of the windscreen and saw a cottage very similar to lucys with stone walls a slate roof and small windows it stood at the top of a hill the only hill faber had seen on the island and not much of a hill at that the house had a squat resilient look about it climbing up to it the jeep skirted a small stand of pine and fir trees faber wondered why the cottage had not been built in the shelter of the trees beside the house was a hawthorn tree in bedraggled blossom david stopped the car faber watched him unfold the wheelchair and ease himself out of the driving seat into the chair he would have resented an offer of help they entered the house by a plank door with no lock they were greeted in the hall by a blackandwhite collie a small broadheaded dog who wagged his tail but did not bark the layout of the cottage was identical with that of lucys but the atmosphere was different this place was bare cheerless and none too clean david led the way into the kitchen where old tom the shepherd sat by an oldfashioned woodburning kitchen range warming his hands he stood up this is tom mcavity david said pleased to meet you tom said formally faber shook his hand tom was a short man and broad with a face like an old tan suitcase he was wearing a cloth cap and smoking a very large briar pipe with a lid his grip was firm and the skin of his hand felt like sandpaper he had a very big nose faber had to concentrate hard to understand what he was saying his scots accent was very broad i hope im not going to be in the way faber said i only came along for the ride david wheeled himself up to the table i dont suppose well do much this morning tom just take a look around aye well have some tay before we go though tom poured strong tea into three mugs and added a shot of whisky to each the three men sat and sipped it in silence david smoking a cigarette and tom drawing gently at his huge pipe and faber felt certain that the other two spent a great deal of time together in this way smoking and warming their hands and saying nothing when they had finished their tea tom put the mugs in the shallow stone sink and they went out to the jeep faber sat in the back david drove slowly this time and the dog which was called bob loped alongside keeping pace without apparent effort it was obvious that david knew the terrain very well as he steered confidently across the open grassland without once getting bogged down in swampy ground the sheep looked very sorry for themselves with their fleece sopping wet they huddled in hollows or close to bramble bushes or on the leeward slopes too dispirited to graze even the lambs were subdued hiding beneath their mothers faber was watching the dog when it stopped listened for a moment and then raced off at a tangent tom had been watching too bobs found something he said the jeep followed the dog for a quarter of a mile when they stopped faber could hear the sea they were close to the islands northern edge the dog was standing at the brink of a small gully when the men got out of the car they could hear what the dog had heard the bleating of a sheep in distress and they went to the edge of the gully and looked down the animal lay on its side about twenty feet down balanced precariously on the steeply sloping bank one foreleg at an awkward angle tom went down to it treading cautiously and examined the leg mutton tonight he called david got the gun from the jeep and slid it down to him tom put the sheep out of its misery do you want to rope it up david called ayeunless our visitor here wants to come and give me a hand surely faber said he picked his way down to where tom stood they took a leg each and dragged the dead animal back up the slope fabers oilskin caught on a thorny bush and he almost fell before he tugged the material free with a loud ripping sound they threw the sheep into the jeep and drove on fabers shoulder felt very wet and he realised he had torn away most of the back of the oilskin im afraid ive ruined this slicker he said all in a good cause tom told him soon they returned to toms cottage faber took off the oilskin and his wet donkey jacket and tom put the jacket over the stove to dry faber sat close to it tom put the kettle on then went upstairs for a new bottle of whisky faber and david warmed their wet hands the gunshot made both men jump faber ran into the hall and up the stairs david followed stopping his wheelchair at the foot of the staircase faber found tom in a small bare room leaning out of the window and shaking his fist at the sky missed tom said missed what eagle downstairs david laughed tom put the shotgun down beside a cardboard box he took a new bottle of whisky from the box and led the way downstairs david was already back in the kitchen close to the heat she was the first animal weve lost this year he said his thoughts returning to the dead sheep aye tom said well fence the gully this summer aye faber sensed a change in the atmosphere it was not the same as it had been earlier they sat drinking and smoking as before but david seemed restless twice faber caught the man staring at him eventually david said well leave you to butcher the ewe tom aye david and faber left tom did not get up but the dog saw them to the door before starting the jeep david took the shotgun from its rack above the windscreen reloaded it and put it back on the way home he underwent another change of mooda surprising oneand became chatty i used to fly spitfires lovely kites four guns in each wingamerican brownings fired one thousand two hundred and sixty rounds a minute the jerries prefer cannon of course their mels only have two machine guns a cannon does more damage but our brownings are faster and more accurate really faber said it politely they put cannon in the hurricanes later but it was the spitfire that won the battle of britain faber found his boastfulness irritating how many enemy aircraft did you shoot down i lost my legs while i was training faber glanced at his face expressionless but it seemed stretched as though the skin would break no i havent killed a single german yet david said faber became very alert he had no idea what david might have deduced or discovered but there now seemed little doubt that the man believed something was up and not just fabers night with his wife faber turned slightly sideways to face david braced himself with his foot against the transmission tunnel on the floor rested his right hand lightly on his left forearm he waited are you interested in aircraft david asked no its become a national pastime i gather aircraft spotting like birdwatching people buy books on aircraft identification spend whole afternoons on their backs looking at the sky through telescopes i thought you might be an enthusiast why pardon what made you think i might be an enthusiast oh i dont know david stopped the jeep to light a cigarette they were at the islands midpoint five miles from toms cottage with another five miles to go to lucys david dropped the match on the floor perhaps it was the film i found in your jacket pocket as he spoke he tossed the lighted cigarette at fabers face and reached for the gun above the windscreen sid cripps looked out of the window and cursed under his breath the meadow was full of american tanksat least eighty of them he realised there was a war on and all that but if only theyd asked him he would have offered them another field where the grass was not so lush by now the caterpillar tracks would have chewed up his best grazing he pulled on his boots and went out there were some yank soldiers in the field and he wondered whether they had noticed the bull when he got to the stile he stopped and scratched his head there was something funny going on the tanks had not chewed up his grass they had left no tracks but the american soldiers were making tank tracks with a tool something like a harrow while sid was trying to figure it all out the bull noticed the tanks it stared at them for a while then pawed the ground and lumbered into a run it was going to charge a tank daft bugger youll break your head sid muttered the soldiers were watching the bull too they seemed to think it was very funny the bull ran fulltilt into the tank its horns piercing the armourplated side of the vehicle sid hoped fervently that british tanks were stronger than the american ones there was a loud hissing noise as the bull worked its horns free the tank collapsed like a deflated balloon the american soldiers fell all over each other laughing it was all quite strange percival godliman walked quickly across parliament square carrying an umbrella he wore a dark striped suit under his raincoat and his black shoes were highly polishedat least they had been until he stepped out into the rain it was not every daycome to that it was not every yearthat he had a private audience with mr churchill a career soldier would have been nervous at going with such bad news to see the supreme commander of the nations armed forces godliman was not nervous a distinguished historian had nothing to fear he told himself from soldiers and politicians not unless his view of history was a good deal more radical than godlimans was not nervous then but worried distinctly worried he was thinking about the effort the forethought the care the money and the manpower that had gone into the creation of the totally ersatz first united states army group stationed in eeast anglia the four hundred landing ships made of canvas and scaffolding floated on oil drums that thronged the harbours and estuaries the carefully manufactured inflatable dummies of tanks artillery trucks halftracks and even ammunition dumps the complaints planted in the correspondence columns of the local newspapers about the decline in moral standards since the arrival of thousands of american troops in the area the phony oil dock at dover designed by britains most distinguished architect and built out of cardboard and old sewage pipes by craftsmen borrowed from film studios the carefully faked reports transmitted to hamburg by german agents who had been turned by the xx committee and the incessant radio chatter broadcast for the benefit of the german listening posts consisting of messages compiled by professional writers of fiction and including such as th queens royal regiment report a number of civilian women presumably unauthorised in the baggage train what are we going to do with themtake them to calais no question a good deal had been achieved the signs indicated that the germans had bought it and now the whole elaborate deception had been put in jeopardy because of one damned spy a spy godliman had failed to catch which of course was the reason for his command performance today his short birdlike paces measured the westminster pavement to the small doorway at no great george street the armed guard standing beside the wall of sandbags examined his pass and waved him in he crossed the lobby and went down the stairs to churchills underground headquarters it was like going below decks on a battleship protected from bombs by a fourfootthick ceiling of reinforced concrete the command post featured steel bulkhead doors and roof props of ancient timber as godliman entered the map room a cluster of youngish people with solemn faces emerged from the conference room beyond an aide followed them a moment later and spotted godliman youre very punctual sir the aide said hes ready for you godliman stepped into the small comfortable conference room there were rugs on the floor and a picture of the king on the wall an electric fan stirred the tobacco smoke in the air churchill sat at the head of an old mirrorsmooth table in the centre of which was a statuette of a faun the emblem of churchills own deception outfit the london controlling section godliman decided not to salute churchill said sit down professor godliman suddenly realised that churchill was not a big man but he sat like a big man shoulders hunched elbows on the arms of his chair chin lowered legs apart he was wearing a solicitors blackandstripes short black jacket and striped grey trousers with a spotted blue bow tie and a brilliant white shirt despite his stocky frame and his paunch the hand holding the fountain pen was delicate thinfingered his complexion was babypink the other hand held a cigar and on the table beside the papers stood a glass containing what looked like whisky he was making notes in the margin of a typewritten report and as he scribbled he occasionally muttered godliman was not really awed by the great man as a peacetime statesman churchill had been in godlimans view something of a disaster however the man had the qualities of a great warrior chieftain and godliman very much respected him for that churchill modestly denied being the british lion saying that he merely was privileged to give the roar godliman thought that assessment was just about right he looked up abruptly now i suppose theres no doubt this damned spy has discovered what were up to none whatsoever sir godliman said you think hes got away we chased him to aberdeen its almost certain that he left there two nights ago in a stolen boat presumably for a rendezvous in the north sea however he cant have been far out of port when the storm blew up he may have met the uboat before the storm hit but its unlikely in all probability he drowned im sorry we cant offer more definite information so am i churchill said and suddenly he seemed angry though not with godliman he got out of his chair and went over to the clock on the wall staring as if mesmerised at the inscription victoria ri ministry of works then as if he had forgotten that godliman was there he began to pace up and down alongside the table muttering to himself godliman was able to make out the words and what he heard astonished him the great man was mumbling this stocky figure with a slight stoop striding up and down suddenly unconscious of any presence beyond his own thoughts it was as if churchill were acting out a hollywood screenplay that he wrote as he went along the performance ended as abruptly as it had begun and if the man knew he had been behaving eccentrically he gave no sign of it he sat down handed godliman a sheet of paper and said this is the german order of battle as of last week godliman read russian front infantry divisions panzer divisions miscellaneous divisions italy amp balkans infantry divisions panzer divisions miscellaneous divisions western front infantry divisions panzer divisions miscellaneous divisions germany infantry divisions panzer division miscellaneous divisions churchill said of those twelve panzer divisions in the west only one is actually on the normandy coast the great ss divisions das reich and adolf hitler are at toulouse and brussels respectively and show no signs of moving what does an this tell you professor our deception and cover plans seem to have been successfull godliman answered and realised the trust churchill had placed in him until this moment normandy had never been mentioned to him not by his uncle colonel terry or anybody else though he had deduced as much knowing as he did about the artificial buildup aimed at calais of course he still did not know the date of the invasion dday and was grateful that he did not totally successful churchill said they are confused and uncertain and their best guesses about our intentions are wildly wrong and yet he paused for effect and yet despite all that he picked up another piece of paper from the table and read it aloud our chances of holding the beachhead particularly after the germans get their buildup are only fiftyfifty he put his cigar down and his voice became quite soft it has taken the total military and industrial might of the whole englishspeaking worldthe greatest civilisation since the roman elmpirefour years to win this fiftyfifty chance if this spy gets out we lose even that which is to say we lose everything he stared at godliman for a moment then picked up his pen with a frail white hand dont bring me probabilities professor bring me die nadel he looked down and began to write after a moment godliman got up and quietly left the room cigarette tobacco burns at degrees centigrade however the coal at the end of the cigarette is normally surrounded by a thin layer of ash to cause a burn the cigarette has to be pressed against the skin for the better part of a second a glancing touch will hardly be felt this applies even to the eyes blinking is the fastest involuntary reaction of the human body only amateurs throw cigarettes and david rose was an amateur a thoroughly frustrated and actionstarved amateur professionals ignore them faber ignored the lighted cigarette that david rose threw at him he was right because the cigarette glanced off his forehead and fell to the metal floor of the jeep he made a grab for davids gun which was an error he should he instantly realised have drawn his stiletto and stabbed david david might have shot him first but david had never before pointed a gun at a human being let alone killed somebody so he would almost certainly have hesitated and in that moment faber could have killed him faber decided he could blame his recent lapse into humanity for such intolerable miscalculation it would be his last david had both hands on the midsection of the gunleft hand on the barrel right hand around the breechand had pulled the weapon about six inches from its rack when faber got a onehanded grip on the muzzle david tugged the gun toward himself but for a moment fabers grasp held the gun pointed at the windscreen faber was a strong man but david was exceptionally strong his shoulders arms and wrists had moved his body and his wheelchair for four years and the muscles had become abnormally developed furthermore he had both hands on the gun in front of him and faber was holding on with one hand at an awkward angle david tugged again more determinedly this time and the muzzle slipped from fabers grasp at that instant with the shotgun pointed at his belly and davids finger curling around the trigger faber felt very close to death he jerked upward catapulting himself out of his seat his head hit the canvas roof of the jeep as the gun exploded with a crash that numbed the ears and produced a physical pain behind the eyes the window by the passenger seat shattered into small pieces and the rain blew in through the empty frame faber twisted his body and fell back not onto his own seat but across david he got both hands to davids throat and squeezed his thumbs david tried to bring the gun around between their bodies to fire the other barrel but the weapon was too big faber looked into his eyes and saw what exhilaration of course the man finally had a chance to fight for his country then his expression changed as his body felt the lack of oxygen and he began to fight for breath david released his grip on the gun and brought both elbows back as far as he could then punched fabers lower ribs with a powerful double jab faber screwed up his face in pain but he held his grip on davids throat knowing he could withstand davids punches longer than david could hold his breath david must have had the same thought he crossed his forearms between their bodies and pushed faber away then when the gap was a few inches wide he brought his hands up in an upwardandoutward blow against fabers arms breaking the stranglehold he bunched his right fist and swung downward with a powerful but unscientific punch that landed on fabers cheekbone and brought water to his eyes faber replied with a series of body jabs david continued to bruise his face they were too close together to do real damage to each other in a short time but davids greater strength began to tell almost in admiration faber realised that david had shrewdly picked the time and place for the fight he had had the advantages of surprise the gun and the confined space in which his muscle counted for much and fabers better balance and greater manoeuvrability counted for little he had only erred really in his bravadounderstandable perhapsabout finding the film can giving faber a moment of warning faber shifted his weight slightly and his hip came into contact with the gearshift throwing the transmission into forward the engine was still running and the car jerked throwing him off balance david used the opportunity to release a long straight left thatmore by luck than by judgmentcaught faber flush on the chin and threw him clear across the cab of the jeep his head cracked against the apost he slumped with his shoulder on the door handle the door opened and he fell out of the car in a backward somersault to land on his face in the mud for a moment he was too dazed to move when he opened his eyes he could see nothing but flashes of blue lightning against a misty red background he heard the engine of the jeep racing he shook his head trying to clear the fireworks from his vision and struggled onto his hands and knees the sound of the jeep receded and then came closer again he turned his head toward the noise and as the colours in front of his eyes dissolved and disappeared he saw the vehicle bearing down on him david was going to run him over with the front bumper less than a yard from his face he threw himself sideways he felt a blast of wind a fender struck his outflung foot as the jeep roared past its heavygauge tyres tearing up the spongy turf and spitting mud he rolled over twice in the wet grass then got to one knee his foot hurt he watched the jeep turn in a tight circle and come for him again he could see davids face through the windscreen the young man was leaning forward hunched over the steering wheel his lips actually drawn back over his teeth in a savage almost crazy grin apparently the frustrated warrior imagining himself in the cockpit of a spitfire coming down out of the sun at an enemy plane with all eight browning machine guns blazing rounds per minute faber moved toward the cliff edge the jeep gathered speed faber knew that for a moment at least he was incapable of running he looked over the cliffa rocky almost vertical slopeto the angry sea a hundred feet below the jeep was coming straight down the cliff edge toward him faber looked up and down for a ledge or even a foothold there was none the jeep was four or five yards away travelling at something like forty miles per hour its wheels were less than two feet from the cliff edge faber dropped flat and swung his legs out into space supporting his weight on his forearms as he hung on the brink the wheels passed him within inches a few yards further on one tyre actually slipped over the edge for a moment faber thought the whole vehicle would slide over and fall into the sea below but the other three wheels dragged the jeep to safety the ground under fabers arms shifted the vibration of the jeeps passing had loosened the earth he felt himself slip a fraction one hundred feet below the sea boiled among the rocks faber stretched one arm to its farthest extent and dug his fingers deep into the soft ground he felt a nail tear and ignored it he repeated the process with his other arm with two hands anchored in the earth he pulled himself upward it was agonisingly slow but eventually his head drew level with his hands his hips reached firm ground and he was able to swivel around and roll away from the edge the jeep was turning again faber ran toward it his foot was painful but not he decided broken david accelerated for another pass faber turned and ran at right angles to the jeeps direction forcing david to turn the wheel and consequently slow down faber knew he could not keep this up much longer he was certain to tire before david did this had to be the last pass he ran faster david steered an interception course headed for a point in front of faber faber doubled back and the jeep zigzagged it was now quite close faber broke into a sprint his course forcing david to drive in a tight circle the jeep was getting slower and faber was getting closer there were only a few yards between them when david realised what faber was up to he steered away but it was too late faber rushed to the jeeps side and threw himself upward landing face down on the top of the canvas roof he lay there for a few seconds catching his breath his injured foot felt as if it was being held in a fire his lungs ached the jeep was still moving faber drew the stiletto from its sheath under his sleeve and cut a long jagged tear in the canvas roof the material flapped downward and faber found himself staring at the back of davids head david looked up and back a look of astonishment crossed his face faber drew back his arm for a knife thrust david jammed the throttle open and heaved the wheel around the jeep leaped forward and lifted on two wheels as it screeched around in a tight curve faber struggled to stay on the jeep still gathering speed crashed down onto four wheels then lifted again it teetered precariously for a few yards the wheels slipped on the sodden ground and the vehicle toppled onto its side with a grinding crash faber was thrown several yards and landed awkwardly the breath knocked out of him by the impact it was several seconds before he could move the jeeps crazy course had once again taken it perilously close to the cliff faber saw his knife in the grass a few yards away he picked it up then turned to the jeep somehow david had got himself and his wheelchair out through the ripped roof and he was now sitting in the chair and pushing himself away along the cliff edge faber running after him had to acknowledge his courage david must have heard the footsteps because just before faber caught up with the chair it stopped dead and spun around and faber glimpsed a heavy wrench in davids hand faber crashed into the wheelchair overturning it his last thought was that both of them and the chair might end up in the sea below and then the wrench hit the back of his head and he blacked out when he came to the wheelchair lay beside him but david was nowhere to be seen he stood up and looked around in dazed puzzlement here the voice came from over the cliff david must have just been able to hit him with the wrench before being flung from the chair and over the edge faber crawled to the cliff and looked over david had one hand around the stem of a bush that grew just under the lip of the cliff the other hand was jammed into a small crevice in the rock he hung suspended just as faber had a few minutes earlier his bravado had gone now pull me up for gods sake he called hoarsely faber leaned closer how did you know about the film he said help me please tell me about the film oh god david made a mighty effort to concentrate when you went to toms outhouse you left your jacket drying in the kitchen tom went upstairs for more whisky and i went through your pockets and i found the negatives and that was evidence enough for you to try to kill me that and what you did with my wife in my house no englishman would behave like that faber could not help laughing the man was a boy after all where are the negatives now in my pocket give them to me and ill pull you up youll have to take them i cant let go hurry faber lay flat on his stomach and reached down under davids oilskin to the breast pocket of his jacket he sighed in relief as his fingers reached the film can and carefully withdrew it he looked at the films they all seemed to be there he put the can in the pocket of his jacket buttoned the flap and reached down to david again no more mistakes he took hold of the bush david was clinging to and uprooted it with a savage jerk david screamed no and scrabbled desperately for grip as his other hand slipped inexorably out of the crack in the rock its not fair he screamed and then his hand came away from the crevice he seemed to hang in midair for a moment then dropped bouncing twice against the cliff on his way down until he hit the water with a splash faber watched for a while to make sure he did not come up again not fair not fair dont you know theres a war on he looked down at the sea for some minutes once he thought he saw a flash of yellow oilskin on the surface but it was gone before he could focus on it there was just the sea and the rocks suddenly he felt terribly tired his injuries penetrated his consciousness one by one the damaged foot the bump on his head the bruises all over his face david rose had been something of a fool also a braggart and a poor husband and he had died screaming for mercy but he had been a brave man and he had died for his country which had been his contribution faber wondered whether his own death would be as good he turned away from the cliff edge and walked back toward the overturned jeep percival godliman felt refreshed determined evenrare for himinspired when he reflected on it this made him uncomfortable peptalks were for the rankandfile and intellectuals believed themselves immune from inspirational speeches yet although he knew that the great mans performance had been carefully scripted the crescendos and diminuendos of the speech predetermined like a symphony nevertheless it had worked on him as effectively as if he had been the captain of the school cricket team hearing lastminute exhortations from the games master he got back to his office itching to do something he dropped his umbrella in the umbrella stand hung up his wet raincoat and looked at himself in the mirror on the inside of the cupboard door without doubt something had happened to his face since he became one of englands spycatchers the other day he had come across a photograph of himself taken in with a group of students at a seminar in oxford in those days he actually looked older than he did now pale skin wispy hair the patchy shave and illfitting clothes of a retired man the wispy hair had gone he was now bald except for a monkish fringe his clothes were those of a business executive not a teacher it seemed to himhe might he supposed have been imagining itthat the set of his jaw was firmer his eyes were brighter and he took more care shaving he sat down behind his desk and lit a cigarette that innovation was not welcome he had developed a cough tried to give it up and discovered that he had become addicted but almost everybody smoked in wartime britain even some of the women well they were doing mens jobs they were entitled to masculine vices the smoke caught in godlimans throat making him cough he put the cigarette out in the tin lid he used for an ashtray crockery was scarce the trouble with being inspired to perform the impossible he reflected was that the inspiration gave you no clues to the practical means he recalled his college thesis about the travels of an obscure mediaeval monk called thomas of the tree godliman had set himself the minor but difficult task of plotting the monks itinerary over a fiveyear period there had been a baffling gap of eight months when he had been either in paris or canterbury but godliman had been unable to determine which and this had threatened the value of the whole project the records he was using simply did not contain the information if the monks stay had gone unrecorded then there was no way to find out where he had been and that was that with the optimism of youth young godliman had refused to believe that the information was just not there and he had worked on the assumption that somewhere there had to be a record of how thomas had spent those months despite the wellknown fact that almost everything that happened in the middle ages went unrecorded if thomas was not in paris or canterbury he must have been in transit between the two godliman had argued and then he had found shipping records in an amsterdam museum that showed that thomas had boarded a vessel bound for dover that got blown off course and was eventually wrecked on the irish coast this model piece of historical research was what got godliman his professorship he might try applying that kind of thinking to the problem of what had harpened to faber it was most likely that faber had drowned if he had not then he was probably in germany by now neither of those possibilities presented any course of action godliman could follow so they should be discounted he must assume that faber was alive and had reached land somewhere he left his office and went down one flight of stairs to the map room his uncle colonel terry was there standing in front of the map of europe with a cigarette between his lips godliman realised that this was a familiar sight in the war office these days senior men standing entranced at maps silently making their own computations of whether the war would he won or lost he guessed it was because all the plans had been made the vast machine had been set in motion and for those who made the big decisions there was nothing to do but wait and see if they had been right terry saw bin come in and said how did you get on with the great man he was drinking whisky godliman said he drinks all day but it never seems to make any difference to him terry said what did he say he wants die nadels head on a platter godliman crossed the room to the wall map of great britain and put a finger on aberdeen if you were sending a uhoat in to pick up a fugitive spy what would you think was the nearest the sub could safely come to the coast terry stood beside him and looked at the map i wouldnt want to come closer than the threemile limit but for preference id stop ten miles out right godliman drew two pencil lines parallel to the coast three miles and ten miles out respectively now if you were an amateur sailor setting out from aberdeen in a smallish fishing boat how far would you go before you began to get nervous you mean whats a reasonable distance to travel in such a boat indeed terry shrugged ask the navy id say fifteen or twenty miles i agree godliman drew an arc of twenty miles radius with its centre on aberdeen now if faber is alive hes either back on the mainland or somewhere within this space he indicated the area bounded by the parallel lines and the arc theres no land in that area have we got a bigger map terry pulled open a drawer and got out a largescale map of scotland he spread it on top of the chest godliman copied the pencil marks from the smaller map onto the larger there was still no land within the area but look godliman said just to the east of the tenmile limit was a long narrow island terry peered closer storm island he read how apt godliman snapped his fingers could be can you send someone there when the storm clears bloggs is up there ill get a plane laid on for him he can take off the minute the weather improves he went to the door good luck terry called after him godliman took the stairs two at a time to the next floor and entered his offlce he picked up the phone get mr bloggs in aberdeen please while he waited he doodled on his blotter drawing the island it was shaped like the top half of a walking stick with the crook at the western end it must have been about ten miles long and perhaps a mile wide he wondered what sort of place it was a barren lump of rock or a thriving community of farmers if faber was there he might still be able to contact his uboat bloggs would have to get to the island before the submarine i have mr bloggs the switchboard girl said fred hello percy i think hes on an island called storm island no hes not bloggs said weve just arrested him he hoped the stiletto was nine inches long with an engraved handle and a stubby little crosspiece its needlelike point was extremely sharp bloggs thought it looked like a highly efficient killing instrument it had recently been polished bloggs and detective chiefinspector kincaid stood looking at it neither man wanting to touch it he was trying to catch a bus to edinburgh kincaid said a pc spotted him at the ticket office and asked for his identification he dropped his suitcase and ran a woman bus conductor hit him over the head with her ticket machine he took ten minutes to come around lets have a look at him bloggs said they went down the corridor to the cells this one kincaid said bloggs looked through the judas the man sat on a stool in the far corner of the cell with his back against the wall his legs were crossed his eves closed his hands in his pockets hes been in cells before bloggs remarked the man was tall with a long handsome face and dark hair it could have been the man in the photograph but it was hard to be certain want to go in kincaid asked in a minute what was in his suitcase apart from the stiletto the tools of a burglars trade quite a lot of money in small notes a pistol and some ammunition black clothes and crepesoled shoes and five hundred lucky strike cigarettes no photographs or film negatives kincaid shook his head balls bloggs said with feeling papers identify him as peter fredericks of wembley middlesex says hes an unemployed toolmaker looking for work toolmaker bloggs said sceptically there hasnt been an unemployed toolmaker in britain in the last four years youd think a spy would know that still kincaid asked shall i start the questioning or will you you kincaid opened the door and bloggs followed him in the man in the corner opened his eyes incuriously he did not alter his position kincaid sat at a small plain table bloggs leaned against the wall kincaid said whats your real name peter fredericks what are you doing so far from home looking for work why arent you in the army weak heart where have you been for the last few days here in aberdeen before that dundee before that perth when did you arrive in aberdeen the day before yesterday kincaid glanced at bloggs who nodded your story is silly kincaid said toolmakers dont need to look for work the country hasnt got enough of them youd better start telling the truth im telling the truth bloggs took all the loose change out of his pocket and tied it up in his handkerchief he stood watching saying nothing swinging the little bundle in his right hand where is the film kincaid said having been briefed to this extent by bloggs though not to the extent of knowing what the film was about the mans expression did not change i dont know what youre talking about kincaid shrugged and looked at bloggs bloggs said on your feet pardon on your feet the man stood up casually step forward he took two steps up to the table name peter predericks bloggs came off the wall and hit the man with the weighted handkerchief the blow caught him accurately on the bridge of the nose and he cried out his hands went to his face stand to attention bloggs said name the man stood upright let his hands fall to his sides peter fredericks bloggs hit him again in exactly the same place this time he went down on one knee and his eyes watered where is the film the man shook his head bloggs pulled him to his feet kneed him in the groin punched his stomach what did you do with the negatives the man fell to the floor and threw up bloggs kicked his face there was a sharp crack what about the uboat where is the rendezvous whats the signal damn you kincaid grabbed bloggs from behind thats enough he said this is my station and i can only turn a blind eye so long you know bloggs rounded on him were not dealing with a case of petty housebreaking im mi and ill do what i fucking well like in your station if the prisoner dies ill take responsibility he turned back to the man on the floor who was staring at him and kincaid face covered with blood and an expression of incredulity what are you talking about he said weakly what is this bloggs hauled him to his feet youre heinrich rudolph hans von müllergüder born at oln on may also known as henry faber a lieutenant colonel in german intelligence within three months youll be hanged for espionage unless you turn out to be more useful to us alive than dead start making yourself useful colonel müllergüder no the man said no no im a thief not a spy please he leaned away from bloggs upraised fist i can prove it bloggs hit him again and kincaid intervened for the second time wait all right fredericks if thats your nameprove youre a thief i done three houses in jubilee crescent last week the man gasped i took about five hundred quid from one and some jewellery from the next onediamond rings and some pearlsand i never got nothing from the other one because of the dog you must know im telling the truth they must have reported it didnt they oh jesus kincaid looked at bloggs all those burglaries took place he could have read about them in the newspapers the third one wasnt reported perhaps he did them he could still be a spy spies can steal too he felt rotten but this was last week your man was in london wasnt he bloggs was silent for a moment then he said well fuck it and walked out peter fredericks looked up at kincaid through a mask of blood whos he the bleedin gestapo he said kincaid stared at him just be glad youre not really the man hes looking for well godliman said into the phone false alarm bloggs voice was scratchy and distorted over the longdistance line a smalltime housebreaker who happened to carry a stiletto and look like faber back to square one godliman said you said something about an island yes storm island its about ten miles off the coast due east of aberdeen youll find it on a largescale map what makes you sure hes there im not sure we still have to cover every other possibility other towns the coast everything but if he did steal that boat the marie ii yes if he did steal it his rendezvous was probably in the area of this island and if im right about that then hes either drowned or shipwrecked on the island okay that makes sense whats the weather like up there no change could you get to the island do you think in a big ship i suppose you can ride any storm if your ships big enough but this island wont have much of a dock will it youd better find out but i expect youre right now listen theres an raf fighter base near edinburgh by the time you get there ill have an amphibious plane standing by you take off the minute the storm begins to clear have the local coastguard ready to move at moments notice too im not sure wholl get there first but if the uboat is also waiting for the storm to clear it will get there first bloggs said youre right godliman lit a cigarette fumbling for inspiration well we can get a navy corvette to circle the island and listen for fabers radio signal when the storm clears it can land a boat on the island what about some fighters yes except like you theyll have to wait until the weather breaks it cant go on much longer what do the scottish meteorologists say another day of it at least but remember all the time were grounded hes bottled up too if hes there yes all right godliman said well have a corvette the coastguard some fighters and an amphibian youd better get on your way call me from rosyth take care will do godliman hung up his cigarette neglected in the ashtray had burned down to a tiny stub lying on its side the jeep looked powerful but helpless like a wounded elephant the engine had stalled faber gave it a hefty push and it toppled majestically onto all four wheels it had survived the fight relatively undamaged the canvas roof was destroyed of course the rip fabers knife had made had become a long tear running from one side to the other the offside front fender which had ploughed into the earth and stopped the vehicle was crumpled the headlight on that side had smashed the window on the same side had been broken by the shot from the gun the windscreen was miraculously intact faber climbed into the drivers seat put the gearshift into neutral and tried the starter it kicked over and died he tried again and the engine fired he was grateful for that he could not have faced a long walk he sat in the car for a while inventorying his wounds he gingerly touched his right ankle it was swelling massively perhaps he had cracked a bone it was as well that the jeep was designed to be driven by a man with no legs faber could not have pressed a brake pedal the lump on the back of his head felt huge at least the size of a golf ball when he touched it his hand came away sticky with blood he examined his face in the rearview mirror it was a mass of small cuts and big bruises like the face of the loser at the end of a boxing match he had abandoned his oilskin back at the cottage so his jacket and overalls were soggy with rain and smeared with mud he needed to get warm and dry very soon he gripped the steering wheel and a burning pain shot through his hand he had forgotten the torn fingernail he looked at it it was the nastiest of his injuries he would have to drive with one hand he pulled away slowly and found what he guessed was the road there was no danger of getting lost on this island all he had to do was follow the cliff edge until he came to lucys cottage he needed to invent a lie to explain to lucy what had become of her husband she wouldnt have heard the shotgun so far away he knew he might of course tell her the truth there was nothing she could do about it however if she became difficult he might have to kill her and he had an aversion to that driving slowly along the cliff top through the pouring rain and howling wind he marvelled at this new thing inside him this scruple it was the first time he had ever felt reluctance to kill it was not that he was amoral to the contrary he had made up his mind that the killing he did was on the same moral level as death on the battlefield and his emotions followed his intellect he always had the physical reaction the vomiting after he killed but that was something incomprehensible that he ignored so why did he not want to kill lucy the feeling was on a par he decided with the affection that drove him to send the luftwaffe erroneous directions to st pauls cathedral a compulsion to protect a thing of beauty she was a remarkable creation as full of loveliness and subtlety as any work of art faber could live with himself as a killer but not as an iconoclast it was he recognised as soon as the thought occurred to him a peculiar way to be but then spies were peculiar people he thought of some of the spies who had been recruited by the abwehr at the same time he had been otto the nordic giant who made delicate paper sculptures in the japanese fashion and hated women friedrich the sly little mathematical genius who jumped at shadows and went into a five day depression if he lost a game of chess helmut who liked to read books about slavery in america and had soon joined the ss all different all peculiar if they had anything more specific in common he did not know what it was he seemed to be driving more and more slowly and the rain and mist became more impenetrable he began to worry about the cliff edge on his lefthand side he felt very hot but suffered spasms of shivering he realised he had been speaking aloud about otto and friedrich and helmut and he recognised the signs of delirium he made an effort to think of nothing but the problem of keeping the jeep on a straight course the noise of the wind took on some kind of rhythm becoming hypnotic once he found himself stationary staring out over the sea and had no idea how long ago he had stopped it seemed hours later that lucys cottage came into view he steered toward it thinking i must remember to put the brake on before i hit the wall there was a figure standing in the doorway looking out at him through the rain he had to stay in control of himself long enough to tell her the lie he had to remember had to remember it was late afternoon by the time the jeep came back lucy was worried about what had happened to the men and at the same time angry with them for not coming home for the lunch she had prepared as the day waned she had spent more and more time at the windows looking out for them when the jeep came down the slight slope to the cottage it was clear something was wrong it was moving terribly slowly on a zigzag course and there was only one person in it it came closer and she saw that the front was dented and the headlight smashed oh god the vehicle shuddered to a halt in front of the cottage and she saw that the figure inside was henry he made no move to get out lucy ran out into the rain and opened the drivers door he sat there with his head back and his eyes halfclosed his hand was on the brake his face was bloody and bruised what happened what happened his hand slipped off the brake and the jeep moved forward lucy leaned across him and slipped the gearshift into neutral left david at toms cottage had crash on way back the words seemed to cost him a great effort now that she knew what had happened lucys panic subsided come inside she said sharply the urgency in her voice got through to him he turned toward her put his foot on the running board to step down and promptly fell to the ground lucy saw that his ankle was swollen like a balloon she got her hands under his shoulders and pulled him upright put your weight on the other foot and lean on me she got his right arm around her neck and half carried him inside jo watched wideeyed as she helped henry into the living room and got him onto the sofa he lay back with his eyes shut his clothes were soaked and muddy lucy said jo go upstairs and get your pyjamas on please but i havent had my story is he dead hes not dead hes had a car crash and you cant have a story tonight go on the child made a complaining sound and lucy looked threateningly at him he went lucy got the big scissors out of her sewing basket and cut henrys clothes away first the jacket then the overalls then the shirt she frowned in puzzlement when she saw the knife in its sheath strapped to his left forearm she guessed it was a special implement for cleaning fish or something when she tried to take it off he pushed her hand away she shrugged and turned her attention to his boots the left one came off easily and its sock but he cried out in pain when she touched the right it must come off she told him youll have to be brave a funny kind of smile came over his face then and he nodded she cut the laces took the shoe gently but firmly in both hands and pulled it off this time he made no sound she cut the elastic in the sock and pulled that off too jo came in hes in his pants his clothes are all wet she kissed the boy good night put yourself to bed darling ill tuck you up later kiss teddy then good night teddy jo went out lucy looked back to henry his eyes were open and he was smiling he said kiss henry then she leaned over him and kissed his battered face then carefully she cut away his underpants the heat from the fire would quickly dry his naked skin she went into the kitchen and filled a bowl with warm water and a little antiseptic to bathe his wounds she found a roll of absorbent cotton and returned to the living room this is the second time youve turned up on the doorstep half dead she said as she set about her task the usual signal henry said the words came abruptly what waitingatcalaisforaphantomarmy henry what are you talking about everyfridayandmonday she finally realised he was delirious dont try to talk she said she lifted his head slightly to clean away the dried blood from around the bump suddenly he sat upright looked fiercely at her and said what day is it what day is it its sunday relax okay he was quiet after that and he let her remove the knife she bathed his face bandaged his finger where he had lost the nail and put a dressing on his ankle when she had finished she stood looking at him for a while he seemed to be sleeping she touched the long scar on his chest and the starshaped mark on his hip the star was a birthmark she decided she went through his pockets before throwing the lacerated clothes away there wasnt much some money his papers a leather wallet and a film can she put them all in a little pile on the mantelpiece beside his fish knife he would have to have some of davids clothes she left him and went upstairs to see to jo the boy was asleep iying on his teddy bear with his arms outflung she kissed his soft cheek and tucked him in she went outside and put the jeep in the barn she made herself a drink in the kitchen then sat watching henry wishing he would wake up and make love to her again it was almost midnight when he woke he opened his eyes and his face showed the series of expressions that were now familiar to her first the fear then the wary survey of the room then the relaxation on impulse she asked him what are you afraid of henry i dont know what you mean you always look frightened when you wake up i dont know he shrugged and the movement seemed to hurt god im battered do you want to tell me what happened yes if youll give me a drink of brandy she got the brandy out of the cupboard you can have some of davids clothes in a minute unless youre embarrassed she handed him the glass smiling im afraid im enjoying it what happened to my clothes i had to cut them off you ive thrown them away not my papers i hope he smiled but there was some other emotion just below the surface on the mantelpiece she pointed is the knife for cleaning fish or something his right hand went to his left forearm where the sheath had been something like that he said he seemed uneasy for a moment then relaxed with an effort and sipped his drink thats good after a moment she said well what how did you manage to lose my husband and crash my jeep david decided to stay over at toms for the night some of the sheep got into trouble in a place they call the gully i know it and six or seven of them were injured theyre all in toms kitchen being bandaged up and making a terrible row anyway david suggested i come back to tell you he would be staying i dont really know how i managed to crash the car is unfamiliar theres no real road i hit something and went into a skid and the jeep ended up on its side the details he shrugged you must have been going quite fast you were in an awful mess when you got here i suppose i rattled around inside the jeep a bit banged my head twisted my ankle lost a fingernail bashed your face and almost caught pneumonia you must be accidentprone he swung his legs to the floor stood up and went to the mantelpiece your powers of recuperation are incredible she said he was strapping the knife to his arm we fishermen are very healthy what about those clothes she got up and stood close to him what do you need clothes for its bedtime he drew her to him pressing her against his naked body and kissed her hard she stroked his thighs after a while he broke away from her he picked up his things from the mantelpiece took her hand then hobbling he led her upstairs to bed the wide white autobahn snaked through the bavarian valley up into the mountains in the leather rear seat of the staff mercedes field marshal gerd von rundstedt was still and weary aged sixtynine he knew he was too fond of champagne and not fond enough of hitler his thin lugubrious face reflected a career longer and more erratic than that of any of hitlers other officers he had been dismissed in disgrace more times than he could remember but the fuehrer always asked him to come back as the car passed through the sixteenthcentury village of berchtesgaden he wondered why he always returned to his command when hitler forgave him money meant nothing to him he had already achieved the highest possible rank decorations were valueless in the third reich and he believed that it was not possible to win honour in this war it was rundstedt who had first called hitler the bohemian corporal the little man knew nothing of the german military tradition nordespite his flashes of inspirationof military strategy if he had he would not have started this war which was unwinnable rundstedt was germanys finest soldier and he had proved it in poland france and russia but he had no hope of victory all the same he would have nothing to do with the small group of generals whohe knewwere plotting to overthrow hitler he turned a blind eye to them but the fahneneid the blood oath of the german warrior was too strong in him to permit him to join the conspiracy and that he supposed was why he continued to serve the third reich right or wrong his country was in danger and he had no option but to protect it im like an old cavalry horse he thought if i stayed at home i would feel ashamed he commanded five armies on the western front now a million and a half men were under his command they were not as strong as they might be some divisions were little better than rest homes for invalids from the russian front there was a shortage of armour and there were many nongerman conscripts among the other ranks but rundstedt could still keep the allies out of france if he deployed his forces shrewdly it was that deployment that he must now discuss with hitler the car climbed the kehlsteinstrasse until the road ended at a vast bronze door in the side of the kehlstein mountain an ss guard touched a button the door hummed open and the car entered a long marble tunnel lit by bronze lanterns at the far end of the tunnel the driver stopped the car and rundstedt walked to the elevator and sat in one of its leather seats for the fourhundredfoot ascent to the adlerhorst the eagles nest in the anteroom rattenhuber took his pistol and left him to wait he stared unappreciatively at hitlers porcelain and went over in his mind the words he would say a few moments later the blond bodyguard returned to usher him into the conference room the place made him think of an eighteenthcentury palace the walls were covered with oil paintings and tapestries and there was a bust of wagner and a huge clock with a bronze eagle on its top the view from the wide window was truly remarkable one could see the hills of salzburg and the peak of the untersberg the mountain where the body of the emperor frederick barbarossa waited according to legend to rise from the grave and save the fatherland inside the room seated in the peculiarly rustic chairs were hitler and just three of his staff admiral theodor krancke the naval commander in the west general alfred jodl chief of staff and admiral karl jesko von puttkamer hitlers aidedecamp rundstedt saluted and was motioned to a chair a footman brought a plate of caviar sandwiches and a glass of champagne hitler stood at the large window looking out with his hands clasped behind his back without turning he said abruptly rundstedt has changed his mind he now agrees with rommel that the allies will invade normandy this is what my instinct has all along told me krancke however still favours calais rundstedt tell krancke how you arrived at your conclusion rundstedt swallowed a mouthful and coughed into his hand there are two things one new piece of information and one new line of reasoning rundstedt began first the information the latest summaries of allied bombing in france show without doubt that their principal aim is to destroy every bridge across the river seine now if they land at calais the seine is irrelevant to the battle but if they land in normandy all our reserves have to cross the seine to reach the zone of conflict second the reasoning i have given some thought to how i would invade france if i were commanding the allied forces my conclusion is that the first goal must be to establish a bridgehead through which men and supplies can be funnelled at speed the initial thrust must therefore come in the region of a large and capacious harbour the natural choice is cherbourg both the bombing pattern and the strategic requirements point to normandy he finished he picked up his glass and emptied it and the footman came forward to refill it jodl said all our intelligence points to calais and we have just executed the head of the abwehr as a traitor hitler interrupted krancke are you convinced i am not the admiral said i too have considered how i would conduct the invasion if i were on the other side but i have brought into the reasoning a number of factors of a nautical nature that our colleague rundstedt may not have comprehended i believe they will attack under cover of darkness by moonlight at full tide to sail over rommels underwater obstacles and away from cliffs rocky waters and strong currents normandy never hitler shook his head in disagreement jodl then said there is another small piece of information i find significant the guards armoured division has been transferred from the north of england to hove on the southeast coast to join the first united states army group under general patton we learned this from wireless surveillance there was a baggage mixup en route one unit had anothers silver cutlery and the fools have been quarrelling about it over the radio this is a crack british division very blueblooded commanded by general sir allen henry shafto adair i feel sure they will not be far from the centre of the battle when it comes hitlers hands moved nervously and his face now twitched in indecision generals he barked at them either i get conflicting advice or no advice at all i have to tell you everything with characteristic boldness rundstedt plunged on my fuehrer you have four superb panzer divisions doing nothing here in germany if i am right they will never get to normandy in time to repel the invasion i beg you order them to france and put them under rommels command if we are wrong and the invasion begins at calais they will at least be close enough to get into the battle at an early stage i dont know i dont know hitlers eyes widened and rundstedt wondered if he had pushed too hard again puttkamer spoke now for the first time my fuehrer today is sunday well tomorrow night the uboat may pick up the spy die nadel ah yes someone i can trust of course he can report by radio at any time though that would be dangerous rundstedt said there isnt time to postpone decisions both air attacks and sabotage activities have increased dramatically the invasion may come any day i disagree krancke said the weather conditions will not be right until early june which is not very far away enough hitler shouted i have made up my mind my panzers stay in germany for now on tuesday by which time we should have heard from die nadel i will reconsider the disposition of these forces if his information favours normandy as i believe it will i will move the panzers rundstedt said quietly and if he does not report if he does not report i shall reconsider just the same rundstedt nodded assent with your permission i will return to my command granted rundstedt got to his feet gave the military salute and went out in the copperlined elevator falling four hundred feet to the underground garage he felt his stomach turn over and wondered whether the sensation was caused by the speed of descent or by the thought that the destiny of his country lay in the hands of a single spy whereabouts unknown part six lucy woke up slowly she rose gradually languidly from the warm void of deep sleep up through layers of unconsciousness perceiving the world piece by isolated piece first the warm hard male body beside her then the strangeness of henrys bed the noise of the storm outside as angry and tireless as yesterday and the day before the faint smell of the mans skin her arm across his chest her leg thrown across his as if to keep him there her breasts pressed against his side the light of day beating against her eyelids the regular light breathing that blew softly across her face and then all at once like the solution to a puzzle the realisation that she was flagrantly and adulterously lying with a man she had met only fortyeight hours before and that they were naked in bed in her husbands house for the second time she opened her eyes and saw jo my god shed overslept he was standing beside the bed in his rumpled pyjamas hair tousled a battered rag doll under his arm sucking his thumb and staring wideeyed at his mummy and the strange man cuddling each other in bed lucy could not read his expression for at this time of day he stared wideeyed at most things as if all the world was new and marvellous every morning she stared back at him in silence not knowing what to say then henrys deep voice said good morning jo took his thumb out of his mouth said good mornin turned around and went out of the bedroom damn damn lucy said henry slid down in the bed until his face was level with hers and kissed her his hand went between her thighs and held her possessively she pushed him away for gods sake stop why jos seen us so what he can talk you know sooner or later hell say something to david what am i going to do do nothing does it matter of course it matters i dont see why the way he is you shouldnt feel guilty lucy suddenly realised that henry simply had no conception of the complex tangle of loyalties and obligations that constituted a marriage any marriage but especially here its not that simple she said she got out of bed and crossed the landing to her own bedroom she slipped into panties trousers and a sweater then remembered she had destroyed all henrys clothes and had to lend him some of davids she found underwear and socks a knitted shirt and a vnecked pullover and finally right at the bottom of a trunk one pair of trousers that were not cut off at the knee and sewn up all the while jo watched her in silence she took the clothes into the other bedroom henry had gone into the bathroom to shave she called through the door your clothes are on the bed she went downstairs lit the stove in the kitchen and put a saucepan of water on to heat she decided to have boiled eggs for breakfast she washed jos face at the kitchen sink combed his hair and dressed him quickly youre very quiet this morning she said brightly he made no reply henry came down and sat at the table as naturally as if he had been doing it every morning for years lucy felt very weird seeing him there in davids clothes handing him a breakfast egg putting a rack of toast on the table in front of him jo said suddenly is my daddy dead henry gave the boy a look and said nothing lucy said dont be silly hes at toms house jo ignored her and spoke to henry youve got my daddys clothes and youve got mummy are you going to be my daddy now lucy muttered out of the mouths of babes and sucklings didnt you see my clothes last night henry said jo nodded well then you know why i had to borrow some of your daddys clothes ill give them back to him when i get some more of my own will you give my mummy back of course lucy said eat your egg jo the child went at his breakfast apparently satisfied lucy was gazing out of the kitchen window the boat wont come today she said are you glad henry asked her she looked at him i dont know lucy didnt feel hungry she drank a cup of tea while jo and henry ate afterward jo went upstairs to play and henry cleared the table as he stacked crockery in the sink he said are you afraid david win hurt you physically she shook her head no you should forget him henry went on you were planning to leave him anyway why should it concern you whether he knows or not hes my husband that counts for something the kind of husband hes been all that doesnt give me the right to humiliate him i think it gives you the right not to care whether hes humiliated or not its not a question that can be settled logically its just the way i feel he made a givingup gesture with his arms id better drive over to toms and find out whether your husband wants to come back where are my boots in the living room ill get you a jacket she went upstairs and got davids old hacking jacket out of the wardrobe it was a fine greygreen tweed very elegant with a nippedin waist and slanted pocket flaps lucy had put leather patches on the elbow to preserve it you couldnt buy clothes like this anymore she took it down to the living room where henry was putting his boots on he had laced the left one and was gingerly inserting his injured right foot into the other lucy knelt to help him the swelling has gone down she said the damned thing still hurts they got the boot on but left it untied and took the lace out henry stood up experimentauy its okay he said lucy helped him into the jacket it was a bit tight across the shoulders we havent got another oilskin she said then ill get wet he pulled her to him and kissed her roughly she put her arms around him and held tightly for a moment drive more carefully today she said he smiled and nodded kissed her againbriefly this timeand went out she watched him limp across to the barn and stood at the window while he started the jeep and drove away up the slight rise and out of sight when he had gone she felt relieved but also empty she began to put the house straight making beds and washing dishes cleaning and tidying but she could summon up no enthusiasm for it she was restless she worried at the problem of what to do with her life following old arguments around in familiar circles unable to put her mind to anything else she again found the cottage claustrophobic there was a big world out there somewhere a world of war and heroism full of colour and people millions of people she wanted to be out there in the midst of it to meet new minds and see cities and hear music she turned on the radio a futile gesture the news broadcast made her feel more isolated not less there was a battle report from italy the rationing regulations had been eased a little the london stiletto murderer was still at large roosevelt had made a speech sandy macpherson began to play a theatre organ and lucy switched off none of it touched her she did not live in that world she wanted to scream she had to get out of the house in spite of the weather it would be only a symbolic escape the stone walls of the cottage were not after all what imprisoned her but the symbol was better than nothing she collected jo from upstairs separating him with some difficulty from a regiment of toy soldiers and wrapped him up in waterproof clothing why are we going out he asked to see if the boat comes you said it wont come today just in case they put bright yellow souwesters on their heads lacing them under their chins and stepped outside the door the wind was like a physical blow unbalancing lucy so that she staggered in seconds her face was as wet as if she had dipped it in a bowl and the ends of hair protruding from under her hat lay limp and clinging on her cheeks and the shoulders of her oilskin jo screamed with delight and jumped in a puddle they walked along the cliff top to the head of the bay and looked down at the huge north sea rollers hurling themselves to destruction against the cliffs and on the beach the storm had uprooted underwater vegetation from god only knew what depths and flung it in heaps on the sand and rocks mother and son became absorbed in the ceaselessly shifting patterns of the waves they had done this before the sea had a hypnotic effect on both of them and lucy was never quite sure afterward how long they had spent watching silently its spell this time was broken by something she saw at first there was only a flash of colour in the trough of a wave so fleeting that she was not certain what colour it had been so small and far away that she immediately doubted whether she had seen it at all she looked for it but did not see it again and her gaze drifted back to the bay and the little jetty on which flotsam gathered in drifts only to be swept away by the next big wave after the storm on the first fine day she and jo would go beachcombing to see what treasures the sea had disgorged and come back with oddly coloured rocks bits of wood of mystifying origin huge seashells and twisted fragments of rusted metal she saw the flash of colour again much nearer and this time it stayed within sight for a few seconds it was bright yellow the colour of all their oilskins she peered at it through the sheets of rain but could not identify its shape before it disappeared again now the current was bringing it closer as it brought everything to the bay depositing its rubbish on the sand like a man emptying his trouser pocked onto a table it was an oilskin she could see that when the sea lifted it on the crest of a wave and showed it to her for the third and final time henry had come back without his yesterday but how had it got into the sea the wave broke over the jetty and flung the object on the wet wooden boards of the ramp and lucy realised it was not henrys oilskin because the owner was still inside it her gasp of horror was whipped away by the wind so that not even she could hear it who was he where had he come from another wrecked ship it occurred to her that he might still be alive she must go and see she bent and shouted in jos ear stay here keep still dont move then she ran down the ramp halfway down she heard footsteps behind her jo was following her the ramp was narrow and slippery quite dangerous she stopped turned and scooped the child up in her arms you naughty boy i told you to wait she looked from the body below to the safety of the clifftop dithered for a moment in painful indecision discerned that the sea would wash the body away at any moment and proceeded downward carrying jo a smaller wave covered the body and when the water receded lucy was close enough to see that it was a man and that it had been in the sea long enough for the water to swell and distort the features which meant he was dead she could do nothing for him and she was not going to risk her life and her sons to preserve a corpse she was about to turn back when something about the bloated face struck her as familiar she stared at it uncomprehending trying to fit the features to something in her memory and then quite abruptly she saw the face for what it was and sheer paralysing terror took hold of her and it seemed that her heart stopped and she whispered no david no oblivious now to the danger she walked forward another lesser wave broke around her knees filling her wellington boots with foamy saltwater but she didnt notice jo twisted in her arms to face forward she screamed dont look in his ear and pushed his face into her shoulder he began to cry she knelt beside the body and touched the horrible face with her hand david there was no doubt he was dead and had been for some time moved by some terrible need to make absolutely certain she lifted the skirt of the oilskin and looked at the stumps of his legs it was impossible to take in the fact of the death she had in a way been wishing him dead but her feelings about him were confused by guilt and the fear of being found out in her infidelity grief horror relief they fluttered in her mind like birds none of them willing to settle she would have stayed there motionless but the next wave was a big one its force knocked her flying and she took a great gulp of sea water somehow she managed to keep jo in her grasp and stay on the ramp and when the surf settled she got to her feet and ran up out of the greedy reach of the ocean she walked all the way to the clifftop without looking back when she came within sight of the cottage she saw the jeep standing outside henry was back still carrying jo she broke into a stumbling run desperate to share her hurt with henry to feel his arms around her and have him comfort her her breath came in ragged sobs and tears mixed invisibly with the rain on her face she went to the back of the cottage burst into the kitchen and dumped jo ungently on the floor henry casually said david decided to stay over at toms another day she stared at him her mind a disbelieving blank and then still disbelieving she understood henry had killed david the conclusion came first like a punch in the stomach winding her the reasons followed a splitsecond later the shipwreck the oddshaped knife he was so attached to the crashed jeep the news bulletin about the london stiletto murderer suddenly everything fitted together a box of jigsaw pieces thrown in the air and landing improbably fully assembled dont look so surprised henry said with a smile theyve got a lot of work to do over there although i admit i didnt encourage him to come back tom she had to go to tom he would know what to do he would protect her and jo until the police came he had a dog and a gun her fear was interrupted by a dart of sadness of sorrow for the henry she had believed in had almost loved clearly he did not existshe had imagined him instead of a warm strong affectionate man she saw in front of her a monster who sat and smiled and calmly gave her invented messages from the husband he had murdered she forced herself not to shudder taking jos hand she walked out of the kitchen along the hall and out of the front door she got into the jeep sat jo beside her and started the engine but henry was there resting his foot casually on the running board and holding davids shotgun where are you going if she drove away now he might shoot hat instinct had warned him to take the gun into the house this timeand while she herself might chance it she couldnt endanger jo she said just putting the jeep away you need jos help for that he likes the ride dont crossexamine me he shrugged and stepped back she looked at him for a moment wearing davids hacking jacket and holding davids gun so casually and wondered whether he really would shoot her if she simply drove away and then she recalled the vein of ice she had sensed in him right from the start and knew that that ultimate commitment that ruthlessness would allow him to do anything with an awful feeling of weariness she threw the jeep into reverse and backed into the barn she switched off got out and walked with jo back into the cottage she had no idea what she would say to henry what she would do in his presence how she would hide her knowledge if indeed she had not already betrayed it she had no plans but she had left the barn door open thats the place number one the captain said and lowered his telescope the first mate peered out through the rain and the spray not quite the ideal holiday resort what sir jolly stark i should say indeed the captain was an oldfashioned naval officer with a grizzled beard who had been at sea during the first war with germany however he had learned to overlook his first mates foppish conversational style for the boy had turned out against all expectations to be a perfectly good sailor the boy who was past thirty and an old salt by this wars standards had no idea of the magnanimity he benefitted from he held on to a rail and braced himself as the corvette mounted the steep side of a wave righted itself at the crest and dived into the trough now that were here sir what do we do circle the island very good sir and keep our eyes open for a uboat were not likely to get one anywhere near the surface in this weather and if we did we couldnt see it unless it came within spitting distance the storm will blow itself out tonighttomorrow at the latest the captain began stuffing tobacco into a pipe do you think so im sure nautical instinct i suppose the weather forecast the corvette rounded a headland and they saw a small bay with a jetty above it on the cliff top was a little cottage standing small and square hunched against the wind the captain pointed well land a party there as soon as we can the first mate nodded all the same well each circuit of the island will take us about an hour i should say so so unless were jolly lucky and happen to be in exactly the right place at exactly the right time the uboat will surface take on its passenger and submerge again without us even seeing the ripples the captain finished yes the captain lit his pipe with an expertise that spoke of long experience in lighting pipes in heavy seas he puffed a few times then inhaled a lungful of smoke ours not to reason why he said and blew smoke through his nostrils a rather unfortunate quotation sir why it refers to the notorious charge of the light brigade i never knew that the captain puffed away one advantage of being uneducated i suppose there was another small cottage at the eastern end of the island the captain scrutinised it through his telescope and observed that it had a large professionallooking radio aerial sparks he called see if you can raise that cottage try the royal observer corps frequency when the cottage had passed out of sight the radio operator called no response sir all right sparks the captain said it wasnt important the crew of the coastguard cutter sat below decks in aberdeen harbour playing blackjack for halfpennies and musing on the feeblemindedness that seemed invariably to accompany high rank twist said jack smith who was more scots than his name albert slim parish a fat londoner far from home dealt him a jack bust smith said slim raked in his stake a pennyhapenny he said in mock wonder i only hope i live to spend it smith rubbed condensation off the inside of a porthole and peered out at the boats bobbing up and down in the harbour the way the skippers panicking youd think we were going to bloody berlin not storm island didnt you know were the spearhead of the allied invasion slim turned over a ten dealt himself a king and said pay twentyones smith said what is this guy anyway a deserter if you ask me its a job for the military police not us slim shuffled the pack ill tell you what he isan escaped prisoner of war jeers all right dont listen to me but when we pick him up just take note of his accent he put the cards down listen what boats go to storm island only the grocer someone said so the only way he can get back to the mainland is on the grocers boat the military police just have to wait for charlies regular trip to the island and pick him up when he steps off the boat at this end theres no reason for us to be sitting here waiting to weigh anchor and shoot over there at the speed of light the minute the weather clears unless he paused melodramatically unless hes got some other means of getting off the island like what a uboat thats what bollocks smith said the others merely laughed slim dealt another hand smith won this time but everyone else lost im a shilling up slim said i think ill retire to that nice little cottage in devon we wont catch him of course the deserter the prisoner of war why not slim tapped his head use your noddle when the storm clears well be here and the uboat will be at the bottom of the bay at the island so wholl get there first the jerries so why are we doing it smith said because the people who are giving the orders are not as sharp as yours truly albert parish you may laugh he dealt another hand place your bets youll see im right whats that smithie a penny gorblimey dont go mad i tell you what ill give odds of five to one we come back from storm island emptyhanded any takers ten to one eh ten to one no takers said smith deal the cards slim dealt the cards squadronleader peterkin blenkinsop he had tried to shorten peterkin to peter but somehow the men always found out stood ramrodstraight in front of the map and addressed the room we fly in formations of three he began the first three will take off as soon as weather permits our target he touched the map with a pointer is here storm island on arrival we will circle for twenty minutes at low altitudes looking for a uboat after twenty minutes we return to base he paused those of you with a logical turn of mind will by now have deduced that to achieve continuous cover the second formation of three aircraft must take off precisely twenty minutes after the first and so on any questions flyingoflficer longman said sir longman what do we do if we see this uboat strafe it of course drop a few grenades cause trouble but were flying fighters sir theres not much we can do to stop a uboat thats a job for battleships isnt it blenkinsop sighed as usual those of you who can think of better ways to win the war are invited to write directly to mr winston churchill number downing street london southwestone now are there any questions as opposed to stupid criticisms there were no questions the later years of the war had produced a different kind of raf officer bloggs thought as he sat on a soft chair in the scramble room close to the fire listening to the rain drumming on the tin roof and intermittently dozing the battle of britain pilots had seemed incorrigibly cheerful with their undergraduate slang their perpetual drinking their tirelessness and their cavalier disregard of the flaming death they faced up to every day that schoolboy heroism had not been enough to carry them through subsequent years as the war dragged on in places far from home and the emphasis shifted from the dashing individuality of aerial dogfighting to the mechanical drudgery of bombing missions they still drank and talked in jargon but they appeared older harder more cynical there was nothing in them now of tom browns schooldays bloggs recalled what he had done to that poor commonorgarden housebreaker in the police cells at aberdeen and he realised its happened to us all they were very quiet they sat all around him some dozing like himself others reading books or playing board games a bespectacled navigator in a corner was learning russian as bloggs surveyed the room with halfclosed eyes another pilot came in and he thought immediately that this one had not been aged by the war he had an oldfashioned wide grin and fresh face that looked as if it hardly needed shaving more than once a week he wore his jacket open and carried his helmet he made a beeline for bloggs detectiveinspector bloggs thats me jolly rood show im your pilot charles calder fine bloggs shook hands the kites all ready and the engines as sweet as a bird shes an amphibian i suppose you know yes jolly good show well land on the sea taxi in to about ten yards from the shore and put you off in a dinghy then you wait for me to come back indeed well all we need now is the weather yes look charles ive been chasing this fellow all over the country for six days and nights so im catching up on my sleep while ive got the chance you wont mind of course not the pilot sat down and produced a thick book from under his jacket catching up on my education he said war and peace bloggs said jolly good show and closed his eyes percival godliman and his uncle colonel terry sat side by side in the map room drinking coffee and tapping the ash of their cigarettes into a fire bucket on the floor between them godliman was repeating himself i cant think of anything more we can do he said so you said the corvette is already there and the fighters are only a few minutes away so the sub will come under fire as soon as she shows herself above the surface if shes seen the corvette will land a party as soon as possible bloggs will be there soon after that and the coastguard will bring up the rear and none of them can be sure to get there in time i know godliman said wearily weve done all we can but is it enough terry lit another cigarette what about the inhabitants of the island oh yes there are only two houses there theres a sheep farmer and his wife in onethey have a young childand an old shepherd lives in the other the shepherds got a radioroyal observer corpsbut we cant raise him he probably keeps the set switched to transmit hes old the farmer sounds promising terry said if hes a bright fellow he might even stop your spy godliman shook his head the poor chaps in a wheelchair dear god we dont get much luck do we no said godliman die nadel seems to have cornered the market lucy was becoming quite calm the feeling crept over her gradually like the icy spread of an anaesthetic deadening her emotions and sharpening her wits the times when she was momentarily paralysed by the thought that she was sharing a house with a murderer became fewer and she was possessed by a coolheaded watchfulness that surprised her as she went about the household chores sweeping around henry as he sat in the living room reading a novel she wondered how much he had noticed of the change in her feelings he was very observant he didnt miss much and there had been a definite wariness if not outright suspicion in that confrontation over the jeep he must have known she was shaken by something on the other hand she had been upset before he left over jo discovering them in bed together he might think that that was all that had been wrong still she had the strangest feeling that he knew exactly what was in her mind but preferred to pretend that everything was all right she hung her laundry to dry on a clotheshorse in the kitchen im sorry about this she said but i cant wait forever for the rain to stop he looked uninterestedly at the clothes thats all right he said and went back into the living room scattered among the wet garments was a complete set of clean dry clothes for lucy for lunch she made a vegetable pie using an austerity recipe she called jo and faber to the table and served up davids gun was propped in a corner of the kitchen i dont like having a loaded gun in the house she said ill take it outside after lunch the pie is good i dont like it jo said lucy picked up the gun and put it on top of the welsh dresser i suppose its all right as long as its out of jos reach jo said when i grow up im going to shoot germans this afternoon i want you to have a sleep lucy told him she went into the living room and took one of davids sleeping pills from the bottle in the cupboard two of the pills were a heavy dose for a stone man so one quarter of one pill should be just enough to make a stone boy sleep in the afternoon she put the pill on her chopping block and halved it then halved it again she put a quarter on a spoon crushed it with the back of another spoon and stirred the powder into a small glass of milk she gave the glass to jo i want you to drink every last drop faber watched the whole thing without comment after lunch she settled jo on the sofa with a pile of books he could not read of course but he had heard the stories read aloud so many times that he knew them by heart and he could turn the pages of the books looking at the pictures and reciting from memory the words on the page would you like some coffee she asked faber real coffee he said surprised ive got a little hoard yes please he watched her making it she wondered if he was afraid she might try to give him sleeping pills too she could hear jos voice from the next room what i said was is anybody at home called out pooh very loudly no said a voice and he laughed heartily as he always did at that joke oh god lucy thought please dont let jo be hurt she poured the coffee and sat opposite faber he reached across the table and held her hand for a while they sat in silence sipping coffee and listening to the rain and jos voice dow long does getting thin take asked pooh anxiously about a week i should think but i cant stay here for a week he began to sound sleepy and then he stopped lucy went and covered him with a blanket she picked up the book that had slipped from his fingers to the floor it had been hers when she was a child and she too knew the stories by heart the flyleaf was inscribed in her mothers copperplate for lucy aged four with love from mother and father she put the book on the sideboard she went back into the kitchen hes asleep and he held out his hand she forced herself to take it he stood up and she went ahead of him upstairs and into the bedroom she dosed the door then pulled her sweater off over her head for a moment he stood still looking at her breasts then he began to undress she got into the bed this was the part she was not sure she could manage pretending to enjoy his body when all she could feel was fear revulsion and guilt he got into bed and embraced her in a short while she found she did not have to pretend after all for a few seconds she lay in the crook of his arm wondering how it was that a man could do what he had done and love a woman as he had just done but what she said was would you like a cup of tea no thank you well i would she extricated herself and got up when he moved she put her hand on his flat belly and said no you stay there ill bring the tea up i havent finished with you he grinned youre really making up for your four wasted years as soon as she was outside the room the smile dropped from her face like a mask her heart pounded in her chest as she went quickly down the stairs in the kitchen she banged the kettle on the stove and rattled some china then began to put on the clothes she had left hidden in the wet laundry her hands were shaking so much she could hardly button the trousers she heard the bed creak upstairs and she stood frozen to the spot listening thinking stay there but he was only shifting his position she was ready she went into the living room jo was in a deep sleep grinding his teeth dear god dont let him wake up she picked him up he muttered in his sleep something about christopher robin and lucy closed her eyes tightly and willed him to be quiet she wrapped the blanket tight around him went back into the kitchen and reached up to the top of the welsh dresser for the gun it slipped from her grasp and fell to the shelf smashing a plate and two cups the crash was deafening she stood fixed to the spot what happened faber called from upstairs i dropped a cup she shouted she couldnt camouflage the tremor in her voice the bed creaked again and there was a footfall on the floor above her but it was too late now for her to turn back she picked up the gun opened the back door and holding jo to her ran across to the barn on the way she had a moment of panic had she left the keys in the jeep surely she had she always did she slipped in the wet mud and fell to her knees she began to cry for a second she was tempted to stay there and let him catch her and kill her the way he had killed her husband and then she remembered the child in her arms and she got up and ran she went into the barn and opened the passenger door of the jeep she put jo on the seat he slipped sideways lucy sobbed oh god she pulled jo upright and this time he stayed that way she ran around to the other side of the jeep and got in dropping the gun onto the floor between her legs she turned the starter it coughed and died please please she turned it again the engine roared into life faber came out of the back door at a run lucy raced the engine and threw the gearshift into forward the jeep seemed to leap out of the barn she rammed the throttle open the wheels spun in the mud for a second then bit again the jeep gathered speed with agonising languor she steered away from him but he chased after the jeep barefoot in the mud she realised he was gaining on her she pushed the handthrottle with all her strength almost snapping the thin lever she wanted to scream with frustration he was only a yard or so away almost even with her running like an athlete his arms going like pistons his bare feet pounding the muddy ground his cheeks blowing his naked chest heaving the engine screamed and there was a jerk as the automatic transmission changed up then a new surge of power lucy looked sideways again he seemed to realise that he had almost lost her and flung himself forward in a dive he got a grip on the door handle with his left hand and brought the right hand across pulled by the jeep he ran alongside for a few paces his feet hardly touching the ground lucy stared at his face so close to her it was red with effort twisted in pain the cords of his powerful neck bulged with the strain suddenly she knew what she had to do she took her hand off the wheel reached through the open window and poked him in the eye with a longnailed forefinger he let go and fell away his hands covering his face the distance between him and the jeep increased rapidly lucy realised she was crying like a baby two miles from her cottage she saw the wheelchair it stood on the cliff top like a memorial its metal frame and big rubber tyres impervious to the unending rain lucy approached it from a slight dip and saw its black outline framed by the slategrey sky and the boiling sea it had a wounded look like the hole left by an uprooted tree or a house with broken windows as if its passenger had been wrenched from it she recalled the first time she had seen it in the hospital it had stood beside davids bed new and shiny and he had swung himself into it expertly and swished up and down the ward showing off shes light as a feathermade of aircraft alloy he had said with brittle enthusiasm and sped off between the rows of beds he had stopped at the far end of the ward with his back to her and after a minute she went up behind him and she saw he was crying she had knelt in front of him and held his hands saying nothing it was the last time she had been able to comfort him there on the cliff top the rain and the salt wind would soon blemish the alloy and eventually it would rust and crumble its rubber perished its leather seat rotted away lucy drove past without slowing three miles further on when she was halfway between the two cottages she ran out of petrol she fought down the panic and tried to think rationally as the jeep shuddered to a halt people walked at four miles an hour she remembered reading somewhere henry was athletic but he had hurt his ankle and even though it seemed to have healed rapidly the running he had done after the jeep must have hurt it she must be a good hour ahead of him she calculated she had no doubt he would come after her he knew as well as she did that there was a wireless transmitter in toms cottage she had plenty of time in the back of the jeep was a halfgallon can of fuel for just such occasions as this she got out of the car fumbled the can out of the back and opened the tank cap then she thought again and the inspiration that came to her surprised her by its fiendishness she replaced the cap and went to the front of the car she checked that the ignition was off and opened the bonnet she was no mechanic but she could identify the distributor cap and trace the leads to the engine she lodged the fuel can securely beside the engine block and took off its cap there was a spark plug wrench in the tool kit she took out a plug checked again that the ignition was off and put the plug in the mouth of the fuel can securing it there with tape then she closed the hood when henry came along he was certain to try to start the jeep he would switch on the starter motor would turn the plug would spark and the halfgallon of petrol would explode she was not sure how much damage it would do but she felt certain it would be no help an hour later she was regretting her cleverness trudging through the mud soaked to the skin the sleeping child a dead weight over her shoulder she wanted nothing more than to lie down and die the booby trap seemed on reflection dubious and risky gasoline would burn not explode if there was not enough air in the mouth of the can it might not even ignite worst of all henry might suspect a trap look under the bonnet dismantle the bomb pour the petrol into the tank and drive after her she contemplated stopping for a rest but decided that if she sat down she might never get up again she should have been in sight of toms house by now she could not possibly have got lost even if she had not walked this path a dozen times before the whole island just was not big enough to get lost on she recognised a thicket where she and jo had once seen a fox she must be about a mile from toms home she would have seen it except for the rain she shifted jo to the other shoulder switched the shotgun from one hand to the other and forced herself to continue putting one foot in front of the other when the cottage finally became visible through the sheeting rain she could have cried with relief she was nearer than she thoughtperhaps a quarter of a mile suddenly jo seemed lighter and although the last stretch was uphillthe only hill on the islandshe seemed to cover it in no time at all tom she called out as she approached the front door tom tom she heard the answering bark of the dog she went in by the front door tom quickly bob dodged excitedly about her ankles barking furiously tom couldnt be far away he was probably in the outhouse lucy went upstairs and laid jo on toms bed the wireless was in the bedroom a complexlooking construction of wires and dials and knobs there was something that looked like a morse key she touched it experimentally and it gave a beep a thought came to her from distant memory something from a schoolgirl thrillerthe morse code for sos she touched the key again three short three long three short where was tom she heard a noise and ran to the window the jeep was making its way up the hill to the house henry had found the booby trap and used the petrol to fill the tank where was tom she rushed out of the bedroom intending to go and bang on the outhouse door but at the head of the stairs she paused bob was standing in the open doorway of the other bedroom the empty one come here bob she said the dog stood his ground barking she went to him and bent to pick him up then she saw tom he lay on his back on the bare floorboards of the vacant bedroom his eyes staring sightlessly at the ceiling his cap upside down on the floor behind his head his jacket was open and there was a small spot of blood on the shirt underneath close to his hand was a crate of whisky and lucy found herself thinking irrelevantly i didnt know he drank that much she felt his pulse he was dead think think yesterday henry had returned to her cottage battered as if he had been in a fight that must have been when he killed david today he had come here to toms cottage to fetch david he had said but of course he had known david was not there so why had he made the journey obviously to kill tom now she was completely alone she took hold of the dog by its collar and dragged it away from the body of its master on impulse she returned and buttoned the jacket over the small stiletto wound that had killed tom then she closed the door on him returned to the front bedroom and looked out of the window the jeep drew up in front of the house and stopped and henry got out lucys distress call was heard by the corvette captain sir said sparks i just picked up an sos from the island the captain frowned nothing we can do until we can land a boat he said did they say anything else not a thing sir it wasnt even repeated nothing we can do he said again send a signal to the mainland reporting it and keep listening aye aye sir it was also picked up by an mi listening post on top of a scottish mountain the rt operator a young man with abdominal wounds who had been invalided out of the raf was trying to pick up german navy signals from norway and he ignored the sos however he went off duty five minutes later and he mentioned it to his commanding officer it was only broadcast once he said probably a fishing vessel off the scottish coastthere might well be the odd small ship in trouble in this weather leave it with me the co said ill give the navy a buzz and i suppose id better inform whitehall protocol you know thank you sir at the royal observer corps station there was something of a panic of course sos was not the signal an observer was supposed to give when he sighted enemy aircraft but they knew that tom was old and who could say what he might send if he got excited so the air raid sirens were sounded and all other posts were alerted and antiaircraft guns were rolled out all over the east coast of scotland and the radio operator tried frantically to raise tom no german bombers came of course and the war office wanted to know why a full alert had been sounded when there was nothing in the sky but a few bedraggled geese so they were told the coastguard heard it too they would have responded to it if it had been on the correct frequency and if they had been able to establish the position of the transmitter and if that position had been within reasonable distance of the coast as it was they guessed from the fact that the signal came over on the observer corps frequency that it originated from old tom and they were already doing all they could about that situation whatever the he that situation was when the news reached the belowdeck card game on the cutter in the harbour at aberdeen slim dealt another hand of blackjack and said ill tell you whats happened old toms caught the prisoner of war and hes sitting on his head waiting for the army to arrive and take the bugger away bollocks said smith with which sentiment there was general agreement and the u heard it she was more than thirty nautical miles from storm island but weissman was roaming the dial to see what he could pick up and hoping improbably to hear glenn miller records from the american forces network in britain and his tuner happened to be on the right wavelength at the right time he passed the information to lieutenant commander heer adding it was not on our mans frequency major wohl who was still as irritating as ever said then it means nothing heer did not miss the opportunity to correcthim it means something he said it means that there may be some activity on the surface when we go up but this is unlikely to trouble us most unlikely heer agreed then it is meaningless it is probably meaningless they argued about it all the way to the island and so it worked out that within the space of five minutes the navy the royal observer corps mi and the coastguard all phoned godliman to tell him about the sos godliman phoned bloggs who had finally fallen into a deep sleep in front of the fire in the scramble room the shrill ring of the telephone startled him and he jumped to his feet thinking that the planes were about to take off a pilot picked up the receiver said yes into it twice and handed it to bloggs a mr godliman for you hello percy fred somebody on the island just broadcast an sos bloggs shook his head to clear the last remains of sleep who we dont know there was just the one signal not repeated and they dont seem to be receiving at all still theres not much doubt now no everything ready up there all except the weather good luck thanks bloggs hung up and returned to the young pilot who was till reading war and peace good news he told him the bastards definitely on the island jolly good show said the pilot faber closed the door of the jeep and began walking quite slowly toward the house he was wearing davids hacking jacket again there was mud all over his trousers where he had fallen and his hair was plastered wetly against his skull he was limping slightly on his right foot lucy backed away from the window and ran out of the bedroom and down the stairs the shotgun was on the floor in the hall where she had dropped it she picked it up suddenly it felt very heavy she had never actually fired a gun and she had no idea how to check whether this one was loaded she could figure it out given time but there was no time she took a deep breath and opened the front door stop she shouted her voice was pitched higher than she had intended and it sounded shrill and hysterical faber smiled pleasantly and kept on walking lucy pointed the gun at him holding the barrel with her left hand and the breech with her right her finger was on the trigger ill kill you she yelled dont be silly lucy he said mildly how could you hurt me after all the things weve done together havent we loved each other a little it was true she had told herself she could not fall in love with him and that was true too but she had felt something for him and if it was not love it was something very like it you knew about me this afternoon he said and now he was thirty yards away but it made no difference to you then did it that was partly true for a moment she saw in her minds eye a vivid picture of herself sitting astride him holding his sensitive hands to her breasts and then she realised what he was doing lucy we can work it out we can still have each other and she pulled the trigger there was an earsplitting crash and the weapon jumped in her hands its butt bruising her hip with the recoil she almost dropped it she had never imagined that firing a gun would feel like that she was quite deaf for a moment the shot went high over fabers head but all the same he ducked turned and ran zigzagging back to the jeep lucy was tempted to fire again but she stopped herself just in time realising that if he knew both barrels had been emptied there would be nothing to stop him turning and coming back he flung open the door of the jeep jumped in and shot off down the hill lucy knew he would be back but suddenly she felt happy almost gay she had won the first round she had driven him off but he would be back still she had the upper hand she was indoors and she had the gun and she had time to prepare prepare she must be ready for him next time he would be more subtle he would surely try to surprise her somehow she hoped he would wait until dark that would give her time first she had to reload the gun she went into the kitchen tom kept everything in his kitchen food coal tools storesand he had a gun like davids she knew the two firearms were the same because david had examined toms then sent away for one exactly like it the two men had enjoyed long discussions about weapons she found toms gun and a box of ammunition she put the two guns and the box on the kitchen table machines were simple she was convinced it was apprehension not stupidity that made women fumble when faced with a piece of engineering she fiddled with davids gun keeping the barrel pointed away from herself until it came open at the breech then she figured out what she had done to open it and practiced doing it again a couple of times it was surprisingly simple she loaded both guns then to make sure she had done everything correctly she pointed toms gun at the kitchen wall and pulled the trigger there was a shower of plaster bob barked like hed gone mad and she bruised her hip and deafened herself again but she was armed she must remember to pull the triggers gently so as not to jerk the gun and spoil her aim men probably got taught that kind of thing in the army what to do next she should make it difficult for henry to get into the house neither of the doors had locks of course if a house was burgled on this island one would know that the culprit lived in the other house lucy rummaged in toms tool box and found a shiny sharpbladed axe she stood on the stairs and began to hack away at the bannister the work made her arms ache but in five minutes she had six short lengths of stout seasoned oak she found a hammer and some nails and fixed the oak bars across the front and back doors three bars to each door four nails to each bar when it was done her wrists were in agony and the hammer felt as heavy as lead but she was still not finished she got another handful of the shiny fourinch nails and went around to every window in the house nailing them shut she realised with a sense of discovery why men always put nails in their mouths it was because you needed both hands for the work and if you put them in your pocket they stuck into your skin by the time she had finished it was dark she left the lights off he could still get into the house of course but at least he could not get in quietly he would have to break something and thereby alert her and then she would be ready with the guns she went upstairs carrying both guns to check on jo he was still asleep wrapped in his blanket on toms bed lucy struck a match to look at his face the sleeping pill must have really knocked him out but he was an average sort of colour his temperature seemed normal and he was breathing easily just stay that way little boy lucy whispered the sudden access of tenderness left her feeling more savage toward henry she restlessly patrolled the house peering through the windows into the darkness the dog following her everywhere she took to carrying just one of the guns leaving the other at the head of the stairs but she hooked the axe into the belt of her trousers she remembered the radio and tapped out her sos several more times she had no idea whether anybody was listening or even whether the radio was working she knew no more morse so she could not broadcast anything else it occurred to her that tom probably did not know morse code surely he must have a book somewhere if only she could tell someone what was happening here she searched the house using dozens of matches feeling terrified every time she lit one within sight of a downstairs window she found nothing all right perhaps he did know morse on the other hand why should he need it he only had to tell the mainland that there were enemy aircraft approaching and there was no reason why that information shouldnt go over the air what was the phrase david had used au clair she went back to the bedroom and looked again at the wireless set to one side of the main cabinet hidden from her previous cursory glance was a microphone if she could talk to them they could talk to her the sound of another human voicea normal sane mainland voice suddenly seemed the most desirable prospect in the world she picked up the microphone and began to experiment with the switches bob growled softly she put the mike down and reached out her hand toward the dog in the darkness what is it bob he growled again she could feel his ears standing stiffly upright she was terribly afraid the confidence gained by confronting henry with the gun by learning how to reload by barricading the door and nailing down the windows all evaporated at one growl from an alert dog downstairs she whispered quietly she held his collar and let him lead her down the stairs in the darkness she felt for the bannister forgetting she had chopped it up for her barricades and she almost overbalanced she regained her equilibrium and sucked at a splinter in her finger the dog hesitated in the hall then growled more loudly and tugged her toward the kitchen she picked him up and held his muzzle shut to silence him then she crept through the doorway she looked in the direction of the window but there was nothing in front of her eyes other than the deep blackness she listened the window creaked at first almost inaudibly then louder he was trying to get in bob rumbled threateningly deep in his throat but seemed to understand the sudden squeeze she gave his muzzle the night became quieter lucy realised the storm was easing almost imperceptibly henry seemed to have given up on the kitchen window she moved to the living room she heard the same creak of old wood resisting pressure now henry seemed more determined there were three muffled bumps as if he were tapping the window frame with the cushioned heel of his hand lucy put the dog down and hefted the shotgun it might almost have been imagination but she could just make out the window as a square of grey in the blank darkness if he got the window open she would fire immediately there was a much harder bang bob lost control and gave a loud bark she heard a scuffling noise outside then came the voice lucy she bit her lip lucy he was using the voice he used in bed deep soft intimate lucy can you hear me dont be afraid i dont want to hurt you talk to me please she had to fight the urge to pull both triggers there and then just to silence that awful sound and destroy the memories it brought to her lucy darling she thought she heard a muffled sob lucy he attacked me i had to kill him i killed for my country you shouldnt hate me for that what in the world did that mean it sounded crazy could he be insane and have hidden it for two intimate days actually he had seemed saner than most people and yet he had already committed murder though she had no idea of the circumstances stop it she was softening up which of course was exactly what he wanted she had an idea lucy just speak to me his voice faded as she tiptoed into the kitchen bob would surely warn her if henry did anything more than talk she fumbled in toms tool box and found a pair of pliers she went to the kitchen window and with her fingertips located the heads of the three nails she had hammered there carefully as quietly as possible she drew them out the job demanded all her strength when they were out she went back to the living room to listen dont cause me trouble and ill leave you alone as silently as she could she lifted the kitchen window she crept into the living room picked up the dog and returned once again to the kitchen hurt you last thing in the world she stroked the dog once or twice and murmured i wouldnt do this if i didnt have to boy then she pushed him out of the window she closed it rapidly found a nail and hammered it in at a new spot with three sharp blows she dropped the hammer picked up the gun and ran into the front room to stand close to the window pressing herself up against the wall give you one last chance there was a scampering sound from bob followed by a terrible terrifying bark lucy had never before heard from a sheepdog then a scuffling sound and the noise of a man falling she could hear henrys breathing gasping grunting then another flurry of bobs scampering a shout of pain a curse in a foreign language another terrible bark the noises now became muffled and more distant then suddenly ended lucy waited pressed against the wall next to the window straining to hear she wanted to go and check jo wanted to try the radio again wanted to cough but she did not dare to move bloody visions of what bob might have done to henry passed in and out of her mind and she badly wanted to hear the dog snuffling at the door she looked at the window then realised she was looking at the window she could see and not just a square patch of faintly lighter grey but the wooden crosspiece of the frame it was still night but only just and she knew if she looked outside the sky would be faintly diffused with a justperceptible light instead of being impenetrably black dawn would come at any minute she would be able to see the furniture in the room and henry would no longer be able to surprise her in the darkness there was a crash of breaking glass inches away from her face she jumped she felt a small sharp pain in her cheek touched the spot and knew that she had been cut by a flying shard she hefted the shotgun waiting for henry to come through the window nothing happened it was not until a minute or two had passed that she wondered what had broken the window she peered at the floor among the pieces of broken glass was a large dark shape she found she could see it better if she looked to one side of it rather than directly at it when she did she was able to make out the familiar shape of the dog she closed her eyes then looked away she was unable to feel any emotion at all her heart had been numbed by all the terror and death that had gone before first david then tom then the endless screaming tension of the allnight siege all she felt was hunger all day yesterday she had been too nervous to eat which meant it was some thirtysix hours since her last meal now incongruously ridiculously she found herself longing for a cheese sandwich something else was coming through the window she saw it out of the corner of her eye then turned her head to look directly at it it was henrys hand she stared at it mesmerised a longfingered hand without rings white under the dirt with caredfor nails and a bandaid around the tip of the index finger a hand that had touched her intimately had played her body like an instrument had thrust a knife into the heart of an old shepherd the hand broke away a piece of glass then another enlarging the hole in the pane then it reached right through up to the elbow and fumbled along the windowsill searching for a catch to unfasten trying to be utterly silent with painful slowness lucy shifted the gun to her left hand and with her right took the axe from her belt lifted it high above her head and brought it down with all her might on henrys hand he must have sensed it or heard the rush of wind or seen a blur of ghostly movement behind the window because he moved abruptly a splitsecond before the blow landed the axe thudded into the wood of the windowsill sticking there for a fraction of an instant lucy thought she had missed then from outside came a scream of pain and she saw beside the axe blade lying on the varnished wood like caterpillars two severed fingers she heard the sound of feet running she threw up the exhaustion hit her then closely followed by a rush of selfpity she had suffered enough surely to god had she not there were policemen and soldiers in the world to deal with situations like this nobody could expect an ordinary housewife and mother to hold off a murderer indefinitely who could blame her if she gave up now who could honestly say they would have done better lasted longer stayed more resourceful for another minute she was finished they would have to take over the outside world the policemen and soldiers whoever was at the other end of that radio link she could do no more she tore her eyes away from the grotesque objects on the windowsill and went wearily up the stairs she picked up the second gun and took both weapons into the bedroom with her jo was still asleep thank god he had hardly moved all night blessedly unaware of the apocalypse going on around him she could tell somehow that he was not sleeping so deeply now something about the look on his face and the way he breathed let her know that he would wake soon and want his breakfast she longed for that old routine now getting up in the morning making breakfast dressing jo doing simple tedious safe household chores like washing and cleaning and cutting herbs from the garden and making pots of tea it seemed incredible that she had been so dissatisfied with davids lovelessness the long boring evenings the endless bleak landscape of turf and heather and rain it would never come back that life she had wanted cities music people ideas now the desire for those things had left her and she could not understand how she had ever wanted them peace was all a human being ought to ask for it seemed to her she sat in front of the radio and studied its switches and dials she would do this one thing then she would rest she made a tremendous effort and forced herself to think analytically for a little longer there were not so many possible combinations of switch and dial she found a knob with two settings turned it and tapped the morse key there was no sound perhaps that meant the microphone was now in circuit she pulled it to her and spoke into it hello hello is there anybody there hello there was a switch that had transmit above it and receive below it was turned to transmit if the world was to talk back to her obviously she had to throw the switch to receive she said hello is anybody listening and threw the switch to receive nothing then come in storm island receiving you loud and clear it was a mans voice he sounded young and strong capable and reassuring and alive and normal come in storm island weve been trying to raise you all night where the devil have you been lucy switched to transmit tried to speak and burst into tears percival godliman had a headache from too many cigarettes and too little sleep he had taken a little whisky to help him through the long worried night in his office and that had been a mistake everything oppressed him the weather his office his job the war for the first time since he had got into this business he found himself longing for dusty libraries illegible manuscripts and mediaeval latin colonel terry walked in with two cups of tea on a tray nobody around here sleeps he said cheerfully he sat down ships biscuit he offered godliman a plate godliman refused the biscuit and drank the tea it gave him a temporary lift i just had a call from the great man terry said hes keeping the night vigil with us i cant imagine why godliman said sourly hes worried the phone rang godliman i have the royal observer corps in aberdeen for you sir yes a new voice came on the voice of a young man royal observer corps aberdeen here sir yes is that mr godliman yes dear god these military types took their time weve raised storm island at last sir its not our regular observer in fact its a woman what did she say nothing yet sir what do you mean godliman fought down the angry impatience shes just well crying sir godliman hesitated can you connect me to her yes hold on there was a pause punctuated by several clicks and a hum then godliman heard the sound of a woman weeping he said hello can you hear me the weeping went on the young man came back on the line to say she wont be able to hear you until she switches to receive sir ah shes done it go ahead godliman said hello young lady when ive finished speaking ill say over then you switch to transmit to speak to me and you say over when you have finished do you understand over the womans voice came on oh thank god for somebody sane yes i understand over now then godliman said gently tell me whats been happening there over a man was shipwrecked here two no three days ago i think hes that stiletto murderer from london he killed my husband and our shepherd and now hes outside the house and ive got my little boy here ive nailed the windows shut and fired at him with a shotgun and barred the door and set the dog on him but he killed the dog and i hit him with an axe when he tried to get in through the window and i cant do it anymore so please come for gods sake over godliman put his hand over the phone his face was white jesus christ but when he spoke to her he was brisk you must try to hold on a little longer he began there are sailors and coastguards and policemen and all sorts of people on their way to you but they cant land until the storm lets up now theres something i want you to do and i cant tell you why you must do it because of the people who may be listening to us but i can tell you that it is absolutely essential are you hearing me clearly over yes go on over you must destroy your radio over oh no please yes godliman said then he realised she was still transmitting i dont i cant then there was a scream godliman said hello aberdeen whats happening the young man came on the sets still transmitting sir but shes not speaking we cant hear anything she screamed yes we got that godliman hesitated a moment whats the weather like up there its raining sir the young man sounded puzzled im not making conversation godliman snapped is there any sign of the storm letting up its eased a little in the last few minutes sir good get back to me the instant that woman comes back on the air very good sir godliman said to terry god only knows what that girls going through up there he jiggled the cradle of the phone the colonel crossed his legs if she would only smash up the radio then then we dont care if he kills her you said it godliman spoke into the phone get me bloggs at rosyth bloggs woke up with a start and listened outside it was dawn everyone in the scramble hut was listening too they could hear nothing that was what they were listening to the silence the rain had stopped drumming on the tin roof bloggs went to the window the sky was grey with a band of white on the eastern horizon the wind had dropped suddenly and the rain had become a light drizzle the pilots started putting on jackets and helmets lacing boots lighting up last cigarettes a klaxon sounded and a voice boomed out over the airfield scramble scramble the phone rang the pilots ignored it and piled out through the door bloggs picked it up yes percy here fred we just contacted the island hes killed the two men the womans managing to hold him off at the moment but she clearly wont last much longer the rain has stopped were taking off now bloggs said make it fast fred goodbye bloggs hung up and looked around for his pilot charles calder had fallen asleep over war and peace bloggs shook him roughly wake up you dozy bastard wake up calder opened his eyes bloggs could have hit him wake up come on were going the storms ended the pilot jumped to his feet jolly good show he said he ran out of the door and bloggs followed shaking his head the lifeboat dropped into the water with a crack like a pistol and a wide vshaped splash the sea was far from calm but here in the partial shelter of the bay there was no risk to a stout boat in the hands of experienced sailors the captain said carry on number one the first mate was standing at the rail with three of the ratings he wore a pistol in a waterproof holster lets go he told them the four men scrambled down the ladders and into the boat the first mate sat in the stern and the three sailors broke out the oars and began to row for a few moments the captain watched their steady progress toward the jetty then he went back to the bridge and gave orders for the corvette to continue circling the island the shrill ringing of a bell broke up the card game on the cutter slim said i thought something was different we arent going up and down so much almost motionless really makes me damn seasick nobody was listening the crew were hurrying to their stations some of them fastening life jackets as they went the engines fired with a roar and the vessel began to tremble faintly up on deck smith stood in the prow enjoying the fresh air and the spray on his face after a day and a night below as the cutter left the harbour slim joined him here we go again slim said i knew the bell was going to ring then smith said you know why tell me i was holding ace and a king bankers twentyone lieutenant commander werner heer looked at his watch thirty minutes major wohl nodded whats the weather like the storm has ended heer said reluctantly he would have preferred to keep that information to himself then we should surface if your man were there he would send us a signal the war is not won by hypothesis captain said wohl i firmly suggest that we surface there had been a blazing row while the uboat was in dock between heers superior officer and wohls and wohls had won heer was still captain of the ship but he had been told in no uncertain terms that he had better have a damned good reason next time he ignored one of major wohls firm suggestions we will surface at six oclock exactly he said wohl nodded again and looked away the sound of breaking glass then an explosion like an incendiary bomb whoomph lucy dropped the microphone something was happening downstairs she picked up a shotgun and ran down the living room was ablaze the fire centred on a broken jar on the floor henry had made some kind of bomb with the petrol from the jeep the flames were spreading across toms threadbare carpet and licking up over the loose covers of his ancient threepiece suite a featherfilled cushion caught and the fire reached up toward the ceiling lucy picked up the cushion and threw it through the broken window singeing her hand she tore her coat off and threw it on the carpet stamping on it she picked it up again and draped it over the floral settee there was another crash of glass it came from upstairs lucy screamed jo she dropped the coat and rushed up the stairs and into the front bedroom faber was sitting on the bed with jo on his lap the child was awake sucking his thumb wearing his wideeyed morning look faber was stroking his tousled hair throw the gun on the bed lucy her shoulders sagged and she did as he said you climbed the wall and got through the window she said dully faber dumped jo off his lap go to mummy jo ran to her and she lifted him up he picked up both guns and went to the radio he was holding his right hand under his left armpit and there was a great red bloodstain on his jacket he sat down you hurt me he said then he turned his attention to the transmitter suddenly it spoke come in storm island he picked up the microphone hello just a minute there was a pause then another voice came on lucy recognised it as the man in london who had told her to destroy the radio he would be disappointed in her it said hello this is godliman again can you hear me over faber said yes i can hear you professor seen any good cathedrals lately what is that yes faber smiled how do you do then the smile abruptly left his face as if playtime was over and he manipulated the frequency dial of the radio lucy turned and left the room it was over she walked listlessly down the stairs and into the kitchen there was nothing for her to do but wait for him to kill her she could not run away she did not have the energy and he obviously knew it she looked out of the window the storm had ended the howling gale had dropped to a stiff breeze there was no rain and the eastern sky was bright with the promise of sunshine the sea she frowned and looked again yes my god it was a submarine destroy the radio the man had said last night henry had cursed in a foreign language did it for my country he had said and in his delirium something about waiting at calais for a phantom army destroy the radio why would a man take a can of photographic negatives on a fishing trip she had known all along he was not insane the submarine was a german uboat henry was some kind of german agent spy this very moment he must be trying to contact that uboat by radio destroy the radio she had no right to give up she couldnt now that she understood she knew what she had to do she would have liked to put jo somewhere else where he could not see itthat bothered her more than the pain she knew she would feelbut there was no time for that henry would surely find his frequency at any second and then it might be too late she had to destroy the radio but the radio was upstairs with henry and he had both the guns and he would kill her she knew only one way to do it she placed one of toms kitchen chairs in the centre of the room stood on it reached up and unscrewed the light bulb she got down off the chair went to the door and threw the switch are you changing the bulb jo asked lucy climbed on the chair hesitated for a moment then thrust three fingers into the live socket there was a bang an instant of agony and then unconsciousness faber heard the bang he had found the right frequency on the transmitter had thrown the switch to transmit and had picked up the microphone he was about to speak when the noise came immediately afterward the lights on the dials of the wireless set went out his face suffused with anger she had shortcircuited the electricity supply to the whole house he had not credited her with that much ingenuity he should have killed her before what was wrong with him he had never hesitated not ever until he met this woman he picked up one of the guns and went downstairs the child was crying lucy lay in the kitchen doorway out cold faber took in the empty light socket with the chair beneath it he frowned in amazement she had done it with her hand faber said jesus christ almighty lucys eyes opened she hurt all over henry was standing over her with the gun in his hands he was saying why did you use your hand why not a screwdriver i didnt know you could do it with a screwdriver he shook his head you are truly an astonishing woman he said as he lifted the gun aimed it at her and lowered it again damn you his gaze went to the window and he started you saw it he said she nodded he stood tense for a moment then went to the door finding it nailed shut he smashed the window with the butt of his gun and climbed out lucy got to her feet jo threw his arms around her legs she did not feel strong enough to pick him up she staggered to the window and looked out he was running toward the cliff the uboat was still there perhaps half a mile offshore he reached the cliff edge and crawled over he was going to try to swim to the submarine she had to stop him dear god no more she climbed through the window blotting out the cries of her son and ran after him when she reached the cliff edge she lay down and looked over he was about halfway between her and the sea he looked up and saw her froze for a moment and then began to move faster dangerously fast her first thought was to climb down after him but what would she do then even if she caught him she couldnt possibly stop him the ground beneath her shifted slightly she scrambled back afraid it would give way and throw her down the cliff which gave her the idea she thumped on the rocky ground with both fists it seemed to shake a little more and a crack appeared she got one hand over the edge and thrust the other into the crack a piece of earthy chalk the size of a watermelon came away in her hands she looked over the edge and sighted him she took careful aim and dropped the stone it seemed to fall very slowly he saw it coming and covered his head with his arm it looked to her as if it would miss him the rock passed within a few inches of his head and hit his left shoulder he was holding on with his left hand he seemed to lose his grip and he balanced precariously for a moment the right hand the injured one scrabbled for a hold then he appeared to lean out away from the face of the rock arms windmilling until his feet slipped from their narrow ledge and he was in midair suspended and finally he dropped like a stone to the rocks below he made no sound he landed on a flat rock that jutted above the surface of the water the noise his body made hitting the rock sickened her he lay there on his back arms outflung head at an impossible angle something seeped out from inside him on to the stone and lucy turned away everything seemed to happen at once then there was a roaring sound from the sky and three aircraft with raf circles on their wings flew out of the clouds and dipped low over the uboat their guns firing four sailors came up the hill toward the house at a jog trot one of them shouting leftrightleftrightleftright another plane landed on the sea a dinghy emerged from inside it and a man in a life jacket began to row toward the cliff a small ship came around the headland and steamed toward the uboat the uboat submerged the dinghy bumped into the rocks at the foot of the cliff and the man got out and examined fabers body a boat she recognised as the coastguard cutter appeared one of the sailors came up to her are you all right love theres a little girl in the cottage crying for her mummy its a boy lucy said i must cut his hair bloggs steered the dinghy toward the body at the foot of the cliff the boat bumped against the rock and he scrambled out andonto the flat surface die nadels skull had smashed like a glass goblet when he hit the rock looking more closely bloggs could see that the man had been somewhat battered even before the fall his right hand was mutilated and there was something wrong with his ankle bloggs searched the body the stiletto was where he had guessed it might be in a sheath strapped to the left forearm in the inside pocket of the expensivelooking bloodstained jacket bloggs found a wallet papers money and a small film can containing twentyfour mm photographic negatives he held them up to the strengthening light they were the negatives of the prints found in the envelopes faber had sent to the portuguese embassy the sailors on the cliff top threw down a rope bloggs put fabers possessions into his own pocket then tied the rope around the body they hauled it up then sent the rope down for bloggs when he got to the top the sublieutenant introduced himself and they walked across to the cottage on top of the hill we havent touched anything didnt want to destroy evidence the senior sailor said dont worry too much bloggs told him there wont be a prosecution they had to enter the house through the broken kitchen window the woman was sitting at a table with the child on her lap bloggs smiled at her he could not think of anything to say he looked quickly around the cottage it was a battlefield he saw the nailedup windows the barred doors the remains of the fire the dog with its throat cut the shotguns the broken bannister and the axe embedded in the windowsill beside two severed fingers he thought what kind of woman is she he set the sailors to work one to tidy the house and unbar the doors and windows another to replace the blown fuse a third to make tea he sat down in front of the woman and looked at her she was dressed in illfitting mannish clothes her hair was wet her face was dirty despite all that she was remarkably beautiful with lovely amber eyes in an oval face bloggs smiled at the child and spoke quietly to the woman what youve done is tremendously important he said one of these days well explain but for now i have to ask you two questions is that okay her eyes focused on him and after a moment she nodded did faber succeed in contacting the uboat by radio the woman just looked blank bloggs found a toffee in his trousers pocket can i give the boy a sweet he looks hungry thank you she said now did faber contact the uboat his name was henry baker she said oh well did he no i shortcircuited the electricity that was very smart bloggs said how did you do it she pointed at the empty light socket above them screwdriver eh no i wasnt that smart fingers he gave her a look of horror disbelief the thought of deliberately he shook himself trying to put it out of his mind and thought again what kind of woman is she right well do you think anyone on the uboat could have seen him coming down the cliff the effort of concentration showed on her face nobody came out of the hatch im quite sure she said could they have seen him through their periscope no she said this is good news very good news it means they dont know hes been neutralised anyway he changed the subject hastily youve been through as much as any man on the front line more were going to get you and the boy to a hospital on the mainland yes she said bloggs turned to the senior sailor is there any form of transport around yes a jeep down in that little stand of trees good will you drive these two over to the jetty and get them onto your boat surely bloggs turned to the woman again he felt a tremendous surge of affection mixed with admiration for her she looked frail and helpless now but he knew she was as brave and strong as she was beautiful surprising her and himself he took hold of her hand when youve been in hospital a day or two youll begin to feel depressed but thats a sign youre getting better i wont be far away and the doctors will tell me ill want to talk to you some more but not before you feel like it okay at last she smiled at him and he felt the warmth youre very kind she said she stood up and carried her child out of the house kind bloggs muttered to himself god what a woman he went upstairs to the radio and tuned it to the royal observer corps frequency storm island calling over come in storm island patch me through to london hold on there was a long pause then a familiar voice godliman percy we caught the smuggler hes dead marvellous marvellous there was undisguised triumph in godlimans voice did he manage to contact his partner almost certainly not well done well done dont congratulate me bloggs said by the time i got here it was all over bar the tidying up who the woman well im damned whats she like bloggs grinned shes a hero percy and godliman smiling on his end now too understood hitler stood at the panoramic window looking out at the mountains he wore his dovegrey uniform and he looked tired and depressed he had called his physician during the night admiral puttkamer saluted and said good morning hitler turned and peered closely at his aidedecamp those beady eyes never failed to unnerve puttkamer was die nadel picked up no there was some trouble at the rendezvous the english police were chasing smugglers it appears die nadel was not there anyway he sent a wireless message a few minutes ago he offered a sheet of paper hitler took it from him put on his spectacles and began to read your rendezvous insecure you cunts i am wounded and transmitting left handed first united states army group assembled east anglia under patton order of battle as follows twentyone infantry divisions five armoured divisions approximately five thousand aircraft plus requisite troopships in the wash fusag will attack calais june fifteenth regards to willi hitler handed the message back to puttkamer and sighed so its calais after all can we be sure of this man the

i would trust this mans report and i shall he made a gesture of dismissal tell rommel and rundstedt they cant have their panzers and send in that damned doctor puttkamer saluted again and went out to relay the orders when germany defeated england in the quarterfinal of the world cup soccer tournament grandpa was furious he sat in front of the colour television set and muttered through his beard at the screen cunning he told the assorted experts who were now disgecting the game cunning and stealth thats the way to defeat the damned germans he would not be mollified until his grandchildren arrived jos white jaguar drew up on the drive of the modest threebedroom house and then jo himself prosperouslooking in a suede jacket along with his wife ann and their children went in jo said did you watch the football pop terrible we were rubbish since hed retired from the force and had more leisure time he had taken an interest in sports the germans were better jo said they play good football we cant win it every time dont talk to me about bloody germans cunning and stealth thats the way to beat them he addressed the grandson on his lap thats the way we beat them in the war davy we tricked them proper how did you trick them davy asked well see we made them think his voice became low and conspiratorial and the little boy giggled in anticipation we made them think we were going to attack calais thats in france not germany ann shushed him let your grandpa tell his stories anyway grandpa continued we made them think we were going to attack calais so they put all their tanks and soldiers there he used a cushion to represent france an ashtray for the germans and a penknife for the allies but we attacked normandy and there was nobody much there but old rommel and a few popguns didnt they find out about the trick david asked they nearly did in fact there was one spy who did find out what happened to him we killed him before he could tell did you kill him grandpa no

becawe she doesnt like me showing it to visitors she was pouring tea its all over now and best forgotten she handed a cup and saucer to her husband he took her arm and held her there its far from over he said and his voice was suddenly gentle they looked at each other for a moment her beautiful hair was greying now and she wore it up in a bun she was heavier than she used to be but her eyes were still the same large and amber and remarkably beautiful those eyes looked back at him now and they both were very still remembering until david jumped off his grandpas lap and knocked the cup of tea to the floor and the spell was broken
