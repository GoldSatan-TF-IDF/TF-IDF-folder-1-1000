elizabeth george careless in red book in the inspector lynley series to the memory of stephen lawrence and april when he was murdered in eltham southeast london by five men who have gone unpunished by the british judicial system to this day if thou art indeed my father then thou hast stained thy sword in the lifeblood of thy son and thou didst it of thine own obstinacy for i sought to turn thee into love from the shahnameh chapter one he found the body on the fortythird day of his walk by then the end of april had arrived although he had only the vaguest idea of that had he been capable of noticing his surroundings the condition of the flora along the coast might have given him a broad hint as to the time of year hed started out when the only sign of life renewed was the promise of yellow buds on the gorse that grew sporadically along the cliff tops but by april the gorse was wild with color and yellow archangel climbed in tight whorls along upright stems in hedgerows on the rare occasions when he wandered into a village soon foxglove would be nodding on roadside verges and lambs foot would expose fiery heads from the hedgerows and the drystone walls that defined individual fields in this part of the world but those bits of burgeoning life were in the future and hed been walking these days that had blended into weeks in an effort to avoid both the thought of the future and the memory of the past he carried virtually nothing with him an ancient sleeping bag a rucksack with a bit of food that he replenished when the thought occurred to him a bottle within that rucksack that he filled with water in the morning if water was to be had near the site where hed slept everything else he wore one waxed jacket one hat one tattersall shirt one pair of trousers boots socks underclothes hed come out for this walk unprepared and uncaring that he was unprepared hed known only that he had to walk or he had to remain at home and sleep and if he remained at home and slept hed come to realise that eventually he would will himself not to awaken again so he walked there had seemed no alternative steep ascents to cliff tops the wind striking his face the sharp salt air desiccating his skin scrambling across beaches where reefs erupted from sand and stone when the tide was low his breath coming short rain soaking his legs stones pressing insistently against his solesthese things would remind him that he was alive and that he was intended to remain so he was thus engaged in a wager with fate if he survived the walk so be it if he did not his ending was in the hands of the gods in the plural he decided he could not think that there might be a single supreme being out there pressing fingers into the keyboard of a divine computer inserting this or forever deleting that his family had asked him not to go for theyd seen his state although like so many families of his class theyd not made any direct mention of it just his mother saying please dont do this darling and his brother suggesting with his face gone pale and always the threat of another relapse hanging over him and over them all let me go with you and his sister murmuring with her arm round his waist youll get past it one does but none of them mentioning her name or the word itself that terrible eternal definitive word nor did he mention it nor did he mention anything other than his need to walk the fortythird day of this walk had taken the same shape as the fortytwo days that had preceded it hed awakened where hed fallen on the previous night with absolutely no knowledge where he was aside from somewhere along the southwest coast path hed climbed out of his sleeping bag donned his jacket and his boots drunk the rest of his water and begun to move in midafternoon the weather which had been uneasy most of the day made up its mind and blew dark clouds across the sky in the wind they piled one upon the other as if an immense shield in the distance were holding them in place and allowing them no further passage having made the promise of a storm he was struggling in the wind to the top of a cliff climbing from a vshaped cove where hed rested for an hour or so and watched the waves slamming into broad fins of slate that formed the reefs in this place the tide was just beginning to come in and hed noted this he needed to be well above it he needed to find some sort of shelter as well near the top of the cliff he sat he was winded and he found it odd that no amount of walking these many days had seemed sufficient to build his endurance for the myriad climbs he was making along the coast so he paused to catch his breath he felt a twinge that he recognised as hunger and he used the minutes of his respite to draw from his rucksack the last of a dried sausage hed purchased when hed come to a hamlet along his route he gnawed it down to nothing realised that he was also thirsty and stood to see if anything resembling habitation was nearby hamlet fishing cottage holiday home or farm there was nothing but thirst was good he thought with resignation thirst was like the sharp stones pressing into the soles of his shoes like the wind like the rain it reminded him when reminders were needed he turned back to the sea he saw that a lone surfer bobbed there just beyond the breaking waves at this time of year the figure was entirely clothed in black neoprene it was the only way to enjoy the frigid water he knew nothing about surfing but he knew a fellow cenobite when he saw one there was no religious meditation involved but they were both alone in places where they should not have been alone they were also both alone in conditions that were not suited for what they were attempting for him the coming rainfor there could be little doubt that rain was moments away from fallingwould make his walk along the coast slippery and dangerous for the surfer the exposed reefs onshore demanded an answer to the question that asked why he surfed at all he had no answer and little interest in developing one his inadequate meal finished he resumed his walk the cliffs were friable in this part of the coast unlike the cliffs where hed begun his walk there they were largely granite igneous intrusions into the landscape forced upon ancient lava limestone and slate although worn by time weather and the restless sea they were nonetheless solid underfoot and a walker could venture near the edge and watch the roiling sea or observe the gulls seeking perches among the crags here however the cliff edge was culm slate shale and sandstone and cliff bases were marked by mounds of the stony detritus called clitter that fell regularly to the beach below venturing near the edge meant a certain fall a fall meant broken bones or death at this section of his walk the cliff top leveled out for some one hundred yards the path was well marked moving away from the cliff s edge and tracing a line between gorse and thrift on one side and a fenced pasture on the other exposed here he bent into the wind and moved steadily forward he became aware that his throat was painfully dry and his head had begun to fill with a dull ache just behind his eyes he felt a sudden bout of dizziness as he reached the far end of the cliff top lack of water he thought he would not be able to go much farther without doing something about it a stile marked the edge of the high pasture hed been following and he climbed it and paused waiting for the landscape to stop swimming in front of him long enough for him to find the descent to what would be yet another cove hed lost count of the inlets hed come upon in his walk along the undulating coast he had no idea what this one was called any more than hed been able to name the others when the vertigo had passed he saw that a lone cottage stood at the edge of a wide meadow beneath him perhaps two hundred yards inland from the beach and along the side of a twisting brook a cottage meant potable water so he would make for that it wasnt a great distance off the path he stepped down from the stile just as the first drops of rain fell he wasnt wearing his hat at the moment so he shrugged his rucksack from his shoulders and dug it out he was pulling it low onto his foreheadan old baseball cap of his brothers with mariners scrolled across itwhen he caught sight of a flash of red he looked in the direction from which it had seemed to come and he found it at the base of the cliff that formed the far side of the inlet beneath him there a sprawl of red lay across a broad plate of slate this slate was itself the landward end of a reef which crept from the cliff bottom out into the sea he studied the red sprawl at this distance it could have been anything from rubbish to laundry but he knew instinctively that it was not for although all of it was crumpled part of it seemed to form an arm and this arm extended outward onto the slate as if supplicating an unseen benefactor who was not nor would ever be there he waited a full minute that he counted off in individual seconds he waited uselessly to see if the form would move when it did not he began his descent a light rain was falling when daidre trahair made the final turn down the lane that led to polcare cove she switched on the windscreen wipers and created a mental note that they would have to be replaced sooner rather than later it wasnt enough to tell herself that spring led to summer and windscreen wipers wouldnt actually be necessary at that point late april was so far being as notoriously unpredictable as usual and while may was generally pleasant in cornwall june could be a weather nightmare so she decided then and there that she had to get new wipers and she considered where she might purchase them she was grateful for this mental diversion it allowed her to push from her mind all consideration of the fact that at the end of this journey south she was feeling nothing no dismay confusion anger resentment or compassion and not an ounce of grief the grief part didnt worry her who honestly could have expected her to feel it but the rest of itto have been bled of every possible emotion in a situation where at least marginal feeling was called forthat concerned her in part it reminded her of what shed heard too many times from too many lovers in part it indicated a regression to a self she thought shed put behind her so the nugatory movement of the windscreen wipers and the resulting smear they left in their wake distracted her she cast about for potential purveyors of auto parts in casvelyn possibly alsperyl hardly perhaps shed have to go all the way to launceton she made a cautious approach to the cottage the lane was narrow and while she didnt expect to meet another car there was always the possibility that a visitor to the cove and its thin strip of beach might barrel along departing in a rush and assuming no one else would be out here in this kind of weather to her right rose a hillside where gorse and yellow wort made a tangled coverlet to her left the polcare valley spread out an enormous green thumbprint of meadow bisected by a stream that flowed down from stowe wood on higher ground this place was different from traditional combes in cornwall which was why shed chosen it a twist of geology made the valley wide as if glacially formedalthough she knew this could not be the caseinstead of canyonlike and constrained by river water wearing away eons of unyielding stone thus she never felt hemmed in in polcare cove her cottage was small but the environment was large and open space was crucial to her peace of mind her first warning that things were not as they should have been occurred as she pulled off the lane onto the patch of gravel and grass that served as her driveway the gate was open it had no lock but she knew that shed left it securely closed for that very reason the last time shed been here now it gaped the width of a body daidre stared at this opening for a moment before she swore at herself for being timid she got out of the car swung the gate wide then drove inside when she parked and went to shut the gate behind her she saw the footprint it pressed down the soft earth where shed planted her primroses along the drive a mansize print it looked like something made from a boot a hiking boot that put her situation in an entirely new light she looked from the print to the cottage the blue front door seemed unmolested but when she quietly circled the building to check for other signs of intrusion she found a windowpane broken this was on a window next to the door that led outside to the stream and the door itself was off the latch fresh mud formed a clump on the step although she knew she should have been frightened or at least cautious daidre was instead infuriated by that broken window she pushed the door open in a state of high dudgeon and stalked through the kitchen to the sitting room there she stopped in the dim light of the tenebrous day outside a form was coming out of her bedroom he was tall he was bearded and he was so filthy that she could smell him from across the room she said i dont know who the hell you are or what youre doing here but you are going to leave directly if you dont leave i shall become violent with you and i assure you you do not want that to happen then she reached behind her for the switch to the lights in the kitchen she flipped it and illumination fell broadly across the sitting room to the mans feet he took a step towards her which brought him fully into the light and she saw his face she said my god youre injured im a doctor may i help he gestured towards the sea from this distance she could hear the waves as always but they seemed closer now the sound of them driven inland by the wind theres a body on the beach he said its up on the rocks at the bottom of the cliff itshes dead i broke in im sorry ill pay for the damage i was looking for a phone to ring the police what is this place a body take me to him hes dead theres nothing are you a doctor no i am take me to him were losing time when we could otherwise be saving a life the man looked as if he would protest she wondered if it was disbelief you a doctor far too young but he apparently read her determination he took off the cap he was wearing he wiped the arm of his jacket along his forehead inadvertently streaking mud on his face his light hair she saw was overlong and his colouring was identical to hers both trim both fair they might have been siblings even to the eyes his were brown so were hers he said very well come with me and he came across the room and passed her leaving behind the acrid scent of himself sweat unwashed clothing unbrushed teeth body oil and something else more profound and more disturbing she backed away from him and kept her distance as they left the cottage and started down the lane the wind was fierce they struggled against it and into the rain as they made their way swiftly towards the beach they passed the point where the valley stream opened into a pool before tumbling across a natural breakwater and rushing down to the sea this marked the beginning of polcare cove a narrow strand at low water just rocks and boulders when the tide was high the man called into the wind over here and he led her to the north side of the cove from that point she needed no further direction she could see the body on an outcropping of slate the bright red windcheater the loose dark trousers for ease of movement the thin and exceedingly flexible shoes he wore a harness round his waist and from this dangled numerous metal devices and a lightweight bag from which a white substance spilled across the rock chalk for his hands she thought she moved to see his face she said god itshes a cliff climber look theres his rope part of it lay nearby an extended umbilical cord to which the body was still attached the rest of it snaked from the body to the bottom of the cliff where it formed a rough mound knotted skillfully with a carabiner protruding from the end she felt for a pulse although she knew there would be none the cliff at this point was two hundred feet high if hed fallen from thereas he most certainly hadonly a miracle could have preserved him there had been no miracle she said to her companion youre right hes dead and with the tidelook were going to have to move him or no the strangers voice was harsh daidre felt a rush of caution what the police have to see it we must phone the police wheres the nearest phone have you a mobile there was nothing he indicated the direction from which theyd come there was no phone in the cottage i havent a mobile she said i dont bring one when i come here what does it matter hes dead we can see how it happened the tides coming in and if we dont move him the water will how long he asked what the tide how long have we got i dont know she looked at the water twenty minutes half an hour no more than that wheres a phone youve got a car and in a variation of her own words were wasting time i can stay here with thewith him if you prefer she didnt prefer she had the impression he would depart like a spirit if she left things up to him he would know shed gone to make the phone call he so wanted made but he himself would vanish leaving her towhat she had a good idea and it wasnt a welcome one she said come with me she took them to the salthouse inn it was the only place within miles she could think of that was guaranteed to have a phone available the inn sat alone at the junction of three roads a white squat thirteenthcentury hostelry that stood inland from alsperyl south of shop and north of woodford she drove there swiftly but the man didnt complain or show evidence of worry that they might end up down the side of the hill or headfirst into an earthen hedge he didnt use his seat belt and he didnt hold on he said nothing nor did she they rode with the tension of strangers between them and with the tension of much unspoken as well she was relieved when they finally reached the inn to be out in the air away from his stench was a form of blessing to have something in front of herimmediate occupationwas a gift from god he followed her across the patch of rocky earth that went for a car park to the lowhung door both of them ducked to get inside the inn they were at once in a vestibule cluttered with jackets rainwear and sodden umbrellas they removed nothing of their own as they entered the bar afternoon drinkersthe inns regularswere still at their normal places round the scarred tables nearest the fire coal it put out a welcome blaze it shot light into the faces bent to it and streamed a soft illumination against sootstained walls daidre nodded to the drinkers she came here herself so they were not unfamiliar to her nor she to them they murmured dr trahair and one of them said to her you come down for the tournament then but the question fell off when her companion was observed eyes to him eyes to her speculation and wonder strangers were hardly unknown in the district good weather brought them to cornwall in droves but they came and went as they werestrangersand they did not generally show up in the company of someone known she went to the bar she said brian i need to use your phone theres been a terrible accident this man she turned from the publican i dont know your name thomas he told her thomas thomas what thomas he said she frowned but said to the publican this man thomas has found a body in polcare cove we need to phone the police brian and this she said more quietly itsi think its santo kerne constable mick mcnulty was performing patrol duty when his radio squawked jarring him awake he considered himself lucky to have been in the panda car at all when the call came through hed recently completed a lunchtime quickie with his wife followed by a sated snooze with both of them naked beneath the counterpane theyd ripped from the bed we cant stain it mick its the only one weve got and only fifty minutes earlier hed resumed cruising along the a on the lookout for potential malefactors but the warmth of the car in combination with the rhythm of the windscreen wipers and the fact that his twoyearold son had kept him up most of the previous night weighed down his eyelids and encouraged him to look for a layby into which he could pull the car for a kip he was doing just thatnappingwhen the radio burst into his dreams body on the beach polcare cove immediate response required secure the area and report back who phoned it in he wanted to know cliff walker and a local resident they would meet him at polcare cottage which was where bloody hell man use your effing head mick gave the radio two fingers he started the car and pulled onto the road hed get to use the lights and the siren which generally happened only in summer when a tourist in a hurry made a vehicular misjudgment with dire results at this time of year the only action he usually saw was from a surfer anxious to blast into the water of widemouth bay too much speed into the car park too late to brake and over the edge onto the sand hed go well mick understood that urgency he felt it himself when the waves were good and the only thing keeping him from his wet suit and his board were the uniform he wore and the thought of being able to wear itright here in casvelyninto his dotage messing up a sinecure was not in his game plan they did not refer to a posting in casvelyn as the velvet coffin for nothing with siren and lights it still took him nearly twenty minutes to reach polcare cottage which was the only habitation along the road down to the cove the distance wasnt great as the crow fliesless than five milesbut the lanes were no wider than a car and a half and defined by farmland woodland hamlet and village not a single one of them was straight the cottage was painted mustard yellow a beacon in the gloomy afternoon it was an anomaly in an area where nearly every other structure was white and in further defiance of local tradition its two outbuildings were purple and lime respectively neither of them was illuminated but the small windows of the cottage itself streamed light onto the garden that surrounded it mick silenced the siren and parked the police car although he left the headlamps on and the roof lights twirling which he considered a nice touch he pushed through a gate and passed an old vauxhall in the driveway at the front door he knocked sharply on the bright blue panels a figure appeared quickly on the other side of a stainedglass window high on the door as if shed been standing nearby waiting for him she wore snug jeans and a turtleneck sweater long earrings dangled as she gestured mick inside im daidre trahair she said i made the call she admitted him to a small square entry crammed with wellingtons hiking boots and jackets a large eggshaped iron kettle that mick recognised as an old mining kibble stood to one side filled with umbrellas and walking sticks instead of with ore a gouged and illused narrow bench marked a spot for changing in and out of boots there was barely space to move mick shook the rainwater from his jacket and followed daidre trahair into the heart of the cottage which was the sitting room here an unkempt bearded man was squatting by the fireplace taking ineffective stabs at five pieces of coal with a duckheaded poker they should have used a candle beneath the coal until it got going mick thought that was what his mum had always done it worked a treat wheres the body he said ill want your details as well he took out his notebook the tides coming in the man said the bodys on thei dont know if its part of the reef but the wateryoull want to see the body surely before the rest the formalities i mean being given a suggestion like thisby a civilian who no doubt obtained all his information about procedure from police dramas on itvgot right up micks nose as did the mans voice whose tone timbre and accent were completely out of keeping with his appearance he looked like a vagrant but certainly didnt talk like one he put mick in mind of what his grandparents referred to as the old days when before the days of international travel people always known as the quality cruised down to cornwall in their fancy cars and stayed in big hotels with wide verandas they knew how to tip they did his granddad would tell him course things were less dear in those days werent they so tuppence went a mile and a shillingd take you all the way to london he exaggerated like that micks granddad it was his mother said part of his charm i wanted to move the body daidre trahair said but hewith a nod at the mansaid not to its an accident well obviously its an accident so i couldnt see whyfrankly i was afraid the surf would take him do you know who it is ino she said i didnt get much of a look at his face mick hated to cave in to them but they were right he tilted his head in the direction of the door lets see him they set off into the rain the man brought out a faded baseball cap and put it on the woman used a rain jacket with the hood pulled over her sandy hair mick paused at the police car and fetched the small flash camera that hed been authorised to carry its purchase had been intended for a moment just like this if he had to move the body theyd at least have a visual record of what the spot had looked like before the waves rose to claim the corpse at the waters edge the wind was fierce and a beach break was coming from both left and right these were rapid waves seductive swells building offshore but they were forming fast and breaking faster just the sort of surf to attract and demolish someone who didnt know what he was doing the body however wasnt that of a surfer this came as something of a surprise to mick hed assumedbut assuming was an idiots game he was glad hed jumped only to mental conclusions and said nothing to the man and woman whod phoned for help daidre trahair was right it looked like some kind of accident a young climbermost decidedly deadlay on a shelf of slate at the base of the cliff mick swore silently when he stood over the body this wasnt the best place to cliff climb either alone or with a partner while there were swathes of slate which provided good handholds toeholds and cracks into which camming devices and chock stones could be slid for the climbers safety there were also vertical fields of sandstone that crumbled as easily as yesterdays scones if the right pressure was put upon them from the look of things the victim had been attempting a solo climb an abseil down from the top of the cliff followed by a climb up from the bottom the rope was in one piece and the carabiner was still attached to the rewoven figureeight knot at the end the climber himself was still bound to the rope by a belay device his descent from above should have gone like clockwork equipment failure at the top of the cliff mick concluded hed have to climb up via the coastal path and see what was what when he was finished down here he took the pictures the tide was creeping towards the body he photographed it and everything surrounding it from every possible angle before he unhooked his radio from his shoulder and barked into it he got static in return he said damn and clambered to the high point of the beach where the man and woman were waiting he said to the man ill need you directly took five steps away and once again shouted into his radio phone the coroner he told the sergeant manning the station in casvelyn we need to move the body weve got a bloody great tide coming in and if we dont move this bloke hes going to be gone and then they waited for there was nothing else to do the minutes ticked by the water rose and finally the radio bleated coronersokayfrom surfroad the disembodied voice croaked whatsiteneeded get out here and bring your rain kit with you get someone to man the station while were gone knowbody some kid i dont know who it is when we get him off the rocks ill check for id mick approached the man and woman who were huddled separately against the wind and the rain he said to the man i dont know who the hell you are but we have a job to do and i dont want you doing anything other than what i tell you come with me and to the woman you as well they picked their way across the rockstrewn beach no sand was left down near the water the tide had covered it they went single file across the first slate slab halfway across the man stopped and extended his hand back to daidre trahair to assist her she shook her head she was fine she told him when they reached the body the tide was lapping at the slab on which it lay another ten minutes and it would be gone mick gave directions to his two companions the man would help him move the corpse to the shore the woman would collect anything that remained behind it wasnt the best situation but it would have to do they could not afford to wait for the professionals chapter two cadan angarrack didnt mind the rain nor did he mind the spectacle that he knew he presented to the limited world of casvelyn he trundled along on his freestyle bmx with his knees rising to the height of his waist and his elbows shooting out like bent arrows intent only on getting home to make his announcement pooh bounced on his shoulder squawking in protest and occasionally shrieking landlubber scum into cadans ear this was decidedly better than applying his beak to cadans earlobe which had happened in the past before the parrot learned the error of his ways so cadan didnt try to silence the bird instead he said you tell em pooh to which the parrot cried blow holes in the attic an expression whose provenance was a mystery to his master had he been out working with the bicycle instead of using it as a means of transport cadan wouldnt have had the parrot with him in early days hed taken pooh along finding a perch for him near the side of the empty swimming pool while he ran through his routines and developed strategies for improving not only his tricks but the area in which he practised them but some damn teacher from the infants school next door to the leisure centre had raised the alarm about poohs vocabulary and what it was doing to the innocent ears of the sevenyearolds whose minds she was trying to mould and cadan had been given the word leave the bird at home if he couldnt keep him quiet and if he wanted to use the empty pool so there had been no choice in the matter until today hed had to use the pool because so far hed made not the slightest inroad with the town council about establishing trails for air jumping on binner down instead theyd looked at him the way they would have looked at a psycho and cadan knew what they were thinking which was just what his father not only thought but said twentytwo years old and youre playing with a bicycle what the hells the matter with you nothing cadan thought not a sodding thing you think this is easy tabletop tailwhip try it sometime but of course they never would not the town councilors and not his dad theyd just look at him and their expressions would say make something of your life get a job for gods sake and that was what he had to tell his father gainful employment was his pooh on his shoulder or not hed actually managed to acquire another job of course his dad didnt need to know how hed acquired it he didnt need to know it was really all about cadan asking if adventures unlimited had thought about the use to which its decrepit crazy golf course could be put and ending up with a brokered deal of maintenance work in the old hotel in exchange for utilising the crazy golf courses hills and dalesminus their windmills barns and other assorted structures naturallyfor perfecting air tricks all lew angarrack had to know was that sacked once again for his myriad failures in the family businessand who the hell wanted to shape surfboards anywaycadan had gone out and replaced job a with job b within seventytwo hours which was something of a record cadan decided he usually gave his dad an excuse to remain in a state of cheesedoffathim for five or six weeks at least he was jouncing along the unpaved lane behind victoria road and wiping the rain from his face when his father drove past him on the way to the house lew angarrack didnt look at his son although his expression of distaste told cadan his father had clocked the sight he presented not to mention been given a reminder of why his progeny was on a bicycle in the rain and no longer behind the wheel of his car up ahead of him cadan saw his father get out of the rav and open the garage door he reversed the toyota into the garage and by the time cadan wheeled his bicycle through the gate and into the back garden lew had already hosed off his surfboard he was heaving his wet suit out of the fourbyfour to wash it off as well while the hosepipe burbled freshwater onto the patch of lawn cadan watched him for a moment he knew that he looked like his father but their similarities ended with the physical they had the same stocky bodies with broad chests and shoulders so they were built like wedges and the same surfeit of dark hair although his father was growing more and more of it over his body so that he was starting to look like what cadans sister privately called him which was gorilla man but that was it as to the rest they were chalk and cheese his fathers idea of a good time was making sure everything was permanently in its place with nothing changing one iota till the end of his days while cadans waswell decidedly different his fathers world was casvelyn start to finish and if he ever made it to the north shore of oahubig dream dad and you just keep dreamingthat would be the worlds biggest alltime miracle cadan on the other hand had miles to go before he slept and the end of those miles was going to be his name in lights the x games gold medals and his grinning mug on the cover of ride bmx he said to his father onshore wind today whyd you head out lew didnt reply he streamed the water over his wetsuit flipped it and did the same to the other side he washed out the boots the hood and the gloves before he looked at cadan and then at the mexican parrot on his shoulder he said best get that bird out of the rain cadan said it wont hurt him it rains where he comes from you didnt get any waves did you tides just now coming in whered you go didnt need waves his father scooped the wet suit from the lawn and hung it where he always hung it over an aluminium lawn chair whose webbed seat caved in with the ghost weight of a thousand bums i wanted to think dont need waves for thinking do i then why go to the trouble of getting the kit ready and hauling it down to the sea cadan wanted to ask but he didnt because if he asked the question hed get an answer and the answer would be what his father had been thinking of there were three possibilities but since one of them was cadan himself and his list of transgressions he decided to forego further conversation in this area instead he followed his father into the house where lew dried his hair off with a limp towel left hanging for this purpose on the back of the door then he went to the kettle and switched it on hed have instant coffee one sugar no milk hed drink it in a mug that said newquay invitational on it hed stand at the window and look at the back garden and when hed finished the coffee hed wash the mug mr spontaneity himself cadan waited till lew had the coffee in hand and was at the window as usual he used the time to establish pooh in the sitting room at his regular perch he returned to the kitchen himself to say got a job then dad his father drank he made no sound no slurp of hot liquid and no grunt of acknowledgement when he finally spoke it was to say wheres your sister cade cadan refused to allow the question to deflate him he said did you hear what i told you ive got a job a decent one and did you hear what i asked you wheres madlyn as its a workday for her i expect shes at work i stopped there shes not then i dont know where she is moping into her soup somewhere crying into her porridge whatever she might be doing instead of pulling herself together like anyone else would youd think the bloody world has ended is she in her room i told you where lew still hadnt turned from the window which was maddening to cadan it made him want to down six pints of lager right in front of the man just to get his attention i said i didnt know where wheres the job lew pivoted not just a turn of his head but of his whole body he leaned against the windowsill he watched his son and cadan knew he was being read evaluated and found wanting it was an expression on his fathers face hed been looking at since he was six years old adventures unlimited he said im to do maintenance on the hotel till the season starts what happens then if things work out ill do instruction this last bit was a stretch but anything was possible and they were in the process of interviewing instructors for the summer werent they abseiling cliff climbing sea kayaking swimming sailinghe could do all of that and even if they didnt want him in those activities there was always freestyle bmx and his plans for altering the crazy golf course he didnt mention this to his father though one word about the freestyle bicycle and lew would read ulterior motives as if the words were tattooed on cadans forehead if things work out lew blew a short breath through his nose his version of a derisive snort which said more than a dramatic monologue would have and all of it based upon the same subject howre you intending to get there then on that thing outside by which he meant the bike because you wont be getting your car keys back from me nor your driving licence so dont start thinking a jobll make a difference im not asking for my keys back am i cadan said im not asking for my licence ill walk or ill ride the bike if i have to i dont care what i look like i rode it there today didnt i that breath again cadan wished his father would just say what he was thinking instead of always telegraphing it through facial expressions and notsosubtle sounds if lew angarrack just came out and declared youre a loser lad cadan would at least have something to row with him about failures as son set against a different sort of failures as father but lew always took the indirect route and this was one that generally used the vehicle of silence heavy breathing andin a pinchoutright comparisons of cadan and his sister she was the sainted madlyn of course a worldclass surfer headed for the top until recently that is cadan felt bad for his sister and what had happened to her but a small nasty part of him crowed in joy for such a small girl shed been casting a large shadow for far too many years he said so thats it then no good job of it cade or congratulations or even well youve surprised me for once i find a joband its going to pay good money by the waybut thats sod all to you becausewhat its not good enough its got nothing to do with surfing its you had a job cade you cocked it up lew downed the rest of his coffee and took his mug to the sink there he scoured it out as he scoured out everything no stains no germs thats bollocks cadan said working for you was always a bad idea and we both know that even if you wont admit it im not a detail person i never was i dont have thei dont knowthe patience or whatever lew dried the mug and the spoon he put them both away he wiped down the scratched old stainlesssteel work top although there wasnt a crumb upon it your trouble is you want everything to be fun but lifes not that way and you dont want to see it cadan gestured outside towards the back garden and the surfing kit that his father had just rinsed off and thats not fun youve spent all your free time for your entire life riding waves but im supposed to see that aswhat some noble endeavour like curing aids putting an end to world poverty you give me aggro about doing what i want to do but havent you done the very same but wait dont answer i already know what you dos all about grooming a champion having a goal while what i do theres nothing wrong with having a goal right yes and i have mine its just not the same as yours or madlyns or what madlyns was where is she lew asked i told you i know what you told me but you must have some idea where your own sister might have taken herself off to if she didnt go to work you know her and him you know him as well if it comes down to it hey dont put that on me she knew his reputation everyone knows it but she wasnt having any words of wisdom from anyone and anyway what you really care about is not where she is at this exact moment but that she got derailed just like you she isnt derailed she bloody well is and where does that leave you dad you pinned your dreams on her instead of living your own shell get back to it dont put money on that and dont you abruptly lew bit off whatever it was hed intended to say they faced each other then across the width of kitchen it was an expanse of less than ten feet but it was also a chasm that grew wider every year each of them stood at his respective edge and it seemed to cadan that the time would come when one of them was going to topple over the side selevan penrule took his time about getting over to clean barrel surf shop having quickly decided it would be unseemly to bolt out of the salthouse inn the moment the whisper went round about santo kerne he certainly had reason to bolt but he knew it wouldnt look good beyond that at his age he was beyond bolting anywhere too many years of milking cows not to mention herding the bloody bovines in and out of pastures and his back was permanently bent and his hips were done for sixtyeight years old he felt like eighty he should have sold out and opened up the caravan park thirtyfive years earlier and he would have done so had he only had the cash the bollocks the vision no wife and no kids they were all gone now the house was torn down and the farm was converted sea dreams hed called it four neat rows of holiday caravans like shoe boxes perched on the cliffs above the sea in his car he was careful there were dogs occasionally on the country lanes cats too rabbits birds selevan hated the thought of hitting something not so much because of the guilt or responsibility he might feel having brought about a death but because of the inconvenience it would cause him hed have to stop and he hated to stop once he set out on a course of action in this case the course of action was getting himself over to casvelyn and into the surf shop where his granddaughter worked he wanted tammy to hear the news from him when he reached the town he parked on the wharf the nose of his antique land rover pointing towards the casvelyn canal a narrow cut that had once connected holsworthy and launceston with the sea but that now meandered inland for seven miles before ending abruptly like an interrupted thought this put him across the river cas from the centre of town where the surf shop was but finding a spot for the car was always too much trouble over thereno matter the weather or the time of yearand anyway he wanted the walk tracing a path back along the crescent of road that defined the southwest edge of the town he would have time to think he had to have an approach that would play the information out and allow him to gauge her reaction to it for what tammy said she was and who tammy really was were as far as selevan penrule was concerned in outright contradiction to each other she just didnt know that yet out of the car he gave a nod to several fishermen who stood smoking in the rain their craft at rest against the side of the wharf theyd have come up from the sea by way of the canal lock at the wharf s far end and they presented a stark contrast to the boats and boatmen who would be in casveyln with the start of summer selevan vastly preferred this group to those who would arrive with the better weather true he made his money from the tourist trade but he didnt have to like that fact he set off into the heart of town going towards it along a string of shops he stopped for a takeaway coffee at jills juices and then again for a packet of dunhills and a roll of breath mints at pukkas pizza slices et cetera the accent being on the et cetera for their pizza was rubbish in a shoe which was where the crescent made its turn up into the strand here the road created a slow climb to the top of the town and clean barrel surf shop stood on a corner half the distance up just along a route that offered a hair salon a decrepit nightclub two extremely downatheel hotels and a fishandchips takeaway he finished his coffee before he got to the surf shop there was no bin nearby so he folded the takeaway cup and put it in the pocket of his rain jacket ahead of him he could see a young man with julius caesar hair having an earnest conversation with nigel coyle clean barrels owner this would be will mendick selevan thought hed had high hopes of will but so far theyd come to nothing selevan heard will saying to nigel coyle i admit i was wrong mr coyle i shouldnt even have suggested it but its not like its something i ever did before to which coyle replied youre not a very good liar are you before walking off with his car keys jingling in his hand will said darkly sod you man sod you for a lark and as selevan came up to him hullo mr penrule tammys inside selevan found his granddaughter restocking a rack with colourful brochures he observed her the way he always observed her like a species of mammal hed never come upon before most of what he saw he disapproved of she was skin and bones in black black shoes black tights black skirt black jersey hair too thin and cut too short and not even a bit of that sticky goo in it to make it do something other than what it did which was lie lifelessly against her skull selevan could have coped with the black and the skin and bones of the girl if shed given the slightest bit of evidence that she might be normal ring her eyes with kohl and plant silver rings through her eyebrows and her lips and a stud in her tongue and he understood that mind he didnt like it but he understood that was the fashion among certain people her age and theyd come to their senses one hoped before they disfigured themselves entirely when they hit twentyone or maybe twentyfive and they discovered that gainful employment wasnt beating a path to their doorsteps theyd sort themselves out like tammys father and what was he now lieutenant colonel in the army with a posting in rhodesia or wherever because selevan could never keep track of himand it would always be rhodesia to selevan never mind what it wanted to call itselfand a distinguished career stretching out before him but as for tammy can we send her to you dad her father had asked selevan his voice coming over the phone line as true as if hed been standing in the very next room and not in an african hotel where hed parked his daughter prior to flying her off to england and what was her granddad to do then she had her ticket she was on her way we can send her to you cant we dad this isnt the right environment for her she sees too much we think thats the problem selevan himself had his own ideas of what the problem was but he liked the thought of a son relying on his fathers wisdom send her selevan told david but mind ill not have any of her nonsense if shes going to stop with me shell eat her meals and clean up after herself and that his son told him would not be a problem true enough the girl barely left a wake behind her if selevan had thought she would cause him trouble what hed come to learn was that the trouble she caused came from not causing trouble at all that wasnt normal which was the heart of the matter for damn it all she was his granddaughter and that meant she was meant to be normal she tapped the final brochure into place and straightened the rack she stepped back as if to see its effect just as will mendick came into the shop he said to tammy no bloody good coyle wont take me back and then to selevan youre early today mr penrule tammy swung round from the brochure rack at this she said grandie didnt you get my message havent been home selevan told her oh i waswill and i were meaning to have a coffee after closing were you now selevan was pleased perhaps he thought hed been incorrect in his assessment of tammys regard for the younger man he was going to drive me home afterwards then she frowned as she seemed to realise it was too early for her grandfather to be there to fetch her home anyway she looked at a watch that flopped round on her thin wrist come from the salthouse inn selevan said been an accident out round polcare cove are you all right she asked did you get in a smash with the car or something she sounded concerned and this gratified selevan tammy loved her old granddad he might be short with her but she never held it against him not me he said and here he began to watch her closely it was santo kerne santo whats happened to him was there a rise to her voice panic a warding off of bad news selevan wanted to think so but he couldnt reconcile the tone of her voice with the look that she exchanged with will mendick fell off the cliff way i understand it he said down polcare cove dr trahair brought some coast walker to the inn to phone the police this blokethe walkerhe found the boy is he all right will mendick asked even as tammy said santos all right though isnt he selevan was definitely gratified at this the rush of tammys words and what that rush of words indicated about her feelings no matter that santo kerne was about as worthless an object for a young girls affections as could be found if affection was present that was a positive sign and selevan penrule had recently allowed the kerne boy access to his property at sea dreams for just this reason give him a shortcut across to the sea cliffs or the sea itself and who knew what might blossom in tammys heart and that had been the objective hadnt it tammy blossoming and a diversion dont know selevan told her just that dr trahair came in and told brian over salthouse that santo kerne was down on the rocks n polcare cove thats all i know that doesnt sound good will mendick said was he surfing grandie tammy asked but she didnt look at her grandfather when she spoke she kept her eyes on will this made selevan look more closely at the young man will he saw was breathing oddly a bit like a runner but his face had lost colour he was a ruddy boy naturally so it was noticeable when the blood drained away dont know what he was doing do i selevan said but somethings happened to him thats for certain and it looks bad why will asked cos theydve hardly left the boy on the rocks alone if hed only been hurt and not he shrugged not dead tammy said dead will repeated tammy said go will but how can i youll think of something just go well have coffee another time that was apparently all he needed will nodded at selevan and headed for the door he touched tammy on the shoulder as he passed her he said thanks tam ill ring you selevan tried to take this as a positive sign daylight was fast fading by the time detective inspector bea hannaford arrived in polcare cove shed been in the midst of buying football shoes for her son when her mobile had rung and shed completed the purchase without giving pete a chance to point out that hed not tried on every style available as was his habit shed said we buy now or you come back later with your father and that had been enough his father would force him into the least expensive pair brooking no arguments about it theyd left the shop in a hurry and dashed through the rain to the car shed rung ray from the road it wasnt his night for pete but ray was flexible he was a cop as well and he knew the demands of the job hed meet them in polcare cove he said got a jumper hed asked her dont know yet shed said bodies at the bases of cliffs were not rare in this part of the world people climbed foolishly on the culm people wandered too near the edge of the cliffs and went over or people jumped if the tide was high the bodies sometimes were never found if it was low the police had a chance to sort out how they had got there pete was saying enthusiastically i bet its all bloody i bet its head cracked open like a rotten egg and its guts n brainsre all over the place peter bea cast him a glance he was slouched against the door the shopping bag containing his shoes clutched to his chest as if he thought someone might rip it from him he had spots on his facethe curse of the young adolescent bea remembered although her own adolescence was forty years long goneand braces on his teeth looking at him at fourteen years of age she found it impossible to imagine the man he might one day become what he demanded you said someone went over the cliff i bet he went headfirst and splattered his skull i bet he took a dive i bet he you wouldnt talk that way if youd ever seen someone whos fallen wicked pete breathed he was doing it deliberately bea thought trying to provoke a row he was angry that he had to go to his fathers and angrier still about the disruption to their plans which had been the rare treat of takeaway pizza and a dvd hed chosen a film about football which his father would not be interested in watching with him unlike his mother bea and pete were as one when it came to football she decided to let his anger go unconfronted there wasnt time to deal with it and anyway he had to learn to cope when plans got changed because no plan was ever written in concrete the rain was coming down in sheets when they finally reached the vicinity of polcare cove this wasnt a place bea hannaford had been to before so she peered through the windscreen and crawled along the lane this descended through a woodland in a series of switchbacks before shooting out from beneath the budding trees climbing up once again into farmland defined by thick earthen hedgerows and descending a final time towards the sea here the land opened to form a meadow at the northwest edge of which stood a mustardcoloured cottage with two nearby outbuildings the only habitation in this place a panda car jutted partially into the lane from the cottage driveway with another police vehicle sitting directly in front of it nudging against a white vauxhall near the cottage itself bea didnt stop since to do so would have blocked the road entirely and she knew there would be many more vehicles arriving and needing access to the beach long before the day was done she went farther along towards the sea and found what went for a car park a patch of earth that was potholed like a piece of swiss cheese there she stopped pete reached for the handle of his door she said wait here but i want to see pete you heard me wait here your fathers on his way if he shows up and youre not in the cardo i need to say more pete threw himself back against the seat looking sulky it wouldnt hurt if i looked and its not my night to stay at dads anyway ah they were at it he knew how to choose his moment so like his father she said flexibility pete as you well know its the key to every game including the game of life now wait here but mum she pulled him towards her she kissed him roughly against the side of the head wait she told him a knock on her window drew her attention a constable stood there in rain gear his eyelashes spiked by water a torch in his hand it wasnt switched on but they would need it soon she got out into the gusting wind and the rain zipped her jacket pulled up her hood and said di hannaford whatve we got kid dead jumper no theres rope attached to the body i expect he fell during an abseil down the cliff hes got a belay device still on the rope whos up at that cottage theres another panda car duty sergeant from casvelyn hes with the two who found the body show me what weve got who are you by the way he introduced himself as mick mcnulty constable from the casvelyn station there were only two of them manning the place himself and a sergeant it was a typical setup for the countryside mcnulty led the way the body lay some thirty yards from the breaking waves but a good distance from the cliff itself from which it must have fallen the constable had had the presence of mind to cover the corpse with a sheet of bright blue plastic and hed been prescient enough to arrange it so thatwith the aid of rocksthe sheet didnt touch the body bea nodded and mcnulty lifted the sheet to expose the corpse while protecting it from the rain the plastic crackled and snapped like a blue sail in the wind bea squatted raised her hand for the torch and shone its light onto the young man who lay on his back he was blond with sunstreaked hair that curled cherubically round his face his eyes were blue and sightless and his flesh was excoriated from hitting the rocks as he fell he was bruised as wellan eye was blackenedbut this looked like an older injury the colour had yellowed as the skin healed he was dressed for climbing he still had his stepin harness fastened round his waist with at least two dozen metal bits and bobs hanging from it and a rope was coiled on his chest this remained knotted to a carabiner but what the carabiner had been attached tothat was the question who is this bea asked do we have an id nothing on him she looked towards the cliff who moved the body me and the bloke who found it he went on quickly lest she reprimand him it was that or drag it guv i couldntve moved it on my own well want your clothes then his as well hes up at the cottage you say my clothes what did you expect constable she pulled out her mobile and flipped it open she looked at the screen and sighed no signal constable mcnulty at least wore a radio on his shoulder and she told him to make the arrangements for a home office pathologist to get down here as soon as possible this she knew wasnt going to be soon at all as the pathologist would have to come from exeter and that would be only if he or she was actually in exeter and not involved in something somewhere else it was going to be a long evening and a longer night while mcnulty radioed as ordered she gazed once more at the body he was a teenager he was very good looking he was fit muscular he was kitted out to climb but like so many climbers his age he wore no headgear that might have saved him but it might have been superfluous only a postmortem would be able to tell her gaze went from the body to the cliff she could see that the coastal patha walking trail in cornwall that began in marsland mouth and ended in cremyllmarked a twisting passage up from the car park to the top of this rise just as it did along much of the cornish coast the seacliff climber who lay at her feet had to have left something up there his identification one hoped a car a motocycle a bike they were out in the middle of nowhere and it was impossible to believe hed come here on foot theyd know who he was soon enough but one of them was going to have to go up there to see she said to constable mcnulty youll need to climb up and see what hes left on the cliff top have a care though that paths going to be murder in the rain they exchanged looks at her choice of words murder it was too early to tell but they would know eventually chapter three since daidre trahair lived by herself she was used to silence and because at work she was most often surrounded by noise when she had the opportunity to exist for a while where the only sound was that which was ambient she experienced no anxiety even when she found herself in a group of people with nothing to say to one another in the evenings she rarely turned on a radio or the television when the phone rang at her home she often didnt bother to answer it so the fact that at least an hour had passed in which not a word had been spoken by either of her companions did not trouble her she sat near the fire with a book of gertrude jekylls garden plans she marveled at them the plans themselves were done in watercolours and where there were gardens available to photograph those accompanied the plans the woman had understood much about form colour and design and as such was daidres goddess the ideaand daidre always thought of it in upper casewas to turn the area round polcare cottage into a garden that gertrude jekyll might have fashioned this would be a challenge because of the wind and the weather and it might all come down to succulents in the end but daidre wanted to have a go she had no garden at her home in bristol and she loved gardens she loved the work of them hands in the soil and something growing as a result gardening was to be her outlet staying busy at work wasnt enough she looked up from her book and considered the two men in the sitting room with her the policeman from casvelyn had introduced himself as sergeant paddy collins and he had a belfast accent to prove the name was genuine he was sitting upright in a straightback chair that hed brought from the kitchen table as if to take one of the armchairs in the sitting room would have indicated a dereliction of duty he still had a notebook open on his knee and he was regarding the other man as hed regarded him from the first with undisguised suspicion who could blame him daidre thought the hiker was a questionable character aside from his appearance and his odour which in and of themselves might not have raised doubts in the mind of a policeman querying his presence in this part of the world since the southwest coast path was a wellused trail at least in fairweather months there was the not small detail of his voice he was obviously well educated and probably well bred and paddy collins had done more than raise an eyebrow when the man had told him he had no identification with him collins had said incredulously what dyou mean youve no identification you got no driving licence man no bank cards nothing nothing thomas said im terribly sorry so you could be bloody anyone that it i suppose i could be thomas sounded as if he wished that were the case and im meant to believe whatever you say about yourself collins asked him thomas appeared to take the question as rhetorical as hed given no answer but he hadnt seemed bothered by the threat implied in the sergeants tone hed merely gone to the small window and gazed out towards the beach although it couldnt actually be seen from the cottage there hed remained motionless and looking as if he were barely breathing daidre wanted to ask him what his injuries were when shed first come upon him in her cottage it hadnt been blood on his face or his clothes nor had it been anything obvious about his body that had prompted her to offer him her aid as a doctor it had been the expression in his eyes he was in inconceivable agony an internal injury but not a physical one she could see that now she knew the signs when sergeant collins stirred rose and made for the kitchenprobably for a cuppa as daidre had showed him where her supplies were keptdaidre took the opportunity to speak to the hiker she said why were you walking along the coast alone and without identification thomas thomas didnt turn from the window he made no reply although his head moved marginally which suggested that he was listening she said what if something happened to you people fall from these cliffs they put a foot wrong they slip they yes he said ive seen the memorials all along the way they were up and down the coast these memorials sometimes as ephemeral as a bunch of dying flowers laid at the site of a fatal fall sometimes a bench carved with a suitable phrase sometimes something as lasting and permanent as a marker akin to a tombstone with the deceaseds name engraved upon it each was something to note the eternal passage of surfers climbers walkers and suicides it was impossible to be out hiking along the coastal path and not to come upon them there was an elaborate one that i saw thomas said as if this were the one subject above all that she wished to discuss with him a table and a bench this was both done in granite granites what you want if standing the test of time is important by the way you havent answered me she pointed out i rather thought i just had if youd fallen i still might do he said when i walk on when this is over wouldnt you want your people to know you have people i daresay she didnt add your sort usually do but the remark was implied he didnt respond the kettle clicked off in the kitchen with a loud snap the sound of pouring water came to them shed been correct a cuppa for the sergeant she said what about your wife thomas he remained completely motionless he said my wife she said youre wearing a wedding ring so i presume you have a wife i presume shed want to know if something happened to you wouldnt she collins came out of the kitchen then but daidre had the impression that the other man wouldnt have responded even had the sergeant not returned to them collins said with a gesture of his teacup that sloshed liquid into its saucer hope you dont mind daidre said no its fine from the window thomas said heres the detective he sounded indifferent to the reprieve collins went to the door from the sitting room daidre heard him exchange a few words with a woman she was when she came into the room an utterly unlikely sort daidre had only ever seen detectives on the television on the rare occasions when she watched one of the police dramas that littered the airwaves they were always coolly professional and dressed in a tediously similar manner that was supposed to reflect either their psyches or their personal lives the women were compulsively perfecttailored to within an inch of their lives and not a hair out of placeand the men were disheveled one group had to make it in a mans world the other had to find a good woman to act the role of saviour this woman who introduced herself as di beatrice hannaford didnt fit that mould she wore an anorak muddy trainers and jeans and her haira red so flaming that it very nearly preceded her into the room and shouted dyed and what do you have to say about itstood up in spikes that were second cousins to a mohawk despite the rain she saw daidre examining her and she said as soon as someone refers to you as gran you rethink the whole growing old gracefully thing daidre nodded thoughtfully there was sense to this and are you a gran i am the detective made her next remark to collins get outside and knock me up when the pathologist gets here keep everyone else away not that anyones likely to show up in this weather but you never know i take it the words gone out this last she said to daidre as collins left them we phoned from the inn so theyll know up there and everywhere else no doubt by now you know the dead boy daidre had considered the possibility that she might be asked this question again she decided to base her answer on her personal definition of the word know i dont she said i dont actually live here you see the cottage is mine but its my getaway i live in bristol i come here for breaks when i have time off what dyou do in bristol im a doctor well not actually a doctor i mean i am a doctor but itsim a veterinarian daidre felt thomass eyes on her and she grew hot this had nothing to do with shame about being a vet a fact about which she was inordinately proud considering how difficult it had been to reach that goal rather it was the fact that shed led him to believe she was another sort of doctor when shed first come upon him she wasnt quite sure why she had done it although to tell someone she could help him with his supposed injuries because she was a vet had seemed ludicrous at the time i do larger animals mostly di hannaford had drawn her eyebrows together she looked from daidre to thomas and she seemed to be testing the waters between them or perhaps she was testing daidres answer for its level of veracity she looked like someone who was good at that despite her incongruous hair thomas said there was a surfer i couldnt tell if it was male or female i saw himill call him himfrom the cliff top what off polcare cove in the cove before polcare although he could have come from here i suppose there was no car though daidre pointed out not in the car park so he had to have gone into the water at bucks haven thats what its called the cove to the south unless you meant the north cove ive not asked you what direction you were walking in from the south he said and to hannaford the weather didnt seem right to me for surfing the tide was wrong as well the reefs werent covered completely if a surfer came too close to themsomeone could get hurt someone did get hurt hannaford pointed out someone got killed but not surfing daidre said then she wondered why shed said it because it sounded to her as if she were interceding for thomas when that hadnt been her intention hannaford said to both of them like to play detectives do you is it a hobby of yours she didnt seem to expect a response to this she went on to thomas saying constable mcnulty tells me you helped him move the body ill want your clothes for forensics your outer clothes whatever you had on at the time which i presume is what you have on now and to daidre did you touch the body i checked for a pulse then ill want your outer clothing as well ive nothing to change into im afraid thomas said nothing again hannaford looked from the man to daidre it came to daidre that the detective had assumed that she and the stranger were a couple she supposed there was some logic in this theyd gone for help together they were together still and neither of them had said anything to dissuade her from this conclusion hannaford said exactly who might you two be and what brings you to this corner of the world daidre said weve given our details to the sergeant humour me ive told you im a veterinarian your practise at the zoo in bristol ive just come down this afternoon for a few days well for a week this time odd time of year for a holiday for some i suppose but i prefer my holidays when there are no crowds what time did you leave bristol i dont know i didnt actually look it was morning perhaps nine ten half past stop along the way daidre tried to work out how much the detective needed to know she said wellbriefly yes but it hardly has to do with where what where did you stop for lunch id had no breakfast i dont usually eat breakfast that is i was hungry so i stopped where there was a pub its not a place i usually stop not that i usually stop but there was a pub and i was hungry and it said pub meals out front so i went in this would be after i left the m i cant remember its name the pubs im sorry i dont think i even looked at the name it was somewhere outside crediton i think you think interesting what did you eat a ploughmans what sort of cheese i dont know i didnt pay attention it was a ploughmans cheese bread pickle onion im a vegetarian of course you are daidre felt her temper flare she hadnt done anything but the detective was making her feel as if she had she said with some attempt at dignity i find that its rather difficult to care for animals on the one hand and eat them on the other inspector of course you do di hannaford said thinly do you know the dead boy i believe i already answered that question i seem to have lost the plot on that one tell me again i didnt get a good look at him im afraid and im afraid that isnt what i asked you im not from around here as i said this is a getaway place for me i come on the occasional weekend bank holidays longer holidays i know a few people but mostly those who live close by this boy doesnt live close by i dont know him daidre could feel the perspiration on her neck and she wondered if it was on her face as well she wasnt used to speaking to the police and speaking to the police under these circumstances was especially unnerving a sharp double knock sounded on the front door then but before anyone made a move to answer it they heard it open two male voicesone of them the voice of sergeant collinscame from the entry just ahead of the men themselves daidre was expecting the other to be the pathologist who inspector hannaford had indicated was on the way but this was apparently not the case instead the newcomertall grey haired and attractivenodded to them and said to hannaford whereve you got him stowed then to which she answered hes not in the car the man shook his head as it happens no hannaford said that bloody child i swear thanks for coming at short notice ray then she spoke to daidre and thomas to daidre she repeated ill want your clothes dr trahair sergeant collins will bag them so sort yourself out about that and to thomas when soco arrives well get you a boiler suit to change into in the meantime mr i dont know your name thomas he said mr thomas is it or is thomas your christian name he hesitated daidre thought for a moment that he meant to lie because that was what it looked like and he could lie couldnt he since he had no identification with him he could say he was absolutely anyone he looked at the coal fire as if meditating on all the possibilities then he looked back at the detective lynley he said its thomas lynley there was a silence daidre looked from thomas to the detective and she saw the expression alter on hannafords face the face of the man shed called ray altered as well and oddly enough he was the one to speak what he said was completely baffling to daidre new scotland yard thomas lynley hesitated once again then he swallowed until recently he said yes new scotland yard of course i know who he is bea hannaford said tersely to her former husband i dont live under a stone it was just like ray to make the pronouncement as if from on high impressed with himself he was devon and cornwall constabulary middlemore mr assistant chief constable a pencil pusher really as far as bea was concerned never had a promotion affected anyones demeanour so maddeningly the only question is what the hell is he doing here of all places she went on collins tells me he isnt even carrying identification with him so he could be anyone couldnt he could be but he isnt how dyou know have you met him i dont need to have met him another indication of selfsatisfaction had he always been like this and had she never seen it had she been so blinded by love or whatever it had been that had propelled her into marriage with this man she hadnt been ageing and ray her only chance at having a home and family shed been twentyone and they had been happy hadnt they until pete theyd had their lives in order one child onlya daughterand that had been something of a disappointment but ginny had given them a grandchild soon enough into her own marriage and she was at this moment on her way to giving them more retirement had been beckoning them from the future and all the things they planned to do with retirement had been beckoning as well and then there was pete a complete surprise pleasant to her unpleasant to ray the rest was history actually ray said in that way he had of outing himself which had always made her forgive him in the end for his worst displays of selfimportance i saw in the paper that he comes from round here his family are in cornwall the penzance area so hes come home hmm yes well after what happened who can blame him for wanting to be done with london bit far from penzance here though perhaps home and family didnt give him what he needed poor sod bea glanced at ray they were walking from the cottage to the car park skirting his porsche which hed leftfoolishly she thought but what did it matter since she wasnt responsible for the vehiclehalf on and half off the lane his voice was moody and his face was moody she could see that in the dying light of the day it touched you all that didnt it she said im not made of stone beatrice he wasnt that the problem for her was that his all too compelling humanity made hating him an impossibility and she would have vastly preferred to hate ray hannaford understanding him was far too painful ah ray said i think weve located our missing child he indicated the cliff rising ahead of them to their right beyond the polcare cove car park the coastal path climbed in a narrow stripe sliced into the rising land and descending from the top of the cliff were two figures the one in front was lighting the way through the rain and the gloom with a torch behind him a smaller figure picked out a route among the rainslicked stones that jutted from the ground where the path had been inadequately cleared that bloody child bea said hes going to be the death of me she shouted get the hell down from there peter hannaford i told you to stay in the car and i damn well meant it and you bloody well know it and you constable what the hell are you doing letting a child they cant hear you love ray said let me he bellowed petes name he gave an order only a fool would have failed to obey pete scurried down the remainder of the path and had his excuse ready by the time he joined them i didnt go near the body he said you said i wasnt meant to go near and i didnt mick cn tell you that all i did was go up the path with him he was stop splitting hairs with your mother ray told him bea said you know how i feel when you do that pete now say hello to your father and get out of here before i wallop you the way you need to be walloped hullo pete said he stuck out his hand for a shake ray accommodated him bea looked away she wouldnt have allowed a handshake she would have grabbed the boy and kissed him mick mcnulty came up behind them sorry guv he said i didnt know no harm done ray put his hands on petes shoulders and firmly turned him in the direction of the porsche i thought wed do thai food he said to his son pete hated thai food but bea left them to sort that out for themselves she shot pete a look that he could not fail to read not here it said he made a face ray kissed bea on the cheek and said take care of yourself she said mind how you go then roadsre slick and then because she couldnt help herself i didnt say before youre looking well ray he replied lot of good its doing me and walked off with their son pete stopped at beas car he brought forth his football shoes bea didnt call out to tell him to let them be instead she said to constable mcnulty so whatve we got mcnulty gestured towards the top of the cliff rucksack up there for soco to bag i expect its the kids anything else evidence of how the poor sod went down i left it for soco as well what is it theres a stile up top some ten feet or so back from the edge of the cliff marks the far west end of a cow pasture up there hed put a sling round it which was supposed to be what his carabiner and rope were fixed to for the abseil down the cliff what sort of sling made of nylon webbing looks like fishing net if you dont know what youre looking at its supposed to be a long loop you drape it round a fixed object and each end is fastened with the carabiner making the loop into a circle you attach your rope to the carabiner and off you go sounds straightforward should have been but the slings been taped togetherpresumably over a weak spot to strengthen itand thats exactly where its failed mcnulty gazed back the way hed come bloody idiot i cant think why anyoned just not get himself another sling what kind of tape was used for the repair mcnulty looked at her as if surprised by the question electrical tape this was kept your digits off it course and the rucksack it was canvas i reckoned as much bea said patiently where was it why do you presume it was his did you have a look inside next to the stile so i reckon it was his all right he probably carried his kit in it nothing in it now but a set of keys car i reckon did you have a look for it thought it best to report back to you think another time constable get back up there and find me the car he looked towards the cliff his expression told her how little he wanted to make a second climb up there in the rain well that couldnt be helped up you go she told him pleasantly the exercise will do you a world of good thought prhaps i ought to go by way of the road its a few miles but up you go she repeated keep an eye out along the trail as well there may be footprints not already destroyed by the rain or by you she thought mcnulty did not look happy but he said will do guv and set off back the way hed come with pete kerra kerne was exhausted and soaked to the skin because shed broken her primary rule head into the wind on the first half of the ride have the wind at your back on your route home but shed been in a hurry to be gone from casvelyn so for the first time in longer than she could remember she hadnt checked the internet before donning her cycling kit and pedaling out of town shed just set off in her lycra and her helmet shed clicked into the pedals and pumped so furiously that she was ten miles out of casvelyn before she actually clocked her location then it was the location alone that she took into consideration and not the wind which had been her error shed just kept riding vaguely east when the weather rolled in she was too far away to do anything to escape it other than seek shelter which she did not want to do hence muscle weary and bone wet she struggled with the last of the thirtyfive miles she needed to cover on her return she blamed alan blind and foolish alan cheston who was supposed to be her life partner with all that being a life partner implied but whod decided to go his own bloodyminded way in the one situation that she couldnt countenance and she blamed her father who was also blind and foolishas well as stupidbut in a completely different manner and for a completely different set of reasons at least ten months earlier shed said to alan please dont do this it wont work out itll be and hed cut into her words which he rarely did which should have told her something about him that she hadnt yet learned but which did not why wont it work out we wont even see each other much if thats what worries you it wasnt what worried her she knew what he was saying was true hed be doing whatever one did in the marketing departmentwhich was less a department and more an old conference room located behind what used to be the reception desk in the mouldy hoteland shed be doing her thing with the trainee instructors hed be sorting out the chaos that her mother had wrought as the nominal director of the nonexistent marketing department while shekerratried to hire suitable employees they might see each other at morning coffee or at lunch but they might well not so rubbing elbows with him at work and then rubbing other body parts later in the day was not what concerned her hed said dont you see kerra that ive got to get some solid employment in casvelyn and this is it jobs arent dangling from trees round here and it was decent of your dad to offer it to me im not about to look a gift horse her father was hardly a gift horse kerra thought and decency had nothing to do with why hed offered the marketing job to alan hed made the offer because they needed someone to promote adventures unlimited to the masses but they also needed a certain kind of someone to do that marketing and alan cheston appeared to be the kind of someone kerras father had been looking for her father was deciding based on appearance to him alan was a type or perhaps better said alan was not a type her father thought the type to be avoided at adventures unlimited was a manly sort grit under the fingernails throw a woman across the bed and have her till she saw stars what he didnt understandand had never understoodwas that there actually was no type there was just maleness and despite the rounding of his shoulders the spectacles the bobbling adams apple the delicate hands with those long probing spatulate fingers alan cheston was male he thought like a male he acted like a male and most important he reacted like a male that was why kerra had put her foot down which had ultimately done no good because she wouldnt say more than it wont work out that proving useless shed done the only thing she could do in the situation which was to tell him theyd likely have to end their relationship to this hed calmly replied without the slightest tinge of panic to his words so thats what you do when you dont get what you want you just cut people off yes shed declared thats what i do and its not when i dont get what i want its when they wont listen to what im saying for their own good how can it be for my own good not to take the job its money its a future isnt that what you want apparently not shed told him still she hadnt quite been able to make good on her threat because in part she couldnt imagine what it would be like to have to work with alan daily but not see him nightly she was weak in this and she despised her weakness especially when shed chosen him primarily because hed seemed like the weak one considerate which shed taken for malleable and gentle which shed taken for diffident that hed proved himself exactly the opposite since coming to work at adventures unlimited scared the hell out of her one way to terminate her fear was to confront it which meant confronting alan himself but really how could she so at first shed fumed and then shed waited watched and listened the inevitable was just thatinevitableand since it had always been that way she spent the time attempting to harden herself becoming remote within while playing the part of certain without shed carried the act off until today when his announcement of ill be gone a few hours down the coast sent the sirens off in her brain at that point her only choice was to ride fast and far to exhaust herself beyond thinking so that she exhausted herself beyond caring as well thus despite her other responsibilities that day shed gone on her way along st mevan crescent and over to burn view down the slope of lansdown road and the strand and from there out of town shed kept riding eastward long after she should have turned back for home for this reason darkness had fallen by the time shed geared down to make the final climb up the strand shops were closed restaurants were open although meagerly peopled at this time of year a dispirited line of bunting crisscrossed the street dripping water and the lone traffic light at the crest of the hill cast a streak of red in her direction no one was out on the soaked pavement but in another two months that would all change when summer visitors filled casvelyn to take advantage of its two broad beaches of its surf of its sea pool of its fun fair andone hopedof the experiences offered by adventures unlimited this holiday business was her fathers dream taking the abandoned hotela derelict structure sitting on a promontory above st mevan beachand turning it into an activitiesoriented destination it was an enormous risk for the kernes and if it didnt work out theyd be destitute but her father was a man whod taken risks in the past and had seen them bear fruit because the one thing he wasnt afraid of in life was hard work as to other things in her fathers lifekerra had spent too many years asking why and receiving no answers at the top of the hill she turned into st mevan crescent from there along a line of old b and bs older hotels a chinese takeaway and a newsagents shop she reached the driveway to what had once been the promontory king george hotel and what was now adventures unlimited the old hotel stood barely illuminated with scaffolding fronting it lights were on in the ground floor but not at the top where the family quarters were in front of the entry a police car was parked kerra drew her eyebrows together when she saw it at once she thought of alan she didnt consider her brother at all ben kernes office at adventures unlimited was on the first floor of the old hotel hed fashioned it out of a single that had once undoubtedly been used by a ladys maid since directly next door to itand formerly with an adjoining doorwas a suite that hed had converted to a unit suitable for one of the holidaying families upon whom hed bet his economic future the time had seemed right to ben for this his biggest venture ever his children were older and at least one of themkerrawas selfsufficient and completely capable of obtaining gainful employment elsewhere should this venture go under santo was a different matter for more than one reason that ben preferred not to consider but he had become more dependable of late thank god as if he finally understood the weighty nature of their undertaking so ben had felt the family was with him it wouldnt be just himself upon whose shoulders the responsibility rested they were fully two years into it now the conversion complete save for the exterior painting and a few final interior details by the middle of june they would be up and running the bookings had been coming in for several months ben was looking through these when the police arrived although the bookings represented the fruits of his familys labours he hadnt been thinking of this or really even thinking of them at all the bookings instead hed been thinking of red not red as being in the red which he certainly was and would be for any number of years until the business earned back what hed spent upon it but red as in the colour of nail varnish or lipstick of a scarf or a blouse of a dress that hugged the body dellen had been wearing red for five days first had come the nail varnish lipstick had followed then a jaunty beret over her blond hair when she went out soon he expected a red sweater would top snug black trousers as it also revealed just a bit of cleavage ultimately she would wear the dress which would show more cleavage as well as her thighs and by that time shed be in full sail and his children would be looking at him as they had looked at him forever waiting for him to do something in a situation in which he could do nothing at all despite their ageseighteen and twentytwosanto and kerra still persisted in thinking that he was capable of changing their mother when he did not do so having failed at the effort when he was even younger than they were now he saw the why in their eyes or at least in kerras eyes why do you put up with her when ben heard the slam of a car door then he thought of dellen when he went to the window and saw it was a police car below and not his wifes old bmw he still thought of dellen later he realised that thinking of kerra would have been more logical since shed been gone for hours on her bicycle in weather that had been growing ever worse since two oclock but dellen had been the centre of his thoughts for twentyeight years and since dellen had gone off at noon and had not yet returned he assumed shed got herself into trouble he left his office and went to the ground floor when he got to reception a uniformed constable was standing there looking about for someone and no doubt surprised to find the front door unlocked and the place virtually deserted the constable was male young and vaguely familiar hed be from the town then ben was getting to know who lived in casvelyn and who was from the outlying area the constable introduced himself mick mcnulty he said and you are sir benesek kerne ben told him was something wrong ben switched on more lights the automatic ones had come on with the end of daylight but they cast shadows everywhere and ben found he wanted to dispel those shadows ah mcnulty said could he speak to mr kerne then ben realised the constable meant could they go somewhere that was not the reception area so he took him one floor above to the lounge this overlooked st mevan beach where the swells were of a decent size and the waves were breaking on the sand bars in rapid sets they were coming in from the southwest but the wind made them rubbish no one was out there not even the most desperate of the local surfers between the beach and the hotel the landscape was much changed from what it had been during the heyday of the promontory king george the pool was still there but in place of the bar and the outdoor restaurant a rockclimbing wall now stood as did the rope wall the swinging bridges and the pulleys gears cords and cables of the canopy experience a neat cabin housed the sea kayaks and another contained the diving equipment constable mcnulty took all of this in or at least he appeared to be doing so which gave ben kerne time to prepare himself to hear what the policeman had come to say he thought about dellen in bits of red about the slickness of the roads and dellens intentions which likely had been to get out of town entirely to go along the coast and perhaps to end up at one of the coves or bays but getting there in this weather especially if she hadnt stuck to the main road would have exposed her to danger of course danger was what she loved and wanted but not the sort that led to cars skidding off roads and down the sides of cliffs when the question came it was not what ben expected mcnulty said is alexander kerne your son ben said santo and he thought thank god it was santo who had got himself into trouble no doubt arrested for trespassing which ben had warned him about time and again he said whats he done then hes had an accident the constable said im sorry to tell you that a bodys been found that appears to be alexanders if you have a photo of him ben heard the word body but did not allow it to penetrate he said is he in hospital then which one what happened he thought of how he would have to tell dellen of what route the news would send her down awfully sorry the constable was saying if youve a photo we what did you say constable mcnulty looked flustered he said hes dead im afraid the body the one we found santo dead but where how ben looked out at the roiling sea just as a gust of wind hit the windows and rattled them against their sills he said good christ he went out in this he was surfing not surfing mcnulty said then what happened ben asked please what happened to santo hes had a cliffclimbing accident equipment failure on the cliffs at polcare cove he was climbing ben said stupidly santo was climbing who was with him where no one as it seems at the moment no one he was climbing alone at polcare cove in this weather it seemed to ben that all he could do was repeat the information like an automaton being programmed to speak to do more than that meant he would have to embrace it and he couldnt bear that because he knew what embracing it was going to mean answer me he said to the constable bloody answer me man have you a picture of alexander i want to see him i must it might not be thats not possible just now thats why i need the photo the bodyhes been taken to hospital in truro ben leapt at the word so hes not dead then mr kerne im sorry hes dead the body you said hospital to the mortuary for the postmortem mcnulty said im very sorry oh my god the front door opened below ben went to the lounge doorway and called out dellen footsteps came in the direction of the stairs but then it was kerra and not bens wife who appeared in the doorway she dripped rainwater onto the floor and shed removed her bicycle helmet the very top of her head was the only part of her that appeared to be dry she looked at the constable then said to ben has something happened santo bens voice was hoarse santos been killed santo then santo kerra looked round the room in a kind of panic wheres alan wheres mum ben found he couldnt meet her eyes your mothers not here whats happened then ben told her what little he knew she said as he had santo was climbing and she looked at him with an expression that said what he himself was thinking if santo had gone climbing hed likely done so because of his father yes ben said i know i know you dont need to tell me know what sir it was the constable speaking it came to ben that these initial moments were critical ones in the eyes of the police they would always be critical because the police didnt yet know what they were dealing with they had a body and they reckoned having a body equated an accident but on the chance that it wasnt an accident they had to be ready to point the finger and ask relevant questions and for the love of god where was dellen ben rubbed his forehead he thought uselessly that all of this was down to the sea coming back to the sea never feeling completely at ease unless the sound of the sea was not far off and yet being forced into feeling at ease for years and years while all the time longing for it and the great open heaving mass of it and the noise of it and the excitement of it and now this it was down to him that santo was dead no surfing hed said i do not want you surfing dyou know how many blokes throw their lives away just hanging about waiting for waves its mad its a waste act as liaison constable mcnulty was saying ben said what whats that liaison kerra was watching him her blue eyes narrowed she looked speculative which was the last way he wanted his daughter to look at him just now she said carefully the constable was telling us theyll send a liaison officer round once they have the picture of santo and they know for certain and then to mcnulty why dyou need a picture he had no identification on him then how we found the car a layby near stowe wood his driving licence was in the glove box and the keys in his rucksack fitted the door lock so this is just form kerra pointed out essentially yes but it has to be done ill fetch a photo then she went off to do so ben marveled at her all business kerra she wore her competence like a suit of armour it broke his heart he said when can i see him not until after the postmortem im afraid why its regulation mr kerne they dont like anyone near thenear himtill afterwards forensics you see theyll cut him up you wont see it wont be like that theyll fix him up after theyre good at what they do you wont see hes not a god damn piece of meat course hes not im sorry mr kerne are you have you children of your own a boy yes ive got a boy sir your loss is the worst a man can experience i know that mr kerne ben stared at him hot eyed the constable was young probably less than twentyfive he thought he knew the ways of the world but he had no clue absolutely not the slightest idea what was out there and what could happen he didnt know that there was no way to prepare and no way to control at a gallop life came at you on horseback and there you were with two options only you either climbed up or you were mowed down try to find the middle ground and you failed kerra returned a snapshot in hand she gave it to constable mcnulty saying this is santo this is my brother mcnulty looked at it handsome lad he said yes ben said heavily he favours his mother chapter four formerly daidre chose her moment when she was alone with thomas lynley when sergeant collins had ducked into the kitchen to brew himself yet another cup of tea collins had so far managed to swill down four of them daidre hoped he had no intention of sleeping that night because if her nose was not mistaken hed been helping himself to her very best russian caravan tea thomas lynley roused himself hed been staring at the coal fire he was seated near it not comfortably with his long legs stretched out as one might expect of a man enjoying the warmth of a fire but elbows on knees and hands dangling loosely in front of him what he said when he asked you you said formerly he said new scotland yard and you said formerly yes lynley said formerly have you quit your job is that why youre in cornwall he looked at her once again she saw the injury that she had seen before in his eyes he said i dont quite know i suppose i have quit that is what sortif you dont mind my asking what sort of policeman were you a fairly good sort i think sorry i meantwell therere lots of different sorts arent there special branch protecting the royals vice walking a patch murder he said you investigated murders yes thats exactly what i did he looked back at the fire that must have beendifficult disheartening seeing mans inhumanity it is is that why you quit im sorry im being intrusive buthad you had enough trials on your heart he didnt reply the front door opened with a thud and daidre felt the wind gust into the room collins came out of the kitchen with his cup of tea as detective inspector hannaford returned to them she carried a white boiler suit over her arm this she thrust at lynley trousers boots and jacket she said it was clearly an order and to daidre wherere yours then daidre indicated the carrier bag into which shed deposited her outer clothing when shed changed into blue jeans and a yellow jumper she said but hell have no shoes its all right lynley said it isnt you cant go round ill get another pair he wont need them just yet anyway hannaford said where can he change my bedroom or the bathroom see to it then lynley had already risen when the di joined them less anticipation this seemed than years of breeding and good manners the di was a woman one rose politely when a woman came into the room socos arrived lynley said to her and the pathologist weve a photo of the dead boy as well hes called alexander kerne a local boy from casvelyn dyou know him she was speaking to daidre sergeant collins hovered in the kitchen doorway as if not quite sure he was meant to be having tea while on duty kerne the names familiar but i cant say why i dont think i know him have a vast acquaintance round here do you what dyou mean daidre was pressing her fingernails into her palms and she made herself stop she knew the detective was attempting to read her you say you dont think you know him its a strange way of putting it seems to me you either know him or you dont are you getting changed this last to lynley an abrupt shift that was as disconcerting as her steady and inquisitive gaze he cast a quick look at daidre and then away he said yes of course and ducked through the low doorway that separated the sitting room from a passage created by the depth of the fireplace beyond it lay a tiny bathroom and a bedroom big enough for a bed and a wardrobe and nothing else the cottage was small and safe and snug it was exactly the way daidre wanted it she said to the detective i believe one can know someone by sightactually have a conversation with him if it comes down to itwithout ever knowing that persons identity their name their details anything i expect your sergeant here can say the same and hes a local man collins was caught teacup halfway to his mouth he shrugged agreeing or discounting it was impossible to tell takes a bit of exertion that wouldnt you say hannaford asked daidre shrewdly ive found the exertion worth it so you knew alexander kerne by sight i may have done but as i said earlier and as ive told the other policeman sergeant collins here and you as well i didnt get a good look at the boy when i first saw the body thomas lynley returned to them then sparing daidre any further questions as well as any further exposure to di hannafords penetrating stare he handed over the clothing the di had asked for it was absurd dairdre thought he was going to catch his death if he wandered round like that no jacket no shoes and just a thin white boiler suit of the type worn at crime scenes to ensure that the official investigators did not leave trace evidence behind it was ridiculous di hannaford spoke to him im going to want to see your identification as well mr lynley its form and im sorry but theres no way round it can you get your hands on it he nodded ill phone good have it sent youre not going anywhere for a few days anyway this looks like a straightforward accident but till we know for certainwell i expect you know the drill ill want you where i can find you yes youll need clothing yes he sounded as if he didnt care one way or the other he was something windblown not flesh bone and determination but rather an insubstantial substance desiccated and helpless against the forces of nature the detective looked round the cottage sitting room as if assessing its potential to produce a set of clothes for the man as well as to house him daidre said hastily hell be able to get clothing in casvelyn not tonight of course everythingll be closed but tomorrow he can stay there as well or at the salthouse inn theyve rooms not many nothing special but theyre adequate and its closer than casvelyn good hannaford said and to lynley ill want you there at the inn then ill have more questions sergeant collins can drive you ill drive him daidre said i expect youll want everyone you can get your hands on to do whatever it is you do at the scene when someone dies i know where the salthouse inn is and if theyve no rooms hell need to be taken to casvelyn dont trouble lynley began its no trouble daidre said what it was was a need to get sergeant collins and di hannaford out of her cottage something that she could effect only if she had a reason to get out of the cottage herself after a pause di hannaford said fine and handing over her card to lynley phone me when youre established somewhere ill want to know where to find you and ill be along directly we have matters sorted out here itll be some time i know he said yes i expect you do she nodded and left them taking with her their clothing stuffed into bags sergeant collins followed her police cars were blocking daidres access to her own vauxhall they would have to be moved if she was to be able to get thomas lynley to the salthouse inn silence swept into the cottage with the departure of the police daidre could feel thomas lynley looking at her but she was finished with being looked at she went from the sitting room into the entry saying over her shoulder you cant go out in your stocking feet like that i have wellies out here i doubt theyll fit he said it doesnt matter ill take the socks off for now put them back on when i get to the inn she stopped thats sensible of you i hadnt thought of it if youre ready then we can go unless youd like something a sandwich soup brian does meals at the inn but if youd rather not have to eat in the dining area she didnt want to make the man a meal but it seemed the proper thing to do they were somehow bound together in this matter partners in suspicion perhaps it felt that way to her because she had secrets and he certainly seemed to have them too i expect i can have something sent up to my room lynley said providing they have rooms available tonight lets be off then daidre said they made their second drive to the salthouse inn more slowly as there was no rush and they encountered two more police vehicles and an ambulance on the way they didnt speak and when daidre glanced over at her companion she saw that his eyes were closed and his hands rested easily on his thighs he looked asleep and she didnt doubt that he was hed seemed exhausted she wondered how long hed been hiking along the coastal path at the salthouse inn she stopped the vauxhall in the car park but lynley didnt move she touched him gently on the shoulder he opened his eyes and blinked slowly as if clearing his head of a dream he said thank you it was kind i didnt want to leave you in the clutches of the police she cut in then sorry i forget youre one of them after a fashion yes i am well anywayi thought you might like a respite from them although from what she saidthe inspectorit doesnt appear youve escaped them for long no theyll want to talk to me at length tonight the first person on the scene is always suspect theyll be intent on gathering as much information as possible as quickly as possible thats the way its done they were silent then a gust of windstronger than any other so farhit the car and rocked it it stirred daidre to words once more she said ill come round for you tomorrow then she made the declaration without thinking through all the ramifications of what it meant what it could mean and what it would look like this wasnt like her and she shook herself mentally but the words were out there and she let them lie youll need to get things from casvelyn i mean i dont expect you want to walk round in that boiler suit for long youll want shoes as well and other things casvelyns the closest place to get them thats good of you lynley told her but i dont want to trouble you you said that earlier but it isnt and youre not its very strange but i feel that were in this together although i dont quite know what this is ive caused you a problem he said more than one the window in your cottage now the police im sorry about it what else were you to do you could hardly walk on once youd found him no i couldnt walk on could i he sat for a moment he seemed to be watching the wind play with the sign hanging above the inns front door he finally said may i ask you something she said certainly why did you lie she heard an unexpected buzzing in her ears she repeated the last word as if shed misheard him when shed heard him only too clearly he said the first time we came here you told the publican that the boy in the cove was santo kerne you said his name santo kerne but when the police asked you he gestured a movement saying finish the rest for yourself the question reminded daidre that this man disheveled and filthy though he was was himself a policeman and a detective at that from this moment she needed to take extraordinary care she said did i say that you did quietly but not quietly enough and now youve told the police at least twice that you didnt recognise the boy when theyve said his name youve said you dont know him im wondering why he looked at her and she instantly regretted her offer to take him into casvelyn for clothing in the morning he was more than the sum of his parts and she hadnt seen that in time she said ive come for a holiday at the time it seemedwhat i said to the policethe best way of ensuring i have one a holiday a rest he said nothing she added thank you for not betraying me to them of course i cant stop you from betraying me later when you speak to them again but id appreciate it if youd considertherere things the police dont need to know about me thats all mr lynley he didnt reply but he didnt look away from her and she felt the heat rising up her neck to her cheeks the door of the inn banged open then a man and a woman stumbled into the wind the woman twisted her ankle and the man put his arm round her waist and then kissed her she shoved him away the gesture was playful he caught her up again and they staggered in the wind towards a line of cars daidre watched them as lynley watched her she finally said ill come for you at ten then will that do for you mr lynley his response was a long time in coming daidre thought he must be a good policeman thomas he said to her please call me thomas it was like an oldtime film about the american west lynley thought he ducked into the inns public bar where the local drinkers were gathered and silence fell this was a part of the world where you were a visitor until you had become a permanent resident and you were a newcomer until your family had lived in the place for two generations so he went down as a stranger among them but he was more than that he was also a stranger dressed in a white boiler suit and wearing nothing but socks on his feet he had no coat against the cold the wind and the rain and if that were not enough to make him a novelty had anyone other than a bride entered this establishment in the past wearing white from shoulder to ankle it probably hadnt happened in the living memory of anyone present the ceilingstained with the soot of fires and the smoke of cigarettes and crossed with black oak beams from which horse brasses were nailedhung less than twelve inches above lynleys head the walls bore a display of ancient farm implements given mostly to scythes and pitchforks and the floor was stone this last was uneven pockmarked scored and scoured thresholds made of the same material as the floor were cratered by hundreds of years of entrances and exits and the room itself that defined the public bar was small and divided into two sections described by fireplaces one large and one small which seemed to be doing more to make the air unbreathable than to warm the place the body heat of the crowd was seeing to that when hed been at the salthouse inn earlier with daidre trahair just a few lateafternoon drinkers had been present now the places nighttime crowd had arrived and lynley had to work his way through them and through their silence to get to the bar he knew it was more than his clothing that made him an object of interest there was the not small matter of his smell unwashed from head to toe for seven weeks now unshaven and unshorn as well the publicanlynley recalled that daidre trahair had referred to him as brianapparently remembered him from his earlier visit because he said abruptly into the silence was it santo kerne out there on the cliffs im afraid i dont know who it was but it was a young man an adolescent or just older than that thats all i can tell you a murmur rose and fell at this lynley heard the name santo repeated several times he glanced over his shoulder dozens of eyesyoung and old and in betweenwere fixed on him he said to brian the boysantohe was well known he lives hereabouts was the unhelpful reply that was the limit of what brian appeared to be willing to reveal to a stranger he said are you after a drink then when lynley asked for a room instead he recognised in brian a marked reluctance to accommodate him he put this down to what it likely was a logical unwillingness to allow an unsavoury stranger such as himself access to the inns sheets and pillows god only knew what vermin might be crawling upon him but the novelty he represented at the salthouse inn was in his favour his appearance was in direct conflict with his accent and his manner of speaking and if that were not enough to make him an object of fascination there was the intriguing matter of his finding the body which had likely been the subject of conversation inside the inn before he entered a small room only was the publicans reply but thats the case with all of em small wasnt like people needed much when the place was built did they lynley said that the size didnt matter and hed be happy with whatever the inn could give him he didnt know how long hed actually need the room he added it seemed that the police were going to require his presence until matters about the young man in the cove had been decided a murmur rose at this it was the word decided and everything that the word implied brian used the toe of his shoe to ease open a door at the far end of the bar and he spoke a few words into whatever room existed behind it from this a middleaged woman emerged the inns cook by her garb of stained white apron which she was hastily removing beneath it she wore a black skirt and white blouse sensible shoes as well she would take him up to a room she said she was all business as if there was nothing strange about him this room she went on was above the restaurant not the bar hed find it quiet there it was a good place to sleep she didnt wait for his reply his thoughts likely didnt interest her anyway his presence meant custom which was hard to come by until late spring and summer when beggars went begging they couldnt exactly choose their benefactors could they she headed for another door at the far side of the public bar this gave onto an icy stone passage the inns restaurant operated in a room off this passage although no one was seated within it while at the far end a stairway the approximate width of a suitcase made the climb to the floor above it was difficult to imagine how furniture had been worked up the stairs there were three rooms only on the first floor and lynley had his choice although his guideher name was siobhan rourke shed told him and she was brians longtime and apparently longsuffering partnerrecommended the smallest of them as it was the one shed mentioned earlier as being above the restaurant and quiet at this time of year they all shared the same bathroom she informed him but that ought to be of no account as no one else was staying lynley wasnt particular about which room he was given so he took the first one whose door siobhan opened this would do he told her it suited him not much larger than a cell it was furnished with a single bed a wardrobe and a dressing table tucked under a tiny casement window with leaded panes its only bow to mod cons were a washbowl in a corner and a telephone on the dressing table this last was a jarring note in a room that could have done for a serving maid two hundred years earlier only in the centre of the room could lynley actually stand upright seeing this siobhan said they were shorter in those days werent they prhaps this isnt the best choice mr lynley he said this is fine does that phone work indeed it did could she bring him anything there were towels in the wardrobe and soap as well as shampoo in the bathroomshe sounded encouraging as she said this last bitand if he wanted a meal that could be arranged up here or in the dining room below naturally if that was what he wanted she added this last as a hasty afterthought although it was fairly clear that the more he kept to his room the happier everyone would be he said he wasnt hungry which was more or less the truth she left him then when the door closed behind her he gazed at the bed it was nearly two months since hed slept in one and even then hed not done much sleeping anyway when he slept he dreamed and he dreaded his dreams not because they were disturbing but because they ended it was hed found more bearable not to sleep at all because there was no point in putting it off he went to the phone and punched in the numbers he was hoping that there would be no answer just a machine picking up so that he could leave a brief message without the human contact but after five double rings he heard her voice there was nothing for it but to speak he said mother hullo at first she said nothing and he knew what she was doing standing next to the phone in the drawing room or perhaps her morning room or elsewhere in the grand sprawling house that was his birthright and even more his curse raising one hand to her lips looking towards whoever else was in the room and that would likely be his younger brother or perhaps the manager of the estate or even his sister in the unlikely event that she was still down from yorkshire and her eyeshis mothers eyeswould communicate the information before she said his name its tommy hes phoned thank god hes all right she said darling where are you how are you he said ive run into somethingits a situation up in casvelyn my god tommy have you walked that far do you know how but she didnt say the rest she meant to ask whether he knew how worried they were but she loved him and she wouldnt burden him further as he loved her he answered her anyway i know i do please understand that its just that i cant seem to find my way she knew of course that he wasnt referring to his sense of direction my dear if i could do anything to remove this from your shoulders he could hardly bear the warmth of her voice her unending compassion especially when she herself had borne so many of her own tragedies throughout the years he said to her yes well and he cleared his throat roughly people have phoned she told him ive kept a list and theyve not stopped phoning the way you think people might you know what i mean one phone call and there ive done my duty it hasnt been like that there has been such concern for you you are so deeply loved my dear he didnt want to hear it and he had to make her understand that it wasnt that he didnt value the concern of his friends and associates it was that their concernand what was worse their expression of itrubbed a place in him already so raw that having it touched by anything was akin to torture hed left his home because of this because on the coast path there was no one in march and few enough people in april and even if he ran across someone in his walk that person would know nothing of him of what he was doing trudging steadily forward day after day or of what had led up to his decision to do so he said mother she heard it in his voice as she would do she said dearest im sorry no more of it her voice altered becoming more businesslike for which he was grateful whats happened youre all right arent you youve not been injured no he told her he wasnt injured but hed come upon someone who had been he was the first to come upon him it seemed a boy hed been killed in a fall from one of the cliffs now the police were involved as hed left at home everything that would identify himcould she send him his wallet its form i daresay theyre just in the process of sorting everything out it looks like an accident but obviously until they know they wont want me going off and they do want me to prove i am who i say i am do they know youre a policeman tommy one of them apparently otherwise ive told them only my name nothing else no it would have turned things into a victorian melodrama my good manor in this case womando you know who youre talking to hed go for the police rank first and if that didnt impress hed try the title next that should produce some serious forelock pulling if nothing else only di hannaford didnt appear to be the sort who pulled on forelocks at least not her own he said so theyre not willing to take me at my word and who can blame them i wouldnt take me at my word will you send the wallet of course at once shall i have peter drive it up to you in the morning he didnt think he could bear his brothers anxious concern he said dont trouble him with that just put it in the post he told her where he was and she askedas she wouldif the inn was pleasant at least if his room was comfortable if the bed would suit him he told her everything was fine he said that he was in fact looking forward to bathing his mother was reassured by that if not entirely satisfied while the desire for a bath did not necessarily indicate a desire to continue living it at least declared a willingness to muddle forward for a while that would do she rang off after telling him to have a good long luxurious soak and hearing him say that a good long luxurious soak was exactly his intention he replaced the phone on the dressing table he turned from the table and because there was no help for it he looked at the room the bed the tiny washbasin in the corner he found that his defences had fallenhis mothers conversation had done it to himand there was her voice with him suddenly not his mothers voice this time but helens voice it is a bit monastic in here isnt it tommy i feel absolutely nunlike determined to be chaste but faced with such horrific temptation to be very very naughty indeed he heard her so clearly the helenness of her the nonsense that drew him out of himself when he most needed to be drawn shed been intuitive that way one look at his face in the evening and shed known exactly what was required it had been her gift a talent for observation and insight sometimes it was the touch of her hand on his cheek and the three words tell me darling other times it was the superficial frivolity that dissipated his tension and brought forth his laughter he said into the silence helen but that was all that he said and certainly the extent to which he couldat the momentacknowledge what hed lost daidre didnt return to the cottage when she left thomas lynley at the salthouse inn instead she drove east the route she took twisted like a discarded spool of ribbon through the misty countryside it passed through several hamlets where lamps shone at windows in the dusk then dipped through two woodlands it divided one farmhouse from its outbuildings and ultimately it came out on the a she took this road south and veered off on a secondary road that tracked east through pastureland where sheep and dairy cows grazed she turned off where a sign pointed to cornish gold with visitors welcome printed beneath the name of the place cornish gold was half a mile down a very narrow lane a farm comprising vast apple orchards circumscribed by stands of plum trees these last planted years ago as a windbreak the orchards began at the crest of a hill and spread down the other side in an impressive fan of acreage before them in stairstep fashion stood two old stone barns and across from these a cider factory formed one side of a cobbled courtyard in the centre of this an animal pen traced a perfect square and within that square snuffled and snorted the ostensible reason for daidres visit to this place should anyone other than the farms owner ask her this reason was an orchard pig a huge and decidedly unfriendly gloucester old spot that had been instrumental in daidres meeting the owner of the cider farm soon after the womans arrival in this part of the world a journey shed made over thirty years from greece to london to st ives to the farm at the side of the pen daidre found the pig waiting he was named stamos after his owners former husband the porcine stamos never a fool and always an optimist had anticipated the reason for daidres visit and had lumbered to the rail fence cooperatively once daidre came into the courtyard she had nothing for him this time however packing peeled oranges into her bag while still at her cottage had seemed a questionable activity while the police were hanging about intent upon watching and noting everyones movements she said sorry stamos but lets have a look at the ear all the same yes yes its all form youre quite recovered and you know it youre too clever for your own good arent you the pig was known to bite so she took care she also looked round the courtyard to see who might be watching because if nothing else one had to be diligent but no one was there and that was reasonable for it was late in the day and all employees of the farm would have long gone home she said looking perfect now to the pig and then she crossed the remainder of the courtyard where an arch led to a small rainsodden vegetable garden here she followed a brick pathuneven overgrown and pooled with rainwaterto a neat white cottage from which the sound of classical guitar came in fits and starts aldara would be practising that was good as it likely meant she was alone the playing stopped instantly when daidre knocked on the door steps hurriedly approached across the hardwood floor inside daidre what on earth aldara pappas was backlit from within the cottage so daidre couldnt see her face but she knew the great dark eyes would hold speculation and not surprise despite her tone of voice aldara stepped back from the door saying come in you are so very welcome what a lovely surprise that you should come to break the tedium of my evening why didnt you phone me from bristol are you down for long it was a sudden decision inside the cottage it was quite warm the way aldara liked it every wall was washed in white and each one of them displayed highlycoloured paintings of rugged landscapes arid and possessing habitations of whitesmall buildings with tile on their roofs and their window boxes bursting with flowers with donkeys standing placidly against their walls and darkhaired children playing in the dirt before their front doors aldaras furniture was simple and sparse the pieces were brightly upholstered in blue and yellow however and a red rug covered part of the floor only the geckos were missing their little bodies curving against the surface of whatever their tiny suctioned feet could cling to a coffee table in front of the sofa held a bowl of fruit and a plate of roasted peppers greek olives and cheese feta undoubtedly a bottle of red wine was still to be opened two wineglasses two napkins two plates and two forks were neatly positioned these gave the lie to aldaras words daidre looked at her she raised an eyebrow it was a small social lie only aldara was as ever completely unembarrassed to have been caught out had you walked in and seen this you would have felt less than welcome no and you are always welcome in my home as is someone else apparently tonight you are far more important than someone else as if to emphasise this aldara went to the fireplace where a fire was laid and matches remained only to be used she struck one on the underside of the mantel and put it to the crumpled paper beneath the wood apple wood this was dried and kept for burning when the orchard trees were pruned aldaras movements were sensuous but they were not studied in the time daidre had known the other woman shed come to realise that aldara was sensual as a result of simply being aldara she would laugh and say its in my blood as if being greek meant being seductive but it was more than blood that made her compelling it was confidence intelligence and complete lack of fear daidre admired this final quality most in the other woman aside from her beauty for she was fortyfive and looked ten years younger daidre was thirtyone and without the olive skin of the other woman knew she would not be so lucky in fourteen years time having lit the fire aldara went to the wine and uncorked it as if underscoring her declaration that daidre was as valued and important a guest as whomever aldara was actually expecting she poured saying its going to have a bite none of that smooth french business as you know i like wine that challenges the palate so have some cheese with it or its likely to take the enamel from your teeth she handed over a glass and scooped up a chunk of cheese which she popped into her mouth she licked her fingers slowly then she winked at daidre mocking herself delicious she said mama sent it from london how is she still looking for someone to kill stamos of course sixtyseven years old and no one holds a grudge like mama she says to me figs i shall send that devil figs will he eat them aldara ill stuff them with arsenic what dyou think i tell her to dismiss him from her thoughts i have i tell her do not waste energy on that man i tell her its been nine years mama and that is sufficient time to wish someone ill she says as if i had not spoken ill send your brothers to kill him and then she curses him in greek at some length all of which im paying for naturally as im the one who makes the phone calls four times a week like the dutiful daughter i have always been when shes finished i tell her at least to send nikko if she truly intends to kill stamos because nikkos the only one of my brothers whos actually good with a knife and a decent shot with a gun and then she laughs she launches into a story about one of nikkos children and that is that daidre smiled aldara dropped onto the sofa kicking off her shoes and tucking her legs beneath her she was wearing a dress the colour of mahogany its hem like a handkerchief its neckline ving towards her breasts it had no sleeves and was fashioned from material more suitable to summer on crete than spring in cornwall little wonder that the room was so warm daidre took some cheese and wine as instructed aldara was right the wine was rough i think they aged it fifteen minutes aldara told her you know the greeks youre the only greek i do know daidre said this is sad but greek women are much more interesting than greek men so you have the best of the lot with me youve not come about stamos have you i mean stamos the lowercase pig of course not stamos the uppercase pig i stopped to look at him his ears are clear they would be i did follow your instructions hes right as rain hes asking for a girlfriend as well although the last thing i want is a dozen orchard piglets round my ankles you didnt answer me by the way did i not you did not im delighted to see you as always but theres something in your face that tells me youve come for a reason she took another piece of cheese whore you expecting daidre asked her aldaras hand lifting the cheese to her mouth paused she cocked her head and regarded daidre that sort of question is completely unlike you she pointed out sorry but what daidre felt flustered and she hated that feeling her life experiencenot to mention her sexual and emotional experienceplaced in opposition to aldaras experience left her seriously wanting and even more seriously out of her depth she shifted gears she did it baldly as baldness was the only weapon she possessed aldara santo kernes been killed aldara said what did you say are you asking that because you didnt hear me or because you want to think you didnt hear me what happened to him aldara said and daidre was gratified to watch her replace her bit of cheese on the plate uneaten he was apparently climbing where the cliff in polcare cove he fell and was killed a man out walking the coastal path was the one to find him he came to the cottage you were there when this happened no i drove down from bristol this afternoon when i got to the cottage the man was inside he was looking for a phone i came in on him you came in on a man inside your cottage my god how frightening how did he did he find the extra key he broke a window to get in he told me there was a body on the rocks and i went down to it with him i said i was a doctor well you are a doctor you might have been able to no its not that well it is in a way because i could have done something i suppose you must more than suppose daidre youve been educated well youve qualified youve managed to acquire a job of enormous responsibility and you cannot say aldara yes all right i know but it was more than wanting to help i wanted to see i had a feeling aldara said nothing sap crackled in one of the logs and the sound of it drew her attention to the fire she looked at it long as if checking to see that the logs remained where she had originally placed them she finally said you thought it might be santo kerne why its obvious isnt it why is it obvious aldara you know i dont you must tell me must i please youre being im being nothing tell me what you want to tell me about why things are so obvious to you daidre because even when one thinks everything has been seen to even when one thinks every i has been dotted every t has been crossed even when one thinks every sentence has a full stop at the end youre becoming tedious aldara pointed out daidre took a sharp breath someone is dead how can you talk like that all right tedious was a poor choice of words hysterical would have been better this is a human being were talking about this is a teenage boy not nineteen years old dead on the rocks now you are hysterical how can you be like this santo kerne is dead and im sorry about that i dont want to think of a boy that young falling from a cliff and if he fell aldara aldara reached for her wineglass daidre notedas she sometimes didthat the greek womans hands were the only part of her that was not lovely aldara herself called them a peasants hands made for pounding clothes against rocks in a stream for kneading bread for working the soil with strong thick fingers and wide palms they were not hands made for delicate employment why if he fell she asked you know the answer to that but you said he was climbing you cant think someone not someone aldara santo kerne polcare cove its not difficult to work out who might have harmed him youre talking nonsense you go to the cinema far too often films make one start believing that people act like theyre playing parts devised in hollywood the fact that santo fell while he was climbing and isnt that a bit odd whyever would he climb in this weather you ask the question as if you expect me to know the answer oh for heavens sake aldara enough aldara firmly set her wineglass down i am not you daidre ive never had thisthisoh what shall i call itthis awe of men that you have this feeling that they are somehow more significant than they actually are that they are necessary in life essential to a womans completion im terribly sorry that the boy is dead but its nothing to do with me no and this daidre indicated the two wineglasses the two plates the two forks the endless repetition of what should have been but never quite was the number two and there was the additional matter of aldaras clothing the filmy dress that embraced and released her hips when she moved the choice of shoes with toes too open and heels too high to be practical on a farm the earrings that illustrated the length of her neck there was little doubt in daidres mind that the sheets on aldaras bed were fresh and scented with lavender and that there were candles ready to be lit in her bedroom a man was at this moment on his way to her he was even now pondering the removal of her clothes he was wondering how quickly upon his arrival he could get down to business with her he was thinking of how he was going to take herrough or tender up against the wall on the floor in a bedand in what position of whether hed be up for the job of doing it more than twice because he knew merely twice would not be enough not for a woman like aldara pappas earthy sensual ready he damn well had to give her what she was looking for because if he didnt hed be tossed aside and he didnt want that daidre said i think youre going to find otherwise aldara i think youre going to see that thiswhat happened to santowhatever it is thats nonsense aldara cut in is it daidre put her palm on the table between them she repeated her earlier question whore you expecting tonight that doesnt concern you are you completely mad i had the police in my cottage and that worries you why because i feel responsible dont you aldara seemed to consider the question because it was a moment before she replied not at all and thats that then i suppose it is because of this the wine the cheese the lovely fire the two of you whoever he is aldara rose she said you must leave ive tried to explain myself to you time and again but you see how i am as a moral question and not what it is which is just a manifestation of the only way i can function so yes someone is on his way and no im not going to tell you who it is and id vastly prefer it if you were not here when he arrives you refuse to be touched by anything dont you daidre asked her my dear that is definitely the pot and the kettle was aldaras reply chapter five cadan had high hopes that the bacon streakies would do the trick he also had high hopes that pooh would do the trick the bacon streakies which were the birds favourite treat were supposed to encourage and reward him the system was to let the parrot see the bag of goodies dangling from cadans fingersa manoeuvre sufficient to get the birds interestand then put him through his paces the reward would follow and there was absolutely no need to show pooh the crunchy substance itself he might have been a parrot but he was no dummy when it came to food but tonight distractions diverted him he and cadan were not alone in the sitting room and the other three individuals were proving more interesting to the parrot than the food on offer so balancing on a small rubber ball and walking said ball across the length of the fireplace mantel did not hold the same promise that a lolly stick in the hands of a sixyearold girl held a lolly stick carefully applied to the parrots feathered head rubbed gently back and forth in the region where one assumed his ears to be guaranteed ecstasy a bacon streakie on the other hand effected only momentary gustatory satisfaction so although cadan made a heroic attempt to get pooh to provide some entertainment for ione soutar and her two young daughters entertainment was not forthcoming whys he not want to do it cade jennie soutar asked she was the younger of the two her older sister leighwho was at ten already wearing glittery eye shadow lipstick and hair extensionslooked as if shed never expected the bird to do anything extraordinary in the first place and who cared anyway as the bird was neither a pop star nor someone likely to become a pop star instead of paying attention to the failed bird show shed been flipping through a fashion magazine squinting at the pictures because she refused to wear her specs and was campaigning for contact lenses cadan said its the lolly stick he knows youve got it he wants to be petted again cn i pet him then cn i hold him jennifer you know how i feel about that bird these words were spoken by her mother ione soutar was standing in the bay window gazing out at victoria road shed been doing that for thirty minutes and she didnt look like a woman who intended to stop doing it anytime soon birds carry germs and diseases but cade touches him all the time ione shot her daughter a look it seemed to say and just look at cade will you jennie interpreted the expression on her mothers face in whatever way ione intended she scooted back on the sofaher legs sticking out in front of herand she puffed out her lips in disappointment it was cadan saw a facial expression unwittingly identical to iones no doubt the feeling behind it was the same as well disappointment cadan wanted to tell ione soutar that she was going to be endlessly disappointed as long as she had his father in her marital sights on the surface it looked as if they were perfect for each othertwo independent businesspeople with workshops in the same location on binner down two parents years without partners two parents who surfed two children for each of them two little girls interested in surfing with a third older girl their role model and instructor two familyoriented familiesthere was probably also good sex involved as well but cadan didnt like to speculate about that as the thought of his father in a carnal embrace with ione made his skin go prickly nonetheless superficially it appeared to be logical that nearly three years in this association between man and woman ought to have resulted in something akin to a commitment from lew angarrack but it hadnt done and cadan had heard enough of his fathers end of telephone conversations to know ione was no longer happy with the situation she was currently annoyed as well two takeaway pukkas pizzas had long since gone cold in the kitchen while she waited in the sitting room for lews return it was a wait that was beginning to seem futile to cadan for his father had showered and changed and rushed off on what cadan saw as a real fools errand it seemed to cadan that a visit from will mendick had prompted lews departure will had rumbled up victoria road in his wheezing old beetle and as hed unfolded his wiry frame from the car and approached the front door cadan could see from his ruddy face that something troubled him hed asked for madlyn directly and said curtly where is she then she wasnt at the bakery either when cadan revealed that she wasnt at home we dont have her on the gps yet cadan told him thats next week will will hadnt seemed to appreciate the humour i need to find her why so hed told him the news hed had off the bird at clean barrel surf shop santo kerne was dead as a doornail his head mashed in or whatever it was that happened when one fell during a cliff climb he was climbing alone climbing at all was the real question since cadan knew what santo kerne really preferred doing which was surf and shag and shag and surf both of which came quite easily to him i didnt say he was alone will pointed out sharply i dont know who was with him or even if there was someone with him why dyou think he was alone cadan didnt have to reply at that point because lew had heard wills voice and had apparently read something dire from the tone hed come from the back of the house where hed been working on the computer and will had brought him into the picture as well ive come to tell madlyn will explained too right cadan thought the way to madlyn was open and will was not a man to ignore a gaping doorway damn lew said in a thoughtful tone santo kerne not one of them was exactly in extremis over the news cadan admitted to himself he reckoned that he was the one who probably felt the worst but that was likely because he had the least at stake in matters ill go look for her then will mendick had said where do you think who bloody knew madlyns emotions had been running their usual mad course since her breakup with santo shed started with devastation and moved on to blind and unreasonable anger as far as cadan was concerned the less he saw of her the better until shed gone through her last stageit was always revengeand then got back to normal again she might have been anywhere robbing banks breaking windows pulling men in pubs tattooing her eyelids beating up small children or off to regions unknown for a surf with madlyn you just never knew lew said weve not seen her since breakfast damn will bit the side of his thumb well someones got to tell her whats happened why was what cadan thought but he didnt say it instead he said think it should be you and he added foolishly wise up mate whenre you planning to work things out youre not her type wills face flared his skin was spotty anyway and the spots enflamed lew said cade cade said but its true come on man will didnt wait to hear the rest he was out of the room and out of the door before cadan could say another word lew said christ cade as apparent commentary on cadans finesse then he went upstairs for his shower he hadnt had one after his surf so cadan had first assumed his father was just doing what he ordinarily did getting the sand and saltwater off but then hed left the house and hed not returned this had put cadan in the position of trying and failing to entertain ione and her daughters as they waited for his father looking for madlyn was what cadan had told his fathers girlfriend hed explained about santo and said nothing more ione was already fully in the picture about the madlynsanto situation she could not have been involved with lew angarrack and not known about the situation madlyns welldeveloped sense of drama would have made that completely impossible ione had gone into the kitchen where shed deposited the pizzas on the work top set the table and made a mixed salad then shed returned to the sitting room after forty minutes shed rung lews mobile if he had it with him he didnt have it on how stupid of him ione said what if she comes home while hes out looking for her howre we to let him know he probably didnt think of that cadan said he went out in a rush this wasnt exactly true but it seemed morewell more likely that a worried father would depart in a rush than as lew had departed which was quite calmly as if hed made a grim decision about something or as if he knew something that no one else knew now having finished studying her fashion magazine leigh soutar piped up in her usual fashion with that bizarre cadence peculiar to young girls with too much exposure to adolescent films on satellite television mum im hungry she said im starving lookit the time okay arent we having dinner want a bacon streakie cadan asked her yuck leigh said junk food and pizza is what cadan enquired politely pizza leigh told him is highly nutritious there are at least two food groups involved and anyway im having only one slice okay right cadan said hed seen leigh at the trough before this night and when it came to pizza she regularly forgot her intention of becoming the kate moss of her generation the day she stopped at one slice of pizza would be the day pigs took to the air in droves im hungry too jennie said could we not eat mummy ione cast one last agonised look at the street i suppose she said she headed in the direction of the kitchen jennie popped off the sofa and followed scratching her bum as she went leigh practised a catwalk prance in her sisters wake casting a baleful look at cadan as she passed him stupid bird she said he doesnt even talk what sort of parrot doesnt even talk one who saves his vocabulary for useful conversations cadan said leigh stuck out her tongue and left the room after a dreary meal of pizza left too long on the work top and salad left to the ministrations of a preoccupied chef wielding too much vinegar cadan offered to do the washing up and hoped in this offer that ione would take her offspring and depart no such luck she hung about another ninety minutes exposing cadan to leighs withering comments about the quality of his dishwashing and drying she phoned lews mobile four more times before taking herself and the girls to their home this left cadan in his least favourite position alone with his thoughts he was thus relieved to field a phone call at long last revealing madlyns whereabouts but he was less relieved when the caller wasnt his father and he became downright concerned when a casual question on his part revealed that his father had not even been round seeking to discover madlyn for himself this concern led cadan directly to being unnerveda condition he didnt care to speculate uponso when his father finally turned up just shortly after midnight cadan was fairly cheesed off at the bloke for causing within him sensations he preferred not to feel he was watching telly when the kitchen door opened and shut thereafter lew appeared in the doorway to the lounge standing in the shadows of the corridor cadan said briefly shes with jago lew blinked and said what madlyn cadan said shes with jago he rang he said shes asleep no reaction from his father cadan felt an unaccountable chill at this it ran up and down his arms like a dead babys fingers he reached for the telly remote and clicked the off button you were looking for her right cadan didnt wait for an answer ione was here her and the girls crikey that leighs a cow you ask me silence so he said you were right lew turned and went back to the kitchen cadan heard the fridge opening and something being poured into a pan his father would be heating milk for his nightly ovaltine cadan decided he wanted one himselfalthough the truth was he wanted to read his father at the same time as he didnt want to read his fatherso he shuffled to the kitchen to join him he said i asked jago what she was doing there you know what i mean just what the hecks she doing there mate because first of all why would she want to spend the night with jagowhat is he seventy years old that creeps me out if you know what i mean although hes all right i expect but its not like hes a relative or anythingand second of all but he couldnt remember what the second of all was he was babbling because his fathers obdurate silence was unnerving him more than he was already unnerved and jago said he was up at the salthouse with mr penrule when this bloke came in with that woman whos got the cottage in polcare cove she said there was a body out there and jago heard her say that she reckoned it was santo so jago went to fetch madlyn from the bakery to break the news to her he didnt phone here at first becausei dont know i spose she went dead mental on him when he told her and he had to cope with her did he say that cadan was so relieved that his father was finally speaking that he said who say what did jago say madlyn went mental cadan thought about this not so much whether jago reeth had actually said that about his sister but rather why his father was asking that of all possible questions it seemed such an unlikely choice of queries that cadan said you were looking for her right i mean thats what i told ione like i said she was here with the girls pizza ione lew said id forgotten the pizza i expect she left in a state she tried to ring you your mobile i didnt have it on the milk steamed on the cooker lew got his newquay mug and spooned ovaltine into it he used a generous amount then he handed the jar over to cadan whod got his own mug down from the shelf above the sink ill ring her now lew said its after midnight cadan told him unnecessarily believe me better late than tomorrow lew left the kitchen and went to his room cadan felt an urgent need to know what was going on this was part curiosity and part a search for a reasonable means of calming himself without questioning why he needed calming so he climbed the stairs in his fathers wake his intention was to listen at lews door but he found that wasnt going to be necessary hed barely reached the top step when he heard lews voice raise and could tell the conversation was going badly lews end consisted mostly of ioneplease listen to meso much on my mindoverloaded with workcompletely forgotbecause im in the middle of shaping a board ione with nearly two dozen moreyes yes i am sorry but you didnt actually tell meione that was it then silence cadan went to the doorway of his fathers room lew was sitting on the edge of the bed he had one hand on the phones receiver which hed just replaced in its cradle he glanced at cadan but he didnt speak instead he got up and went for his jacket which hed thrown over the seat of a ladderback chair in the corner of the room he began to put it on apparently he was going out again cadan said whats happening lew didnt look at him as he replied with shes had enough shes finished he soundedcadan thought about this regretful tired heavyhearted accepting of the fact that as long as one remained unchanged the past would accurately predict the future cadan said philosophically well you cocked things up forgetting her and everything lew patted his pockets as if looking for something yes right well she didnt want to listen to what it was a pizza dinner cade thats all pizza i could hardly be expected to remember a pizza dinner thats cold isnt it cadan said its also none of your business lew told him cadan felt his belly grow tight and hot he said right well i guess it isnt but when you want me to entertain your girlfriend while youre outout doing whateverthen it is my business lew dropped his hand from the search of his pockets he said christ imim sorry cade im on edge so much is going on i dont know how to explain myself to you but that was just it cadan thought what was going on true theyd heard from will mendick that santo kerne was deadand yeah that was unfortunate wasnt itbut why would the news throw their lives into chaos if chaos was indeed where they were the equipment room of adventures unlimited had been constructed in a former dining hall and the former dining hall had itself once been a teadancing pavilion in the heyday of the promontory king george hotel a heyday that had occurred between the two world wars often when he found himself in the equipment room ben kerne tried to imagine what it had been like when the parquet floor wore a gloss the ceiling glittered with chandeliers and women in frothy summer frocks floated in the arms of men wearing linen suits theyd danced with a blissful lack of awareness then believing that the war to end all wars had actually ended all wars theyd learned otherwise and far too soon but the thought of them had always been soothing as was the music ben imagined he heard the orchestra playing as whitegloved waiters passed finger sandwiches on silver trays he considered the dancersnearly saw their ghostsand felt a poignancy about times that had passed but at the same moment he always felt comfort people came and went from the promontory king george and life continued in the equipment room now however the tea dancers of didnt enter ben kernes mind he stood in front of a row of cabinets one of which hed unlocked inside this cabinet climbing equipment hung from hooks lay neatly in plastic containers and coiled on shelves ropes harnesses slings belay and camming devices chock stones carabinerseverything his own equipment he stored elsewhere because he didnt like the inconvenience of coming down here to sort out what he wanted to take with him if he had a free afternoon for a climb but santos kit had a prominent place and above it ben himself had proudly fixed a sign that said do not take from this instructors and students alike were to know those pieces of gear were sacrosanct the accumulation of three christmases and four birthday celebrations now however all of it was missing ben knew what this meant he understood that the absence of santos equipment constituted santos final message to his father and he felt the impact of that message just as he felt the weight and experienced the sudden illumination that the message provided as well his own remarksmade unthinkingly and born of pigheaded selfrighteousnesshad effected this despite his every effort despite the fact that he and santo could not possibly have been more unlike each other in everything from personality to appearance history had repeated itself in form if not in substance his own history spoke of wrongheaded judgement banishment and years of estrangement santos now spoke of denunciation and death not in so many words but rather with an open acknowledgement of a heaviness of heart that in and of itself had uttered a single damning question as loudly as if ben had shouted it what sort of miserable excuse for a man are you to have done such a thing santo could not have failed to interpret this unspoken query as anything other than what it was and any son of any father would have likely done the same and reacted out of the same sense of outrage that had taken santo out to the cliffs ben himself had reacted to his own father in much the same manner at much the same age you talk about man ill give you man but the underlying reason for bens interaction with santo remained unexamined although the superficial why of it didnt need to be addressed at all because santo knew exactly what it was the historical reason for their interaction on the other hand was far too frightening to contemplate instead of doing so ben had eternally told himself only that santo wasalways and merelywho santo was it just happened santo had confessed to ben look i dont want you ben said incredulous you stop right there because what you want doesnt interest me what youve done on the other hand does what youve accomplished the sum total of your bloody selfinterest why the hell do you care so much what is it to you if there was something to be handled i would have handled it but there was nothing there is nothing nothing okay human beings ben said are not to be handled theyre not pieces of meat theyre not merchandise youre twisting my words youre twisting peoples lives thats unfair thats so fucking unfair as santo would find most of life ben had thought except he hadnt lived long enough to do so and whose fault was that benesek he asked himself was the moment worth the price youre paying that moment had been a single remark said partly in anger but in larger part bleak fear unfair is having a worthless piece of manure as a son once said the words hung there like black paint tossed at a clean white wall his punishment for having said them was going to be the memory of that wretched statement and what it had produced which was santos face gone white and the fact that a father had turned his back on his son you want man ill show you man in spades if i must but show you i will ben didnt want to think of what hed said if he had his preference it would be that he might never think of anything again his mind would go blank and thus it would remain allowing him to go through the motions of living until his body gave out and eternal rest claimed him ben closed the cupboard and looped the padlock back into place he breathed slowly through his mouth till hed mastered himself and his guts were easy again then he went to the lift and rang for it it descended at a dignified antique speed that matched its appearance of open iron fretwork it creaked to a stop and he rode it to the top of the hotel where the family flat was and where dellen waited he didnt go to his wife at once instead he went first to the kitchen there kerra sat at the table with her partner alan cheston was watching her and kerra herself was listening her head tilted in the direction of the bedrooms she was ben knew waiting for a sign of how things would be her gaze took in her father as he came through the doorway bens eyes questioned she responded still was her answer all right he said he went to the cooktop kerra had boiled a kettle there and the fire was still on beneath it low so the steam escaped soundlessly and the water stayed just beneath a boil shed set up four mugs each held a teabag he poured water in two of them and stood there watching the tea brew his daughter and her lover sat in silence he could feel their eyes upon him though and he could sense the questions they wanted to ask not only of him but of each other there were matters to discuss in every corner he couldnt bear the thought of talking so when the tea was sufficiently dark he poured milk and added sugar to one and nothing to the other he carried both from the kitchen and set one on the floor momentarily in front of santos door which was closed but not locked he opened it and went inside into the dark with two cups of tea that he knew neither of them would be able or willing to drink shed switched on no lights and as santos room was at the back of the hotel there were no streetlamps from the town to illuminate the darkness within across the curved expanse of st mevan beach the lights at the end of the breakwater and atop the canal lock glittered through the wind and the rain but they did nothing to expel the gloom in here a milky shaft of light from the corridor however fell across the rag rug on the bedroom floor on this ben saw that his wife was foetally curled shed ripped sheets and blankets from santos bed and shed covered herself with them most of her face was in shadow but where it was not ben could see it was stony he wondered if the thought was in her mind if only i had been hereif only i hadnt gone off for the dayhe doubted it regret had never been dellens style with his foot ben closed the door behind him dellen stirred he thought she might speak but instead she drew the linens up to her face she pressed them to her nose taking in santos scent she was like a mother animal in this and like an animal she operated on instinct it had been her appeal from the day hed met her both of them adolescents one of them randy and the other one willing all she knew so far was that santo was dead that the police had been that a fall had taken him and that the fall was during a seacliff climb ben had got no further than that with the information because shed said a climb after which shed read her husbands face as shed long been capable of doing and shed said you did this to him that was it theyd been standing in the reception area of the old hotel because hed not managed to get her any farther inside upon her return shed seen at once that something was wrong and shed demanded to know not as a way of deflecting the obvious question of where she herself had been for so many hoursshe wouldnt think anyone actually had a right to know thatbut because something was wrong on a much larger scale than curiosity over her whereabouts hed tried to get her upstairs to the lounge but shed been immovable so he told her there she went for the stairs she stopped momentarily at the bottom step and she clutched the railing as if to keep herself upright then she climbed now ben set the milkandsugar tea on the floor near her head he sat on the edge of santos bed she said youre blaming me you reek of blaming me ben i dont blame you he said i dont know why youd think that i think it because were here casvelyn that was all about me no it was for all of us id had enough of truro as well you know that you would have stayed in truro forever thats not the case dellen and if youd had enoughwhich i dont believe anywayit hadnt to do with you or truro or any town i can feel your loathing ben it smells like sewage he said nothing outside a gust of wind hit the side of the building rattling the windows a fierce storm was brewing ben knew the signs the wind was onshore it would bring in heavier rain from the atlantic they were not yet out of the season of storms its myself he said we had words i said some things oh i expect you did you saint you bloody saint theres nothing saintly about following through theres nothing saintly about accepting thats not what things were about between you and santo dont think i dont know youre a real bastard you know why ben set his mug of tea on the bedside table deliberately then he switched on the lamp if she looked at him he wanted her able to see his face and to read his eyes he wanted her to know that he spoke the truth i told him he needed to take more care i told him people are real not toys i wanted him to see that theres more to life than seeking pleasure for himself her voice was scorn as if thats how he lives you know that it is hes good with people all people but he cant let thatthat skill of his lead him to do wrong by them or to them but he doesnt want to see doesnt hes dead ben there is no doesnt ben thought she might weep then but she did not he said there is no shame in teaching ones children to do right dellen which means your right yes not his yours he was supposed to be made in your likeness wasnt he but he wasnt you ben and nothing could make him in your likeness i know that ben felt the words intolerable weight believe me i know that you dont you didnt and you couldnt cope with it could you you had to have him the way you wanted dellen i know im to blame do you think that i dont im as much to blame for this as no she rose to her knees do not dare she cried dont bring that back to me just now because if you do i swear if you do if you even mention it if you bring it up if you try to if you words seemed to fail her suddenly she reached for the mug hed placed on the floor and she threw it at him hot tea stung his chest the rim of the mug struck his breastbone i hate you she said and then louder with each successive word i hate you i hate you i hate you he dropped off the bed and onto his knees he grabbed her then she was still shrieking her hate as he pulled her to him and she beat on his chest his face and his neck before he was able to catch her arms why didnt you let him just be who he was hes dead and all you ever needed to do was just to let him be was that too much was that asking too much shh ben murmured he held her he rocked her he pressed his fingers to her thick blonde hair dellen he said dellen dell we can weep for this we can we must i wont let me go let me go she struggled but he held her firmly he knew he couldnt let her leave the room she was on the edge and if she went over they all would go with her and he couldnt have that not in addition to santo he was stronger than she so he began to move her even as she fought him he got her to the floor and he held her there with the weight of his body she writhed trying to throw him off he covered her mouth with his he felt her resistance for a moment and then it was gone as if it had never been she tore at him but it was clothing now she ripped at his shirt at the buckle of his belt she pushed his jeans desperately over his buttocks he thought yes and he showed no tenderness as he pulled her sweater over her head he shoved up her bra and fell on her breasts she gasped and lowered the zip on her trousers savagely he slapped her hand away he would do it he thought he would own her in a fury he made her naked she arced to accept him and cried out as he took her afterwards both of them wept kerra heard it all how could she help it the family flat had been transformed as inexpensively as possible from a collection of rooms on the hotels top floor because it was needed elsewhere very little money had gone into the insulation of the walls they werent paper thin but they might as well have been she heard their voices firsther fathers soft and her mothers risingthen the shrieking which she could not ignore and then the rest hail the conquering hero she thought dully she said to alan you need to go although part of her was also saying do you understand now alan said no we need to talk my brother has died i dont think we need to anything santo alan said quietly your brothers name was santo they were still in the kitchen although not at the table where theyd been sitting when ben had joined them with the rising noise from santos bedroom kerra had shoved away from the table and gone to the sink there shed turned on the water to fill a pan although she had no idea what she would do with it shed remained there after shed turned off the taps outside she could see casvelyn just the top of it where st issey road met st mevan crescent an unappealing supermarket called blue star grocery sprawled like a nasty thought at this vshaped junction a bunker of brick and glass that made her wonder why modern conveniences had to be so ugly its lights were still on for evening shopping and just beyond it more lights indicated cars moving carefully along the northwest and southeast boundaries of st mevan down workers were heading home for the evening to the various hamlets that for centuries had popped up like toadstools along the coast smugglers havens kerra thought cornwall had always been a lawless place she said please go alan said do you want to tell me what this is about santoand she said his name with deliberate slownessis what this is about you and i are a couple kerra when people a couple she cut in oh yes how true he ignored her sarcasm when people are a couple they face things together im here im staying so you can choose which thing youd like to face with me she shot him a look she hoped he read in it derision he wasnt supposed to be like this especially not now she hadnt taken him on as her partner only to have him reveal a side of himself that proved he was someone she didnt actually know he was alan wasnt he alan alan cheston bit of a weak chest so winters were tough on him often cautious to a maddening extreme churchgoing parents loving unathletic sheep not shepherd respectful as well and respectable he was the sort of bloke whod said may i before hed tried to hold her hand but nowthis person just nowthis was not the alan whod never missed a sunday dinner at his mum and dads since hed left university and london bloody school of economics this was not the floppyhaired and whiteskinned alan who practised yoga and served mealsonwheels and was never known to dive into the sea pit just above st mevan beach without sticking his toes in first to test the temperature of the water he wasnt supposed to be telling her how things were going to be yet he stood there doing it he stood there in front of the steelfronted fridge and he lookedimplacable kerra thought the sight of him made her veins feel icy he said talk to me his voice sounded firm the firmness undid her so what she said in reply was i cant even this wasnt what she intended to say but his eyes which were generally so deferential were compelling at the moment she knew that came from power knowledge and lack of fear and where that had come from was what made kerra turn from him she would cook she decided they were all going to have to eat eventually fine alan said to her back ill talk then i have to make a meal she told him we all have to eat if we lose our strength things will get worse in the next few days theres going to be so much to do arrangements phone calls someone has to call my grandparents santo was their favourite im the oldest of the grandkidstherere twentyseven of usisnt that obscene what with overpopulation and that sort of thingbut santo was their favourite we spent time with them santo and i sometimes a month once nine weeks they need to be told and my father wont do it they dont speak he and granddad not unless they have to she reached for a cookbook she had a collection of them all kept in a stand on the work top the product of cookery classes shed taken one of the kernes had to learn how to plan nutritious inexpensive and tasty meals for the large groups whod book into adventures unlimited the kernes would hire a cook of course but theyd save money by having the meals planned out by someone other than an executive chef kerra had volunteered for the job she wasnt interested in anything having to do with a kitchen but she knew they couldnt rely on santo and relying on dellen would have been ridiculous the former was a passable cook on a small scale but easily distracted by everything from a piece of music on the radio to the sight of a gannet flying in the direction of sawsneck down as for the latter everything about dellen could alter in a second including her willingness to participate in matters familial kerra flipped open the book shed chosen at random she began leafing through pages to find something complicated something requiring every bit of her attention the list of ingredients needed to be impressive and what they didnt have in the kitchen she would send alan out to purchase at blue star grocery if he refused she would go herself in either case she would be busy and busy was what she wanted to be alan said kerra she ignored him she decided on jambalaya with dirty rice and green beans along with bread pudding it would take hours and that was fine with her chicken sausage prawns green peppers clam juicethe list stretched on and on shed make enough for a week she decided the practice would be good and they could all dip into it and reheat it in the microwave whenever they chose and werent microwaves marvelous hadnt they simplified life god wouldnt it be the answer to a young girls prayers to have an appliance like a microwave into which people could be deposited as well not to heat them up but just to make them different to what they were whom would she have shoved in first she wondered her mother her father santo alan santo of course it was always santo in you go brother let me set the timer and twirl the dial and wait for someone new to emerge no need for that now santo was decidedly altered now no more willothewisp no more tripping without a care in the world along the paths that opened up before him no more thoughtless chase of ifitfeelsgooddoit theres more to life than that and i suppose you know it now santo you knew it in the final moment you had to know it you crashed towards the rocks without a lastminute miracle in sight and in the precise instant before you struck bottom you finally knew that there were actually other people in your world and that you were answerable for the pain you caused them it was too late then to amend yourself but it was always better late than never when it came to selfknowledge wasnt it kerra felt as if bubbles were rising inside her they were hot like the bubbles of water boiling and just like boiling water they burned to get out she hardened herself against letting them escape and she grabbed a litre of olive oil from another cupboard above the work top she turned to scoop up measuring spoons thinking how much oil and the bottle slipped from her fingers it hit the floor just rightas it naturally wouldand broke in two neat pieces the oil pooled out in a viscous mess it splashed the cooker the cupboards and her clothes she leapt to one side but she didnt escape she cried damn and she finally felt the threat of tears she said to alan would you just please leave she snatched up a roll of kitchen towels and began to unspool them into the oil completely unequal to the task at hand they were soaked to mush the instant they touched the liquid alan said let me kerra sit down let me she said no i made the mess ill clean it up kerra no i said no i dont need your help i dont want your help i want you to leave go on a stand near the door a dozen or more copies of the watchman had been piled alan reached for this he put casvelyns newspaper to good use kerra watched the oil soak into the newsprint alan did the same they stood at opposite sides of the pool she considered it a chasm but he she knew saw it as a momentary inconvenience he said you dont need to feel guilty because you were angry at santo you had a right to anger he may have thought it was irrational even stupid of you to care about something that seemed silly to him but you had a reason for what you felt and you had a right you always have a right to whatever you feel if it comes down to it thats how it is i asked you not to work here her voice was expressionless her emotion was spent he looked puzzled it was a remark she realised coming from out of nowhere as far as he knew but at the moment it summed up everything she was feeling but could not say kerra jobs arent falling from the sky im good at what i do im getting this place noticed the mail on sunday therere bookings coming in every day as a result of that piece its tough out here and if we mean to make a life in cornwall we dont she said we cant not now because of santo oh come on alan what are you afraid of im not afraid im never afraid bollocks youre angry because youre afraid anger is easier it makes more sense you dont know what youre talking about accepted so tell me she couldnt too much hung in the balance to speak too much seen and too much experienced for too many years to explain it all to alan was beyond her he needed to take her word as the truth and he needed to act accordingly that he had not done so that he was going to continue his refusals to do so rang the death knell over their relationship kerra told herself that because of this nothing that had happened that day actually mattered even as she thought this though she knew that she was lying to herself but that was something that also didnt matter selevan penrule thought it was rubbish but he joined hands with his granddaughter anyway across the narrow table in the caravan they closed their eyes and tammy began to pray selevan didnt listen to the words although he caught the gist of them instead he considered his grandchilds hands they were dry and cool but so thin that they felt like something he could crush simply by closing his own fingers roughly over them shes not been eating right father penrule his daughterinlaw had told him he hated what she called himfather penrule made him feel like a renegade priestbut hed said nothing to correct sally joy since speaking to him at all was something that she and her husband hadnt bothered with for ages so hed grunted and said hed fatten the girl up its being in africa woman dont you know that you cart the girl off to rhodesia zimbabwe father penrule and were actually in whatever the hell they want it to be called you cart her off to rhodesia and expose her to god only knows what and that would kill anyones appetite let me tell you selevan realised he was taking things too far at that point because sally joy said nothing for a moment he imagined her there in rhodesia or wherever she was sitting on the porch in a rattan chair with her legs stretched out and a drink on the table next to herlemonade it would be lemonade with a dash ofwhat is it sally joy whats in the glass that would make rhodesia go down a trick for you he harrumphed noisily and said well never mind then you send her along ill get her sorted youll watch her food intake like a peregrine which he had done shed taken thirtynine bites tonight thirtynine spoonfuls of a gruel that would have made oliver twist lead an armed rebellion no milk no raisins no cinnamon no sugar just watery porridge and a glass of water not even tempted by her grandfathers meal of chops and veg she was for your will is what we seek amen tammy said and he opened his eyes to find hers on him her expression was fond he dropped her fingers in a rush he said roughly bloody stupid you know that eh she smiled so youve told me but she settled in so that he could tell her again and she balanced her cheek on her palm we pray before the bloody meal he groused why dwe got to bloody pray at the bloody end as well she answered by rote but with no indication that she was tiring of a discussion theyd had at least twice a week since shed come to cornwall we say a prayer of thanks at the beginning we thank god for the food we have then at the end we pray for those who dont have enough food to sustain them if theyre bloody alive they have enough bloody food to bloody sustain them dont they he countered grandie you know what i mean theres a difference between just being alive and having enough to be sustained sustained means more than just living it means having enough sustenance to engage take the sudan for example now you hang on right there missymiss and dont move either he slid out from the banquette he carried his plate the short distance to the caravans sink as a means of feigning other employment but instead of beginning the washing up he snatched her rucksack from the hook on the back of the door and said lets just have a look she said grandie in a patient voice you cant stop me you know he said i know my duty to your parents is what i know my girl he brought the sack to the table and emptied its contents and there it was on the cover a young black mother in tribal dress holding her child one of them sorrowful and both of them hungry blurred in the background were countless others waiting in a mixture of hope and confusion the magazine was called crossroads and he scooped it up rolled it up and slapped it against his palm right he said another bowl of that mush for you then either that or a chop you can take your choice he shoved the magazine into the back pocket of his drooping trousers he would dispose of it later when shed gone to bed ive had enough she said truly grandie i eat enough to stay alive and well and thats what god intended were not meant to carry round excess flesh aside from being not good for us its also not right oh a sin is it wellit can be yes so your grandies a sinner going straight to hell on a plate of beans while youre playing harps with the angels eh she laughed outright you know thats not what i think what you think is a cartload of bollocks what i know is that this stage youre in a stage and how do you know that when you and i have been togetherwhat two months before that you didnt even know me grandie not really makes no difference that i know women and youre a woman despite what youre doing to make yourself look like a twelveyearold girl she nodded thoughtfully and he could tell from the expression on her face that she was about to twist his words and use them against him as she seemed only too expert at doing so let me see she said you had four sons and one daughter and the daughterthis would be aunt nan of courseleft home when she was sixteen and never returned except at christmas and the odd bank holiday so that leaves gran and whatever wife or girlfriend your sons brought round yes so how is it that you know women in general from this limited exposure to them grandie dont you get clever with me id been married to your gran for fortysix years when the poor woman dropped dead so i had plenty of time to know your sort my sort the female sort and what i know is that women need men as much as men need women and anyone who thinks otherwise is doing their thinking straight through the arse what about men who need men and women who need women well not talk about that he declared in outrage therell be no perversion in my family and have no doubt about that ah thats what you think then its perversion thats what i know hed shoved her possessions back into the rucksack and replaced it on the hook before he saw how shed diverted them from his chosen topic the damn girl was like a freshly hooked fish when it came to conversation she flipped and flopped and avoided the net well that would not be the case tonight he was a match for her wiliness the cleverness in her blood was diluted by having sally joy for a mother the cleverness in his blood was not he said a stage full stop girls your age they all have stages this one here it might look different from another girls but a stage is a stage and i know one when im looking it in the eyes dont i do you oh aye and thereve been signs by the way in case you think im blowing smoke in the matter i saw you with him i did she didnt reply instead she carried her glass and bowl to the sink and began the washing up she scraped the bone from his chop into the rubbish and she stacked the cooking pots the plates the cutlery and the glasses on the work top in the order in which she intended to wash them she filled the sink steam rose he thought she was going to scald herself some night but the heat never seemed to bother her when she began to wash but still said nothing he picked up a tea towel for the drying and spoke again you hear me girl i saw you with him so do not be declaring to your granddad that you have no interest eh i know what i saw and i know what i know when a woman looks at a man in the way you were looking at himthat tells me you dont know your own mind no matter what you say she said and where did this seeing take place grandie what does it matter there you were heads together arms lockedthe way lovers do by the way and did that worry you that we might be lovers dont try that with me dont you bloody try that again missymiss once a night is enough and your granddad isnt fool enough to fall for it twice shed done her water glass and his lager pint and he snatched up the latter and pushed the tea towel into it he screwed it around and gave it a polish you were interested you bloody were she paused she was looking out of the window towards the four lines of caravans below their own they marched towards the edge of the cliff and the sea only one of them was occupied at this time of yearthe one nearest the cliffand its kitchen light was on this winked in the night as the rain fell against it jagos home tammy said we should have him over for a meal soon its not good for elderly people to be on their own so much and now hes going to behell miss santo badly though i dont expect hell ever admit it ah there the name had been said selevan could talk about the boy freely now he said youll claim it was nothing wont you awhat dyou call it a passing interest a bit of flirting but i saw and i know you were willing if hed made a move she picked up a plate she washed it thoroughly her movements were languid there was no sense of urgency in anything that tammy did she said grandie you misconstrued santo and i were friends he talked to me he needed someone to talk to and i was the person he chose thats him not you no it was both i was happy with that happy to bewell to be someone he could turn to bah dont lie to me why would i lie he talked i listened and if he wanted to know what i thought about something i told him what i thought i saw you with your arms linked girl she cocked her head as she looked at him she studied his face and then she smiled she removed her hands from the water and dripping as they were she put her arms around him she kissed him even as he stiffened and tried to resist her she said dear grandie linking arms doesnt mean what it might have meant once it means friendship and thats the honest truth honest he said bah it is i always try to be honest with yourself as well especially with myself she went back to the washing up and cleaned her gruel bowl carefully and then she began on the cutlery shed done it all before she spoke again and then she spoke in a very low voice which selevan might have missed altogether had he not been straining to hear something quite different from what she next said i told him to be honest as well she murmured if i hadnt grandieim rather worried about that chapter six you and i both know that you can arrange this if you want to ray thats all im asking you to do bea hannaford raised her mug of morning coffee and watched her exhusband over the rim of it trying to determine how much further she could push him ray felt guilty for a number of things and bea was never beyond a session of button pressing in what she considered a good cause its just not on he said and even if it was done i dont have those kinds of strings to pull assistant chief constable oh please she refrained from rolling her eyes she knew he hated that and hed score a point if she did it there were times when having experienced nearly twenty years of marriage with someone came in very handy and this was one of those times you cant intend me to take that onboard you can do with it what you will ray said anyway you dont know what youve got yet and you wont know till you hear from forensics so youre jumping the gun which by the way youre very good at doing if it comes down to it that she thought was below the belt it was one of those exhusband kinds of remarks the sort that lead to a row in which comments are made with the intention of drawing blood she wasnt about to participate she went to the coffeemaker and topped up her mug she held out the glass carafe in his direction did he want more he did he drank it as she didblackwhich made things as simple as they ever could be between a man and a woman divorced for nearly fifteen years hed shown up at her door at shed gone to answer it assuming the courier from london had arrived far earlier than expected but shed opened it to find her former husband on the step he was frowning in the direction of her front window where a threetiered plant stand displayed a collection of pot plants going through the death throes of the sadly neglected a sign above them was printed with the words fundraiser for home nursesleave money in box clearly the poor home nurses were not going to benefit from beas attempt to add to their coffers ray said your black thumb i see has not become greener recently she said ray whatre you doing here wheres pete at school where else would he be and deeply unhappy at having been forced to eat two eggs this morning instead of his regular since when is he allowed cold pizza for breakfast hes lying to you wellessentially it was only once the problem is he has an unfailing memory he comes by that honestly she returned to the kitchen rather than reply he followed her there he had a carrier bag in his hand and he placed this on the table it comprised the reason for his call upon her petes football shoes she didnt want him leaving the shoes at his dads house did she nor did she want him to take them to school yes so his father had brought them by shed sipped her coffee and offered him one if he wanted he knew where the mugs were she told him but shed made the offer before she thought about it the coffeemaker squatted next to her calendar and what was on this calendar was not only petes schedule but also her own given her own was cryptic enough but ray was no fool hed read a few of the notations inside the boxed dates she knew what he was seeing motormouth wanker big trouble wanker there were others as well as he would note if he flipped back to the previous three months thirteen weeks of internet dating there might be millions of fish in the sea but bea hannaford kept hooking crab pots and seaweed it was largely to forestall a conversation about her decision to reenter the world of dating yet another ludicrous time that prompted bea to bring up having the incident room in casvelyn it should of course have been in bodmin where the setup would be minimal but bodmin was miles and miles from casvelyn with only tediously slowmoving twolane country roads between them she wanted she explained to him an incident room that was nearer to the crime scene he made his point once again you dont know its a crime scene it might be the scene of a tragic accident what makes you think its a crime this isnt one of your feelings is it she wanted to say i dont have feelings as you recall but she didnt over the years shed become so much better at letting go of matters over which she had no control one of which was her former husbands assessment of her she said the bodys a bit marked up his eye was blackenedhealing now so id guess he got into it with someone last week or earlier then there was the sling that webbing thing they use for slinging round a tree or some other stationary object hence the name of it ray murmured bear with me ray as i know nothing about cliff climbing bea kept her voice patient he said sorry anyway the sling broke which was how he fell but i think it may have been nobbled constable mcnultywho by the way has absolutely no future in criminal investigationspointed out that the sling was being held together with electrical tape over a tear and is it any wonder the poor lad took a fatal tumble as a result but every single piece of the boys equipment had electrical tape wrapped round it at some point and i think the tapes used to identify the equipment for some reason if thats the case how difficult would it have been for someone to remove the tape weaken the sling however it was weakened and then replace the tape without the boy ever knowing it have you had a look at the rest of the equipment every piece is with forensics and i have a fairly good idea what theyre going to tell me and what they tell me is why ill need an incident room but not why you need one in casvelyn bea downed the rest of her coffee and placed the mug in the sink with the bowl she neither rinsed nor washed it and she realised this was yet another benefit to lifewithouthusband if she didnt feel up to doing the washing up she didnt have to do the washing up just to soothe the savage breast of the compulsive personality she said the principals are there ray in casvelyn not in bodmin not even here in holsworthy they have a police station small but adequate and its got a conference room on the first floor thats perfectly adequate as well youve done your homework im trying to make it easier for you im giving you details to support the arrangement i know you can do this he studied her she avoided studying him back he was an attractive manhair going a bit thin but that didnt detractand she didnt need to compare him to motormouth wanker or any of the others she just needed him to cooperate or leave or cooperate and leave which would be even better he said and if i arrange this for you beatrice what whats the quid pro quo he was standing by the coffeemaker and he gave another look to the calendar big trouble wanker he read motormouth wanker come on beatrice she said thanks for bringing petes football shoes finished with your coffee he let a moment go by then he took a final gulp and handed the mug over to her saying there had to have been less expensive shoes he has expensive tastes hows the porsche running by the way the porsche he said is a dream the porsche she reminded him is a car she held up a finger to stop him from retorting she said which brings to mindthe victims car what about it what does an unopened package of condoms in the car of an eighteenyearold boy suggest to you is this rhetorical they were in his car along with a bluegrass cd a blank invoice from something called liquidearth and a rolledup poster for a music festival last year in cheltenham and two dogeared surfing magazines ive got my fingers on everything but the condoms well thank god for that ray said with a smile and im wondering if he was about to get lucky getting lucky or hopeful of getting lucky or just eighteen ray said all boys that age should be so adequately prepared what about lynley condoms lynley wherere we going with this what was your interview like hes hardly going to be intimidated by being in the presence of a cop so id have to say the interview was fine no matter which way i flipped the questions his answers were consistent i think hes playing it straight but ray prompted he knew her too well her tone of voice the expression that she tried and obviously failed to control on her face the other one concerns me she said the otherah the woman at the cottage what was her name daidre trahair shes a vet from bristol and what concerns you about the vet from bristol ive a sense about things i know that well enough and whats the sense about things telling you this time that shes lying about something i want to know what daidre neatly situated her vauxhall in the car park at the town end of st mevan crescent which made a slow curve towards st mevan beach and the old promontory king george hotel sitting well above the sand a line of decrepit blue beach huts below it when shed dropped him at the bottom of belle vue lane and pointed him in the direction of the shops she and thomas lynley had agreed on two hours hed said politely im not inconveniencing you i hope he was not she assured him she had several things to do in town anyway he was to take his time and purchase what he needed hed protested this idea initially when shed first fetched him from the salthouse inn although he was considerably more fragrant than on the previous day he was still wearing the ghastly white boiler suit still with nothing but socks on his feet hed carefully removed these to cross the muddy path to her car and hed tried to insist that buying new clothing could wait when shed pressed two hundred pounds upon him she said please dont be ridiculous thomas you cant continue to walk round the area likewell like someone from a hazardouschemicals squad or whatever they call it you can repay me the money besides and here she smiled i hate to be the one to inform you but white doesnt suit you in the least it doesnt hed smiled in turn he had a quite pleasant smile and it came to her that shed not seen him smile until that moment not that there had been anything in particular to grin about on the previous day but stillsmiling was virtually an automatic response in most people a reaction indicative of nothing other than passing courtesy so it was unusual to find someone so grave not in the least she told him so buy something suitable for yourself thank you hed said youre very kind im only kind to the wounded she told him hed nodded thoughtfully and looked out of the windscreen for a moment perhaps meditating on the way belle vue lane climbed in a narrow passage to the upper reaches of the town hed finally said two hours then and got out leaving her wondering what else he had on his mind shed driven off as hed walked barefoot on a route towards the outdooroutfitters shop shed passed him with a wave and had seen from her rearview mirror that hed watched from the pavement as she made her way up the hill to where the street curved out of sight and split off in one direction to the car park and in the other towards st mevan down this was the highest point in casvelyn from here one could take in the charmless nature of the little town it had seen its heyday more than seventy years earlier when holidaying at the sea had been the height of fashion now it existed largely at the pleasure of surfers and other outdoor enthusiasts with tea shops long ago morphed into tshirt boutiques souvenir shops and surfing academies and postedwardian homes serving as doss houses for a peripatetic population who followed the seasons and the swells across belle vue lane from the car park toes on the nose café was doing a good mornings business off the local surfers two of whom had left their cars parked illegally along the kerb as if with the intention of tearing out of the establishment at the first sign of a change in conditions the place was crowded with them they were a close community daidre felt the prick of absencehow different it was from the sorrow of loss she realisedas she passed by and saw them huddled round tables and no doubt telling tales of derringdo in the waves she headed for the offices of the watchman which hunkered down in an unattractive cube of blue stucco at the junction of princes street and queen street in an area of casvelyn that the locals jokingly called the royal t princes street served as the cross piece of the t with queen street the trunk below queen was king street and nearby were duke street and duchy row in victorian times and earlier casvelyn had longed to append regis to its name and its streets appellations bore historical testimony to this fact when shed told thomas lynley that she had things to do in town she hadnt been lyingexactly there were arrangements to be made eventually about the broken window at the cottage but beyond that there was the not insignificant matter of santo kernes death the watchman would be covering the teenagers fall in polcare cove and as she did not take a newspaper in cornwall it would be perfectly logical that she might stop by the offices of the paper to see if an issue with this story in it was soon going to be available when she entered she saw max priestley at once the place was quite smallconsisting of maxs own office the layout room a tiny newsroom and a reception area that conveniently doubled as the newspapers morgueso this was no surprise he was in the layout room in the company of one of the papers two reporters and they were bent over what appeared to be a mockup of a front page which max seemed to want changed and which the reporterwho looked like nothing so much as a twelveyearold girl in flipflopsapparently wanted to remain the same peoplell expect it she was insisting thiss a community paper and he was a member of the community the queen dies and we go three inches max replied otherwise we dont get carried away he looked up then and fixed on daidre she raised a hand hesitantly and studied him as closely as she could without being obvious about it he was an outdoorsman and he looked it weathered skin making him seem older than his forty years thick hair permanently bleached from the sun trim from regular coastal walking he seemed normal today she wondered about that the receptionistwho tripled as copy editor and secretary to the publisherwas in the process of politely enquiring after daidres business when max came out to join them polishing his goldrimmed spectacles on his shirt he said to daidre i just sent steve teller to interview you not five minutes ago its time you had a phone like the rest of the world i do have a phone she told him its just not in cornwall thats hardly convenient to our purpose daidre so youre working on the story about santo kerne i cant exactly avoid it and still call myself a newsman can i he tilted his head towards his office saying to the receptionist bring up steve on his mobile if you can janna tell him dr trahairs come into town and if he manages to get back quick enough she might consent to an interview ive nothing to tell him daidre told max priestley nothing is our business he replied affably he held out his hand a gesture telling daidre to go into his office she cooperated beneath his desk his golden retriever snoozed daidre squatted by the dog and caressed her silky head looking well she said the medications working he grunted in the affirmative and said but you arent making a house call are you daidre made a cursory exam of the dogs belly more a matter of form than from any real need all signs of the skin infection were gone she rose and said dont let it go on so long next time lily could lose her fur in gobs you dont want that wont be a next time im actually a fast learner despite what my history suggests whyre you here you know how santo kerne died dont you daidre you know that i know so i suppose the real question is whyre you asking or stating or whatever youre doing what do you want how can i help you this morning she could hear the irritation in his voice she knew what it meant she was merely an occasional holiday maker in casvelyn she had entrée to some places and not to others she shifted gears i saw aldara last night she was waiting for someone was she indeed i thought it might have been you thats not very likely he looked round the office as if for employment and is that why youve come checking up on aldara checking up on me neither seems like you but im not much good at reading women as you know no thats not it then is there more because as we want to get the paper out earlier today ive actually come to ask a favour he looked immediately suspicious what would that be your computer the internet actually ive no other access and id rather not use the library i need to look up she hesitated how much to say what she cast about and came up with it and what she said was the truth despite its being incomplete the bodysantomax santo was found by a man doing the coastal walk we know that actually all right yes i suppose you do but hes also a detective from new scotland yard do you know that as well is he indeed max sounded interested so he says i want to find out if thats true why why well goodness think of it what better claim to make about yourself if you dont want people looking at you too closely thinking of going into police work yourself thinking of coming to work for me because otherwise daidre i dont see what this has to do with you i found the man inside my cottage id like to know if he is who he says he is she explained how shed come to be acquainted with thomas lynley she made no mention however of how the man seemed like someone carrying across his shoulders a yoke studded with protruding nails her explanation apparently seemed reasonable to the newsman he tilted his head towards his computer terminal have at it then print up what you find because we may well use it ive work to do lilyll keep you company he started to leave the room but paused at the door one hand on the jamb you havent seen me he said shed moved to the terminal she looked up frowning what you havent seen me should anyone ask are we clear on that you do know what that sounds like dont you frankly i dont care what it sounds like he left her then and she mulled over what hed said only animals she concluded were safe for ones devotion she logged onto the internet and then a search engine she typed in thomas lynleys name daidre found him waiting at the bottom of belle vue lane he looked completely different from the bearded stranger shed driven into town but she had no trouble recognising him since shed spent over an hour gazing on a dozen or more news photos of him generated by the investigation of a serial killing in london and by the tragedy that had supervened in his life she now knew why she had seen him as an injured man carrying a tremendous burden she merely didnt know what to do with her knowledge nor with the rest of it who he actually was what comprised his background the title the money the trappings of a world so far different from her own that they might have come from different planets and not merely from different circumstances in different parts of the very same county hed had his hair cut and hed had a shave he wore a rain jacket over a collarless shirt and pullover hed bought sturdy shoes and corduroy trousers he carried a waxed rain hat in his hand not she thought grimly exactly the getup one expected to see on a belted earl but thats what he was lord whoever with a murdered wife done in on the street by a twelveyearold boy shed been pregnant as well it was little wonder to daidre that lynley was among the injured the real miracle was that the man was actually capable of functioning at all when she pulled to the kerb he got into the car hed bought a few items from the pharmacy as well he told her indicating a bag he brought forth from the capacious inner pocket of his jacket razor toothbrush toothpaste shaving cream youve no need to account to me she told him im only glad you had enough funds he gestured to his clothes on sale end of the season a real bargain ive even managedhe reached into the pocket of his trousers and brought forth a few notes and a handful of coinsto bring you change he said i never thought id he drifted off what she stuffed the notes and coins into the unused ashtray shop for yourself he looked at her clearly assessing her words no he said i never thought id enjoy it ah well its retail therapy absolutely guaranteed to lift ones spirits women know this at birth somehow men have to learn it he was quiet for a moment and she caught him doing it another time looking out of the car through the windscreen at the street in a different place and a different time she heard her words again and bit the inside of her lip she hastened to add shall we top off your experience with a coffee somewhere he considered this he answered slowly yes i think id like a coffee detective inspector hannaford was waiting for them at the salthouse inn when they returned lynley decided that the inspector had been watching for daidres car for as soon as they pulled into the inns lumpy car park she came out of the building it had begun to rain again marchs ceaseless bad weather having segued into april and now may and she pulled up the hood of her rain jacket and marched across to them moving briskly she knocked on daidres window and when it was lowered said id like a word both of you please and then directly to lynley youre looking more human today its an improvement she turned and headed back into the inn lynley and daidre followed they found hannaford in the public bar where shed beenas lynley suspectedoccupying a window seat she shed her rain jacket onto a bench and nodded for them to do the same she led them to one of the larger tables on which a magazinesize a to z was opened she spoke expansively to lynley which made him immediately suspicious about her motives when cops were friendly as he well knew they were friendly for a reason and it wasnt necessarily a good one where she asked him had he begun his coastal walk on the previous day would he show her on the map see the paths well marked with a green dotted line and if hed be so kind as to point out the spotit was all a matter of tying up the loose ends of his story she said he would know the dance of course lynley brought out his reading spectacles and leaned over the road atlas the truth of the matter was that he hadnt the slightest idea where hed begun his walk on the southwest coast path on the previous day if there had been a landmark he hadnt taken note of it he remembered the names of several villages and hamlets hed come upon along the coast but as to when on his walk hed passed through them he couldnt say he also didnt see that it mattered although di hannaford cleared the air on that concern in a moment he took a stab at placing himself some twelve miles southwest of polcare cove he had no idea if this was accurate hannaford said right although she made no note about the location she went on pleasantly with and what about you dr trahair the vet stirred next to lynley i did tell you i came down from bristol you did indeed mind showing me the route cn i assume you follow the same route each time by the way straightforward matter and all that not necessarily lynley noted how daidre drew out the final word and he knew that hannaford would not miss it either drawing a reply out like that generally meant certain mental hoops were being jumped through what those hoops were and why they existed at allhannaford would be fishing for the reason lynley took a moment to evaluate the two women from head to toe they couldnt have been more dissimilar hannafords flaming mop done up in wild spikes daidres sandy hair drawn back from her face and held at the crown of her head with a tortoiseshell slide hannaford dressed to mean business in a suit and court shoes daidre wearing jeans pullover and boots daidre was lithe like a woman who took regular exercise and watched what she ate hannaford looked like someone whose busy life precluded both regular meals and regular workouts there were also several decades between them the detective could have been daidres mother she wasnt acting motherly now she was waiting for an answer to her question as daidre looked at the atlas to explain the route shed followed from bristol to polcare cove lynley knew why the cop was asking he wondered if daidre was working that out as well before she replied the m down to exeter she said over to okehampton and northwest from there there was no completely easy way to get to polcare cove she pointed out sometimes she did the exeter route but other times she worked her way over from tiverton hannaford made much of studying the map before she said and from okehampton what dyou mean daidre asked one cant leap from okehampton to polcare cove dr trahair you didnt come by helicopter from there did you what was the route you took the exact route please lynley saw a flush rise up the vets neck she was lucky that her skin was lightly freckled had it not been she would have coloured to puce she said are you asking me this because you think i had something to do with that boys death did you i did not then you wont mind showing me your route will you daidre pressed her lips together she pushed an errant lock of hair behind her left ear her lobe lynley saw was pierced three times she wore a hoop a stud but nothing else she traced the route a a a and then a series of smaller roads until she reached polcare cove which earned barely a speck in the a to z as she pointed out the journey shed made hannaford took notes she nodded thoughtfully and thanked the other woman when daidre had completed her answer daidre didnt look pleased to have the detectives thanks she looked if anything angry and trying to master her anger this told lynley that daidre knew what the detective was up to what it didnt tell him was where her anger was being directed though at di hannaford or herself are we released now daidre asked you are dr trahair hannaford said but mr lynley and i have further business you cant think he she stopped the flush was there again she looked at lynley and then away he what hannaford asked politely hes a stranger round here how would he have known that boy are you saying you yourself knew him dr trahair did you know that boy he might have been a stranger here as well our mr lynleyfor all we knowmay have come along precisely to toss santo kernethats his name by the wayright down the face of that cliff thats ridiculous hes said hes a policeman hes said but ive no actual proof of that have you inever mind shed placed her shoulder bag on a chair and she scooped it up im leaving now as you said you were finished with me inspector as indeed i am bea hannaford said pleasantly for now they exchanged only a brief few remarks in the car afterwards lynley asked hannaford where she was taking him and she replied that she was taking him with her to truro to royal cornwall hospital to be exact he then said youre going to check all the pubs on the route arent you to which she archly replied all the pubs on the route to truro not very likely my good man he said im not talking about the route to truro inspector she said i knew that and do you really expect me to answer that question you found the body you know the game if youre who you say you are she glanced his way shed put on sunglasses although there was no sun and indeed it was still raining he wondered about this and she answered his wonder corrective she told him for my driving my others are at home or possibly in my sons rucksack at school or one of the dogs could have eaten them for all i know you have dogs three black labs dogs one two and three interesting names i like to keep things simple at home to balance all the ways things are never simple at work that was the extent of what they said the rest of the drive they made in silence broken by radio chatter and two calls hannaford took on her mobile phone one of them apparently asked for her approximate time of arrival in truro barring traffic problems and the other was a brief message from someone to whom she responded with a terse i told them to get it to me what the hells it doing with you in bloody exeterand howm i supposed tothat is not necessary and yes youre right before you say it i dont want to owe youoh grand do what you like ray at the hospital in truro hannaford guided lynley to the mortuary where the air smelled headily of disinfectant and an assistant was hosing off the trolley on which a body had been cut open for inspection nearby the forensic pathologistthin as an ageing spinsters marital hopeswas downing a large tomato juice over a stainless sink the man lynley thought had to have a stomach of iron and the sensitivity of a stone this is gordie lisle hannaford said to lynley fastest y incision on the planet and you dont want to know how quick he can shear ribs you do me too much honour lisle said i know this is thomas lynley she told him whatve we got finishing his juice lisle went to a desk and scooped up a document to which he referred as he began his report this he prefaced with the information that the injuries were consistent with a fall he went about relating them pelvis broken he said and right medial malleolus shattered he added thats ankle to the layman hannaford nodded sagely right tibia and right fibula fractured lisle continued compound fractures of the ulna and radius also on the right six ribs broken left greater tubercle crushed both lungs pierced spleen ruptured what the hell is a tubercle hannaford asked shoulder he explained nasty business but is all that enough to kill him what sent him to the other side then shock i was saving the best for last enormous fracture of the temporal bone his skull broke like an eggshell see here lisle set his document on a work top and strolled over to a wall on which the human skeletal system was displayed on a large chart when he fell i reckon he hit an outcrop on the way down the cliff he flipped at least once picked up speed with the rest of the descent landed heavy on the right side and crushed his skull on the slate when the bone fractured it sliced into the middle meningeal artery that produced an acute epidural haematoma pressure on the brain and no place for it to go thats not lethal hed have died in about fifteen minutes although he would have been unconscious throughout i take it there was no helmet nearby no other headgear kids hannaford said they think theyre invincible this one wasnt anyway the extent of the injuries suggests he fell the moment he began the abseil which itself suggests the sling broke the instant it took his full weight id agree with that what about the black eye it was healing yes whats it consistent with a bloody good punch someone gave him a decent one that likely floored him you can still see the impression of the knuckles hannaford nodded she gave a glance at lynley whod been listening and simultaneously wondering why hannaford was making him part of this it was more than irregular it was foolhardy of her considering his position in the case and she didnt seem like a foolhardy woman she had a plan of some sort he would have laid a wager on that when hannaford asked the punch lisle said id say a week ago does it look like he was in a fight lisle shook his head why not no other marks on him of a similar age lynley put in someone got one good blow in and that was that hannaford looked at him quite as if shed forgotten shed brought him lisle said id agree someone snapped or someone was giving him discipline of some sort it either resolved things knocked him flat or he wasnt the type to be provoked even by a punch in the face what about sadomasochism hannaford asked lisle looked thoughtful and lynley said im not sure sadomasochists like being punched in the face hmm yes lisle said id think your common s and m freak would be looking to have himself tweaked round his privates spanked as well maybe whipped for good measure and weve got nothing on the body consistent with that all three of them stood for a moment staring at the chart of the skeletal system lisle finally said to hannaford hows the dating coming along internet made your dreams come true yet daily she told him you must try it again gordie you gave up far too soon he shook his head im finished there case of looking for love in all the wrong places if i might coin a phrase he gazed mournfully round the mortuary puts them right off this does and no getting round it no dolling it up i spill the beans and there you have it what dyou mean he gestured to the room another corpse was waiting nearby a sheet covering its body a tag on its toe when they learn what i do no one fancies it much hannaford patted him on the shoulder well no matter there gordie you fancy it and thats what counts you want to give us a try then he looked at her differently assessing and weighing dont tempt me dear youre far too young and anyway im a sinner at heart ill need the paperwork on thisusing her chin to indicate the trolley that had been washed offas quickly as possible ill sweettalk someone lisle said they left him hannaford examined a hospital plan nearby and ushered lynley to the cafeteria he couldnt think she intended to have a meal after their visit to the morgue and he found he was correct in this assessment of matters hannaford paused in the doorway and looked round the room till she spied a man at a table alone reading a newspaper she led lynley to him it was the man lynley saw whod come to daidre trahairs cottage on the previous night the same man whod asked him about new scotland yard he hadnt been identified then but hannaford did the honours now this was acc ray hannaford from middlemore she told him the assistant chief constable stood and courteously offered his hand yes di hannaford then said to lynley yes lynley asked hes a relation former ray hannaford said regrettably you flatter me darling di hannaford said neither of them elucidated further although the word former spoke a volume or two more than one cop in the immediate family lynley concluded it couldnt have been easy ray hannaford picked up a manila envelope that had been sitting on the table here it is he said to his former wife next time you insist on a courier do tell them where you are for delivery beatrice i did tell them the di replied obviously whoever the sod was who brought this down from london he didnt want the bother of going all the way to holsworthy or the casvelyn station or she asked shrewdly did you put in a call for this as well she gestured with the manila envelope i didnt he said but were going to have to talk about a quid pro quo the accounts growing the drive from exeter was bloody murder you owe me on two fronts now two whats the other fetching pete last night without complaint as i recall did i drag you from the arms of a twentyyearold i believe she was at least twentythree bea hannaford chuckled she opened the envelope and peered inside she said ah yes i take it youve had a look yourself ray guilty as suspected she brought the contents out at once lynley recognised his own police identification from new scotland yard he said i handed that in it should have beenwhat do they do to those things when someone quits they must destroy them ray hannaford was the one who replied apparently they werent willing to destroy yours premature was the word they used bea hannaford added a hasty decision made at a bad time she offered the scotland yard id to lynley he didnt take it instead he said my identification is on its way from my home i did tell you that my wallet along with everything in it will be here by tomorrow thishe indicated his warrant cardwas unnecessary on the contrary di hannaford said it was entirely necessary phony ids as you well know are as easy to get as the clap for all i know youve spent the morning scouring the streets for the goods why would i want to do that i expect you can work that out for yourself superintendent lynley or do you prefer the aristo title and what the hell is someone like you doing working for the bill im not he said not any longer tell that to the yard you didnt answer which are you called which dyou prefer personal or professional title i prefer thomas and now that you know i am who i said i was last nightwhich i suspect you knew already or why else would you have allowed me into the mortuary with youmay i presume im free to resume my walk on the coast thats the very last thing you may presume youre not going anywhere till i tell you otherwise and if youre thinking of scurrying off in the dark of night think again youve a usefulness now i have the proof you are who you claimed to be usefulness as a policeman or as a private citizen lynley asked her as whatever works detective works for what for our good doctor who the vet dr trahair you and i both know shes lying through those pretty white teeth of hers your job is to find out why you cant possibly require me hannafords mobile rang she held up a hand and cut him off she dug the phone from her bag and walked off a few paces saying tell me into the mobile as she flipped it open she bent her head as she listened she tapped her foot she lives for this ray hannaford said she didnt at the beginning but now its what makes her alive foolish isnt it that death would make someone alive no that i let her go she wanted one thing i wanted another that happens not if id had my head on straight lynley looked at hannaford earlier hed said regrettably about his status as the inspectors former husband you could tell her lynley said could and did but sometimes when you demean yourself in anothers eyes you cant recover id like to turn back time though yes lynley said wouldnt we both the di returned to them then her jaw was set she gestured with her mobile and said to the acc its murder ray i want that incident room in casvelyn i dont care what you have to do to get it and i dont care what the quid pro quo is going to be either i want holmes set up an mcit in place and an evidence officer assigned all right you dont ask for much beatrice do you on the contrary raymond she replied levelly as you well know well sort out a car for you bea hannaford said to lynley youre going to need one they stood outside the entrance to royal cornwall hospital ray had gone on his way after telling bea that he couldnt promise her anything and after hearing her retort of how true which she knew was an unfair dig but which she used anyway because shed long ago learned that when it came to murder the end of charging someone with a homicide justified any means one employed to get there lynley replied with what sounded to bea like care i dont believe you can ask this of me because you outrank me thats not going to count for much out here in the hinterlands superintendent acting only what acting superintendent i was never promoted permanently i was just stepping in to fill a need how good of you the very sort of bloke im looking for you can step in to fill another rather burning need now she felt him glance her way as they proceeded towards her car and she laughed outright not that need she said though i expect you offer a decent shag when a woman puts a gun to your head how old are you the yard didnt tell you humour me thirtyeight star sign what gemini taurus virgo what is this somehow important as i said humour me going along with the moment is so inexpensive thomas he sighed pisces as it happens well there you have it it would never work between us besides im twenty years older than you and while i fancy them younger than myself i dont fancy them that young so youre entirely safe in my company somehow thats not a soothing thought she laughed again and unlocked the car they both climbed in but she didnt insert the ignition key at once instead she looked at him seriously i need you to do this for me she told him she wants to protect you who you know who dr trahair she hardly wants that i broke into her house she wants me around to pay for the damage and i owe her money for the clothing dont be obtuse she jumped to your defence earlier and theres a reason for that shes got a vulnerable spot it may have to do with you or it may not i dont know where it is or why it is but youre going to find it why because you can because this is a murder investigation and all the nice social rules fly out of the window when we start looking for a killer and thats something you know as well as i do lynley shook his head but it seemed to bea hannaford that this movement wasnt one of refusal so much as one that acknowledged a regretful understanding and acceptance of a single immutable fact she had him by the short and curlies if he did a runner shed fetch him back and he knew it he said at last was the sling cut then what the phone call you received you came away from it calling the situation murder so im wondering if the sling was cut or if theyve dug up something else at forensics bea thought about whether to answer the question and what it would signal to him if she did so she knew little enough about the man but she also knew when a leap of faith was needed simply for what a leap of faith meant she said it was cut obviously so microscopic examination helped push the decisionif you willover the edge so not terribly obvious at least to the naked eye why do you think its murder and notwhat suicide played out to look like an accident to spare the family additional pain what do we know so far that could possibly lead you there he was hit punched and its stretching but perhaps he wasnt in a position to defend himself he wanted to but couldnt who knows why he felt unable or at least unwilling which resulted in a sense of uselessness he projects that uselessness onto the rest of his life onto all his relationships no matter how illogical the projection is and bobs your mothers youknowwhat i dont think so and neither do you bea shoved her car key into the ignition and thought about what these remarks suggested not so much about the victim but about thomas lynley himself she gave him a wary look and wondered if shed been wrong in her assessment of him dyou know what a chock stone is she asked him he shook his head should i what is it its what makes this a murder investigation she said chapter seven the rain stopped in casvelyn not long after midday and for this cadan angarrack was grateful hed been painting radiators in the guest rooms of adventures unlimited since his arrival that morning and the fumes were causing his head to pound he couldnt sort out why they had him painting radiators anyway who was going to notice them who ever noticed whether radiators were painted when they were in a hotel no one except perhaps a hotel inspector and what did it amount to if a hotel inspector noticed a bit of rust in the ironwork nothing absobloodylutely nothing and anyway it wasnt like the decrepit promontory king george hotel was being taken back to its former glory was it it was merely being made habitable for the hordes interested in a holiday package on the sea that consisted of fun frolic food and some kind of instruction in an outdoor activity and that lot didnt care where they stayed at night as long as it was clean served chips and stayed within the budget so when the skies cleared cadan decided that a bit of fresh air was just the ticket he would have a look at the crazy golf course future location of the bmx trails future site of the bmx lessons that cadan was certain would be requested of him once he had a chance to show his stuff tothat was the problem of the moment he wasnt quite sure to whom he would be showing anything indeed he hadnt been certain he was even supposed to come into work on this day as he wasnt sure that he had a job after what had happened to santo at first hed thought he simply wouldnt show up he thought hed let a few days roll by and then hed phone and express whatever condolences he could come up with and ask did they still want him to do maintenance work but then he reckoned a phone call like that would give them a chance to sack him before hed even had a chance to demonstrate how valuable he could be so hed decided to put in an appearance at the place and to look as doleful as possible round any kerne he might run into cadan hadnt yet seen a hair of either ben or dellensanto kernes parentsbut his arrival had coincided with alan chestons and when cadan brought alan into the picture about his employment at adventures unlimited alan said hed fetch someone at once to see what cadan was meant to be doing hed strode off to do so after unlocking the front door letting them both in and pocketing the keys with the air of a man who knew exactly where his place was in the scheme of things the old hotel was as silent as a graveyard it was cold as well cadan shiveredhe felt pooh do likewise on his shoulderand he waited in the new reception area where a bulletin board displayed the words your instructors along with head shots of the six staff members so far hired these all pyramided down from a picture of kerra kerne who was identified as director of instruction it was cadan thought a decent picture of kerra she was no great beautyordinary brown hair ordinary blue eyes and stockier than cadan fancied in a womanbut there was no doubt she was in the best physical condition of any female her age in casvelyn it was just unfortunate that her roll of the genetic dice had given kerra her fathers looks instead of her mothers santo had inherited every one of those a fact which some might refer to as lucky cadan however reckoned most blokes didnt fancy being pretty like santo unless naturally one knew how to use it cade he swung round pooh squawked and shifted position kerra had materialized from somewhere alan was with her cadan knew they were a couple but he couldnt reconcile the matter kerra was sun and sinew with unfortunately treetrunk ankles alan looked like someone whod take exercise as a last resort and then only if threatened with disembowelment a few words among them had sorted things although alan on the surface might have looked like small change it turned out he was on top of almost all that was going on at the place so before cadan knew enough to make a spurious excuse about the delicate condition of his lungs should they ever be exposed to paint fumes he found himself with drop cloths and a paintbrush in one hand and two gallons of glossy white in the other alan made an introduction between cadan and the project and that was that four hours later saw cadan deciding he was owed a break outdoors pooh he noted had grown ominously silent likely the parrot had a headache as well the ground was still sopping round the crazy golf course but cadan didnt let that deter him guiding his bike he climbed the slope to hole number one where he quickly saw that doing a few tabletops just now in this location had been something of a pipe dream he set his bike to one side established pooh on the handlebars and gave the crazy golf course a closer look this wasnt going to be a simple project the course looked at least sixty years old it also looked like something that hadnt been maintained in the last thirty of those years this was too bad because otherwise crazy golf could have been a little moneymaker for adventures unlimited on the other hand this was also a plus because an unmaintained course made it far likelier than otherwise that anyone in the position of making a decision about the future would climb onboard once cadan laid out his plans but the idea of laying out plans necessitated having plans and cadan wasnt a havingplans sort of person so he walked round the first five holes of the course and tried to reckon what needed to be done aside from ripping out miniature windmills barns and schoolhouses and filling in the holes he was still considering all this when he saw a panda car pulling from st mevan crescent into the car park of the old hotel the drivera uniformed constablegot out and went inside a few minutes later he departed shortly thereafter kerra came out of the building she stood in the car park hands on hips and she looked about cadan was squatting next to a tiny shipwrecked rowboat that acted as an obstacle on hole number six and it came to him that she was searching for someone possibly him his modus operandi was generally to hide since if someone was seeking him it was usually because hed bollocksed something up and was presently going to hear about it but a quick evaluation of his performance in the painting department told him hed been doing a class a job so he rose and made his presence known kerra headed in his direction shed changed from what shed been wearing earlier she was decked out in lycra and cadan recognised the kit she had on her longdistance cyclists gear odd time of day to be going for a ride he thought but when you were the bosss daughter you made your own rules kerra spoke to him without preamble when she reached the ruins of the crazy golf course her voice was clipped i phoned the farm but they told me she doesnt work there any longer i phoned your house but shes not there either dyou know where she is i want to speak with her cadan took a moment to think about the remarks the question and the implications of each he bought time by going to his bike removing pooh from the handlebars and settling the bird on his shoulder blow holes in the attic pooh remarked cade kerras voice was patient but with an edge please answer me now would be preferable to sometime in the future its weird you want to know is all cadan told her i mean its not like youre friends with madlyn any longer so i was wondering he cocked his head so that his cheek touched poohs side he liked the feeling of the birds feathers against him kerras eyes narrowed you were wondering what santo the cops showing up you coming out here to talk to me asking me about madlyn is all this related kerra had her hair in a ponytail and she unbanded it so that it fell to her shoulders she shook it out then tied it back up it seemed as much a gesture to buy time for her as rescuing pooh from the bike had been for cadan then she looked at him and seemed to focus more clearly what happened to your face plain old luck he said its the one i was born with dont joke cadan you know what i mean the bruises the scratches i slipped occupational hazard i was doing a nofooted cancan and i hit the side of the pool the wrong way over at the leisure centre you did that swimming she sounded incredulous pools empty i was practising there on the bike he felt himself colour and this irritated him he made it a point never to be embarrassed about his passion and he didnt want to think why he was embarrassed now whats going on he asked with a nod at the hotel it wasnt an ordinary fall he was murdered thats what the police came to tell us they sent theirwhatever he istheir liaison officer i think hes meant to hang about serving us tea and biscuits to keep us fromi dont knowwhat do people generally do when a member of the family is murdered go mad to get vengeance shoot up the town gnash their teeth and what the hell is that gnashing the teeth where is she cade she already knows he died that he died or that he was murdered where is she he was my brother and as she was hishis girlfriend your friend as well cadan reminded her at least at one time dont she said just dont all right he shrugged he directed his attention back to the crazy golf course and said this needs to go its a wreck you could repair it but my guess is the cost would exceed the benefits in the short term in the long runwho knows alan knows the long run profit and loss longterm projections he knows it all but none of that matters because just now there may not be a reason to worry about about anything related to adventures unlimited i doubt my father will have the stomach to open after whats happened to santo whats next then if you dont open alan would say we try to find a buyer and recoup our investment but then thats alan a mind for the figures if nothing else sounds like youre cheesed off at him she didnt take up the remark is she at home and just not answering the phone i can go over there but i dont want to take the trouble if shes not there anyway so dyou mind telling me that much i expect shes still with jago he said whos jago jago reeth bloke that works for my dad she was with him all night shes still with him for all i know kerra laughed shortly without amusement well shes moved on hasnt she that was quick miraculous recovery from complete heartbreak how very nice for her cadan wanted to ask what it was to her whether his sister moved on to another man or not but instead he said jago reeths likei dont know maybe hes seventy or something hes like a granddad to her okay whats he do for your dad then some seventyyearold she was definitely annoying him she was being the bosss daughter and youbettertreatmeasimmeanttobetreated and that rubbed cadan wrong he said kerra does that matter exactly why the hell dyou want to know and just like that she altered she gave a weird little cough and he saw the glitter of tears in her eyes that glitter reminded him that her brother was dead that hed died only on the previous day and that shed just learned hed been murdered he said a glasser when she looked at him in confusion he added jago reeth he does the fiberglass on the boards hes an old surfer my dad picked upi dont knowsix months ago maybe hes a detail man like dad and whats important not like me she spent the night with a seventyyearold bloke jago phoned and said she was there what time kerra this is important cadan why dyou think she gave your brother the bump how was she supposed to do that shove him over the cliff his equipment was messed with thats what the cop told us cadan widened his eyes hang on kerra no wayand i mean no way she may have been off her nut with everything that happened between them but my sister is not he stopped himself not because of what hed intended to say about madlyn but because as hed been speaking his gaze had moved from kerra to the beach below them and across that beach a surfer was jogging his board under his arm and its leash trailing behind him in the sand he was fully garbed as he would be at this time of year for the water was still quite cold head to toe in neoprene head to toe in black you couldnt in fact actually tell if the surfer was male or female from this distance what kerra said cadan shuddered he said quietly madlyn may have been all over the map with how she reacted after what happened between her and santo i give you that that and then some kerra remarked but killing off her exboyfriend wouldnt be part of her repertoire okay jesus kerra she kept thinking he was just going through a stage you know at first kerra clarified okay maybe only at first she thought that but it doesnt mean shed finally get to the point of understanding how things really were and deciding the only reasonable thing to do was to kill him does that make sense to you love kerra said never makes sense to me people do all sorts of mad things when theyre in love with someone yeah cadan said is that the truth so what about you she made no reply i rest my case he told her and then he added sea dreams if you have to know whats that where she is jagos got a caravan at that holiday park where the dairy used to be out beyond sawsneck down if you want to grill her grill her there for what its worth though youll be wasting your time what makes you think i want to grill her you sure as hell want something cadan told her once bea hannaford had him in possession of a hired car she told lynley to follow her she said to him i expect this isnt your typical heap in reference to the ford but at least youll fit it or itll fit you under other circumstances lynley might have told her that she was being more than generous indeed his breeding generally made that sort of remark second nature to him but under the present circumstances he merely told her that his usual mode of transportation had been totaled in february and he hadnt yet replaced it with something else so the ford was fine she said good and advised him to mind his driving since he would be doing so without a licence until his wallet arrived itll be our little secret she said she told him to follow her she had something to show him what she had to show him was in casvelyn and he obediently trailed her there he drove trying to keep his mind on thatsimply on the drivingbut he found the strength draining out of him with the sheer effort he made to hold his thoughts in check hed told himself he was finished with murder one did not watch a beloved wife diethe victim of an utterly senseless street killingand walk away from that to think that tomorrow was simply another day tomorrow was instead something to be endured so far hed endured the endless succession of tomorrows hed been living through by doing what was set in front of him and nothing more at first it had been howenstow seeing to matters on and around the land that was his legacy and the great house sitting upon that land no matter that his mother his brother and an estate manager had been handling howenstow matters for ages hed thrown himself into them to keep from throwing himself elsewhere until half of what hed taken on was a muddle and the other half was a wreck his mothers gentle admonition of darling let me handle this or john penellins been working on this situation for weeks tommy or anything of a similar persuasion was something he brushed aside with a remark so terse that the dowager countess had sighed pressed his shoulder and left him to it but he found that howenstow matters ultimately brought helen into his mind whether he wanted her there or not the halffinished nursery had to be dismantled countryside clothing shed left in their bedroom had to be gone through a plaque for her resting place in the estate chapelfor the resting place she shared with their neverborn sonhad to be designed and then there were the reminders of her where he and she had walked together on the path from the house through the wood and over to the cove where shed stood in front of pictures in the gallery and lightheartedly commented on the physical attributes of some of his more questionable ancestors where shed browsed through ancient editions of country life in the library where shed curled up withand ultimately dozed off overa thick biography of oscar wilde because reminders of helen were everywhere at howenstow hed begun his walk trudging along the entire southwest coast path was the last possible challenge helen would ever have undertaken my god tommy youve got to be mad what would i do for shoes that arent utterly appalling in appearance so he knew he could walk the length of it with impunity should he choose to do so there would be not a single reminder of her along the way but hed not counted on the memorials hed come across nothing hed read about the path prior to walking it had prepared him for those from simple bunches of dying flowers to wooden benches engraved with the names of the departed death greeted him nearly every day hed left the yard because he could not face another sudden brutal passing of a human being but there it was confronting him with a regularity that mocked his every attempt to forget and now this di hannaford wasnt exactly involving him in the murder investigation itself but she was putting him close to it he didnt want that but at the same time he didnt know how he could avoid it because he read the inspector as a woman who was as good as her word should he conveniently disappear from the region of casvelyn she would happily fetch him back and not rest till shed done so as to what she was asking him to dolike di hannaford lynley believed daidre trahair was lying about the route shed taken from bristol to polcare cove on the previous day unlike di hannaford lynley also knew daidre trahair had lied more than once about knowing santo kerne there were going to be reasons behind both of these liesfar beyond what the vet had told him when hed confronted her about her knowledge of the dead boys identityand he didnt know if he wanted to uncover them her reasons for obfuscation were doubtless personal and the poor woman was hardly a killer yet why did he think that he asked himself he knew better than anyone that killers wore a thousand different guises killers were men killers were women killers to his anguish were children and victims everywhereno matter how foul they might actually bewere not meant to be dispatched by anyone whatever the motive for untimely sending them to their eternal reward or punishment the whole basis for their society rested upon the idea that murder was wrong start to finish and that justice had to be served so that closureif not satisfaction not relief and certainly not an end to griefmight at least be achieved on the entire event justice equated to naming and convicting the killer and justice was what was owed to those the victim summarily left behind part of lynley cried out that this was not his problem part of him knew that now and forever and more than ever it would always be by the time they reached casvelyn he was if not reconciled to the matter then at least in moderate accord with it everything needed to be accounted for in an investigation daidre trahair was part of that everything having made herself so the moment she lied casvelyns police station was in lansdown road in the heart of the town directly at the bottom of belle vues course up the towns main acclivity and it was here in front of the plain grey twostorey structure that bea hannaford parked lynley thought at first that she meant to take him inside and introduce him around but instead she said come with me and she put a hand on his elbow and guided him back the way they had come at the junction of lansdown road and belle vue they crossed a triangle of land where benches a fountain and three trees provided casvelyn with an outdoor gathering place in good weather from there they headed over to queen street which was lined with shops like those on belle vue lane everything from purveyors of furniture to pharmacies there bea hannaford paused and peered in both directions till she apparently saw what she wanted for she said yes over here i want you to see what were dealing with over here referred to a shop selling sporting goods both equipment and clothing for outdoor activities hannaford did an admirably quick recce of the place found what she wanted told the shop assistant they needed no help and directed lynley to a wall upon it were hung various metallic devices mostly of steel it wasnt rocket science to sort out they were used for climbing she chose a package that held three devices constructed of lead heavy steel cable and plastic sheathing the lead was a thick wedge at the end of a cable perhaps one quarter inch thick this looped through the wedge at one end and also formed another loop at the other end in the middle was a tough plastic sheath which wrapped tightly round the cable and thus held the two sides of it closely together the result was a sturdy cord with a slug of lead at one end and a loop at the other this hannaford said to lynley is a chock stone dyou know how its used lynley shook his head obviously it was meant for cliff climbing equally so its loop end would be used to connect the chock stone to some other device but that was as much as he could sort out di hannaford said hold up your hand palm towards yourself keep your fingers tight ill show you lynley did as she asked she slid the cable between his upright index and middle fingers so that the slug of lead was snug against his palm and the loop at the other end of the cable was on her side of his hand she said your fingers are a crack in the cliff face or an aperture between two boulders your hand is the cliff itself or the boulders themselves got it she waited for his nod the lead piecethats the chock stonegets shoved down the crack in the cliff or the aperture between the boulders as far as it can go with the cable sticking out in the loop end of the cablehere she paused to scan the wall of climbing gear till she found what she wanted and scooped it upyou clip a carabiner like this she did so and you fix your rope to the carabiner with whatever sort of knot youve been taught to use if youre climbing up you use chock stones on the way every few feet or whatever youre comfortable with if youre abseiling you can use them at the top instead of a sling to fix your rope to whatever youve chosen to hold it in place while you descend she took the chock stone from him and replaced it along with the carabiner on the wall of goods she turned back and said climbers mark each part of their kit distinctly because they often climb together lets say you and i are climbing i use six chock stones or sixteen chock stones you use ten we use my carabiners but your slings how do we sort it all out quickly and without discussion in the end by marking each piece with something that wont easily come off bright tape is just the ticket santo kerne used black electrical tape lynley saw where she was heading with this he said so if someone wishes to play fast and loose with someone elses kit he merely needs to get his hands on the same kind of tape and the equipment itself yes thats right you can damage the equipment put identical tape over the damage and no one is the wiser the sling obviously it would have been the easiest to damage although cutting it would have shown if not to the naked eye at least to the microscope which is exactly what happened as weve discussed earlier but theres more isnt there or you wouldnt have shown me this forensics went through santos kit hannaford said hand on his elbow again she began to guide him out of the shop she kept her voice low two of the chock stones had been seen to beneath the marking tape both the plastic sheathing and the cable had been damaged the sheathing was cut through the cable was hanging on by a metaphorical thread if the boy used either one for an abseil he was done for same thing applied to the sling he was a dead man walking a dead climber climbing what you will it was only a matter of time before he used the right piece of equipment at the worst possible moment fingerprints galore hannaford said but im not sure how useful theyre going to be since most climbers dont go solo all the time and were likely to find thats the case with santo unless theres a print on the damaged pieces that doesnt exist on any others that would be difficult for someone to explain away hmm yes but that whole bit has me wondering thomas what whole bit is that lynley asked three damaged pieces instead of only one what does that suggest to you he considered this he said thoughtfully only one bad piece was needed to send him to his death but he was carrying three you might conclude that the killer didnt care when it happened or if the fall even killed him since he could have used the damaged chock stones quite low on an upward route and not used the sling at all any other conclusions if he generally abseiled first and climbed back up afterwards you might conclude that three pieces of damaged equipment indicate the killer was in a hurry to do away with the boy or as difficult as it might be to believe he pondered a moment wondering about the final likelihood and what that final likelihood suggested she prompted him with yes damaging three piecesyou might also conclude the killer wanted everyone to know it was murder she nodded bit mad isnt it but thats what i was thinking it was the sheer madness of love that had made kerra want to get out of the hotel and onto her bike shed changed into her riding kit because of it and shed determined that twenty miles or so would be sufficient to clear her head of the thought of it a twentymile ride wouldnt take her terribly long either not if the weather continued to improve and not for someone in her condition on a good day with the weather cooperating she could do sixty miles with one hand tied behind her back so twenty was childs play it was also highly necessary childs play so shed made herself ready and headed for the door the arrival of the police officer had stopped her it was the same bloke as the previous night constable mcnulty and he had on his face such a lugubrious expression that kerra knew the news would be bad before he uttered it hed asked to see her parents shed told him that was impossible theyre not here hed asked it was a logical question oh they were at home upstairs but unavailable you can tell me what youve come to tell them theyve asked not to be disturbed im afraid i need to ask you to fetch them the officer said and im afraid i have to refuse theyve asked to be left alone theyve made it clear theyre finally resting im sure you understand have you any children constable because when one loses a child one reels and theyre reeling this wasnt exactly true but the truth would hardly garner sympathy the thought of her mother and her father going at each other in santos bedroom like randy adolescents made the contents of kerras stomach curdle she didnt want anything to do with them just now especially she didnt want anything to do with her father whom she was growing to despise more and more with each passing hour shed despised him for years but nothing hed so far done or failed to do held a candle to what was going on at the moment constable mcnulty had reluctantly left the information once alan had come out of the marketing office where hed been reviewing a commercial video alan had said what is it kerra may i help and he sounded firm and sure of himself as if the past sixteen hours were continuing to transform him im kerras fiancé he told the policeman is there something i can do for you fiancé kerra had thought kerras fiancé where was that coming from before shed been able to correct him the cop had given them the information murder several pieces of santos kit had been tampered with the sling and two chock stones as well the police were going to want to interview the family first alan had said the expected you arent supposing one of the family and managed to sound perplexed and outraged simultaneously everyone who knew santo would be interviewed constable mcnulty told them he appeared rather excited about this and it had come to kerra how tediously boring the policemans life must be in casvelyn in the offseason with threequarters of the summer population gone and those who remained either in their houses huddling against the atlantic storms or committing only the occasional minor traffic violation to break the monotony of a constables life all of santos belongings would need to be examined the constable told them a family history would be constructed and that had been enough for kerra family history that would certainly be illuminating a family history would show it all bats in the belfry and skeletons in the closet people who were permanently estranged and people who were just permanently strange all of this gave her another reason to ride and then came cadan and the conversation with cadan which left her feeling blamed after her words with him she fetched her bike her father met her outside alan coming out behind him with an expression that said hed passed along the information about santo so alan didnt need to mouth the words he knows although thats what he did kerra wanted to tell him hed had no right to tell her father anything alan wasnt a member of the family ben kerne said to kerra where are you going id like you to stay here he sounded exhausted he looked it too did you fuck her again was what kerra wished to use as reply did she slip on her little red negligee and crook her finger and did you melt and not see anything else not even that santo is dead good way to forget for a few minutes eh works a trick always has done but she said none of that although she was positively itching to flay him she said i need a ride just now ive got to youre needed here kerra glanced at alan he was watching her surprisingly he indicated by cocking his head in the direction of the road that she should ride no matter her fathers desires although she didnt want to be she was grateful for this display of understanding alan was in this at least fully on her side does she need something from me kerra asked her father he looked behind him up at the windows of the familys flat the curtains of the master bedroom were blocking out the daylight behind them dellen was coping in her dellen way on the crushed spines of her near relations shes in black kerras father said thatll doubtless be a large disappointment to any number of people kerra replied ben kerne looked at her with eyes so anguished that for a moment kerra regretted her words not his fault came to her but at the same time there were things that were her fathers fault not the least of which was that they were even talking about her mother and in doing so that they were reduced to using a carefully chosen set of words like semaphores and they two distant communicators with a secret language all their own she sighed an aggrieved party unwilling to apologise that he too was aggrieved could not be allowed to count she said do you what need something from me because she doesnt shell be wanting you and no doubt vice versa ben made no reply he went back into the hotel without another word shouldering past alan who looked rather like a man trying to decipher the dead sea scrolls alan said a little harsh that kerra dont you think the last thing kerra wanted to show alan was gratitude for his previous understanding so she welcomed the criticism she said if youve decided to remain at work here you need to become a little more familiar with the mechanism of your employment okay like her father he looked struck she was happy he felt the sting of her words he said ive got it that youre angry but what i havent got is why not the anger part of it but the afraid part of it thats fueling the anger i cant suss that one ive tried i spent most of last night awake trying poor you she said kerra none of this is like you whatre you frightened about nothing she said im not frightened at all youre trying to talk about subjects you dont understand then help me understand not my job she said i warned you off you warned me off working here thisyou whats happening with you and what happened to santoisnt part of my employment she smiled briefly stay round then if you havent already youre soon to find out whats part and parcel of your employment now if youll excuse me i want a ride i doubt youll still be here when i return are you coming over tonight she raised her eyebrows i think that part might be finished between us what are you saying somethings happened since yesterday beyond santo somethings happened oh i do know that she mounted her bike gearing it to take the rise of the driveway heading into town she coursed along the southeast edge of st mevan down where unmowed grass bent heavily with a weight of raindrops and a few dogs romped grateful for a respite in the rain she too was grateful and she decided shed head roughly in the direction of polcare cove she told herself she had no intention of going to the place where santo had died but if she ended up there by chance she would consider it meant to be she wouldnt pay attention to the route she would merely blast along the lanes as fast as she could turning when she felt like turning continuing straight on when she fancied that she knew she needed a source of energy to do the sort of ride she had in mind however so when she saw casvelyn of cornwall countys number one pasty to the right on the corner of burn view lane she coasted over to the bakery a large operation that supplied pasties up and down the coast to restaurants shops pubs and smaller bakeries unable to bake their own the business comprised an industrialsize kitchen in the back and a shop in the front with ten bakers working in one area and two shop assistants in the other kerra leaned her bike against the front window a stunning monument to pasties bread loaves pastry and scones she ducked inside deciding in advance that she would have a steakandbeer pasty and shed eat it on her way out of town at the counter she placed her order with a girl whose impressive thighs looked like the result of their owner having sampled the products far too often the requested pasty was being bagged and rung up at the till when the other shop assistant emerged with a tray of fresh goods to go into the display case kerra looked up as the kitchen door swung closed at the same moment as her glance fell on the girl with the tray that girls glance fell upon kerra her steps faltered she stood expressionless with the tray extended in front of her madlyn kerra said it came to her much later how stupid she sounded i didnt know that you worked here madlyn angarrack went to one of the display cases and opened it sliding fresh pasties from the tray she held she said to the other girl who was in the process of bagging kerras purchase what sort is that shar her voice was curt steak and beer kerra was the one to answer and then madlyn i was asking cadan about you only twenty minutes ago how longve you been give her one of these shar theyre fresher shar looked from madlyn to kerra as if taking a reading off the tension in the air and wondering from which direction it was flowing but she did as she was told kerra took her pasty over to where madlyn was lining up display trays neatly she said to her when did you start working here madlyn glanced her way why dyou want to know she shut the lid of the display case with a decisive snap would that make some sort of difference to you she used the back of her wrist to move some hair from her face it was shorther hairquite dark and curly at this time of year the copper that streaked it from exposure to the summer sun was missing it came to kerra how remarkably like cadan his sister looked the same colour of hair that was thick with curls the same olive skin the same dark eyes the same shape of face the angarracks were thus nothing like the kerne siblings physically as well as in every other way kerra and santo had been nothing alike the sudden thought of santo made kerra blink hard she didnt want him there not in her mind and definitely not near her heart madlyn seemed to take this as a reaction to her question and to its inimical tone because she went on to say i heard about santo im sorry he fell yet it seemed pro forma too much an obligation performed because of this kerra said more brutally than she otherwise would have done he didnt fall he was murdered the police have been to tell us a little while ago they didnt know at first when he was found they couldnt tell madlyns mouth opened as if she would speak her lips clearly forming the first part of murdered but she did not say it instead she said why because they had to look at his climbing kit didnt they under their microscopes or whatever i expect you can figure out the rest i mean why would someone murder santo i find it hard to believe you of all people would even ask that question are you saying madlyn balanced the empty tray vertically against her hip we were friends kerra i think you were a lot more than friends im not talking about santo im talking about you and me we were friends close friends you might say best friends so how you can think that id ever you ended our friendship i started seeing your brother that was all i did full stop yes well and you defined everything after that no one sees my brother and remains my friend that was your position only you didnt even say that much did you you just made the cut with your rusty scissors and that was it no more friendship when someone does something you dont want them to do it was for your own good oh really what getting cut off from someonegetting cut off from a sister because thats what you were to me all right a sister you could have kerra didnt know how to go on she also couldnt see how theyd come to this shed wanted to talk to madlyn it was true that was why shed earlier gone to cadan about his sister but the conversation shed been having with madlyn angarrack in her brain had not resembled the conversation she was having with madlyn angarrack now that mental conversation had not taken place in the presence of a second shop assistant who was attending their colloquy with the sort of rabid spectators interest that precedes a girl fight at a secondary school kerra said quietly its not as if i didnt warn you of what of what it would be like for you if you and my brother kerra glanced at shar there was a glitter to her eyes that was discomfiting you know what im talking about i told you what he was like but what you didnt tell me was what you were like what you are like mean and vindictive look at you kerra have you even cried your own brother dead and here you are right as could be going about on your bike without a care in the world you seem to be coping well enough yourself kerra pointed out at least i didnt want him to die didnt you whyre you here what happened to the farm i quit the farm all right her face had gone red her grip on the tray shed brought with her from the kitchen had become so tight that her knuckles were white as she went on are you happy now kerra have you learned what you wanted to know i sorted out the truth and do you want to know how i did that kerra he claimed that hed always be honest with me of course but when it came to thisoh get out of here get out she raised the tray as if to throw it hey mad shar spoke uneasily doubtless kerra thought the other girl had never seen the rage of which madlyn angarrack was fully capable doubtless shar had never opened a postal package and discovered within it pictures of herself with her head cut off pictures of herself with her eyeballs stabbed by the lead of a pencil handwritten notes and two birthday cards once saved but now smeared with faeces a newspaper article about the head of instructors at adventures unlimited with bollocks and shit written in red pencil across it no return address but none had been needed nor had been any other sort of message when the intentions of the sender were so clearly illustrated by the contents of the envelope in which theyd come this quality in her former friend comprised another reason that kerra had wanted to talk to madlyn angarrack kerra might have hated her brother but she also loved him it wasnt a matter of blood being thicker but it was still and always a matter of blood chapter eight i know this isnt a good time to talk about it alan cheston said theres not going to be a good time to talk about anything for a long while to come and i think we both know that the thing is thoughthese guys have a diary to fill and if were going to commit we need to let them know or were going to lose out ben kerne nodded numbly he couldnt imagine conversing rationally about any subject let alone about business all he could imagine was a further walking of the corridors inside the promontory king george hotel one shoulder against the wall and his head aimed down to study the floor down one corridor and up another through a fire door and up the stairs to begin another corridor on and on spectrallike into infinity occasionally thinking about how much they had spent on the old hotels transformation and wondering what the purpose might be in spending any more wondering what the purpose might be in anything at this point and then trying to stop thinking altogether hed done all that on the previous night dellen had pills but he would not take them ben looked at alan he saw him through a fog as if a veil existed between his eyeballs and his brain he could take in the younger man but he had no ability to process what he was taking in so he said go on i understand although he didnt want the first and didnt mean the second they were in the marketing office a small former conference room that opened off the erstwhile reception area it had likely been used for staff meetings when the hotel was in operation an ancient blackboard still hung on the wall stained with ghostly copperplate undoubtedly the work of a manager stirring his troops to action if the excessive underlining was anything to go by beneath this writing surface and encircling the room the walls were covered with gouged wainscoting above it faded wallpaper featuring hunting scenes the kernes had determined to leave all this as it was when theyd taken over the hotel no one would see it but themselves theyd decided and the money could be more profitably spent elsewhere which was the purpose of this meeting with alan ben tuned in to what the young man was talking about and heard must consider the cost as an investment towards returns additionally its a onetime cost but not a onetime use of the product so wed amortise what we spent producing it if were careful to avoid a look that will date the piece well be fine you know what i mean keep away from shots of vehicles avoid sites likely to demonstrate anachronicity in five years and use sites likely to demonstrate their history that sort of thing here this sample came the other day ive already shown dellen but she probablywell understandably she probably wont have mentioned it to you alan rose from the conference tablea pitted and scratched pine affair with countless burns from forgotten cigarettesand went to the video player he had coloured in a febrile manner as he spoke and not for the first time ben speculated about his daughters relationship with this man he reckoned he knew the reason behind kerras choice of alan and he was fairly certain she was wrong about him in more ways than one he and alan were having their regular meeting about marketing strategies ben hadnt possessed the will to cancel it he sat in mute attendance now considering which of them was the more heartless bastard alan for ostensibly carrying on as if nothing had happened or himself for being present dellen was meant to be in attendance as she too worked in marketing but shed not risen from bed on the video monitor a promotional film began it featured a resort in the scilly isles a highend hotel and spa with golf course attached it wouldnt attract the same sort of clientele as adventures unlimited but that wasnt the point of alans showing it to him a suave voiceover provided the commentary a sales pitch for the resort while the voice recited the expected panegyric the accompanying film featured shots of the hotel sitting atop white sands spa goers basking under the ministrations of lithesome and tanned masseuses golfers whacking away at balls diners on terraces and in candlelit rooms this was alan said the type of film one showed at travel venues they could do that as well but with a much broader base of appeal this then was what alan was after bens permission to pursue yet another way to market adventures unlimited as youve mentioned weve got bookings coming in alan said once the film had finished which is brilliant ben that piece the mail on sunday printed on you and what youre doing with this place helped enormously as a promotional vehicle but its time we looked at the potential we have for a larger market he ticked items off on his fingers families with children from six to sixteen independent schools with programmes taking pupils for weeklong maturing courses singles looking to meet life mates mature travelers in good condition who dont want to while away their golden years rocking on a veranda somewhere then there are drugrehab programmes early release programmes for young offenders innercity youth programmes weve an expansive market out there and i mean to see us tap into it alans face was shiny his ears were red and his eyes were bright enthusiasm and hope ben thought either that or nerves he said to alan youve got big plans i hope thats why you took me on ben what you have herethis place its location your ideas for it with an investment in areas likely to be fruitful youre looking at the goose and gold eggs i swear it alan seemed to study him then just as ben had himself studied alan he ejected the video from the machine and handed it over putting a hand on bens shoulder momentarily watch it again with dellen when youre both up to it he said weve no need to make a decision today butsoon though bens fingers closed round the plastic case he felt its little ridges press against his skin he said youre doing a good job organising the mail on sunday piecethat was brilliant i wanted you to see what i could do alan told him im grateful you took me on otherwise id probably have been forced to live in truro or exeter which i wouldnt much like much larger places than casvelyn though too large for me if kerras not there alan gave a laugh which sounded embarrassed she didnt want me to come on staff here you know she said it wouldnt work out but i mean to show her otherwise this placehe extended his arms to take in the hotel as a wholethis place fills me with ideas all i need is someone to listen and okay them when the time is right i mean have you thought about everything the hotel can actually be in the offseason its got room for conferences and with a little tweaking of the promotional film ben tuned out not because he wasnt interested but because of the painful contrast to santo that alan cheston was presenting here was the zeal ben had hoped for in santo a wholehearted embracing of what would have been santos inheritance and that of his sister but santo hadnt seen things that way hed hungered for experiencing life instead of for building life that was how he and his father had differed true hed been only eighteen years old and with maturity might have come interest and commitment but if the past was the best indicator of the future didnt it stand to reason that santo would have continued to engage in more of what had already begun to define him as a man charm and pursuit charm and pleasure charm and enthusiasm for what enthusiasm could gain him and not what enthusiasm could produce ben wondered if alan had seen all this when hed asked for employment at adventures unlimited for alan had known santo had spoken to him had seen him had watched him thus alan had known a gap was present hed assessed this gap and had deemed himself the man to fill it alan was saying so if we combine our assets and present a plan to the bank when ben interrupted our having broken into his thoughts like a sharp rap on the door of his consciousness do you know where santo kept his climbing kit alan alan stopped dead in his verbal tracks he looked at ben in some apparent confusion it was feigned it was not feigned ben couldnt tell alan said what and when ben repeated the question alan appeared to think about his reply before making it i expect he kept it in his bedroom ben didnt he or perhaps wherever you keep yours do you know where mine is why would i know alan went about putting away the video recorder a silence hung between them in it a car drove up outside and alan walked to the window as he said unless but his answer was lost as two doors slammed on the other side of the window police alan said its that constable again the one who came earlier hes got some woman with him this time ben left the conference room at once and went to the entry as the front door opened and constable mcnulty came inside he was preceded by a toughlooking woman with sid vicious hair dyed a shade of red that bordered on purple she wasnt young but she wasnt old she looked at him directly but not without compassion mr kerne she said and went on to introduce herself as detective inspector hannaford she was there to interview the family she told him all of the family ben wanted to know because his wife was in bed and his daughter was off on a bicycle ride he felt this last made kerra sound heartless so he added stress when she feels pressure she needs an outlet and then he felt hed said too much they would get to the daughter later hannaford told him in the meantime they would wait while he roused his wife this was preliminary stuff she added they would not take up too much of his time just now just now meant there would be a later with the police what was implied was generally more important than what was said where are you with the investigation he asked this is the first step mr kerne aside from forensics theyre beginning with fingerprints his equipment his car the contents of his car theyll move on from there youand with a gesture that took in the hotel and obviously meant everyone within itwill need to be fingerprinted but for the moment its questions so if youll fetch your wife there was nothing for it but to do as she requested anything else and hed look uncooperative so dellens state couldnt be allowed to matter ben went up the stairs instead of taking the lift he wanted to use the climb to think there was so much he didnt want the police to know consisting of matters both buried and private at their bedroom ben knocked on the door softly but he didnt wait to hear his wifes voice he went into the darkness and moved towards the bed where he switched on a lamp dellen lay as shed lain when hed last seen her she was supine one arm crooked across her eyes next to her on the bedside table were two bottles of pills and a glass of water the glasss rim bore a crescent of red lipstick he sat down on the edge of the bed but she didnt alter her position although her lips moved convulsively so he knew she wasnt asleep he said the police have come they want to talk to us youll have to come down her head moved fractionally i cant you must i cant let them see me like this you know that dellen she lowered her arm she squinted in the light and turned her head away from it and from him i cant and you know it she said again unless you want them to see me like this is that it how can you say that dell he put his hand on her shoulder he felt the answering tension run through her body unless she said again and she turned her head towards him you want them to see me like this because we know you prefer me this way dont you you love me this way you want me this way i could almost think you arranged santos death just to send me in this direction its so useful to you yes ben rose abruptly he swung round so that she might not see his face she said at once im sorry oh god ben i dont know what im saying why dont you leave me i know you want to youve wanted to forever you wear our marriage like a hair shirt why he said please dell but he didnt know what he was asking her for he wiped his nose on the arm of his shirt and went back to her let me help you theyre not going to leave till theyve spoken to us he didnt add what he also might have told her that the police were likely going to come back later to talk to kerra and they could as well talk to dellen then that he determined could not be allowed to happen he needed to be there when they spoke to dellen and if the investigators came back later there was always a chance theyd catch dellen alone he went to the wardrobe and pulled clothes out for her black trousers black jersey black sandals for her feet he sorted out underwear and carried everything back to the bed let me help you he said it had been the imperative of their years together he lived to serve her she lived to be served he drew the blankets and sheet away from her body beneath them she was nude and her scent was rank and he looked on her with no stirring of lust no longer the form of the fifteenyearold girl hed rolled with in the maram grass between the dunes her body expressed the loathing that her voice wouldnt speak she was pitted and stretched she was dyed and painted she was simultaneously barely real and all too corporeal she was the pastembroilment and estrangementmade flesh he put his arm beneath her shoulders and he raised her shed begun to weep it was a silent crying ugly to watch it stretched her mouth it reddened her nose it slit her eyes she said you want to so do it im not holding you here ive never held you he murmured shhh now put this on and he slid arms through the straps of her bra she was no help to him despite his encouragement he was forced to cup her heavy breasts in his hands and fit the bra around them before he hooked it in the back thus he dressed her and when he had her in her clothing he urged her to her feet and she finally came to life she said again i cant let them see me like this but her tone was different this time she went to her dressing table and from among its clutter of cosmetics and costume jewellery she brought forth a brush this she vigorously ran through her long blonde hair till she had it untangled and fashioned into a passable chignon she switched on a little brass lamp that hed given her on a long ago christmas and she bent to the mirror to examine her face she used powder and a bit of mascara and then she rustled among the lipsticks to find the one she wanted which she applied all right she said and she turned to him head to toe in black but her lips were red they were as red as a rose might be they were as red as blood indeed was in conducting the preliminaries of the investigation with the assistance of constable mcnulty and sergeant collins bea hannaford learned soon enough that she had as helpmates the indisputable police equivalents of stan laurel and oliver hardy this realisation had abruptly descended upon her when constable mcnulty informed herwith a suitably lachrymose expression on his facethat hed given the family the information about santo kernes death likely being a murder while this in itself could not be called execrable police work having gone on blithely to share with the kernes the facts about the dead boys climbing equipment definitely was bea had stared at mcnulty disbelieving at first then shed understood that he was not misspeaking that he had actually disclosed vital particulars of a police investigation to individuals who very well might be suspects shed exploded first shed wanted to strangle him second exactly what do you do all day shed enquired third in a nasty tone toss off in public lavatories because my man you are the most wretched excuse for a police officer ive yet to meet are you aware that now we have nothing known only by ourselves and the killer do you understand the position that puts us in after that shed told him to come with her and keep his mouth shut unless and until she told him he had permission to speak hed shown good sense in this at least from the moment theyd arrived at the promontory king george hotela crumbling heap of derelict art deco that needed to be pulled down in beas opinionconstable mcnulty had uttered not a word hed even taken notes never once looking up from his pad as she spoke to alan cheston while they waited for the return of ben kerne one hoped with his wife in tow cheston was not a niggard with details he was twentyfive he was putatively the partner of the kerne daughter hed grown up in cambridge as the only child of a retired physicist thats mum he explained with no little pride and a retired university librarian thats dad he added unnecessarily hed studied at trinity hall gone on to the london school of economics and worked in marketing in a birmingham redevelopment corporation until his parents retirement to casvelyn at which point he moved to cornwall to be close to them in their latter years he owned a terrace house in lansdown road that was being renovated making it suitable for the wife and family he hoped for so in the meantime he was living in a bedsit at the far end of breakwater road well not exactly a bedsit he added after watching constable mcnultys industrious scribbling for a moment its rather a room in that housethe large pink cottageat the end of the road opposite the canal ive kitchen privileges andwell the landladys quite liberal with how i use the rest of the house by which bea assumed he meant that the landlady had modern ideas by which she assumed he meant that he and the kerne daughter bonked there with impunity kerra and i intend to marry he added as if this fine detail might smooth the troubled waters of what he mistakenly saw as beas ostensible concern for the young womans virtue ah how nice and santo she asked him what sort of relationship did you have with him terrific lad was alans reply he was hard not to like he was no great intellectual mind you but he had a happiness about him a playfulness he was infectious and from what i could see people liked to be around him people in general joie de vivre bea thought she pressed on and what about you in particular did you like to be around him we didnt spend much time together im kerras partner so santo and iwe were more like inlaws i suppose cordial and friendly in conversation but not anything else we didnt have the same interests he was very physical im morecerebral which makes you better suited to run a business i expect bea noted yes of course like this business for example the young man was no idiot he unlike the stan and ollie she was saddled with could tell a hawk from a handsaw no matter the direction of the wind he said actually santo was a bit relieved when he knew i was going to work here it took an unwanted pressure off him what sort of pressure hed have had to work with his mum in this part of the business and he didnt want to at least thats what he led me to believe he said he wasnt suited for this end of the operation but you dont mind it working this end of things working with her not at all when he said this last bit he kept his eyes well fixed on beas and his entire body motionless that alone made her wonder about the nature of his lie she said id like to look at santos climbing kit if youll point out where i can find it mr cheston sorry thing is i dont actually know where he kept it she had to wonder about that as well hed answered rather promptly hadnt he as if hed been expecting the question she was about to press him further on this topic when he said heres ben with dellen into the sound of the old cagelike lift descending she told the young man theyd speak again no doubt he said absolutely whenever the inspector wished he returned to his office before the lift reached the ground floor and disgorged the kernes ben came out first and extended his hand to assist his wife she emerged slowly looking rather like a somnambulist drugs bea thought shed be sedated which was hardly unexpected in the mother of a dead child the rest of her appearance however was unexpected the polite term for it would have been faded beauty somewhere in her midforties she suffered from the voluptuous womans curse the luscious curves of her youth having given way to the spread and the sag of advancing middle age shed been a smoker as well and perhaps she still was for her skin was heavily webbed round the eyes and creviced round the lips she wasnt fat but she lacked the toned body that her husband possessed too little exercise and too much indulgence bea concluded and yet the woman had a way about her pedicured feet manicured hands sumptuous blond hair with a pleasing sheen large violet eyes with thick dark lashes and a manner of movement that asked for aid troubadours would have called her a damsel bea called her big trouble and waited to find out why mrs kerne she said thank you for joining us and then to ben kerne is there somewhere we could talk this shouldnt take overly long the last bit was typical police casuistry it would take however long it took for bea to be satisfied ben kerne said they could go up to the hotels first floor the residents lounge was there theyd be comfortable they were the room overlooked st mevan beach and it was fitted out with plush but durable new sofas a largescreen television a dvd player a stereo a pool table and a kitchenette this last feature possessed teamaking facilities and a shiny stainlesssteel cappuccino machine the walls displayed vintage posters of athletic scenes from the s and s skiers hikers cyclists swimmers and tennis players it was well thought out and nicely done a lot of money had gone into it bea wondered where the money for such a project had come from and she was not shy about asking rather than reply however ben kerne asked if the police wanted something from the cappuccino machine bea demurred for both of them before constable mcnultywhod raised his head from his pad with what she considered precipitate enthusiasmcould accept kerne went to the machine anyway saying if you dont mind and going on to make some sort of concoction which he pressed upon his wife she took it from him with no enthusiasm he asked her to have a bit of it and he sounded solicitous dellen said she didnt want it but ben was obdurate you must he told her they looked at each other and seemed to engage in a battle of wills dellen was the one to blink she raised the cup to her lips and didnt lower it till shed drunk it all leaving a disturbing smear of red where her lips had touched the stoneware bea asked them how long theyd been in casvelyn and ben told her theyd arrived two years earlier theyd come from truro he said and he went on to explain that hed owned two sporting goods shops in that town which hed soldalong with the family housein order to finance if only partially the project of setting up adventures unlimited further money had come from the bank naturally one did not take on a venture like this without more than one source of financing they were due to open in midjune he said at least they had been due to open nowhe didnt know bea let that go for the moment she said grow up in truro did you mr kerne were you and your wife childhood sweethearts he hesitated at this for some reason he looked to dellen as if considering how best to phrase his answer bea wondered which of the questions was giving him pause the growing up in truro part or the childhood sweethearts part not in truro no he finally answered but as to being childhood sweethearts he looked at his wife again and there was no doubt that his expression was fond weve been together more or less since we were teenagers sixteen and fifteen wasnt it dell he didnt wait for his wife to reply we were like most kids though together for a bit broken up for a bit then forgiveness and getting back together we did that for six or seven years before we got married didnt we dell dellen said i dont know ive forgotten all that she had a husky voice a smokers voice it suited her anything else would have been wildly out of character have you he turned from her to bea it seemed to go on forever the drama of our teenage years as these things do when you care for someone what sort of drama bea asked as next to her constable mcnulty kept up a gratifying scribbling against his pad i slept around dellen said bluntly dell shell likely find out the truth so we may as well tell it dellen said i was the village tart inspector and then to her husband cn you make me another coffee ben and hotter if you will the last was rather lukewarm bens face had altered to granite as shed spoken after a fractional hestitation he rose from the sofa where hed placed himself and his wife and he went back to the cappuccino maker bea let the silence continue and when constable mcnulty cleared his throat as if to speak she knocked her foot against his to keep him quiet she liked tension during an interview especially if one of the suspects was inadvertently providing it to the other dellen finally spoke again but she looked at ben as if what she said comprised a hidden message for him we lived down the coast ben and i but not in a place like newquay where therere at least a few diversions we were from a village where there was nothing to do besides the beach in summer and sex in winter and sometimes sex in summer as well if the weather wasnt good enough for the beach we ran in packs thena gang of kidsand we mixed it up with each other pairing off this way for a bit pairing off that way for a bit till we got to truro that is ben went first and iclever girlfollowed him directly and that made all the difference things changed for us in truro ben returned with her drink he also brought with him a packet of cigarettes that hed taken from somewhere in the kitchenette and he lit one for her and handed it over he sat next to her quite close dellen downed the second coffee much as shed done the first as if her mouth were lined with asbestos she took the cigarette from him and drew in on it expertly doing what bea always thought of as that doubleinhaling bit drawing smoke in letting a bit out drawing it all back in again dellen kerne made the act look unique bea tried to get a bead on the woman dellens hands were unsteady bright lights big city she asked the kernes is that what took you to truro hardly dellen said ben had an uncle who took him in when he was eighteen he kept rowing with his dad over me dad thoughtthis is bens not minethat if he got him out of the village hed get him out of my hair as well or get me out of his he didnt reckon id follow did he ben ben covered her hand with his she was saying too much and all of them knew it but only ben and his wife knew why she was doing it bea considered what all this had to do with santo as ben endeavoured to wrest control of the conversation from dellen by saying thats a reinvention of history truth of the matterand this he said directly to beais that my dad and i never got on very well his dream was to live entirely off the land and after eighteen years of that id had enough i made arrangements to live with my uncle i took off for truro dellen followed me ini dont knowwhat was it eight months seemed like eight centuries dellen said for my sins i knew a good thing when i saw it for my sins i still do she kept her gaze on ben kerne as she said to bea ive a wonderful husband whose patience ive tried for many years inspector hannaford could i have another coffee ben ben said are you sure thats wise but make it hotter still please i dont think that machine is working very well and it came to bea that that was it the coffee and what the coffee stood for she hadnt wanted it and hed insisted coffee as metaphor and dellen kerne was rubbing his face in it she said id like to see your sons room if i may as soon as youve finished with your coffee of course daidre trahair was walking back towards polcare cove along the cliff top when she saw him a brisk wind was blowing and shed just stopped to refasten her hair in its tortoiseshell slide shed managed to capture most of it and shed shoved the rest of it behind her ears and there he was perhaps one hundred yards to the south of her hed obviously just climbed from the cove so her first thought was that he was on his way again resuming his walk having been released from all suspicion by detective inspector hannaford she concluded that this release was reasonable enough as soon as hed said he was from new scotland yard hed probably been absolved from suspicion if only she herself had been half so clever except she had to be truthful at least with herself thomas lynley had never told them he was from new scotland yard had he it had been something assumed last night by the other two the moment hed said his name hed said thomas lynley theyd saidone of them and she couldnt remember which one it had beennew scotland yard in such a way that seemed to speak volumes among them hed said something to indicate they were correct in their assumption and that had been it she knew why now for if he was thomas lynley of new scotland yard then he was also thomas lynley whose wife had been murdered in the street in front of their belgravia house every cop in the country would know about that the police were after all a brotherhood of sorts this meant daidre knew that all cops everywhere in the country were connected she needed to remember that and she needed to be careful round him no matter his pain and her inclination to assuage it everyone had pain she told herself life was all about learning to cope with it he raised an arm to wave she waved in turn they walked towards each other across the top of the cliff the path here was narrow and unevenwith shards of carboniferous stone tipping up from the soiland along its east side gorse rustled thickly a yellow intrusion standing hardily against the wind beyond the gorse grass grew abundantly although it was closely cropped by the sheep that grazed freely upon it when they were close enough to be heard by each other daidre said to thomas lynley so youre on your way then but as soon as she spoke she realised this was not the case and she went on to add except youve not got your rucksack with you so you arent on your way at all he nodded solemnly youd make a good detective a decidedly elementary deduction im afraid anything more would escape my notice are you out for a walk i was looking for you as it had done to hers the wind tossed his hair and he brushed it away from his forehead again she thought how like hers it was she assumed that he went quite blond in summer for me she asked how did you know where to find me beyond knocking at the door of the cottage i mean because i hope i can presume you did knock this time i dont have many more windows to offer up to you i knocked he said when no one answered i had a look round and saw the fresh footprints i followed them it was simple enough and here i am she said and here you are he smiled and seemed to hesitate for some reason which surprised daidre as he didnt seem the type of man whod hesitate at anything she said and and cocked her head he had she noted a scar on his upper lip that relieved his otherwise offputting appearance which was handsome in that classical sense he had strong features that were well defined no indication of inbreeding here ive come to ask you to dinner he said im afraid i can only offer you the salthouse inn as ive no funds of my own yet and i can hardly invite you for a meal and ask you to pay for it can i but at the inn theyll put our meal on the books and as breakfast was excellentwell at least it was fillingi suspect dinner will be adequate as well what a dubious invitation she said he seemed to think about it dyou mean the adequate part yes join me for an adequate albeit farfromsumptuous meal its one of those gallant postvictorian requests one can only respond to with thank you i think he laughed sorry my mother would roll in her grave were she dead which she isnt let me say then that ive had a look at tonights menu and it appearsif not brilliant then at least swell she laughed in turn swell where on earth did that come from never mind dont tell me have a meal here instead ive something already prepared and theres enough for two it only wants baking but then ill be doubly in your debt which is exactly where i want you my lord his face altered all amusement drained away by her slip of the tongue she cursed herself for her lapse in circumspection and what it presaged about her ability to keep other things to herself in his presence he said ah so you know she sought an explanation and decided one existed that would be reasonable even to him when you said last night that you were scotland yard i wanted to know if that was the case so i set about finding out she looked away from him for a moment she saw that the herring gulls were settling in on the nearby cliff face for the night pairing off onto ledges and into crevices ruffling their wings huddling against the wind im terribly sorry thomas she said after a moment during which more gulls landed and others soared and cawed he said youve no need to apologise i would have done the same in your situation a stranger in your house claiming to be a policeman someone dead outside what are you to believe thats not what i meant she looked back at him he was into the wind she was against it it played havoc with her hair whipping it into her face despite the slide then what he said your wife she told him im so terribly sorry about what happened to her what a wrenching thing for you to have to go through ah he said yes he moved his gaze to the seabirds he would see them daidre knew as she saw them pairing off not because there was safety in numbers but because there was safety in just one other gull it was far more wrenching for her than for me he said no daidre said i dont believe that dont you well theres little more wrenching than death by gunshot i daresay especially when death is not immediate i didnt have to go through that helen did she was there one moment just trying to get her shopping in the front door she was shot the next that would be rather wrenching wouldnt you say he sounded bleak and he didnt look at her as he spoke but hed misunderstood her meaning and daidre sought to clarify it i believe that death is the end of this part of our existence thomas the spiritual beings human experience the spirit leaves the body and then goes on to whats next and whats next has to be better than whats here or whats the point really do you actually believe that his tone walked the line between bitterness and incredulity heaven and hell and nonsense in a similar vein not heaven and hell that all seems rather silly doesnt it god or whoever up there on a throne casting this soul downward to eternal torment tossing this soul upward to sing hymns with the angels that cant be what thisher arm took in the cliff side and the seais all about but that theres something else beyond what we understand in this moment yes i do believe that so for youyoure still the spiritual being undergoing and attempting to understand the human experience while she now knows helen he said her name was helen helen yes forgive me helen she now knows what it was all about but theres little peace of mind in that for you i meanknowing that helens moved on it wasnt her choice he said is it ever thomas suicide he looked at her evenly she felt a chill thats not a choice thats a decision based upon the belief that there are no choices god a muscle moved in his jaw she so regretted her slip of the tongue a simple expressionmy lordhad reduced him to his wound these things take time she wanted to tell him such a cliché but so much truth within it she said to him thomas do you fancy a walk theres something id like to show you its a bit of a wayperhaps a mile up the coast along the path but itll give us something of an appetite for dinner she thought he might refuse but he did not he nodded and she gestured him to follow her they headed in the direction from which shed just come dipping down at first into another cove where great fins of slate shot out of the encroaching surf and reached towards a treacherous cliff top of sandstone and shale the wind and the waves made talking difficult as did their positionsone behind the otherso daidre said nothing nor did thomas lynley it was she decided better this way letting a moment pass without acknowledging it further was sometimes a more efficacious approach to healing than troubling a developing scar spring had brought wildflowers into areas more protected by the wind and along the way into combes the yellow of ragwort mixed with the pinks of thrift while bluebells still marked the spots where ancient forests had once stood there was scant habitation in the immediate environs of the cliffs when they ascended but in the distance stonebuilt farmhouses crouched alongside their greatersize barns and the cattle these served grazed in paddocks that were marked by cornwalls earthen hedgerows with their rich vegetation where dog rose and pennywort grew the nearest village was a place called alsperyl which was also their destination this comprised a church a vicarage a collection of cottages an ancient schoolhouse and a pub all fashioned from the unpainted stone of the district they sat some half mile to the east of the cliff path beyond a lumpy paddock only the church spire was visible daidre pointed this out and said st morwennas but were going this way just a bit farther if you can manage he nodded and she felt foolish with her final remark he was hardly infirm and grief did not rob one of the ability to walk she nodded in turn and led him perhaps another two hundred yards where a break in the windtossed heather on the seaside edge of the path gave way to steps hewn into stone she said its not much of a descent but have care the edge is still deadly and werei dont knowperhaps one hundred fifty feet above the water down a set of steps which curved with the natural form of the cliff side they came to another little path nearly overgrown with gorse and patches of english stonecrop that somehow thrived here despite the wind perhaps twenty yards along the path ended abruptly but not with a precipitous cliff edge as one might expect rather a small hut had been hewn into the cliff face it was fronted with the old driftwood of ruined ships and sidedwhere such sides emerged beyond the cliff face itselfwith small blocks of sandstone its wooden face was grey with age the hinges that served its rough dutch door bled rust onto pitted panels daidre glanced back at thomas lynley to see his reaction such a structure in such a remote location his eyes had widened and a smile crooked his mouth his expression seemed to say to her what is this place she replied to his unasked question speaking above the wind that buffeted them isnt it marvelous thomas its called hedras hut evidentlyif the journal of the reverend mr walcombe is to be believedits been here since the late eighteenth century did he build it mr walcombe no no he wasnt a builder but he was quite a chronicler he kept a journal of the doings round alsperyl i found it in the library in casvelyn he was the vicar of st morwennas fori dont knowforty years perhaps he tried to save the tormented soul who did build this place ah that would be the hedra from hedras hut then the very woman apparently she was widowed when her husbandwho fished the waters out of polcare covewas caught in a storm and drowned leaving her with one young son according to mr walcombewho does not generally embellish his factsthe boy disappeared one day likely having ventured too near the edge of the cliff in an area too friable to support his weight rather than confront the deaths of both husband and son within six months of each other poor hedra chose to believe a selkie had taken the boy she told herself hed wandered down to the watergod knows how he managed it from this heightand there the seal waited in her human form and beckoned him into the sea to join the rest of the she frowned blast ive quite forgotten what a group of seals is called it cant be a herd a pod but thats whales well no matter at the moment thats what happened hedra built this hut to watch for his return and thats what she did for the rest of her life its a poignant story isnt it is it true if we can believe mr walcombe come inside theres more to see lets get out of the wind the upper and lower doors closed by means of wooden bars that slid through rough wooden handles and rested on hooks as she pushed the top one back and then the bottom one and swung the doors open she said over her shoulder hedra knew what she was about she gave herself quite a sturdy place to wait for her son its framed in timber all round each side has a bench the roof has quite decent beams to hold it up and the floor is slate its as if she knew shed be waiting for a while isnt it she led the way in but then stopped short behind her she heard him duck under the low lintel to join her she said oh blast in disgust and he said now thats a shame the wall directly in front of them had been defaced and defaced recently if the freshness of the cuts into the wooden panels of the little building were anything to go by the remains of a heart which had been earlier carved into the woodno doubt accompanied by lovers initialscurved round a series of vicious hack marks that now gouged deeply as if into flesh no initials were left well daidre said trying to sound philosophical about the mess i suppose its not as if the walls havent already been carved up and at least it isnt spray paint but stillone wonderswhy do people do such things thomas was observing the rest of the hut with its more than two hundred years of carvings initials dates other hearts the occasional name he said thoughtfully where i went to school theres a wallits not too far from the entry actually so no visitor can ever miss itpupils have put their initials into it fori dont knowi expect theyve done it since the time of henry the sixth whenever i go backbecause i do go back occasionallyone doesi look for mine theyre still there they somehow say im real i existed then i exist even now but when i look at all the othersand there are hundreds probably thousands of themi cant help thinking how fleeting life is its the same thing here isnt it i suppose it is she ran her fingers over several of the older carvings a celtic cross the name daniel bj sr i like to come here to think she told him sometimes i wonder who were these people all coupled together so confidently and did their love last i wonder that as well for his part lynley touched the poor gouged heart nothing lasts he said thats our curse chapter nine bea hannaford saw much that seemed typical in santo kernes bedroom and for the first time she was glad to have constable mcnulty doing penance as her dogsbody for the walls of santos bedroom bore a plethora of surfing posters and from what bea could tell what mcnulty didnt know about surfing the locations of the photos and the surfers themselves didnt actually bear knowing she couldnt conclude that his knowledge was in any way relevant to anything however she was merely relieved that at the end of the day mcnulty did know something about something jaws he murmured obscurely gazing awestruck at a liquid mountain down which a thumbsize madman rushed bloody hell look at that bloke thats hamilton off maui hes dead mad hell do anything christ this looks like a tsunami doesnt it he whistled low and shook his head ben kerne was with them but he didnt venture into the room his wife had remained below in the lounge it had been obvious that kerne hadnt wanted to leave her on her own but hed been caught between the police and his spouse he couldnt accommodate one while attempting to monitor the other hed had little choice in the matter then they would either wander the hotel till they found santos bedroom as he saw to his wife or he would have to take them there hed chosen the latter but it was fairly clear that his mind was elsewhere so far weve heard nothing about santo and surfing bea said to ben kerne who stood in the doorway kerne said he started surfing when we first came to casvelyn is his surfing kit here board wet suit whatever else hood mcnulty murmured gloves boots extra fins thatll do constable bea told him sharply mr kerne probably gets the point no ben kerne said he kept his kit elsewhere did he why bea said not exactly convenient is it ben looked at the posters as he replied i expect he didnt like to keep it here why she repeated he likely suspected id do something with it ah constable bea was gratified to see that mick mcnulty took the hint and once more attended to his note taking although ben kerne couldnt say when asked where santo had indeed kept his gear bea said to him why would santo think you might do something with his kit mr kerne or do you mean to his kit and she thought if the surfing kit why not the cliffclimbing kit because he knew i didnt particularly want him to like surfing really it seems a harmless enough sport compared to cliff climbing no sport is completely harmless inspector but it wasnt that kerne seemed to be looking for a way to explain and he came into the bedroom to do so he observed the posters his face was stony bea said do you surf mr kerne i wouldnt prefer santo not surf if i did it myself now would i i dont know would you i still dont see why you approved of one sport but not another its the type all right kerne gave an apologetic glance to constable mcnulty i didnt like him mixing with surfers because for so many of them its their only world i didnt want him adopting it the hanging about they do waiting for the opportunity for a surf their lives defined by isobar charts and tide tables driving up and down the coast to find perfect waves and when theyre not having a surf theyre talking about it or smoking cannabis while they stand round in their wet suits afterwards still talking about it therere blokesand lasses as well i admit itwhose entire worlds revolve round riding waves and traveling the globe to ride more waves i didnt want that for santo would you want it for your son or daughter but if his world revolved round cliff climbing it didnt but at least its a sport where one depends upon others its not solitary the way surfing can be and generally is a surfer alone on the waves you see it all the time i didnt want him out there alone i wanted him to be with people so if something happened to him he moved his gaze back to the posters and what they depicted waseven to an unschooled observer like beaabsolute danger embodied in an unimaginable tonnage of water exposure to everything from broken bones to certain drowning she wondered how many people died each year coursing a nearly vertical declivity that unlike the earth with its knowable textures changed within seconds to trap the unwary she said yet santo was climbing alone when he fell just as he might have been had he gone for a surf and anyway surfers dont always do this alone do they on the wave itself the surfer and the wave alone there may be others out there but its not about them with climbing it is though you depend on the other climber and he depends on you you keep each other safe he cleared his throat roughly and added what father wouldnt want safety for his son and when santo didnt agree with your assessment of surfing what about it what happened between you arguments punishment do you tend towards violence mr kerne he faced her but in doing so he put his back to the window so she could no longer read his face he said what the hell sort of question is that one that wants answering santos eye was blackened by someone recently what dyou know about that his shoulders dropped he moved again but this time out of the light of the window and towards the other side of the room where a computer and its printer sat on a single plywood sheet across two sawhorses forming a primitive desk there was a stack of papers facedown on this desk ben kerne reached for them bea stopped him before his fingers made contact she repeated her question he wouldnt tell me kerne said obviously i could tell hed been punched it was a bad blow but he wouldnt explain it so i was left to think he shook his head he seemed to have information he was loath to part with bea said if you know somethingif you suspect something i dont its just thatthe young women liked santo and santo liked the young women he didnt discriminate between what between available and unavailable between attached and unattached santo washe was like pure mating instinct given human form perhaps an angry father punched him out or a furious boyfriend he wouldnt say but he liked the lasses and the lasses liked him and truth of the matter is that he was easily led where a determined young woman wanted him to go he wasim afraid he was always that way anyone in particular his last was a girl called madlyn angarrack theyd beenwhat do you call itan item for more than a year is she also a surfer by any chance bea asked a brilliant one if santo was to be believed national champion in the making he was quite taken with her and she with him it wasnt a oneway street how was it for you watching your son become involved with a surfer then ben kerne answered steadily santo was always involved somewhere inspector i knew it would pass whatever it was as i said he liked the ladies he wasnt ready to settle not with madlyn not with anyone no matter what bea thought that last was a strange expression she said you wanted him to settle though like any father i wanted him to keep his nose clean and stay out of trouble not overly ambitious for him then those are fairly limited as expectations go ben kerne said nothing bea had the impression he was keeping something to himself and it was her experience that in a murder enquiry when someone did that it was generally out of selfinterest she said did you ever beat santo mr kerne his gaze on her didnt waver ive answered that question already she let a silence hang there but this one lacked fecundity she was forced to move on she did so by giving her attention to santos computer they would have to take it with them she told kerne constable mcnulty would unhook it all and carry the components out to their car having said this she reached for the stack of papers that kerne had been going for on the desk she flipped them over and spread them out they were she saw a variation of designs that incorporated the words adventures unlimited into each of them in one the two words themselves formed into a curling wave in another they made a circular logo in which the promontory king george hotel stood centrally in a third they became the base upon which a variety of athletic feats were being accomplished by buffedout silhouettes both masculine and feminine in another they made a climbing apparatus heoh god bea looked up from the designs to see kernes stricken face what is it she asked he designed tshirts on his computer he wasobviously he was working on something for the business id not asked him to do it oh god santo he said the last like an apology in reaction bea asked him about his sons climbing equipment kerne told her that all of it was missing every belay device every chock stone every rope every item he would need for any climb he might make would he have needed all of it to make that climb yesterday no kerne told her he either began keeping it elsewhere without his fathers knowledge or hed taken it all on the previous day when he set off to make his fatal climb why bea asked wed had harsh words hed have reacted to them it would have been an ill show you sort of statement one that led to his death too much in a state to examine his kit closely was he the type to do that impulsive you mean impulsive enough to climb without looking over his equipment yes kerne said he was exactly the type to do that it was praise god or praise whomever one felt like praising when praise was called for the last radiator not the last radiator as in the last radiator of all radiators in the hotel but the last radiator as in the last radiator he would have to paint for the day given a half hour to clean the brushes and seal the paint tinsafter years of practise while working for his father cadan knew he could stretch out any activity as long as was necessaryit would be time to leave for the day hallefuckinglujah his lower back was throbbing and his head was reacting to the fumes once again clearly he wasnt meant for this type of labour well that was hardly a surprise cadan squatted back on his heels and admired his handiwork it was dead stupid of them to put down the fitted carpet before they had someone paint the radiators he thought but hed managed to get the most recent spill cleaned up with a bit of industrious rubbing and what hed not got up he reckoned the curtains would hide besides it had been his only serious spill of the day and that was saying something he declared we are out of here poohster the parrot adjusted his balance on cadans shoulder and replied with a squawk followed by loose bolts on the fridge call the cops call the cops yet another of his curious remarks the door to the room swung open as pooh flapped his wings preparatory either to making a descent to the floor or to performing a less than welcome bodily function on cadans shoulder cadan said dont you bloody dare mate and a female voice said in concerned reply who are you please whatre you doing here the speaker turned out to be a woman in black and cadan reckoned that she was santo kernes mother dellen he scrambled to his feet pooh said polly wants a shag polly wants a shag displaying not for the first time the level of inapposition to which he was capable of sinking at a moments notice what is that dellen kerne asked clearly in reference to the bird a parrot she looked annoyed i can see its a parrot she told him im not stupid or blind what sort of parrot and whats he doing here and whatre you doing here if it comes to that hes a mexican parrot cadan could feel himself getting hot but he knew the woman wouldnt twig his discomfiture as his olive skin didnt blush when blood suffused it his name is pooh as in winniethe as in what he does best a smile flickered round her lips why dont i know you whyve i not seen you here before cadan introduced himself benmr kerne hired me yesterday he probably forgot to tell you about me because of he saw the way he was headed too late to avoid heading there he quirked his mouth and wanted to disappear sinceaside from painting radiators and dreaming about what could be done to the crazy golf coursehis day had been spent in avoiding a runin precisely like this facetoface with one of santo kernes parents in a moment when the magnitude of their loss was going to have to be acknowledged with an appropriate expression of sympathy he said sorry about santo she looked at him evenly of course you are whatever that was supposed to mean cadan shifted on his feet he had a paintbrush still in his hand and he wondered suddenly and idiotically what he was meant to do with it or with the tin of paint theyd been brought to him and no one had said where to put them at the end of the workday hed not thought to ask did you know him dellen kerne said abruptly did you know santo a bit yeah and what did you think of him this was rocky ground cadan didnt know how to reply other than to say he bought a surfboard from my dad he didnt mention madlyn didnt want to mention madlyn and didnt want to think why he didnt want to mention madlyn i see yes but that doesnt actually answer the question does it dellen came farther into the room she went to the fitted clothes cupboard for some reason she opened it she looked inside she spoke oddly into the cupboards interior she said santo was a great deal like me you wouldnt know that if you didnt know him and you didnt know him did you not actually like i said a bit i saw him round more when he was first learning to surf than later on because you surf as well me no well i mean ive been of course but its not like its the onlyi mean ive got other interests she turned from the cupboard do you what are they sport i expect you look quite fit and women as well young men your age generally have women as one of their main interests are you like other young men she frowned can we open that window cadan the smell of paint cadan wanted to say it was her hotel so she could do whatever she wanted to do but he set down his paintbrush carefully went to the window and wrestled it open which wasnt easy it needed adjusting or greasing or something whatever one did to rejuvenate windows she said thank you im going to have a cigarette now do you smoke no thats a surprise you have the look of a smoker cadan knew he was meant to ask what the look of a smoker was and had she been somewhere between twenty and thirty years old he would have done so his attitude would have been that questions like that one of a potentially metaphoric nature could lead to interesting answers which in turn could lead to interesting developments but in this case he kept his mouth shut and when she said you wont be bothered if i smoke will you he shook his head he hoped she didnt expect him to light her cigarette for herbecause she did seem the sort of woman round whom men leapt like jackrabbitssince he had neither matches nor lighter with him she was correct in her assessment of him though he was a smoker but hed been cutting back recently inanely telling himself it was tobacco and not drink that was the real root of his problems he saw that shed brought a packet of cigarettes with her and she had matches as well tucked into the packet she lit up drew in and let smoke drift from her nostrils whose shits on fire pooh remarked cadan winced sorry hes heard that from my sister a million times he mimics her he mimics everyone anyway she hates smoking and then again sorry because he didnt want her to think he was being critical of her youre nervous dellen said im making you that way and the birds fine he doesnt know what hes saying after all yeah well sometimes though id swear he does like the remark about shagging he blinked what polly wants a shag she reminded him it was the first thing he said when i came into the room i dont actually want a shag that is but im curious why he said that i expect you use that bird to collect women is that why you brought him with you he goes most everywhere with me that cant be convenient we work things out do you she observed the bird but cadan had the feeling she wasnt really seeing pooh he couldnt have said what she was seeing but her next remarks gave him at least an idea santo and i were quite close are you close to your mother cadan no he didnt add that it was impossible to be close to wenna rice angarrack mccloud jackson smythe aka the bounder she had never remained stationary long enough for closeness to be anywhere in the deck of cards she played santo and i were quite close dellen said again we were very like sensualists do you know what that is she gave him no chance to answer not that he could have given her a definition anyway she said we live for sensation for what we can see and hear and smell for what we can taste for what we can touch and for what can touch us we experience life in all its richness without guilt and without fear thats what santo was like thats what i taught santo to be right cadan thought how hed like to get out of the room but he wasnt certain how to effect a departure that wouldnt look like running away he told himself there was no real reason to turn tail and disappear through the doorway but he had a feeling nearly animal in nature that danger was near dellen said to him what sort are you cadan can i touch your bird or will he bite he said he likes to be scratched on his head where youd put his ears if birds had ears i mean ears like ours because they can hear obviously like this she came close to cadan then he could smell her scent musk he thought she used the nail of her index finger which was painted red pooh accepted her ministrations as he normally did he purred like a cat yet another sound hed learned from a previous owner dellen smiled at the bird she said to cadan you didnt answer me what sort are you sensualist emotionalist intellectual not bloody likely he replied intellectual i mean im not intellectual ah are you emotional bundle of feelings raw to the touch inside i mean he shook his head then youre a sensualist like me like santo i thought as much you have that look about you i expect its something your girlfriend appreciates if you have one do you not just now pity youre quite attractive cadan what do you do for sex cadan felt ever more the need to escape yet she wasnt doing a single thing except petting the bird and talking to him still something was very off with the woman then it came to him at a gallop that her son was dead not only dead but murdered he was gone kaput given the chop whatever when a son diedor a daughter or a husbandwasnt the mother supposed to rip up her clothes tear at her hair shed tears by the bucketful she said because you must do something for sex cadan a young virile man like you you cant mean me to think you live like a celibate priest i wait for summer he finally told her her finger hesitated less than an inch from poohs green head the bird sidestepped to get back within its range for summer dellen said towns full of girls then here on holiday ah you prefer the shortterm relationship then sex without strings well he said yeah works for me that i expect it does you scratch them and they scratch you and everyones happy with the arrangement no questions asked i know exactly what you mean although i expect that surprises you a woman my age married with children knowing what it means he offered a half smile it was insincere just a way to acknowledge what she was saying without having to acknowledge what she was saying he gave a look in the direction of the doorway he said well and tried to make his tone decisive a way of saying thats that then nice talking to you she said why havent we met before this i just started no i understand that but i cant sort out why we havent met before youre roughly santos age four years older actually hes my and youre so like him as well so i cant sort out why youve never come round with him sisters age madlyn he said you probably know madlyn my sister she and santo werewell they were whatever you want to call it what dellen asked blankly what did you call her madlyn madlyn angarrack theyshe and santothey were together fori dont knoweighteen months two years whatever shes my sister madlyns my sister dellen stared at him then she stared past him but she appeared to be looking at nothing at all she said in a different voice altogether how very odd shes called madlyn you say yeah madlyn angarrack and she and santo werewhat exactly boyfriend and girlfriend partners lovers whatever youre joking he shook his head confused wondering why shed think he was joking they met when he came to get a board from my dad madlyn taught him to surf santo that is well obviously not my dad thats how they got to know each other and thenwell i spose you could say they started hanging about together and things went from there and you called her madlyn dellen asked yeah madlyn together for eighteen months eighteen months or so yeah thats it then why did i never meet her she said when di bea hannaford returned to the police station with constable mcnulty in tow it was to find that ray had managed to fulfill her wish for an incident room in casvelyn and that sergeant collins had set the room up with a degree of expertise that surprised her hed somehow managed to get the upperfloor conference room in order and now it was ready with china boards upon which pictures of santo kerne were posted both in death and in life and on which activities could be listed neatly there were also desks phones computers with holmes at the ready printers a filing cabinet and supplies the only thing the incident room didnt have was unfortunately the most vital part of any investigation the mcit officers the absence of a murder squad was going to leave bea in the unenviable position of having to conduct the investigation with mcnulty and collins alone until such a time as a murder squad got there since that squad should have arrived along with the contents of the incident room bea labeled the situation unacceptable it was also annoying because she knew very well that her former husband could get a murder squad from lands end to london in less than three hours if he was pressed to do so damn she muttered she told mcnulty to type up his notes officially and she went to a desk in the corner where she quickly discovered that having a phone within sight did not necessarily mean that it was connected to an actual telephone line she looked meaningfully at sergeant collins who said apologetically bt says another three hours theres no hookup up here so theyre sending someone over from bodmin to put one in we have to use mobiles or the phones downstairs till then do they know this is a murder enquiry they know he said but his tone suggested that murder or not bt also didnt much care bea said hell and took out her mobile she walked to a desk in the corner and punched in rays work number theres been something of a cockup was what she told him when she had him on the phone at last he said beatrice hullo youre welcome for the incident room am i having pete for the night again im not phoning about pete wherere the mcit blokes ah he said that well weve a bit of a problem he went on to lower the boom cant be done love theres no mcit available at the moment to be sent to casvelyn you can ring dorset or somerset and try to get one of theirs of course or i can do it for you in the meantime i do have a tag team i can send you a tag team she said a tag team ray this is a murder enquiry murder major crime requiring a major crime investigating team blood from a stone he returned theres not much more i can do i did try to suggest you maintain your incident room in are you punishing me dont be ridiculous youre the one who dont you dare go there this is professional i think ill have pete with me till youve got a result he said mildly youre going to be quite busy i dont want him staying on his own its not a good idea you dont want him stayingyou dont she was left speechless a reaction to ray so rare that its presence now left her even more speechless what remained was ending the conversation she should have done so with dignity but all she managed was to punch off the mobile and throw it onto the closest desk when it rang a moment later she thought her former husband was phoning to apologise or more likely to lecture her about police procedure about her propensity for myopic decision making about perpetually crossing the boundaries of what was allowed while expecting someone to run interference for her she snatched up the mobile and said what what it was the forensic lab however someone called duke clarence washoeand was that name bizarre enoughwhat in gods name had his parents been thinkingringing up with the fingerprint report got a real stew mum was how he broke the news to her guv she said or di hannaford not maam madam mum or anything suggesting you and i are related or ive got royal connections all right oh right sorry a pause he seemed to need a moment to adjust his approach weve got dabs from your vic all over the car victim bea said and she thought wearily about what american television had done to normal communications not vic victim or santo kerne if you prefer lets show a little respect mr washoe duke clarence he said you cn call me duke clarence that delights me no end she replied go on eleven other different sets of prints as well this is outside of the car inside weve got seven sets the victhe dead boys and six others who also left prints on the passenger door fascia window handles and glove box therere prints on the cd cases as well the boy and three others what about on the climbing equipment the only decent printsre on that tape wrapped round it but theyre santo kernes damn bea said theres a nice clear set on the boot of the car though fresh ones id guess but i dont know what good thatll do you none at all bea thought someone crossing the bloody road in town couldve touched the damn car in passing she would send forensics the prints gathered from everyone remotely connected to santo kerne but the truth was that identifying whose fingers left dabs on the boys car probably wasnt going to get them anywhere this was a disappointment let me know what else you turn up she told duke clarence washoe theres got to be something from that car we can use as to that weve got some hair caught up in the climbing equipment that might turn up something tissue attached she asked hopefully yes indeed keep it safe then carry on mr washoe you cn call me duke clarence he reminded her ah yes she said id forgotten that they rang off bea sat down at the desk she watched constable mcnulty across the room attempting to type up his notes and it came to her that he didnt actually know how to type he was hunting for every letter to tap upon with his index fingers with prodigious pauses between each tap she knew if she watched him for longer than thirty seconds she would scream so she rose and began to head out of the room sergeant collins met her at the door he said phones below she said fervently thank god where are they who bt bt theyve not arrived yet then what the phone youve a call downstairs its an officer from middlemore she finished that would be my former husband assistant chief constable hannaford head him off for me i need some time ray she decided had tried on her mobile and now he was trying to get through on the land line hed have built up a head of steam at this point she didnt particularly want to experience it she said tell him ive just set out to see to some business tell him to phone me back tomorrow or at home later she would give him that much its not acc hannaford collins said you said an officer someone called sir david what is it with people bea demanded ive just got off the phone with a duke clarence up in chepstow and now its sir david hillier hes called collins said sir david hillier assistant commissioner up at the met scotland yard bea asked now isnt that just what i need by the time his regular drinking hour at the salthouse inn had rolled round selevan penrule was in need of one he also was at least to his way of thinking deserving of one something strong from the sixteen men of tain or however the hell many there were having to cope with both his granddaughters pigheadedness and her mothers hysteria in a single day would have been too much for any bloke no wonder david had moved them all off to rhodesia or whatever it was called these days hed probably thought a good bout of heat cholera tb snakes and tsetse fliesor whatever they had in that godawful bloody climate of theirswould sort both of them out but it hadnt done so if tammys behaviour and sally joys voice on the phone were anything to go by is she eating properly sally joy had demanded from the bowels of africa where a decent connection on a telephone line was apparently something akin to the spontaneous transmogrification of tabby cat into twoheaded lion is she still praying father penrule shes has she gained any weight how much time is she on her knees what about the bible does she have a bible jaysus in a sandwich selevan thought sally joy made his bloody head swim he said i told you id watch over the girl thats what im doing s there anything else then oh im tedious im tedious but you dont understand what its like to have a daughter i had one myself didnt i four sons as well if youre interested i know i know but in tammys case you either leave her to me or i send her back woman that got through the last thing sally joy and david wanted was their daughter back in africa exposed to its hardships and believing that she could singlehandedly do something about them all right i know youre doing what you can and better than you did selevan thought but that was before hed caught tammy on her knees shed fashioned herself what he called a prayer benchshed referred to it as a preesomething but selevan was not one for fancy termsin her bitsy sleeping area in the caravan and hed thought at first she meant to hang her clothing from the back of it the way gents did with their suits in posh hotels but not long after breakfast when hed gone in search of her in order to drive her in to work hed found her kneeling in front of it with a book open on its narrow shelf and she was reading studiously this hed discovered too latethe readingbecause the first thing hed assumed was that the girl was at her god damn beads again and this despite the fact that hed already removed two sets of them from her belongings hed pounced and hauled her back by her shoulders saying well none of this nonsense and then had seen that she was merely reading it wasnt even a bible but it also wasnt much better she was soaking up some saints writing st teresa of avila she revealed grandie its just philosophy if its some saints scribbles its religious muck was what he told her as he snatched up the book filling your head with rubbish you are thats not fair she said and her eyes became moist theyd driven to casvelyn in silence afterwards with tammy turned away from him so all he could see was the curve of her stubborn little jaw and the sheenless fall of her hair shed sniffed and hed understood she was crying and hed felthe didnt know how he felt becauseand he cursed her parents soundly for sending her to himhe was trying to help the girl to bring her to whatever senses she had left to get her to see she was meant to be living her life and not spending it caught up in reading about the doings of saints and sinners he felt irritated with her then defiance he could deal with he could shout and be rough but tearshe said theyre lezzies you know the lot of them girl you got that dont you she said in a small voice dont be stupid and she cried a little harder he was reminded of nan his daughter a ride in the car and nan in this same position turned away from him its just exeter shed said its just a club dad and his reply well be having none of that nonsense while youre under my roof so dry your eyes or feel my palm and it wont be drying them for you had he really been so hard with the girl when all shed wanted to do was go clubbing with her mates but he had he had for clubbing with mates was how things started and where they ended was in disgrace all of that seemed so innocent now what had he been thinking in denying nan a few hours of pleasure because hed had none when he was her age the day passed slowly with selevans internal skies quite clouded he was more than ready for the salthouse inn by the time the appointed hour rumbled round for his embrace of the sixteen men of tain he was also ready for some conversation and this would be provided by his regular companion of the spirits who was waiting for him in the smoky inglenook of the salthouse inns public bar when he arrived late in the afternoon this was jago reeth and he sat with his regular pint of guinness cupped in his hands his ankles hooked round the legs of his stool and his back hunched over so that his spectaclesrepaired at the temple with a twist of wireslid to the end of his bony nose he was wearing his usual getup of crusty jeans and sweatshirt and his boots were as always grey with the dust of carved polystyrene from the surfboard makers workshop where he was employed he was beyond the age of a pensioner but as he was fond of putting it when asked old surfers did not die or fade away they merely looked for regular jobs when their days of riding waves were finished jagos had concluded because of parkinsons and selevan always felt a gruff sympathy for his contemporary when he saw how the shakes had come into his hands but any expression of concern was always brushed aside by jago i had my day he was fond of saying time to let the youngsters have theirs thus he was the perfect confessor for selevans current situation and once selevan had his glenmorangie in hand he told his friend about his morning skirmish with tammy in answer to the question hows tricks which jago asked as he raised his own glass to his mouth he used two hands to do it selevan noted shes going over to the lezzies selevan told him as a conclusion to his tale jago shrugged well kidsre meant to do what they want to do mate anything else and youre buying trouble dont see any point to that do i but her parents what do parents know what did you know if it comes down to it and you had what five yourself did you know your arse from a pickle when you dealt with them he hadnt known his arse from a pickle when hed dealt with anything selevan had to admit even when hed dealt with his wife hed been too caught up in being cheesed off at having to cope with the bloody dairy instead of doing what hed wanted to do which had been the navy seeing the world and getting the hell away from cornwall hed made a dogs dinner of his role as father and husband and he hadnt done much better with his role as dairyman he said but not in an unfriendly fashion easy for you to say mate for jago had no children had never had a wife and had spent his youth and his middle age following waves jago smiled showing teeth that had seen hard use and little maintenance too right he admitted i ought to keep it plugged and hows a duffer like me supposed to understand a lass anyway selevan asked just keepm from getting stuffed too soon n my opinion jago downed the rest of his guinness and pushed away from the table he was tall and it took a moment for him to untangle his long legs from the stool while jago went to the bar for another drink selevan considered what his friend had said it was good advice except it didnt apply to tammy getting stuffed was not her interest what hung between mens legs had not so far beguiled her in the least should the girl ever come up pregnant thered be cause for celebration not the general outcry one might assume would normally rise from outraged parents and relations never been a lezzie in my house he said when jago returned whynt you ask her about it then now how the hell am i sposed to put it like the bush bettern the prong my sweet why would that be jago offered and then he grinned look mate youre meant to keep the doors open between you by pretending whats in front of your face int in front of your face kidsre different to what they were like when we were young get started early and dont know what theyre about do they youre there to guide them not to direct them thats what im trying to do selevan said its the how of it man selevan couldnt argue with this hed mucked up the how of it with his own children and now he was doing the same with tammy in contrasthe had to admitjago reeth did have a way with the youngsters selevan had seen both of the angarrack young people come and go from jagos hired caravan at sea dreams and when the dead boysanto kernehad dropped by to ask selevans permission for beach access from his property hed ended up spending more time with the ancient surfer than in the water when that permission was given waxing santos board together setting its fins examining it for dings and imperfections sitting in deck chairs on the patch of scrub grass next to the caravan and talking about what selevan wondered how did one talk to another generation jago answered as if the questions had been asked aloud saying s more about listening than anything else not speechifying when all you itch to do is make a speech or give a lecture bloody hell how i want to give a lecture but i wait till they finally say to me so what dyou think and theres the opening simple as that he winked but not easy mind you quarter hour with them and the last thing you want is having your youth back trauma and tears thatd be the girl selevan said wisely oh aye thatd be the girl she fell and fell hard didnt ask for my advice in the befores didnt ask for my advice in the afters buthere he took a hefty swig of his stout and sloshed it round his mouth which was selevan thought probably his only bow to oral hygienei broke my own rule at the end of the day speechifying telling her what id do in her place which was kill the bastard jago spoke casually as if santo kerne were not as dead as a christmas goose on the table selevan raised both eyebrows at this jago went on that not being possible course i told her to do it like a symbol kill off the past wave it goodbye make a bonfire of it toss in everything that bore on the two of them together diaries journals letters cards photos valentines paddington bears usedup condoms from their very first shag if shed been feeling sentimental at that juncture everything just get rid of it all and move along easy enough to say selevan noted truth there but when its a lasss first and theyve gone the full mile its the only way when things go bad clean house of the bloke you ask me which she was finally on her way to doing whenwellwhen it happened bad that jago nodded makes it worse for the girl hows she supposed to see santo kerne in a real light now no shes got her work cut out getting over this wish it hadnt happened none of it he wasnt a bad lad but he had his ways and she didnt see that till too bleeding late by that time the locomotive was steaming out of the station and all that was left to do was step out of the way loves a bitch of a thing selevan said its a killer that jago agreed chapter ten lynley looked through the gertrude jekyll book at the photos and drawings of gardens that were vibrant with english springtime colours their palettes were soft and soothing and gazing at them he could almost feel what it would be like to sit on one of the weathered benches and let the pastel blanket of petals wash over him gardens he thought were meant to be like these not the formal parterres of the elizabethans planted with careful displays of constipated shrubbery and clipped vegetation but rather the exuberant mimicry of what might occur in a nature from which weeds were banished but other plant life was allowed to flourish banks of colour tumbling unrestrained onto lawns and herbaceous borders bowing onto paths that themselves wandered as a path would in nature yes gertrude jekyll had known what she was about lovely arent they lynley looked up daidre trahair stood before him a small stemmed glass in her extended hand she made a moue of apology as she gave a glance in its direction saying ive only sherry for an aperitif i think its been here since i got the cottage which would befour years ago she smiled im not much of a drinker so i dont actually knowdoes sherry go bad i cant tell you if this is dry or sweet to be honest i suspect sweet though it said cream on the bottle that would be sweet lynley said thank you he took the glass youre not drinking ive a small one in the kitchen you wont allow me to help you he nodded in the direction from which domestic sounds had been coming im not very good at it truthfully im fairly wretched at it but im sure i could chop something if something needs to be chopped and measuring also i can tell you unblushingly that im a genius with measuring cups and spoons thats comforting she replied are you capable of a salad if all the ingredients are set out on the work top and youve no critical decisions to make as long as i dont have to dress it you wouldnt want me wieldingwhatever it is one wields to dress a salad you cant be that hopeless she told him with a laugh surely your wife she stopped herself her expression altered probably because his own had altered she thought she cocked her head ruefully im sorry thomas its difficult not to refer to her lynley rose from his chair the jekyll book still in hand helen would have loved a gertrude jekyll garden he said she used to deadhead our roses in london because she said it encouraged more blooms it does she was right did she like to garden she liked to be in gardens i think she liked the effect of having gardened but you dont know for sure i dont know for sure hed never asked her hed have just come home from work to find her with secateurs in hand and a pail of clipped and spent roses at her feet shed look at him and toss her dark hair off her cheek and say something about roses about gardens in general and what shed say would force him to smile and the smile would force him to forget the world outside the brick walls of their garden a world that needed to be forgotten and locked away so it didnt intrude on the life he shared with her she couldnt cook by the way he told daidre she was dreadful at it completely appalling neither of you cooked then neither of us cooked i could do eggs and toast of course and helen was brilliant at opening tins of soup beans and smoked salmon although she could easily be expected to pop a tin in the microwave and possibly blow the entire electrical system in the house we employed someone to cook for us it was that takeaway curry or starvation and one can eat only so much takeaway curry you poor things daidre said come along then i expect you can learn at least something she returned to the kitchen and he followed her from a cupboard she took a wooden bowlcarved with primitive dancing figures round its rimand she rustled up a cutting board and a number of thankfully recognisable foodstuffs meant to be combined into a salad she set him to his task with a knife saying throw in anything thats the beauty of a salad when youve got enough in the bowl ill show you a simple dressing that wont tax your sadly meagre talents any questions then im sure ill have them as i go along they worked in companionable silence lynley upon the salad and daidre trahair upon a dish with string beans and mint something was baking away in the ovenemitting the fragrance of pastrywhile something else simmered in a pan in time they had a meal assembled and daidre instructed him in the art of laying a table which he did at least know how to do but which he allowed her to demonstrate for him because allowing her that allowed him to watch and evaluate her he was acutely aware of di hannafords instructions to him and while he didnt like the idea of using daidre trahairs hospitality as a device of investigation instead of a means of friendly entrée into her world the part of him that was a policeman trumped the part of him that was a social creature in need of communing with other like creatures so he watched and waited and he remained alert for what crumbs he could gather about her there were few enough she was very careful which was in itself a valuable crumb they tucked into their meal in her tiny dining room where a piece of cardboard fixed over a window reminded him of his duty to repair it for her they ate something she called portobello wellington along with a side dish of couscous with sundried tomatoes green beans done up with garlic and mint and his salad dressed with oil vinegar mustard and italian seasoning they had no wine to drink merely water with lemon she apologized for this much as she had over the sherry she said she hoped he didnt mind a vegetarian meal she wasnt vegan she explained for she saw no sin in consuming animal products like eggs and such but when it came to the flesh of her fellow creatures on the planet it seemed toowell too cannibalistic whatever happens to the beasts happens to man she said all things are connected it sounded to him like a quote and even as he thought as much she unblushingly told him it was she said appealingly those arent my words actually i cant remember who said them or wrote them but when i first came across them years ago they had the ring of truth isnt there an application to zoos imprisoning beasts leading to mans imprisonment you mean something like that iforgive mei dont much care for zoos nor do i they hearken back to the victorians dont they that excited quest for knowledge about the natural world without an accompanying compassion for that world i myself loathe zoos to be quite honest but you choose to work in them i choose to be committed to improving conditions for the animals therein subverting the system from within it makes more sense than carrying a protest sign doesnt it rather like going on a foxhunt with a herring attached to your horse do you like foxhunting i find it execrable ive been only once on boxing day one year i must have been eleven years old my conclusion was that oscar had it right although i couldnt have said as much at the time just that i didnt like it and the idea of a pack of dogs on the trail of a terrified animaland then being allowed to tear it to pieces if they find itit wasnt for me youve a soft heart then for the animal world im not a hunter if thats what you mean i would have made a very bad prehistoric man no killing sabretooth tigers for you evolution im afraid would have ground to a precipitate halt had i been at the tribal helm she laughed youre very droll thomas only in fits and starts he told her tell me how you subvert the system the zoo not as well as i would like to she helped herself to more green beans and she passed the bowl to him saying have some more this is my mothers recipe the secret is what you do with the mint popping it into the hot olive oil just long enough to wilt it which releases its flavour her nose wrinkled or something like that anyway the beans you boil only five minutes any longer and theyll be mushy which is the last thing you want nothing being worse than a mushy bean he noted he took another helping all praise to your mother these are very good youve done her proud where is she your mother mines just south of penzance near lamorna cove and i fear she cooks about as well as i do youre a cornwall man then more or less yes and you i grew up in falmouth born there iwell yes i suppose i mean i was born at home and at the time my parents lived just outside falmouth were you really how extraordinary lynley said i was born at home as well we all were in more rarefied surroundings than my own birthing chamber i daresay daidre pointed out how many of you are there just three im the middle child ive an older sisterthat would be judithand a younger brother peter you one brother lok unusual name hes chinese we adopted him when i was seventeen she cut a wedge of her portobello wellington neatly and held it on her fork as she went on he was six at the time hes reading maths at oxford at the moment quite brainy the dickens how did you come to adopt him we saw him on the telly actually a programme on bbc about chinese orphanages he was handed over because he has spinal bifida i think his parents thought hed not be able to care for them in their old agealthough i dont know that for sure mind youand they didnt have the wherewithal to care for him either so they gave him up lynley observed her she seemed completely without artifice everything she said could be easily verified but stilli like the we he told her she was spearing up some salad she held the fork midway to her mouth and she coloured lightly the we she said and it came to lynley that she thought he was referring to the two of them at that moment seated at her little dining table he grew hot as well you said we adopted him i liked that ah well it was a family decision we always reached big decisions as a family we had sundayafternoon family meetings right after the joint of beef and the yorkshire pud your parents werent vegetarians then goodness no it was meat and veg lamb pork or beef every sunday the occasional chicken sproutslord i do hate sproutsalways did and always willboiled into submission as well as carrots and cauliflower but no beans beans she looked at him blankly you said your mother taught you to cook green beans she looked at the bowl of them where ten or twelve remained uneaten she said oh yes the beans that would have been after her cookery course my father went for mediterranean food in a very big way and mum decided there had to be life beyond spaghetti bolognese so she set about finding it in falmouth yes i did say i grew up in falmouth school there as well she observed him openly her face was kind and she was smiling but her eyes were wary are you interrogating me thomas he held up both hands a gesture meant to be read as openness and submission sorry occupational hazard tell me about gertrude jekyll for a moment he wondered if she would do so he added helpfully i saw youve a number of books about her the very antithesis of capability brown was her answer given after a moment of thought she understood that not everyone had sweeping landscapes to work with i like that about her id have a jekyll garden if i could but im probably doomed to succulents here anything else in the wind and the weatherwell one has to be practical about some things if not about others definitely theyd finished their meal during their conversation and she stood preparatory to gathering up the dishes if shed taken offence at his questioning of her she hid it well for she smiled at him and told him to come along as he was meant to help with the washing up after that she said i shall thoroughly scour your soul and reduce you to rubble metaphorically speaking of course how shall you manage all that in a single evening you mean she cocked her head in the direction of the sitting room with a game of darts she told him ive a tournament to practice for and while i expect youll not be much of a challenger youll do in a pinch my only reply to that must be that ill trounce you and humiliate you lynley told her with a gauntlet like that thrown down we must play at once then she told him loser does the washing up youre on ben kerne knew he would have to phone his father considering the old mans age he also knew that he ought to drive the distance to pengelly cove and break the news about santo in person but he hadnt been to pengelly cove in years and he couldnt face going there just now it wouldnt have changed at allpartly due to its remote location and even more due to the commitment of its citizens to never altering a thing including their attitudesand the lack of change would catapult him back into the past which was the penultimate place in which he wished to dwell the last place was in the present he longed for a limbo of the mind a mental lethe in which he could swim until memory itself no longer concerned him ben would have let the entire matter go had santo not been beloved of his grandparents ben knew it was unlikely they would ever contact him they hadnt done so since his marriage and the only time hed spoken to them at all was when hed phoned occasionally either holding a stilted conversation with them at holiday time or speaking more freely to his mother when he phoned her office or desperate for a place to send santo and kerra when dellen was in one of her bad periods things might have been different had he written to them he may have worn them down over time but he was no writer and even if he had been there was dellen to consider and his loyalty to dellen and everything that loyalty to dellen had demanded of him since his adolescence so hed let go of all attempts at reconciliation and they had done the same and when his mother had suffered a stroke suddenly in her late fifties hed learned of her condition only because the event had occurred during a period when santo and kerra had been staying with their grandparents and theyd brought the news with them upon their return even bens own brothers and sisters had been forbidden from passing the information along another man might have extended the same treatment to his parents now allowing them to learn of santos death in whatever way fate allowed them to learn it but ben had triedand failed in so many waysto be a man unlike his father and that meant creating a breach in the wall that surrounded his heart at this moment allowing some form of compassion to enter it despite his need to hide himself away in a place where it would be safe for him to grieve all the things he needed to grieve at any rate the police were going to contact eddie and ann kerne because that was what the police did they delved into the lives and histories of everyone associated with the deceasedgod he was calling santo the deceased and what did that mean about the state of his heartand they looked for anything that could be used to assign blame doubtless his fathers grief upon hearing about santo would propel him into expletive first and accusation second with no wife there willing or able to act as a moderating influence upon his words but rather with ann kerne standing nearby looking what she felt which would be tormented after years with a man whom she loved but could do little to temper and although there was nothing for ben to be accused of in santos death the job of the police was to make deductions connecting dots no matter how unrelated they were one to another so he didnt need them talking to his father with his father unaware of what had happened to his favourite grandchild ben decided to make the call from his office and not from the familys flat he went down by means of the stairs because doing so prolonged the inevitable when he was in his office he didnt at once pick up the phone instead he looked at the china board upon which the weeks prior to and after adventures unlimiteds opening day were marked in the fashion of a calendar and filled with both activities and bookings he could see their need of alan cheston displayed on this board for months before alans advent dellen had been in charge of marketing adventures unlimited but shed not made much of a job of it she had ideas but virtually no followthrough organisational skills were not her strength and what is her strength if you dont mind my asking his father would have enquired but never mind that no answer required the whole effing village knows what shes good at and make no mistake about that my boy untrue of course it was just his fathers way of taking the piss because he believed that children were meant not to get puffed up which was translated in eddie kernes mind to children not being meant to have confidence in their own decisions he wasnt a bad man just set in his ways and his ways were not bens ways so theyd come into conflict not unlike ben himself and santo ben realised now the very hell of being a father was realising ones own father cast a shadow one could not hope to escape he studied the calendar four weeks to opening and they had to open although he couldnt see how they might be able to do so his heart wasnt in it but they had so much money invested in the business that not to open or to postpone opening wasnt an alternative he could choose besides to ben the bookings they had were covenants that could not be broken and while there werent as many as hed dreamed of having at this point in the businesss development he had faith that bringing onboard alan cheston was going to take care of that alan had ideas and the wherewithal to make them into realities he was clever and a leader as well most important he was not a bit like santo ben hated the disloyalty of the thought in thinking it he was doing what he vowed he would never do repeat the past youre following your effing prong boy had been his fathers words intoned with variation only in the emotion that underscored them from sadness to fury to derision to contempt santo had done much the same and ben didnt want to think what lay behind his sons proclivity for sexual dalliance or where such a proclivity might have taken him before he could avoid any longer he picked up the phone on his desk he punched in the numbers he had little doubt his father would still be up and about the ramshackle house like ben eddie kerne was an insomniac hed be awake for hours yet doing whatever it was one did at night when committed to a green lifestyle as his father long had been eddie kerne and his family had had electricity only if he could produce it from the wind or from water they had water only if he could divert it from a stream or bring it up in a well they had heat when solar panels produced it they grew or raised what they needed for their food and their house had been a derelict farm building bought for a bargain and rescued from destruction by eddie kerne and his sons granite stone by granite stone whitewashed roofed and windowed so inexpertly that the winter wind hissed through the spaces between the frames and the walls his father answered in his usual way with the barked greeting speaking when ben didnt say anything at once his father went on with if youre there start yapping if not get off the line its ben ben said ben who benesek i didnt wake you did i after a brief pause and what if you did you caring for anyone sides yourself these days like father like son ben wanted to reply i had a very good teacher instead he said santos been killed it happened yesterday i thought youd want to know as he was fond of you and i thought perhaps the feeling was mutual another pause this one was longer and then bastard his father said his voice was so tight that ben thought it might break bastard you dont effing change do you do you want to know what happened to santo whatd you let him get up to what did i do this time you mean what happened damn you what god damn happened ben told him as briefly as possible in the end he added the fact of murder he didnt call it murder he used homicide instead someone damaged his climbing kit he told his father god damn eddie kernes voice had altered from anger to shock but he shifted back to anger quickly and what the hell were you doing while he was climbing some bloody cliff watching him egging him on or having it off with her he was climbing alone i didnt know hed gone i dont know why he went the last was a lie but he couldnt bear to give his father any additional ammunition they thought at first it was an accident but when they looked at his equipment they saw it had been tampered with by who well they dont know that dad if they knew theyd make an arrest and matters would be settled settled thats how you talk about the death of your son of your flesh and blood of the means of carrying on your name settled matters get settled and you just go on that it benesek you and whatsername just stroll into the future and put the past behind you but then youre good at doing that arent you so is she shes bleeding brilliant at doing that f i recall right hows she taking all this getting in the way of her lifestyle is it ben had forgotten the nasty emphases in his fathers speech loaded words and pointed questions all designed to carve away ones fragile sense of self no one was meant to be an individual in eddie kernes world family meant adherence to a single belief and a single way of life like father like son he thought abruptly what a cockup hed made of the rough form of paternity hed actually been granted ben said theres no funeral planned yet the police havent released the body ive not seen him even then how the hell dyou know its santo as his car was at the site as his identification was in the car as he hasnt returned home yet i think its safe to assume the body is santo youre a piece of work benesek talking about your own son like that what do you want me to say when nothing i say is going to be right i phoned to tell you because youre going to learn about it anyway from the police and i thought you dont want that do you me n cops in a converse my jaw wagging and their ears perked up if thats what you believe ben said what i was going to say is that i reckoned youd appreciate hearing the news from me and not from the police theyll be talking to you and mum theyll be talking to everyone associated with santo i thought youd want to know what they were doing on your property when they finally show up oh id reckon itd have to do with you eddie kerne said yes i suppose you would ben rang off then no farewell given hed been standing but now he sat at his desk he felt a great pressure building within him as if a tumour in his chest was growing to a size that would cut off his breath the room seemed close soon the air would be used up what he needed was escape like always his father would have said his father a man who rewrote history to suit whatever purpose the moment demanded but there was no history to this moment there was only getting through the now he rose he went along the corridors to the equipment room where hed earlier gone himself and where hed taken di hannaford this time though he didnt approach the row of long cupboards where the climbing equipment was stored rather he went through the room to a smaller one where a storage cupboard the size of a large wardrobe had a padlock hanging from a hasp he possessed the only key to this lock and he used it now when he swung it open the scent of old rubber was strong it had been more than twenty years he thought before kerras birth even likely the thing would fall apart but it didnt he was in the wet suit before he had a clear thought as to why he was in it shoulders to ankles in neoprene pulling the zip up his back by its cord one hard tug and the rest was easy no corrosion because hed always taken care of his kit come on come on lets bloody get home his mates would say to him dont be such a wanker kerne were freezing our arses out here but there was a hosepipe available and hed used it to rinse the saltwater off then he did the same when he got his kit home surfing kits were expensive and he had no intention of needing to purchase another because saltwater had corroded and rotted the one he owned so he washed the wet suit thoroughlyits boots gloves and hood as welland he washed the board his mates hooted and called him a poofter but he would not be moved from his intentions in that and in everything else he thought now he felt cursed by his own determination the board was in the cupboard as well he eased it out and examined it not a ding anywhere the deck still waxed a real antique by the standards of today but perfectly suitable for what he intended whatever that was because he didnt quite know he just wanted to be out of the hotel he scooped up boots gloves and hood he tucked the surfboard under his arm the equipment room had a door that led to the terrace and from there to the still empty swimming pool a concrete stairway at the far end of the pool area took one up to the promontory for which the old hotel had been named and a path along the edge of this promontory followed the curve of st mevan beach a line of beach huts were tucked into the cliff here not the standard huts which were generally freestanding but rather a joined rank of them looking like a long and lowslung stable with narrow blue doors ben followed this route breathing in the cold salt air and listening to the crash of the waves he paused above the beach huts to don his neoprene hood but the boots and gloves he would pull on when he got to the edge of the water he looked out at the sea the tide was high so the reefs were covered and the reefs would keep the waves consistent from this distance five feet seemed their size with swells coming from the south they were breaking right with an offshore wind had it been daylighteven dawn or duskconditions would be considered good even at this time of year when the water would be as cold as a witchs heart no one surfed at night there were too many dangers from sharks to reefs to rips but this wasnt so much about surfing as it was about remembering and while ben didnt want to remember talking to his father was forcing him to do so it was either that or remaining within the promontory king george hotel and that he could not do he descended the steps to the beach there were no lights here but tall streetlamps that followed the path along the promontory above shed at least some illumination onto the rocks and sand he picked his way through hunks of slate and sandstone boulders clitter from the cliff top that now formed the base of the promontory and he stepped at last onto the sand this wasnt the soft sand of a tropical isle but rather the grit produced over eons as a frozen land of permafrost warmed till slowmoving landslides left coarse gravel in their wake and water forever beating upon these stones reduced them to hard little grains that glittered in sunlight but shone dull otherwise grey and dun coloured unforgiving upon flesh and abrasive to the touch to his right was the sea pit high tide filling it with new water now nearly submersing it in order to do so to his left was the tributary of the river cas and beyond it what remained of the casvelyn canal in front of him was the sea restless and demanding it drew him forward he set his board on the sand and donned his boots and gloves he squatted for a momenta huddled figure in black with his back to casvelynand he watched the phosphorescence in the waves hed been to the beach at night as a youth but those visits had not been for a surf with their surfing done for the day theyd make a fire ring when embers were all that was left of the blaze theyd pair off and if the tide was low the great sea caves of pengelly cove beckoned there theyd make love on a blanket or not semiclothed or nude drunk slightly tipsy or sober shed been younger then shed been his she was what he wanted all that he wanted she had known it as well and the trouble had come from that knowing he rose and approached the water with his board he had no leash for it but that didnt matter if it got away from him it got away from him like so much else in his life keeping the board close by should he fall from it was a concern beyond his control just now his feet and ankles felt the shock of the cold first and then his legs and thighs and upwards it would take a few moments for his body temperature to warm the water within his wet suit and in the meantime the bitter cold of it reminded him he was alive thigh deep he eased onto the board and began to paddle out through the white water towards the righthand reef break the spray hit his face and the waves washed over him he thoughtbrieflyhe might paddle forever straight into morning paddle until he was so far from shore that cornwall itself would be only a memory but instead bleakly governed by love and by duty he stopped beyond the reef at the swells and there he straddled his board he sat first with his back to the shore looking out at the vast and undulating sea then he turned the board round and saw the lights of casvelyn the line of tall lamps shining whitely along the promontory and then the amber glow behind the curtained windows of the houses in town like the gaslights of the nineteenth century or the open fires of an earlier time the swells were seductive offering him a hypnotic rhythm that was as comforting as it was false it felt he thought like a return to the womb one could stretch out on the board bob in the sea and sleep forever but swells brokethe sheer volume of the water collapsing in on itselfas the landmass beneath it sloped up into the shore there was danger here as well as seduction one had to act or one submitted to the force of the waves he wondered if after all these years he would recognise the moment that confluence of shape force and curl telling the surfer it was time to drop in but some things ultimately were second nature and he found that taking a wave was one of them understanding and experience coalesced into skill and the passage of time had not robbed him of that the peak built and he rose with it paddling first then up on one knee and then erect no deck grip at the tail of the board holding the back foot in position because on this boardon his boardsuch a device had never been placed he skimmed for a second across the waves shoulder he dropped into its face he carved getting high and fast with his muscles acting on memory alone then he was in the barrel and it was clean green room mate they would have yelled sheeeeit youre in the green room kerne he rode until there was only white water and there he stepped off thigh deep in the shallows once again catching the board before it got away from him he paused with the inside waves breaking against him his breath came hard and he stood there till the pounding of his heart grew slower then he walked towards the beach the seawater pouring off him like a discarded cape he trudged in the direction of the stairs as he did so a figuremidnight silhouettecame forward to meet him kerra had seen him leave the hotel at first she hadnt known it was her father indeed for a mad moment her leaping heart had declared it to be santo beneath her striding across the terrace and up the steps towards the promontory and st mevan beach to have a secret surf at night shed watched from above and seeing only the blackgarbed figure and knowing that figure had come out of the hotelthere was nothing else for her to think it had all been a mistake shed thought nonsensically a terrible ghastly horrible mistake there was some other body discovered at the base of that cliff in polcare cove but it was not her brother so shed hurried to the stairs and shed clattered down them as the antique lift would have been too slow she dashed through the dining hall which like the equipment room opened onto the terrace and she set across this and flew up the stairs by the time she reached the promontory the blackgarbed figure was down on the beach squatting next to the surfboard so she waited there and there she watched only as he approached her after riding a single wave did she realise it was her father she was filled with questions and then with fury with the eternal and unanswerable whys of nearly everything that had defined her childhood why did you pretend why did you argue with santo about and beyond that the who of it all who are you dad but she asked none of these halfformed questions as her father reached her position at the base of the steps instead she tried in the semidarkness to read his face he paused his expression seemed to soften and he looked as if he intended to speak but when he finally opened his mouth it was only to say kerra love and then he passed her he climbed the steps to the promontory path and she followed him wordlessly they approached the hotel where they descended towards the empty swimming pool at a hosepipe her father paused and washed the seawater from his surfboard then he went on into the hotel in the equipment room he stripped off his wet suit he was wearing his undershorts beneath it and his skin was pimpled with the cold but this didnt seem to bother him because he didnt shiver instead he carried the wet suit to a large heavy plastic rubbish bin in the corner of the room and he dumped it inside without ceremony the dripping surfboard he carried into another rooman inner room kerra saw a room she had not yet investigated in the hoteland there he put it into a cupboard this he locked with a padlock which he then tested as if to make sure the cupboards contents were safe from prying eyes from family eyes she realised from her eyes and from santos eyes because her mother must have known this secret all along santo kerra thought the sheer hypocrisy of it all she simply did not understand her father used his tshirt to dry himself off he tossed it to one side and donned his pullover he motioned for her to turn her back which she did and heard the sound of him removing his undershorts plopping them onto the floor and then zipping his trousers then he said all right she turned back to him and they faced each other he waited clearly for her questions she determined to surprise him as hed surprised her so what she said was its because of her isnt it who mum you couldnt surf and watch her at the same time so you stopped surfing thats why isnt it i saw you dad how long has it been twenty years more yes since before you were born so you put on your wet suit you went out there you took the first wave that came along and that was it no trouble it was easy for you it was childs play for you it was nothing like walking like breathing yes all right it was which meanshow long had you surfed when you stopped her father picked up his tshirt and folded it neatly despite its condition which was damp through he said most of my life its what we did in those days there was nothing else youve seen how your grandparents live we had the beach in the summer and school the rest of the time there was work at home trying to keep that bloody house from falling apart and when there was free time we surfed there was no money for holidays no cheap flights to spain it wasnt like today but you stopped i stopped things change kerra yes she came along that was the change you got caught up in her and by the time you saw what shes really like it was too late you couldnt get away so you had to make a choice and you chose her its not that simple he moved past her out of the smaller room and into the larger equipment room he waited for her to follow him and when she was with him he shut and locked the smaller rooms door did santo know about this she gestured to the door hed locked you were good werent you i saw enough to know that so why suddenly she was as close to weeping as shed come in the last terrible thirty hours or so he was watching her she saw that he looked ineffably sad and in that sadness she understood that while they were a familythe four of them then the three of them nowthey were a family in name only beyond a common surname they were and had always been merely a repository of secrets shed believed that all of these secrets had to do with her mother with her mothers troubles her mothers periods of bizarre alteration and these were secrets to which she herself had long been a party because there was no way to avoid knowing them when the simple act of coming home from school might put her in the midst of what had always been referred to as a bit of an embarrassing situation dont breathe a word to dad darling but dad knew anyway all of them knew by the clothes she wore the tilt of her head when she was speaking the rhythm of her sentences the tap of her fingers on the table during dinner and the restlessness of her gaze and the red they knew from the red for kerra and santo what came on the heels of that colour was a prolonged visit to the elder kernes and whats the cow up to now from her granddad but say nothing to your grandparents about this understand was the injunction that kerra and santo had lived by keep the faith keep the secret and eventually things would return to normal whatever normal was but now kerra understood there were even more secrets than those which shed kept about her mother arcane bits of knowledge that went beyond dellens convoluted psyche and touched upon kerras father as well embracing this stinging piece of truth kerra realised there was no solid place to put down her foot if she wished to walk forward and pass into the future i was thirteen years old she said there was a bloke i liked called stuart he was fourteen and he had terrible spots and i liked him the spots made him seem safe you know only he wasnt safe its funny actually because all id done was go to the kitchen to fetch us some jam tarts and a drinkless than five minutesand thats all it took stuart didnt understand what was going on but i knew didnt i because id grown up knowing so had santo only he was safe becauselets face ithe was just like her not in all ways her father said no not that that she said you know it that and in ways that affected me ah madlyn we were best friends before santo got his hands on her kerra santo didnt intend yes he did he bloody well did and the worst part of it was that he didnt need to pursue her he was already pursuingwhatthree other girls or was it that hed already been through three other girls she knew that she sounded what she was bitter but it seemed to her in that moment that nothing in her life had ever been secure from depredation her father said kerra people go their own way theres nothing you can do about it do you actually believe that is that how you defend her defend him im not you are you always have done at least when it comes to her shes made a fool of you for my entire life and ill put money down on the bet shes made a fool of you since the day you met her if ben was offended by kerras remark he didnt say so rather he said its not your mother im talking about love and its not santo its this stuart lad whoever he was its madlyn angarrack he paused before finishing with its alan kerra its everyone people will go their own way youre best off to let them like you did you mean i cant explain things further because its a secret she asked and she did not care that the question sounded like a taunt like everything else in your life like the surfing we dont choose where to love we dont choose who to love i dont believe that for a moment she said tell me why you didnt like santo surfing because i believed no good would come of it is that what happened to you he said nothing for a moment kerra thought he would not reply but at last he said what she knew he would say yes not a single good came of it for me so i lay down the board and got on with my life with her kerra noted yes with your mother chapter eleven di bea hannaford arrived at the police station late in a foul mood and with rays parting words still gnawing at her she didnt want anything ray had to say taking up residence in her consciousness but he had a way of transmuting goodbye from an innocuous social moment into the bolt from a crossbow and one had to be quick to avoid getting hit she was fast on her verbal feet when there was nothing else on her mind but that was impossible in the middle of a murder enquiry shed had to cave in on the issue of pete another reason she was late to the station given the absence of mcit officers to work the case given only the loan of a tag teamand who the bloody hell knew when they were going to be withdrawnshe would be putting in long hours and someone had to look after pete not so much because pete couldnt look after himself since hed been cooking for years and hed mastered the art of laundry the first time his mother had turned a beloved arsenal tshirt purple but because he had to be ferried about from school to football coaching to this or that appointment and his time on the internet had to be watched and his homework had to be monitored or he wouldnt bother to do it he was in short an average fourteenyearold boy who needed regular parenting bea knew she ought to be grateful that her former husband was willing to step up to the challenge exceptshe was convinced that ray had orchestrated the entire situation just for that reason to obtain unimpeded access to pete he wanted a more definite inroad with their son and hed seen this as an opportunity to make one petes new enthusiasm at having to stay at his fathers house suggested ray was having some success in this area as well which caused bea to question exactly what constituted rays approach to fatherhood from the meals he served pete to the freedom he gave him so shed grilled her former husband as pete had trotted off to the spare roomhis room as he had referred to itto stow his belongings and ray had tunneled his way through her questions to their root in his typical fashion hes happy to be here because he loves me was his reply just as hes happy to be with you because he loves you he has two parents not one beatrice all things in the balance this is good you know she wanted to say two parents oh right thats brilliant ray but instead she said i dont want him exposed to any naked twentyfiveyearold women running about the house he asked fear not ive told my stable of beauties normally in residence here at the playboy mansion that the orgies are postponed indefinitely their hearts are brokenmy own is devastatedbut there you have it pete comes first hed leaned against the kitchen work top hed been sorting through yesterdays post and there was no indication that anyone else was present in the house shed checked this as surreptitiously as possible telling herself she did not want pete exposed to anyones casual sex not at his age and not before shed had the opportunity to explain to him each one of the sexually transmitted diseases he could end up with if he played fast and loose with his body parts you have ray told her the oddest damn ideas of how i spend what little free time i possess my dear she didnt engage instead she gave him a bag of groceries because she was damned if she was going to be in debt to him for having pete to stay during a time when he was not scheduled to do so then shed barked out their sons name hugged him goodbye kissed him on the cheek with the loudest smack she could manage despite his squirming and his oh mum and shed left the house ray had followed her to her car it was windy and grey outside beginning to rain as well but he didnt hurry or seek shelter from the weather he waited till she got in and he motioned for her to lower the window when shed done so he leaned down and said whats it going to take beatrice she said what and she didnt bother to hide her irritation for you to forgive what do i need to do she shook her head reversed down the driveway and drove off but shed not been able to shake his question she was predisposed to be annoyed with sergeant collins and constable mcnulty when she finally strode into the station but the two miserable louts made it impossible for her to feel anything close to annoyance collins had somehow risen to the occasion of her tardiness deploying half of the tag officers to canvass the area within a threemile radius of polcare cove to see if they could come up with anything of note from those few who lived there in the several hamlets and on the farms the others hed told to work on background checks of everyone so far connected to the crime each of the kernesand especially ben kernes financial status and whether that status was altered by his sons demisemadlyn angarrack her family daidre trahair thomas lynley and alan cheston everyone was being asked for fingerprints and the kernes had been given the word that santos body was ready for the formality of identification in truro in the meantime constable mcnulty had been engaged with santo kernes computer when bea arrived he was checking through all the deleted emails going to take bloody hours he informed her sounding as if he hoped shed tell him to forego the tedious operation which she had no intention of doing and before that hed pulled from the computers files what seemed to be more designs for tshirts mcnulty had divided them into categories local businesses whose names he recognised largely pubs hotels and surf shops rock bands both popular and extremely obscure festivals from music to the arts and those designs that were questionable because he had a feeling about them which bea interpreted to mean he didnt know what they were she was wrong as she soon discovered the first questionable tshirt design was for liquidearth a name bea recognised from the invoice left in santo kernes car this mcnulty explained was the name of a surfboard shapers business the board shaper was called lewis angarrack as in madlyn angarrack bea asked him as in her dad this was interesting what about the others cornish gold was the second design hed singled out this belonged to a cider farm he told her hows that important its the only business from outside casvelyn i thought that was worth looking into mcnulty she thought might not be as useless as shed earlier concluded and the last one she gave the design her scrutiny it appeared to be twosided the obverse declared commit an act of subversion above a rubbish bin which was suggestive of everything from bombs in the street to delving into the bins of celebrities for information to sell to the tabloids on the reverse however things became clear eat free declared an artful dodger urchin who was pointing to the same rubbish bin which had been upended spilling its contents onto the ground what dyou make of this bea asked the constable dont know he said but it seemed worth looking into because its got nothing to do with an organisation unlike the others like i said i had a feeling what cant be identified needs to be examined he sounded like someone quoting a manual but it was good sense the first shed heard from him it gave her hope you might have a future in this business she told him he didnt look entirely pleased with the idea tammy was quiet in the morning which concerned selevan penrule she was always on the quiet side anyway but this time her lack of conversation seemed to indicate a pensiveness she hadnt previously been caught up in before it always looked to her grandfather as if the girl was just preternaturally calm yet another indication that something was off about her because at her age she wasnt supposed to be calm about anything she was supposed to be caught up worrying about her complexion and her figure about having the right clothes and the perfect haircut and other such nonsense but this morning she looked caught up in considering something to selevan there could be little doubt about what that something was selevan contemplated his approach he thought about his conversation with jago reeth and what jago had said on the subject of guiding and not directing a young person despite selevans earlier reaction of easyforyoutosaymate he had to admit that jago had spoken good sense what was the point of trying to impose ones will upon an adolescent when that adolescent had a will as well it wasnt as if people were all meant to do the same thing as their parents was it if they did the world would never change would never develop would perhaps never even be interesting it would all be lockstep one generation after another but on the other hand was that so bad selevan didnt know what he did know was that hed ended up despite his own wishes in the matter and because of a cruel twist of fate in the person of his fathers ill health doing the same thing as his parents hed given in to duty and the end result had been carrying on with a dairy farm that hed intended as a young boy and then an adolescent to escape as soon as possible hed never thought that situation was fair so he had to ask himself how fair the family were being on tammy opposing her desires on the other hand what if her desires werent her desires at all but only the result of her fear now that was a question that wanted answering but it couldnt be answered unless it was asked he waited though first he had to keep his promise to her and her parents and that meant he had to go through her rucksack before he drove her to work she submitted to the search with resignation she watched him in silence he could feel her gaze on him as he pawed through her belongings for contraband nothing a meagre lunch a wallet holding the five pounds hed given her for spending money two weeks earlier lip balm and her address book there was a paperback novel as well and he leapt upon this as evidence but the titleshoes of the fishermansuggested she was reading at last about cornwall and her heritage so he let it go he handed the rucksack over to her with a gruff see you keep it this way and then he noted she was wearing something hed not seen before it wasnt a new garment she was still in unrelieved black from head to toe like queen victoria in the postalbert period but she had something different round her neck it was inside her jersey its green cord the only part he could see he said whats this then and he pulled it out not a necklace he realised because if it was it was the oddest necklace hed ever looked at it had two ends each of which was identical they had small squares of cloth attached to them these were embroidered with an ornamental m above which was embroidered a small gold crown selevan examined the cloth squares suspiciously he said to tammy whats this then girl scapular she told him scapperwhat scapular and the m means mary mary who he demanded she sighed oh grandie was her reply this response didnt exactly fill him with relief he pocketed the scapular and told her to get her arse out to the car when he joined her he knew it was time so he spoke is it the fear he asked her what fear you know what fear men he said has your mumyou know you bloody well know what im talking about girl i dont actually has your mum told you his wifes mum hadnt poor dot knew nothing shed come to him not only a virgin but as ignorant as a newborn lamb hed made a mess of things because of his inexperience and his nerves which had evidenced as impatience and had reduced her to frightened tears but modern girls werent like that were they they knew it all before they were ten on the other hand ignorance and fear explained a lot about tammy for they could be what lay at the root of how she was living at present all huddled into herself he said has your mum told you bout it girl about what birds and bees cats and kittens has your mum told you oh grandie she said stop the oh grandie and put me in the bloody picture because if she hasnt poor dot he thought poor ignorant dot the oldest girl in a family of girls never having seen a grown naked man except in museums and hadnt the poor fool woman actually believed that the male genitalia were shaped like fig leavesgod what a horror the wedding night had been and what hed learned from it all was the idjit hed been to have been respectful and waited for marriage because if theyd done it beforehand at least she would have known whether she wanted to marry at allonly she would have insisted upon marriage at that point so any way you looked at hed have been caught as he was always caught by love by duty and now by tammy so whats oh grandie meant to mean he asked her you know youre embarrassed youre what she lowered her head he thought she might be about to cry and he didnt want that so he started the car they rumbled up the slope and out of the caravan park he saw that she was not going to speak she intended to make this difficult for him damn and blast her she was a stubborn little thing he couldnt reckon where she got that from but it was no wonder her parents had reached the point of despair with her well there was nothing for it but to hammer away if she wasnt going to answer him so out of the caravan park and up the lane on the way into casvelyn selevan got out his tools its the natural order of things he told her men and women together anything else is unnatural and i mean anything else if you receive my meaning girl nothing to be worried over because we got separate parts dont we and our separate partsre meant to be joined you got man on top and woman on bottom they put their things together because thats how it goes he slides in and they rustle about and when its all said and done they go to sleep sometimes they get a baby out of it sometimes they dont but its all the way its supposed to be and if a mans got any wits about him its a jolly nice thing that they both enjoy there hed said it but he wanted to repeat one part to make certain she understood anything else he said with a tap on the steering wheel isnt in the natural order of things and were meant to be natural natural like nature and in nature what you dont see and dont ever see is ive been talking to god tammy said now that was a real conversation stopper selevan thought straight out of the blue like he hadnt been trying to make a point with the girl he said have you now and whats god been saying back nice that hes got time for you by the by cause the buggers never had time for me ive tried to listen tammy spoke like a girl with things on her mind ive tried to listen for his voice she said his voice gods voice from where you expecting it out of the gorse or something gods voice comes from within tammy said and she brought a lightly clenched fist to her skinny chest ive tried to listen to the voice from inside myself its a quiet voice its the voice of whats right you know when you hear it grandie hear it a lot do you when i get quiet i do but now i cant ive seen you quiet day and night but not inside hows that he looked over at her she was concentrating on the rainstreaked day hedgerows dripping as the car skimmed past them a magpie taking to the sky my heads full of chatter she said if my head wont be silent i cant hear god chatter he thought what was the maddening girl on about one moment he thought he had her sorted the next he was flummoxed again what dyou got up there then he asked and he poked her head goblins and ghoulies dont make fun she told him im trying to tell youbut theres nothing and theres no one that i can ask you see so im asking you as its the only thing left that i can think to do i spose im asking for help grandie now he thought they were down to it this was the moment the girls parents had hoped for time with her granddad paying off he waited for more he made a hmph noise to indicate his willingness to listen the moments ticked by as they approached casvelyn she said nothing more till they were in town then it was brief hed pulled to the kerb in front of clean barrel surf shop before she finally spoke if i know something she said to him her eyes fixed on the shops front door and if what i know might cause someone troublewhat should i do grandie thats what ive been asking god but he hasnt answered what should i do i could keep asking because when something bad happens to someone you care about it seems like the kerne boy he interrupted dyou know something about the kerne boy tammy look at me square girl not out of the window she did he could see she was troubled beyond what he had thought so there was only one answer and despite the irritations it might cause in his own life he owed it to her to give it you know something you tell the police he said nothing else to it you do it today chapter twelve she excelled at darts lynley had learned that quickly enough on the previous evening and hed added the information to what little he knew about daidre trahair she had a dartboard mounted on the back of the sitting room door something hed not noticed before because she kept the door open instead of closing it against the cold wind which could sweep into the building from the tiny vestibule when someone entered the cottage he should have known he was in trouble when she used a tape measure to create a distance of exactly seven feet nine and onequarter inches from the back of the closed door here she placed the fireplace poker on a parallel calling it their oche when he said okkey and shed said the oche marks where the player has to stand thomas hed had his first real clue that he was probably in over his head but hed thought how difficult can it possibly be and hed gone like a lamb to the metaphorical slaughter agreeing to a match called about which he knew nothing at all he said are there rules shed looked at him askance of course there are rules its a game thomas and shed gone about explaining them to him she began with the dartboard itself losing him almost immediately when she referred to treble and double rings and what it meant to ones score to land in one of them hed never thought of himself as an idiotit had always seemed to him that knowing how to identify a bullseye was the limit of what one needed to embrace when it came to dartsbut within moments he was entirely lost it was simple she told him we each start with a score of and the object is to reduce that to nought we each throw three darts a bullseye scores fifty the outer ring twentyfive and anything in the double or treble ring is double or treble the segment score yes he nodded he was almost altogether uncertain what she was talking about but confidence he reckoned was the key to success good now the caveat is that the last dart thrown has to land in a double or in the bullseye and additionally if you reduce your score to one or it actually goes below nought your turn ends immediately and the play is turned over to the other thrower follow he nodded he was even more uncertain at that point but he decided it couldnt be that difficult to hit a dartboard from less than eight feet away besides it was only a game and his ego was strong enough to emerge undamaged should she win the match for another could follow two out of three three out of five it didnt matter it was all in an evenings diversion yes she won every match they could have gone on all night and she probably would have continued to win the vixenfor so he was thinking of her by thenturned out to be not only a tournament player but the sort of woman who did not believe a mans ego had to be preserved by allowing him moments of specious supremacy over her she had the grace to be at least moderately embarrassed she said oh my oh dear well its just that i never actually just let someone win its never seemed right yourequite amazing he said my head is spinning its that i play a lot i didnt tell you that did i so ill pay the penalty for unspoken truths ill help you with the washing up she was as good as her word and they saw to the kitchen in companionable fashion with him doing the washing and her doing the drying she made him clean the cooktopits only fair she told himbut she herself swept the floor and scoured the sink he found himself enjoying her company and as a result felt ill at ease when it came to his appointed task he did it nonetheless he was a cop when everything got reduced to essentials and someone was dead through murder shed lied to an investigating officer and no matter his personal enjoyment of the evening he had a job to do for di hannaford and he intended to do it he set about it the following morning and he was able to get a fair distance right there from his room in the salthouse inn he discovered through a few simple phone calls that someone called daidre trahair was indeed one of the veterinarians at bristol zoo gardens when he asked about speaking to dr trahair he was told that she was on emergency leave dealing with a family matter in cornwall this bit of news didnt give him pause people often claimed that family matters needed to be taken care of when what those family matters were was simply a need to get away for a few days of decompression from a stressful job he decided that couldnt be held against her her claims about her adopted chinese brother held up as well lok trahair was indeed a student at oxford university daidre herself had a first in biological science from the university of glasgow having gone on from there to the royal veterinary college for her advanced degree well and good lynley had thought she might have had secrets that she wished to keep from di hannaford but they werent secrets about her identity or that of her brother he delved back further into her schooling but this was where he hit the first snag daidre trahair had been a pupil in a secondary comprehensive in falmouth but before that there was no record of her no school in falmouth would claim her state or public day school boarding school convent schoolthere was nothing she either had not lived in falmouth for those years of her education or shed been sent far away for some reason or shed been schooled at home yet surely she would have mentioned being schooled at home since by her own admission shed been born at home it was a logical followup wasnt it he wasnt sure he also wasnt sure what more he could do he was pondering his options when a knock at his bedroom door roused him from his thoughts siobhan rourke presented him with a small package it had just arrived in the post she told him he thanked her and when he was alone again automatically opened it to find his wallet this he opened as well it was a kneejerk reaction but it was more than that he wasunprepared for the fact of it allsuddenly restored to who he was driving licence folded into a square bank card credit cards picture of helen he took this last in his fingers it was of helen at christmas less than two months away from dying theyd had a hurried holiday with no time to visit her family or his because hed been in the midst of a case not to worry therell be other christmases darling shed said helen he thought he had to force himself back to the present he carefully placed the photo of his wifecheek in her hand smiling at him across the breakfast table hair still uncombed face without makeup the way he loved herback into its position in his wallet he put the wallet onto the bedside table next to the phone he sat in silence only hearing his own breathing he thought of her name he thought of her face he thought of nothing after a moment he continued his work he considered his options further investigation into daidre trahair was needed but he didnt want to be the one who did it loyalty to a fellow cop or not for he wasnt a cop not here and not now but there were others before he could stop himself because it would be so easy to do so he picked up the phone and punched in a number more familiar to him than was his own and a voice as familiar as a family members answered on the other end of the line dorothea harriman departmental secretary at new scotland yard at first he wasnt sure he could speak but he finally managed to say dee she knew at once in a hushed voice she said detective superintendentdetective inspectorsir just thomas he said just thomas dee oh goodness no sir was her reply dee harriman who had never called anyone by anything less than his or her full title how are you detective superintendent lynley im fine dee is barbara available detective sergeant havers she asked stupid question which wasnt like dee lynley wondered why she had asked it no no she isnt detective superintendent she isnt here but detective sergeant nkata is around and detective inspector stewart and detective inspec lynley spared her the endless recitation ill try barbara on her mobile he said and dee detective superintendent dont tell anyone ive phoned all right but are you please yes yes of course but we hopenot just mei speak for everyone i know i do when i say thank you he said he rang off he thought about making the call to barbara havers longtime partner and fractious friend he knew that she would offer her help gladly but it would be too gladly and if she was in the middle of a case shed offer her help to him anyway and then suffer the result of that offering without mentioning it to him he didnt know if he could do it for other reasons that hed felt the moment hed heard dorothea harrimans voice it was obviously far too soon perhaps a wound too deep to heal yet a boy was dead and lynley was who he was he picked up the phone again yeah the answer was vintage havers she shouted it as well for she was obviously rattling along somewhere in her death trap of a car if the background noise was anything to go by he drew a breath still unsure she said hey someone there i cant hear you cn you hear me he said yes i can hear you barbara the games afoot can you help me out there was a long pause he could hear noise from her radio the distant sound of traffic passing wisely it seemed shed pulled to the side of the road to talk but still she said nothing barbara he said tell me sir was her reply liquidearth stood on binner down among a collection of other smallmanufacturing businesses on the grounds of a longdecommissioned royal air station this was a relic of world war ii reduced all these decades later to a combination of crumbling buildings rutted lanes and masses of brambles between the abandoned buildings and along the lanes the area resembled nothing so much as a rubbish tip disused lobster traps and fishing nets formed piles next to lumps of broken concrete discarded tyres and moulding furniture languished against propane tanks stained toilets and chipped basins became contrasting elements that fought with wild ivy there were mattresses black garbage sacks stuffed with whoknewwhat threelegged chairs splintered doors ruined casings from windows it was a perfect spot to toss a body bea hannaford concluded no one would find it for a generation even from inside the car she could smell the place the damp air offered fires and cow manure from a working dairy farm at the edge of the down added to the general unpleasantness of the environment pooled rainwater that was skimmed by oil slicks sat in craters along the tarmac shed brought constable mcnulty with her both as navigator and note taker based on his comments in santo kernes bedroom on the previous day she decided he might prove useful with matters related to surfing and as a longtime resident of casvelyn at least he knew the town theyd come at liquidearth on a circuitous route that had taken them by the town wharf which formed the northeast edge of the disused casvelyn canal they gained binner down from a street called arundel off which a lumpy track led past a grimestreaked farmhouse behind this the decommissioned air station lay and far beyond it in the distance a tumbledown house stood a mess of a place taken over by a succession of surfers and brought to wrack as a result of their habitation mcnulty seemed philosophical about this what else could one expect he seemed to say bea saw soon enough that she was lucky to have him with her for the businesses on the erstwhile airfield had no addresses affixed to them they were nearly windowless cinderblock buildings with roofs of galvanised metal overhung with ivy cracked concrete ramps led up to heavy steel vehicle doors at the front of each and the occasional passageway door had been cut into these mcnulty directed bea along a track on the far north edge of the airfield after a spinedamaging jounce for some three hundred yards he mercifully said here you go guv and indicated one hut of three that he claimed had once been housing for wrens she found that difficult enough to believe but times had been tough compared to eking out an existence on a bomb site in london or coventry this had probably seemed like paradise when they alighted and did a little chiropractic manoeuvring of their spinal cords mcnulty pointed out how much closer they were at this point to the habitation of the surfers he called it binner down house and it stood in the distance directly across the down from them convenient for the surfers when you thought about it he noted if their boards needed repairing they could just nip across the down and leave them here with lew angarrack they entered liquidearth by means of a door fortified with no less than four locks immediately they were within a small showroom where in racks along two walls long boards and short boards leaned nose up and finless on a third wall surfing posters hung featuring waves the size of ocean liners while along the fourth wall stood a business counter within and behind this a display of surfing accouterments were laid out board bags leashes fins there were no wet suits nor were there any tshirts designed by santo kerne the place had an eyestinging smell about it this turned out to be coming from a dusty room beyond the showroom where a boilersuited man with a long grey ponytail and largeframed spectacles was carefully pouring a substance from a plastic pail onto the top of a surfboard this lay across two sawhorses the gent was slow about what he was doing perhaps because of the nature of the work perhaps because of the nature of his disability his habits or his age he was a shaker bea saw parkinsons the drink whatever she said excuse me mr angarrack just as the sound of an electrical tool powered up from behind a closed door to the side not him mcnulty said sotto voce behind her thatll be lew shaping a board in the other room by this bea took it to mean that angarrack was operating whatever tool was making the noise as she reached her conclusion the older gentleman turned he had an antique face and his specs were held together with wire he said sorry cant stop just now with a nod at what he was doing come in though you the cops that was obvious enough as mcnulty was in uniform but bea stepped forward leaving tracks along a floor powdered with polystyrene dust and offered her identification he gave it a cursory glance and a nod and said he was jago reeth the glasser he added he was putting the final coat of resin on a board and he had to smooth it before it began to set or hed have a sanding problem on his hands but hed be free to talk to them when he was finished if they wanted him if they wanted lew he was doing the initial shaping of the rails on a board and he wouldnt want to be disturbed as he liked to do it in one go well be sure to make our apologies bea told jago reeth can you fetch him for us or shall we she indicated the door behind which the shrieking of a tool told the tale of some serious rail shaping hang on then jago said let me get this on wont take five minutes and its got to be done all at once they watched as he finished with the plastic pail the resin formed a shallow pool defined by the curve of the surfboard and he used a paintbrush to spread it evenly once again bea noted the degree to which his hand shook as he wielded the paintbrush he seemed to read her mind in her glance he said not too many good years left should have taken on the big waves when i had the chance you surf yourself bea asked jago reeth not these days not if i want to see tomorrow he peered up at her from his position bent over the board his eyes behind his spectaclesthe glass of which was flecked with white residuewere clear and sharp despite his age youre here about santo kerne i expect was a murder eh you know that do you bea asked jago reeth didnt know he said just reckoned why youre here why else if not a murder or are you lot going round offering condolences to everyone who knew the lad youre among those am he said not long but i knew him six months or so since i worked for lew so youre not an oldtimer here in town he made a long sweep with his paintbrush the length of the board me no i come up from australia this time round been following the season long as i can tell you summer or surfing same thing in some places others its winter they always need blokes who can do boards im their man isnt it a bit early for the season here not hardly eh just a few more weeks and nows when im needed most cos before the season starts is when the orders come in then in the season boards get dinged and repairs are needed newquay north shore queensland california im there to do them use to work first and surf later sometimes the reverse but not now hell no itd kill me for sure his dad thought itd kill santo you know idjit he was safer than crossing the street and it gets a lad out in the air and sunlight so does sea cliff climbing bea pointed out jago eyed her and look what happened there dyou know the kernes then santo like i said and the rest of them from what santo said and that would be the limit of what i know he set his paintbrush in the pail which hed put on the floor beneath the board and he scrutinised his work squatting at the end of the board to study it from tail to nose then he rose and went to the door behind which the rails of a board were being shaped he closed it behind him in a moment the tool was shut off constable mcnulty bea saw was looking about a line forming between his eyebrows as if he was considering what he was observing she knew nothing about the making of surfboards so she said what and he roused himself from his thoughts something he said dont quite know yet about the place about reeth about santo his family what not sure she blew out a breath the man would probably need a bloody ouija board lew angarrak joined them he was outfitted like jago reeth in a white boiler suit fashioned from heavy paper the perfect accompaniment to the rest of him which was also white his thick hair could have been any colourprobably salt and pepper considering his age which appeared to be somewhere past fortyfivebut now it looked like a barristers wig so thoroughly covered as it was by polystyrene dust this same dust formed a fine patina on his forehead and cheeks round his mouth and eyes there was none its absence explained by the air filter that dangled round his neck along with a pair of protective glasses behind him bea could see the board he was working on like the board being finished by the glasser it lay on two tall sawhorses shaped from its earlier form of a blank oblong of polystyrene that was marked in halves by a wooden stringer more of these blanks lined a wall to one side of the shaping room the other side bea saw bore a rack of tools planers sanders and surforms by the look of them angarrack wasnt a big man not much taller than bea herself but he appeared quite powerful in the upper body and bea reckoned he had a great deal of strength jago reeth had apparently put him in the picture about the facts of santos death but he didnt seem wary about seeing the police nor did he seem surprised or shocked or sorrowful for that matter bea introduced herself and constable mcnulty could they speak with mr angarrack that bits a formality isnt it he replied shortly youre here and i assume that means were going to be speaking perhaps you can show us round as we do so bea said i know nothing of making surfboards called shaping jago reeth told her he stood nearby little enough to see angarrack said shaping spraying glassing finishing theres a room for each he used his thumb to indicate them as he spoke the door to the spraying room was open but unlit and he flipped a switch on the wall bright colours leapt out at them sprayed onto the walls the floors and the ceiling another sawhorse stood in the middle of the room but no board waited upon it although five stood against the wall shaped and ready for someones artistry you decorate them as well bea asked not me an oldtimer did the designs for a time till he moved on then santo did them as a way of paying for a board he wanted im looking for someone else now because of santos death no id already sacked him why id guess youd say loyalty to my daughter santos girlfriend for a time but that time was past he moved by them and out into the showroom where an electric kettle stoodalong with brochures a clipboard thick with paperwork and board designson a card table behind the counter he plugged this in and said you want something and when they demurred he called out jago black and nasty jago returned tell us about santo kerne bea said as lew went about his business with coffee crystals which he loaded up into one mug cup and used more sparingly in another he bought a board from me couple years ago hed been watching the surfers round the promontory and he said he wanted to learn hed started out down at clean barrel surf shop mcnulty murmured as if believing bea would need a translator and will mendick bloke who used to work there recommended he get a board from me i place some boards in clean barrel but not a lot no money in retail jago called from the other room too right that angarrack said santo had liked the look of one at clean barrel but it was too advanced for him although he wouldnt have known that at the time it was a short board a threefin thruster he asked about it but will knew hed not learn well with thatif he learned at allso he sent him to me i made him a board he could learn on something wider longer with a single fin and madlynthats my daughtergave him lessons thats how they became involved then essentially the kettle clicked off angarrack poured the water into the mugs stirred the liquid and said here it is mate which brought jago reeth to join them he drank noisily how did you feel about that bea asked angarrack about their involvement she noted that jago was watching lew intently interesting she thought and she made a mental tick against both of their names truth i didnt like it she lost her focus before she had a goal the nationals international competitions after she met santo all of that was gone she could still see beyond the nose on her face but she couldnt see an inch beyond santo kerne first love jago commented its brutal they were both too young angarrack said not even seventeen when they met and i dont know how old when they began he made a gesture with his hand to indicate they were to complete the sentence became lovers bea said its not love at that age angarrack told her not for boys but for her stars in the eyes and cotton wool in the head santo this and santo that i wish i could have done something to prevent it way of the world lew jago leaned against the doorway to the glassing room mug in his hand i didnt forbid her seeing him angarrack went on what would have been the point but i told her to have a care as to what the obvious bad enough she wasnt competing any longer even worse if she came up pregnant or worse than that worse diseased ah sounds as if you thought the boy was promiscuous i didnt know what the hell he was and i didnt want to find out by means of madlyn being in some sort of trouble any sort of trouble so i warned her and then i let it be angarrack had not yet taken up his mug but he did so now and he took a gulp that was probably my mistake he said why did she she wouldve got over him faster when things ended as it is she hasnt i daresay she will now bea said the two men exchanged looks quick nearly furtive bea noted this and made two more mental ticks against them she said we found a tshirt design for liquidearth on santos computer constable mcnulty brought the drawing forth and passed it over to the surfboard shaper was that at your request bea asked angarrack shook his head when madlyn finished with santo i finished with santo as well he might have been doing a design to pay for the new board another board hed got way beyond the first he needed another beyond the learning board if he was going to improve but once i sacked him he had no way to pay me back for the board this might have been it he handed the design back to mcnulty bea said to the constable show him the other and mcnulty brought forth the design for commit an act of subversion and handed it over lew looked at it and shook his head he passed it on to jago who knuckled his spectacles into place read the logo and said will mendick this was for him the bloke from clean barrel surf shop bea said used to be he works at blue star grocery now whats the significance of the design hes freegan least thats what santo said he calls himself freegan ive not heard that term only eats whats free clobber he growss well as muck from wheelie bins behind the market and in back of restaurants how appealing is this a movement or something like jago shrugged dont know do i but he and santo were mates more or less so it mightve been a favour the tshirt that is bea was gratified to hear the sound of constable mcnulty jotting all of this down instead of studying the nearby surfing posters she was less gratified when he suddenly said to jago ever see the big waves hed coloured as he spoke as if he knew he was out of order but could no longer contain himself oh aye ke iki waimea jaws teahupoo big as they say depends on the weather jago said big as office blocks sometimes bigger where when and then apologetically to bea i mean to go you see the wife and i and the kidsits a dreamand when we go i want to be sure of the place and the wavesyou know surf then do you jago asked bit not like you lot but i thatll do constable bea told mcnulty he looked anguished an opportunity ripped from his hands i just wanted to know where might we find your daughter she asked lew angarrack waving mcnulty impatiently to silence lew finished his coffee and placed his mug on the card table he said why do you want madlyn i should think thats rather obvious as it happens its not former and potentially discarded lover of santo kerne mr angarrack shes got to be interviewed like everyone else it was clear that angarrack didnt like the direction in which bea intended to head but he told her where she could find his daughter at her place of employment bea gave him her card circling her mobile number if he thought of anything else he nodded and returned to his work shutting the door to the shaping room behind him a moment later the sound of an electric tool shrieked in the building again jago reeth remained with bea and the constable he said casting a look over his shoulder one more thingi got a conscious on this so if you have a moment for nother word and when bea nodded he said id be chuffed if lew didnt know this got me the way things turned out hell be dead cheesed off if he knows what jago shifted his weight was me giving them the place i know i probly shouldntve i saw that afterwards but by then the bloody milk was spilt couldnt exactly pour it back into the bottle when it was spread all over the floor could i while i admire your adherence to your metaphor bea told him perhaps you could make it more clear santo and madlyn i go to the salthouse inn regular in the afternoons have a mate i meet over there most days santo and madlyn they used my place then for sex he didnt look happy about making the admission could have left them to sort things out on their own but it seemedi wanted them to be safe see not in the backseat of a car somewhere not ini dont know yet as his father owns a hotel bea pointed out jago wiped his mouth on the back of his wrist all right yeah theres the rooms at the old promontory king george for what theyre worth but that didnt meanthe two of them therei justoh hell i couldnt be sure hed use what he needed to use to keep her safe so i left them for him right by the bed condoms he looked moderately embarrassed an old bloke unused to having such a frank conversation with someone he might otherwise have deemed a lady one of the fairer sex bea thought she could see this thought playing across his face he used em but not every time see and you know he used them because bea prompted he looked horrified good god woman im not sure god had much to do with this mr reeth if youd answer the question did you count them up before and after search them out in the rubbish what he looked miserable both he said bloody hell i care about that girl shes got a good heart bit of a temper but a good heart way i saw it it was going to happen between them anyways so i might as well make certain it happened right where would this be your house i mean ive a caravan over in sea dreams bea glanced at constable mcnulty and he nodded he knew the place that was good she said we may want to see it reckoned as much he shook his head young people whats consequences to them when theyre young yes well in the heat of the moment who thinks of consequences bea asked but its more than consequences isnt it jago said just like this he was now apparently referring to one of the posters on the wall it depicted a surfboard shooting into the air its rider in the middle of a massive and memorable wipeout that had him looking crucified against a background of water that was a monstrous wave they dont think of the moment itself let alone beyond the moment and look what happens whos that mcnulty asked approaching the poster bloke called mark foo minute or two before the poor bastard died mcnultys mouth formed a respectful o and he began to respond bea saw him settling in for a proper surfing natter and she could only imagine where a trip down this watery and mournful memory lane was going to lead them she said that looks a bit more dangerous than sea cliff climbing doesnt it perhaps santos father had the right idea discouraging surfing trying to keep the boy from what he loved what kind of ideas that perhaps one that was intended to keep him alive but it didnt keep him alive did it jago reeth said end of the day thats not always something we can do for others daidre trahair used the internet once again in max priestleys office in the watchman but she had to pay this time round max didnt ask for money however the price was an interview with one of his two reporters steve teller he said just happened to be in the office working on the story of the murder of santo kerne she was the missing piece the crime asked for an eyewitness account daidre said murder because she decided the response was expected shed seen the body and shed seen the sling but max didnt know that although he might suppose it cops gave us the word this morning max told her steves working in the layout room as im using the computer just now youll have time to have a word with him daidre didnt believe that max was using the computer but she didnt argue she didnt want to be involved didnt want her name her photo the location of her cottage or anything else related to her put into the paper but she saw no way to avoid it that wouldnt arouse the newsmans suspicion so she agreed she needed the computer and this spot afforded her more time and privacy than the sole computer in the library did she was being paranoidand she damn well knew itbut embracing paranoia seemed the course of wisdom so she went with max to the layout room taking a moment to cast a surreptitious look at him in order to ascertain whatever might lie beneath the surface of his composure like her he walked the coastal path shed come across him more than once at the top of one sea cliff or another his dog his only companion the fourth or fifth time theyd joked with each other saying weve got to stop meeting like this and shed asked him why he walked the path so much hed said lily liked it and as for him he liked to be alone an only child hed said im used to solitude but shed never thought that was the truth of the matter he wasnt readable on this day not that he ever was particularly he was as ever put together like a man stepping out of a country life fantasy pictorial on daily doings in cornwall the collar of a crisp blue shirt rose above a creamcoloured fishermans sweater he was cleanly shaven and his spectacles glinted in the overhead lights as spotless as the rest of him a fortysomething man without sin heres our quarry steve he said as they entered the layout room where the reporter was working at a pc in the corner shes agreed to an interview show her no mercy daidre cast him a look you make it sound as if im involved somehow you didnt appear surprised not to mention horrified to hear it was murder max said they locked eyes she weighed potential answers and settled on id seen the body you forget that obvious was it initial knowledge given out was that hed fallen i think it was meant to look that way she heard teller typing away at his pc and she said rather too sharply i hadnt indicated that the interview was beginning max chuckled youre with a journalist my dear everything is meat with due respect forewarned et cetera i see she sat and knew she did so primly perched on the edge of a ladderback chair that would have had to work hard to be more uncomfortable she kept her shoulder bag on her knees her hands folded over the top of it she knew she looked like a schoolmarm or a hopeful interviewee that couldnt be helped and she didnt try to help it she said im not entirely happy about this no one ever is save blist celebrities max left them then calling out janna have we heard about the inquest time yet janna made some reply from the other room as steve teller asked daidre his first question he wanted the facts first and then her impressions second he told her the latter she decided was the last thing shed give anyone least of all a journalist but like a policeman he was doubtless trained to sniff out falsehoods and note diversions so she would have a care with how she said what she said she didnt like leaving things to chance the entire watchman experience ate up two hours and was evenly divided between the conversation with teller and her investigation on the internet when she had what she needed in print for her later perusal she concluded her research with the words adventures unlimited she paused before she clicked the search engine into action it was a case of wondering how far she really wanted to go was it better to know or not to know and if she knew could she keep the knowledge from her face she wasnt sure the list of references to the neophyte business wasnt long the mail on sunday had featured it in a lengthy piece she saw as had several small journals in cornwall the watchman was among them and why not she asked herself adventures unlimited was a casvelyn story the watchman was the casvelyn newspaper the promontory king george hotel had been saved from destructionwell come along daidre its a listed building so it was hardly going under the wrecking ball was itso there was that as well she read the story and looked at the photos it was all standard stuff the architectural interest the plan the family and there they were in pictures santo among them there was background on them all with no one emphasised in particular because it was of course a family affair last of all she looked at the byline she saw that max had done the story himself this was not unusual because the newspaper was tiny and consequently work was shared but it was potentially damning all the same she asked herself what this was to her max santo kerne the sea cliffs and adventures unlimited she thought of donne and then dismissed the thought of donne unlike the poet there were too many times when she didnt feel part of mankind at all she left the newspaper office she was thinking about max priestley and about what shed read when she heard her name called she turned round to see thomas lynley coming along princes street a large piece of cardboard under his arm and a small bag dangling from his fingers once again she thought how different he looked without the growth of beard newly dressed and at least partially refreshed she said youre not looking too chastened by the trouncing you took at the dartboard last night may i assume your egos intact thomas marginally he said i was up all night practicing in the bar at the inn where by the way i learned that you regularly thrash all comers practically blindfolded the way they tell it they exaggerate im afraid do they what other secrets are you keeping roller derby she told him are you familiar with that its an american sport featuring frightening women bashing one another about on inline skates good lord weve a fledging team in bristol and im absolute hell on wheels as a jammer far more ruthless on my blades than i am with my darts were boudicas broads by the way and im kickarse electra we all have suitably threatening monikers you never cease to surprise dr trahair i like to consider that part of my charm what have you got then with a nod at his package ah youre very well met as things turn out may i stow this in your car its the replacement glass for the window i broke at your cottage and the tools to fix it as well however did you know the size ive been out there to measure he cocked his head in the vague direction of her cottage far north of the town i had to go inside again finding you gone he admitted i hope you dont mind i trust you didnt break another window to do so didnt have to with the first one broken best to get it repaired before someone else discovers the damage and avails himself ofwhatever youve got cached away within little enough she said unless someone wants to nick my dartboard would they only he replied fervently at which she chuckled he said so now that weve met may i stow this in your car she led him to it shed left the vauxhall in the same spot where shed left it on the previous day in the car park across from toes on the nose which was hosting another gathering of surfers although this time they stood about outside gazing vaguely towards st mevan beach from the vantage point of the car park the promontory king george hotel squared off some three hundred yards away she pointed the structure out to lynley that was where santo kerne came from she told him then she said you didnt mention murder thomas you must have known last night but you said nothing why do you assume i knew you went off with that detective in the afternoon youre one yourself a detective that is i cant think she didnt tell you brotherhood of police and all that she told me he admitted am i a suspect we all are myself included and did you tell her what that i knewor at least recognisedsanto kerne he took his time about answering and she wondered why no he said at last i didnt tell her why he didnt reply to this instead he said ah your car as they reached it she wanted to press him for an answer but she also didnt much want the answer because she wasnt sure what shed do with it when she got it she fumbled in her bag for her keys the paperwork she was carrying from the watchman slipped from her grasp and slid onto the tarmac she said damn as it soaked up rainwater she started to squat to gather it up lynley said let me and ever the gentleman he set down his package and bent to retrieve it ever the cop as well he glanced at it and then at her she felt herself colouring he said hoping for a miracle are you my social life has been rather bleak for the past few years everything helps i find may i ask why you didnt tell me thomas tell you what that santo kerne had been murdered it cant have been privileged information max priestley knew it he handed her the printouts shed made from the internet and picked up his own package as she unlocked the vauxhalls boot and max priestley is the publisher and editor of the watchman i spoke to him earlier as a journalist he would have been given the word from di hannaford i expect shed be the officer determining when information gets disseminated as i doubt theres a press officer here in town unless shes directed someone to act as one it wouldnt be up to me to tell anyone until hannaford was ready for the word to go out i see she couldnt say to him but i thought we were friends because that was hardly the case there seemed no point to carrying the matter further so she said are you coming out to the cottage now then to repair the window he told her he had a few things more to do in town but that afterwards if she didnt mind he would drive out to polcare cove and make the repair she asked him if he actually knew how to repair a window somehow one didnt expect an earlgainfully employed as a cop or notto know what to do with glass and putty he told her he was certain he could muddle through it somewhat proficiently then he said for reasons she couldnt sort out dyou generally do your research at the newspaper office i generally dont do research at all she told him especially when im in cornwall but if theres something i need to look up yes i use the watchman max priestleys got a retriever ive doctored so he gives me access that cant be the only internet site consider where we are thomas im lucky theres access in casvelyn at all she gestured south in the direction of the wharf i could use the librarys access i suppose but they dole out time fifteen minutes and the next person gets a whack its maddening if youre trying to do something more meaningful than answer your email more private as well i suppose lynley said theres that she admitted and we know you like privacy she smiled but she knew the effort showed it was time for an exit graceful or otherwise she told him she would perhaps see him when he came to repair her window then she took herself off she could feel his steady gaze on her as she left the car park lynley watched her go she was a cipher in more ways than one holding much to herself some of it had to do with santo kerne he reckoned he wanted to believe that not all of it did he wasnt sure why this was the case but he did admit to himself that he liked the woman he admired her independence and what appeared to be a lifestyle of going against the common grain she was unlike anyone else he knew but that in itself raised questions who was she exactly and why did she seem to have sprung into existence as an adolescent fully formed like athena from the head of zeus the questions about her were deeply disturbing he had to acknowledge the fact that a hundred red flags surrounded this woman only some of them having to do with a dead boy at the foot of a cliff nearby her cottage he walked from the car park to the police station at the end of lansdown road this was a narrow cobbled lane of white terrace houses ill roofed and largely stained by rainwater from rusty gutters most of them had fallen into the disrepair prevalent in the poorer sections of cornwall where gentrification had not yet extended its greedy fingers one of them was undergoing refurbishment however its scaffolding suggesting that better times for someone had come to the neighbourhood the police station was an eyesore even here a grey stucco building with nothing of architectural interest to recommend itself it was flat in front and flat on top a shoe box with occasional windows and a notice board near its door inside a small vestibule offered a line of three institutional plastic chairs and a reception counter bea hannaford sat behind this the telephone receiver pressed to her ear she raised a finger in greeting to lynley and said to whoever was on the other end of the line got it well theres no surprise in that is therewell want to have another little chat with her wont we then she rang off and took lynley up to the incident room which was set up on the first floor of the building in what seemed to be otherwise a conference room coffee room locker room and meal room up here they were making do with a few china boards and computers set up with holmes but clearly an insufficiency of manpower the constable and the sergeant were hard at it lynley saw and two other officers were huddled together exchanging either information on the case or background on the horses currently running at newmarket it was difficult to tell actions were listed on the china board some completed and others pending di hannaford said to sergeant collins man reception sergeant and then to lynley when collins left the room to do so she was lying as it turns out he said who although there was only one she theyd been looking at as far as he knew pro forma question isnt that the di said meaningfully our dr trahair thats who not a pub remembers her on the route she claimed she took from bristol and shed be remembered this time of year considering how few people are out and about in this part of the country perhaps he said but there must be a hundred pubs involved not the way she came claiming that was the route may have been her first mistake and where theres one there are others trust me whatve you got on her lynley related what hed gleaned from falmouth about daidre trahair he added what he knew about her brother her work and her education everything shed said about herself checked out he told her so far so good why is it i think youre not telling me everything there is to tell was bea hannafords reply after a moment of observing him are you holding back something superintendent lynley he wanted to say that he wasnt superintendent lynley any longer he wasnt anything related to police work which was why he also wasnt required to tell her every fact he had acquired but he said shes doing some curious research on the internet just now theres that although i cant see how it relates to murder what sort of research miracles he said or rather places associated with miracles lourdes for one a church in new mexico there were others as well but i didnt have time to look through all the paperwork and i wasnt wearing my reading glasses anyway shes been on the internet at the watchman thats the local paper she knows the publisher evidently thatd be max priestley it was constable mcnulty speaking up from a computer in one corner of the room hes been in touch with the dead boy by the way has he indeed bea hannaford said now thats an interesting twist she told lynley that the constable was digging through santo kernes old emails looking for nuggets of information whats he saying no skin off my back just watch your own i reckon its priestley cause its come from mep at watchmanco et cetera although it could have come from anyone who knows his password and has access to a computer at the paper i spose thats it hannaford asked the constable thats it from priestley but theres a whole collection from the angarrack girl coming straight out of liquidearth the course of most of the relationship being charted casual closer intimate hot graphic and then nothing else like once they started doing the nasty she didnt want to commit it to writing interesting that bea noted swhat i thought as well but wild for him doesnt even touch how she felt about the boy you ask me ill wager she wouldntve said no to the idea of someone chopping off his bollocks when they got to the endgame her and santo what dthey say about a womans scorn a woman scorned lynley murmured right well id say we give her a closer look shedve likely had access to his climbing kit at some point or shedve known where he kept it shes on our list hannaford said is that it then ive got emails from someone calling himself freeganman as well and id say thats mendick cause i doubt the towns crawling with people of his ilk hannaford explained the moniker to lynley how theyd come to know it and with whom it was associated she said to the constable and whats mr mendick got to say for himself can we keep it between us not exactly illuminating ill give you that but still a reason to talk to him then lets put blue star grocery on the schedule right mcnulty went back to the computer hannaford strode over to a desk where she dug in a heavylooking shoulder bag she brought forth a mobile phone this she tossed to lynley she said receptions the devil round here ive found but i want you carrying this and i want it turned on your reason lynley asked i need a stated reason do i superintendent if nothing else because i outrank you would have been his answer in other circumstances but not in these he said im curious it suggests my usefulness to you hasnt come to an end that would be correct im undermanned and i want you available to me im not bollocks once a cop always a cop theres a need here and you and i know youre not about to walk away from a situation where your help is required beyond that youre a principal figure and youre not going anywhere without me coming after you until you have my blessing to leave so you may as well make yourself useful to me youve something in mind dr trahair details everything from her shoe size to her blood type and all points in between how am i supposed to oh please detective dont take me for a fool youve sources and youve charm use them both dig into her background take her on a picnic wine her dine her read her poetry caress her palm gain her trust i dont bloody care how you do it just do it and when youve done it i want it all are we clear on that sergeant collins had appeared in the doorway as hannaford was speaking he said guv someone to see you queer bird called tammy penrule down below says shes got information for you the di said to lynley keep that phone charged take your spade and use it do whatever you have to do im not comfortable with thats not my concern murders not comfortable either chapter thirteen downstairs bea found the named tammy penrule sitting in one of the plastic reception chairs her feet flat on the floor her hands clasped in her lap her back a plane perpendicular to the seat she was dressed in black but she wasnt a goth as bea first suspected when she caught sight of her she wore no makeup no hideous black nail enamel and she had no silver protrusions erupting from various points on her head she also wore no jewellery and nothing else relieved the midnight of her clothes she looked like mourning made flesh tammy penrule bea said to her unnecessarily the girl jumped to her feet she was thin as workhouse gruel one couldnt look at her without considering eating disorders youve got information for me when the girl nodded bea said come with me then before she realised she had not yet located the interview rooms at the station stumbling about wasnt going to inspire confidence in anyone so she reversed herself said hang on a moment and found a cubbyhole next to a broom closet that would do until further exploration of the station might provide its secret as to the site of interrogations when she had tammy penrule situated in this spot she said to her whatve you got to tell me tammy licked her lips she needed balm for them they were badly chapped and a thin line of scabbing marked a spot where her lower lip had cracked seriously enough to bleed its about santo kerne she said ive got that much bea crossed her arms beneath her breasts unconsciously it seemed tammy did the same although she had no breasts to speak of and bea wondered if santo kernes relationship with madlyn angarrack had ended because of this girl she hadnt yet met madlyn but the fact that the girl had been a competitive surfer suggested someoneperhaps more physically defined was the term she wanted this teenager seemed more like an evanescent being corporeal only as long as she had the strength to manifest in human form bea couldnt picture her spreadeagled beneath a hotblooded adolescent boy tammy said santo talked to me ah the girl seemed to be waiting for more of a response so bea said cooperatively how did you know him from clean barrel surf shop tammy said its where i work he comes there for wax and the like and to look at the isobar chart except i think that may have been just an excuse to hang about with the other surfers you cn look up the isobar chart on the internet and i expect theyve got internet over at the hotel adventures unlimited tammy nodded the hollow of her throat was deep and shadowed above the neck of her jersey the points of her collarbone protruded like the excrescent evidence of dutch elm disease on the bark of a tree so thats how i know him that and sea dreams bea recognised the name of the caravan park and she cocked her head perhaps shed been wrong about this girl and santo she said did you meet him there no like i said i met him at clean barrel sorry i dont mean met him as in met him bea clarified i mean met him as in having assignations with him tammy flushed there was so little substance between her skin and her blood vessels that she coloured nearly to purple and she did so quickly you meansanto and mefor sex oh no i live there at sea dreams my granddad owns the caravan park i knew santo from clean barrel like i said but he came to sea dreams with madlyn and he came on his own as well because theres a cliff he used to practise on sometimes and granddad said he could get to it across our land if he wanted to abseil anyway i saw him there and we talked sometimes on his own bea asked this was something new like i said he climbed down and up but sometimes just up so hed come from belowor i suppose he just went down and then up all the time because i cant quite remember he also visited mr reeth so did she madlyn mr reeth he works for madlyns dad at yes i know weve spoken to him but what she didnt know was that santo had been there to sea dreams on his own this was a new wrinkle he was nice santo he was especially nice to girls i gather tammys flush had receded and she didnt flush again yes i suppose he was but it wasnt like that for me becausewell thats not important what is important is that we talked from time to time when he was finished with his climbing or when he was leaving mr reeths or sometimes when he was waiting for madlyn to get there from work they didnt come together not always madlyn works in town now but she didnt earlier she had to come a greater distance than santo from out by brandis corner she worked on a farm making jam i expect she preferred teaching surfing oh yes she did she does but thats in the season when she teaches surfing shes got to do something else the rest of the year she works in the bakery now in town they make pasties mostly for wholesale but they sell some of them out of the shop as well and where does santo fit in with all this santo of course shed been using her hands to gesture with as she talked but now she clasped them again in her lap she said we talked now and again i liked him but i didnt like him in the way most girls probably would if you know what i mean so i think that made me different and maybe safer or something for advice or whatever because he couldnt go to his dad or his mum why not his dad he said wouldve got the wrong impression and his mumi dont know his mum but i get the idea sheswell shes not very mummish apparently she smoothed her skirt it looked like something that would be scratchy against the skin and it was virtually shapeless a fashion penance anyway santo asked me for advice about something and thats what i thought you ought to know advice of what kind she seemed to look for a gentle way to say what came next and not finding a euphemism went for a circuitous route to the truth he washed got someone new you see and the situation was irregularthats the word he used when he talked to me he said it was irregularand he wanted to ask me what i thought he should do about that irregular that was his word youre sure tammy nodded he said he thought he loved herthis is madlynbut he wanted this other thing as well he said he wanted it very badly and if he wanted this other thing the way he wanted this other thing did it mean he didnt actually love madlyn he talked to you about love then no that part was more like santo talking to santo he wanted to know what i thought he should do about the whole situation should he be honest with everyone about it he wanted to know should he tell the truth start to finish he asked and what did you tell him i said he should be honest i said he should always be honest because when people are honest about who they are what they want and what they do it gives other peoplethis is the people theyre involved with i meanthe chance to decide if they really want to be with them she looked at bea and her expression was earnest so i suppose he was you see she said honest i mean and thats why ive come i think that maybe hes dead because of it more than anything else its a question of balance was the declaration that alan used to conclude you see that dont you darling kerras hackles stood stiffly darling was too much there was no darling she was no darling she thought shed made that clear to alan but the bloody man refused to believe it they stood before the glassfronted notice board in the entry area of the former hotel your instructors was the purpose of their discussion the imbalance between male and female instructors was alans point in charge of hiring all of the instructors kerra had allowed the balance to swing to females this was not good for several reasons according to alan for marketing purposes they needed an equal number of men and women offering instruction in the various activities and if possible and what was highly desirable they needed more male than female they needed the males to be nicely built and good looking because first of all such men could serve as a feature to bring unmarried females to adventures unlimited and second of all alan intended to use them in a video hed lined up a crew from plymouth to take video footage by the way so whatever instructors kerra came up with also needed to be onboard within three weeks or he supposedthinking aloudperhaps they could actually use actorsno stuntmenyes stuntmen could be very good in making the video actually the initial outlay would be higher because stuntmen no doubt had some sort of scale upon which they were paid but it wouldnt take as long to film them because theyd be professionals so the final cost would likely not be as high so he was absolutely maddening kerra wanted to argue with him and she had been arguing but hed matched her point for point he said the publicity from that mail on sunday article helped us enormously but that was seven months back and were going to need to do more if were to begin heading in the direction of the black we wont be in the black of course not this year and probably not next but the point is we have to chip away at debt so everyone has to consider how best to get us out of the red red did it for her red held her between wanting to run and wanting to argue she said im not refusing to hire men alan if thats what youre implying i can hardly be blamed if theyre not applying in droves to work here its not a question of blame he reassured her but to be honest i do wonder how aggressive youre being in trying to recruit them not aggressive at all she couldnt be but what was the point in telling him that she said with the greatest courtesy she could manage very well ill start with the watchman how much can we spend on an advertisement for instructors oh well need a much wider net than that alan said affably i doubt an ad in the watchman would do us much good at all we need to go national advertisements placed in specialised magazines at least one for each sport he studied the notice board where the pictures of the instructors were posted then he looked at kerra you do see my point dont you kerra we must consider them as an attraction theyre more than merely instructors theyre a reason to come to adventures unlimited like social directors on a cruise line come to adventures unlimited for a shag kerra said yes ive got the point well enough thats the implication naturally alan said sex sells you know that it all gets reduced to sex in the end doesnt it kerra said bitterly he gazed at the pictures again he was either evaluating them or avoiding her he said well yes i suppose it does thats how life is she left him without replying she said abruptly that she was going to the watchman if anyone wanted her daring him to make his point again about the futility of placing an advertisement in that paper and she set out on her bicycle this time however she had no intention of riding until the sweat of her efforts bled the anxiety from her muscles she also had no intention of going to the watchman to place an advertisement for randy males willing to instruct equally randy females during daylight hours and fulfill their sexual fantasies at night that was all they needed at adventures unlimited an excess of testosterone oozing down the corridors kerra pedaled off the promontory in the direction of toes on the nose where she was forced to follow the oneway system through town she climbed to the crest of the hill where st mevan down rolled inland from the sea and made her way to queen street with its clutter of cars ultimately she coursed downward towards the casvelyn canal where just beyond the wharf that edged it a bridge arched to a y in the road go left and you ultimately headed to widemouth bay go right and you found yourself out on the breakwater this formed the southwest side of the canal just as the wharf served as its northeastern edge cottages lined it sitting some fifteen feet above the tarmac and at their far end was the largest of them one that only a blind man could miss seeing it was trimmed in fuchsia and painted the pink of flamingos unimaginatively it was called pink cottage and its owner was a maiden lady long referred to by townspeople as busy lizzie and only in part as a reference to the flowers she planted in her front garden in enormous banks with riotous abandon every late spring kerra was known to busy lizzie as a regular visitor so when she knocked on the door the woman admitted her without question saying why isnt this the nicest surprise kerra alans not here at the moment but i expect you know that come in my dear she was not even five feet tall and shed long reminded kerra of a chess piece specifically she looked very much like a pawn she wore her white hair in an impressively constructed edwardian pouf and she favoured highnecked ivory blouses and bellshaped flannel skirts of navy or grey that fell to the floor she always looked like someone on the verge of being discovered for a part in a henry james novel brought to film but as far as kerra had ever been able to learnwhich admittedly wasnt very farbusy lizzie had no inclination for either screen or stage she let one of the bedrooms in her house the rest being filled with her vast collection of carlton ware from the s she was liberal in her thinking and preferring young men to young women as her lodgerssomehow one always feels safer with a man in the house was her way of putting itshe recognised that her lodgers had appetites whose fulfillment she oughtnt deny so each successive lodger had kitchen privileges and if a sleepover occurred in which a young lady might put in an appearance at the breakfast table busy lizzie did not complain indeed she provided either tea or coffee and she asked sleep well dear quite as if the young lady belonged there while his house in lansdown road was undergoing work alan had his temporary lodging here in pink cottage he could have moved in with his parentsit would have saved him moneybut hed explained to kerra that while he loved his mum and dad devotedly he liked to have a degree of freedom that his parents blind adoration of him sometimes precluded besides hed delicately said to her they had a certain image of him that he didnt want to mess about with kerra read this as he intended she said god they cant think youre a virgin alan and when he didnt answer do they alan no no of course not of course they dont what a ridiculousthey know im normal but theyre older people arent they and its a sign of respect to them that i dont take a woman to bed while im unmarried and under their roof theyd feel verywell odd about it kerra understood at least at first but in the end the whole question of alan having this lodging separate from his parents began to have a different resonance so she had to know she had to be certain she said to busy lizzie ive left a rather personal item in alans room miss careyfor such was her nameand i wonder if i might dash in and have a look for it alans forgotten to give me his key but if youd like to phone him at work oh my dear no need of that the rooms unlocked anyway as this is bedlinen day you know the way i was just watching my telly would you like a cup of tea do you need my help kerra demurred both the offer of tea and the offer of help she shouldnt be long she said shed let herself out when she had what shed come for and are you riding about in the rain my dear on your bicycle why youll catch your death kerra are you sure you wouldnt care for a nice cup of pg tips no no she was fine kerra assured miss carey she was right as rain they both chuckled at her lame remark and they parted at the far end of the sitting room busy lizzie went back to her telly as kerra ducked into the corridor that led along to the far end of the house there alans room overlooked the southwest section of st mevan beach from the window kerra could see that the tide was in the waves were breaking from threefoot swells and at least a dozen surfers bobbed in the distance kerra turned from the sight of them the thought came to her of her father last night and of what it meant that part of his life was hidden from her but she dismissed this consideration because now was not the time and anyway she had to work quickly she was looking for signs without actually knowing what the signs would be she needed to understand why the alan cheston of the last few days was not the alan cheston she had known and involved herself with she reckoned she knew the explanation but still she wanted hard evidence although what she would do with it when she had it was something she hadnt yet considered shed also never done a search before the whole enterprise made her feel unclean but there was no alternative other than hurling accusations at him and going that route was something she couldnt afford to do she girded herself mentally and began to look about it was she saw all so vintage alan with every item in its place his djembe drum stood in its stand in the corner of the room in front of a stool upon which alan sat when he played it during his daily meditation a tambourinesomething of a joke gift that kerra had given him before shed understood how significant the drum actually was to alans spiritual regimenleaned nearby against a bookcase where he kept his yoga books on top of this bookcase were his photos alan wearing the cap and gown of the university graduate flanked by his beaming parents alan and kerra on a holiday in portsmouth his arm round her shoulders on the deck of the victory kerra by herself perched on the flat stone top of lanyon quoit a younger alan with his childhood dog a mixedbreed terrier with a coat the colour of rusty bedsprings the trouble was that kerra had no idea what she was looking for she wanted a sign but she didnt know if shed recognise anything that wasnt written out for her by means of flashing neon lights she prowled the room opening and closing drawers in the chest and then in the desk aside from neatly folded clothes in conservative hues the only items of interest she came up with were a collection of birthday cards given or sent to him through the years and a list entitled fiveyear objectives upon which she read that among other things he intended to learn italian take xylophone lessons and visit patagonia in addition to marry kerra which came before patagonia but after italian and then in a tarnished silver toast rack where alan kept his mail she found it the item without a purpose in the bedroom of a man for whom every item had a purpose either in the present the past or the future this was a postcard tucked at the back of correspondence from alans bank his dentist and the london school of economics the picture on the card was taken from the sea into the shore and the view presented was of two deep sea caves one on either side of a cove above the cove was a cornish village well known to kerra as it was the place shed been sent with her brother throughout their childhoods to stay with their grandparents while their mother was going through one of her spells pengelly cove they were not allowed to go to the beach there no matter the weather the reason given was the tide and the sea caves the tide came in fast the way it came in at morecambe bay deep in a sea cave where you thought you were safe with your explorationor whatever else you were doingthe water swept in and the walls marked its depth which was higher than the top of the tallest mans head as relentless as it was unforgiving kids just like you lotve died in those caves granddad would thunder so therell be no beachgoing while youre stopping here sides theres work enough round this place to keep you busy and if i see youre bored ill give you more but all of that was an excuse and they knew it kerra and santo beachgoing meant villagegoing and in the village they were known as the children of dellen kerne or dellen nankervis as shed been then long loose widespreading dellen the village tart dellen whose unmistakable handwriting formed the sentence this is it which was scripted in red on the face of the postcard in alans old toast rack from the it an arrow extended down to the sea cave on the south side of the cove kerra pocketed the postcard and looked about for something more but nothing else was actually needed cadan had spent the morning with a mouth that felt like a wrestlers jockstrap and a stomach doing a shimmy to his throat more hair of the dog that had bitten him was what hed needed from the getgo but an unexpected preadventures unlimited conversation with his sister had prevented him from doing a recce for his fathers booze not that madlyn would have reported cadan to lew had she caught him in the act of going through cupboardsdespite her general weirdness cadans sister had never been known to sneakbut she would have realised what he was doing and she would have ragged on him about it he couldnt handle that as it was hed had enough trouble merely responding to what she had to say when the subject wasnt him at all it was instead ione soutar whod phoned three times in the last thirtysix hours on one spurious excuse after another well she was stupid if she ever thought it was going to go somewhere madlyn had said i mean did they ever have anything between them besides sex and dating if you can call what they did dating because judging surfing competitions in newquay and having pizza nights and takeaway curry nights with those two obnoxious girls of hersnot exactly what id call a promising relationship would you so what was she thinking cadan was the last person capable of answering these questions and he wondered if madlyn herself ought to be holding forth on what comprised a promising relationship but he reckoned her final query was rhetorical and he was happy enough that he didnt have to reply madlyn went on all she had to do was look at his history but could she do that would she do that no and why because she saw him as father material and thats what she wanted for leigh and jennie well god knows they need that especially leigh cadan managed an answer to this jennies all right he hoped that would put an end to the matter leaving him to his headache and general queasiness in peace madlyn said oh i suppose if you like them that age shes all right the other one thoughleighs a real piece of work she said nothing for a moment and cadan saw that she was watching him watching pooh he was waiting for the parrot to finish a breakfast of sunflower seeds and apples pooh preferred english applescox if he could get thembut in a pinch and in the offseason he enjoyed an imported fuji which he was doing now madlyn continued but for gods sake hes had his kids why would he want to go through all that again and why didnt she see that i can see it cant you cadan mumbled noncommittally even if he hadnt felt like worshipping the porcelain god he knew better than to engage his sister lengthily or otherwise on the topic of their dad so he said come on pooh we got work to go to and he offered the last sixteenth of apple pooh ignored it and instead wiped his beak on his right claw then he set about investigating the feathers under his left wing looking like an avian miner with all the digging he was doing there cadan frowned and thought about mites in the meantime madlyn went on she was turning to use the mirror over the tiny coal fireplace in order to see to her hair in the past shed never given much attention to her hair but she hadnt needed to like cadans and like their fathers it was dark and curly kept short enough it was low maintenance a good shaking sorted it out in the morning but shed grown it because santo kerne had liked it longer once their whateveritwasbecausecadandidntwanttocallitarelationship ended hed thought shed cut itto get even with santo if for no other reasonbut so far she hadnt done so she hadnt got back to surfing yet either she said well hell move on to someone else now if he hasnt already and so will she and that will be an end to the whole thing oh i expect there may be a few more weeks of tearful phone calls but hell do his painedsilence thing and after a time shell get sick of that and realise shes thrown away three years of her life or however long its been because i cant remember and as the clock is ticking shell move on shell want a man before her sellby date comes along and believe me she knows its out there madlyn was pleased cadan could hear it in her voice the longer their father had seen ione soutar the more anxiety ridden madlyn had become shed been household goddess for most of her lifethanks to the bounders final bounding shortly before madlyns fifth birthdayand the last thing she had ever wanted was another woman usurping her position of sole female shed wielded considerable power from that position and no one with power ever wanted to let it go cadan scooped up the newspapers from beneath poohs perch balling them up against the detritus of his meal and the copious morning excretions of his body he spread out a fresh old edition of the watchman and said whatever were off then off where madlyn frowned to work work she didnt cadan thought need to sound so amazed adventures unlimited he told her i got hired there her face altered cadan could see how she would take the information as a fraternal betrayal no matter his need for gainful employment well she was going to have to take it whatever way she wanted to take it he required a source of income and jobs were practically nonexistent still he didnt want to engage her on the topic of adventures unlimited any more than hed wanted to engage her on the topic of ione soutar and the end of her affair with their father so he set pooh on his shoulder and said by way of diversion talking of sellby dates madwhat the hell were you doing with jago night before last his went by round forty years ago didnt it jago she said is a friend i got that much i like the bloke myself but you wont catch me spending the night out there are you actually suggestingyou know youre quite nasty cade if you need the information he came to tell me about santo but he didnt want to tell me at the bakery so he took me home because he cared about how i was going to react to the news he actually cares about me cadan and we dont you didnt like santo dont pretend you did hey at the end neither did you or did something change did he come crawling back to you begging forgiveness and declaring love cadan hooted pooh duplicated the sound exactly not bloody likely cadan said blow holes in the attic pooh remarked shrilly cadan winced at the sound so near his ear madlyn saw this she said you got drunk last night thats what you were doing in your room isnt it whats the matter with you cade he wished he could have answered that question hed have loved to do so but the fact was hed headed for the offlicence without thinking and in the same manner hed purchased the beefeater and in the same manner hed drunk it hed told himself that the fact that he was doing his drinking at home was admirable when one considered he could be out at a pub or sitting on a street corner orworsedriving round in a car while pouring gin down his throat but instead he was being responsible getting obliterated in silence within the four walls of his room where he would hurt no one but himself what this was related to hed not questioned but as his hangover subsideda blessed event that did not occur till the middle of the afternoonhe realised he was perilously close to having to think what he ended up thinking about was his father as well as madlyn and santo kerne but he didnt like where his thoughts headed when he bunched those three individuals together in his mind because when he did that the fourth thought that popped up like an unwanted uncle at christmas lunch was the thought of murder it went like this madlyn in love madlyn heartbroken santo dead lew angarrackwhat out with his surfboard on a day when not a single wave was worthy of a ride missing in action and determinedly mum on the subject of his whereabouts and what did those two considerations add up to a daughter scorned a father enraged cadan didnt want to begin an extended consideration of that topic so he considered will mendick instead torchbearer of love for madlyn unrequited love for madlyn waiting to step in as chief comforter once santo kerne was finally dispatched but would will have had access to santos climbing equipment cadan wondered and was will the sort to go for such a crafty way to dispose of someone and even if the answer to both of those questions was yes wasnt the real question whether will was actually so hot for madlyns knickers that hed get rid of santo in the hope of closing the deal with madlyn did that even make sense why rid madlyns life of santo when santo himself had already rid her life of santo unless santos death had nothing to do with madlyn at alland wouldnt that be a bloody relief but if it did have to do with madlyn what about jago then jago in the role of elderly avenger whod suspect an old bloke with shakes like a barman making martinis he was hardly fit enough to sit on the loo unassisted let alone in the shape one considered necessary to do away with another human being except it had been a handsoff murder hadnt it santos equipment had been messed about with if kerra kerne was to be believed surely jago could have managed that but then so could any of them so could madlyn for instance so could lew so could will so could kerra kerne or alan cheston or father christmas or the easter bunny cadans head felt stuffed with cotton wool it was too soon after the hangover to be doing any serious thinking about anything really he hadnt taken a break since his arrival at adventures unlimited that morning and he was owed one at this point perhaps some fresh airand even a sandwichwould allow him to dwell on these thoughts more clearly pooh had been patient without doing the slightest bit of damage and only once letting his bird bowels loose hed spent hours watching cadan paint radiators from his perch on a series of showercurtain rods he too was owed some r r and he probably wouldnt say no to a bite of sandwich cadan hadnt brought one from home so that was a bit of a problem but he could solve it with a quick trip for takeaway from toes on the nose now that his stomach had returned to its normal condition tuna and sweet corn on brown bread sounded good to him with crisps on the side and a coke first he needed to move his painting supplies to the next room up for radiator refreshment something he accomplished quickly he headed for the stairwayforgoing the groaning old lift that frankly gave him the williesand shared with pooh what was coming next he said toes on the nose and behave yourself no swearing in front of the ladies which ladies are you talking about the question came from behind him cadan swung about santo kernes mother had appeared from out of nowhere like a spirit materialising directly through the wainscoting she was coming towards him soundlessly on the new carpet runner she wore black once again but now it was relieved at her throat by a billowy red scarf that exactly matched the red of her shoes those shoes reminded cadan ridiculously of a description hed heard once of the wizard of oz the story of two old birds fighting over a pair of red shoes he smiled unconsciously at the thought dellen returned the smile you didnt ask him not to swear in front of me she had a throaty voice like a blues singer he said stupidly what your bird when we were first introduced you didnt tell him not to swear in my presence i wonder how im to take that cadan am i not a lady he hadnt the first clue how to reply so he chuckled lamely he waited for her to pass him in the corridor she didnt do so he said going to lunch she looked at her watch rather late for that isnt it i wasnt hungry earlier and are you now hungry that is bit yeah good come with me she went towards the stairs but she didnt descend instead she headed upwards and when he didnt follow at once she turned come with me cadan she told him i dont bite theres a kitchen above and ill sort something out for you up there oh sokay he said i was going to walk over to toes dont be silly this will be quicker and you wont have to pay for it she smiled wistfully not in money that is in companionship id like someone to talk to prhaps kerra shes out my husbands disappeared alan is closeted with his telephone come with me cadan her eyes clouded when he didnt move you need to eat and i need to talk we can be of service to each other when he still didnt move because he couldnt come up with a way to get himself out of the situation she added im the bosss wife i think youve no choice but to humour me he gave a twochuckle laugh feeling no amusement there seemed nothing for it but to follow her up the stairs they went up to what seemed to be the familys flat it was a goodsize space that was modestly furnished in what had once been called danish modern but now was danish retro she led him through a sitting room and into a kitchen where she pointed to the table and told him to sit she turned on a radio that sat on the spotless white work top and she fiddled with the knob till she had a station that she seemed to prefer it featured dance music of the ballroom type she said thats nice isnt it and kept the volume low now she put her hands on her hips what do you fancy cadan it was just the sort of question one saw in films a mrs robinson question while poor benjamin was caught up still thinking about plastics and dellen kerne was a mrs robinson type no doubt about that she was admittedly a bit gone to seed but it was a voluptuous gone to seed she had the kind of curves one didnt see in younger women obsessed with looking like catwalk models and if her skin was grooved from years of sun and cigarettes her masses of blonde hair made up for that as did her mouth which had what they called beestung lips cadan reacted to her it was automatic too long a period of celibacy and now too much blood heading in the wrong direction he stammered i wasthat isgoing totuna and sweet corn her full lips curved i think we can manage that he was vaguely aware of pooh moving restlessly on his shoulder claws digging a little too deeply into his flesh he needed to remove the bird but he didnt like to put the parrot onto the back of a chair since often pooh took a removal from cadans shoulder to a perch as a sign he was meant to drop his load cadan looked about for a newspaper that he could use beneath a chair just in case he spied one sitting on the counter and he went to fetch it last weeks edition of the watchman he saw he picked it up and said mind to dellen pooh needs to perch and if i could put this on the floor she was opening a tin she said for the bird of course and when he had the paper spread and pooh on the back of the chair she went on to say an unusual choice of pet isnt he cadan didnt think he was meant to answer but he did so anyway parrots cn live to be eighty the answer seemed to be sufficient unto itself a pet who could live eighty years wasnt likely to be going anywhere and it didnt take a degree in psychology to sort that one out yes dellen said eighty i do understand she cast him a look and her smile was tremulous i hope he makes it but they dont always do they he dropped his gaze im sorry about santo thank you she paused i cant talk about him yet i keep thinking that if i just move forward a bit even try to distract myself i wont have to face the fact that hes dead i know thats not true but im nothow can one ever be ready to look squarely at the death of ones child she reached hastily for the knob of the radio and raised the volume she began to move with the music she said lets dance cadan it was a vaguely south american rhythm a tango a rumba something like that it called for bodies moving together sinuously and no way did cadan want to be one of them but she moved across the kitchen towards him each step a swaying of the hips a rolling of one shoulder then the other hands extended cadan saw she was crying in the way that actresses cried in films no redness of face no screwing up of features just tears marking a forking path downward from her remarkable eyes she danced and she wept simultaneously his heart went out to her mother of a son whod been murderedwho was to say how the woman was meant to act if she wanted to talk if she wanted to dance what did it matter she was coping as best she could she said dance with me cadan please dance with me he took her into his arms she pressed against him at once each movement its own form of caress he didnt know the dance but that didnt appear to matter she raised both arms to his neck and held him close one hand on the back of his head when she lifted her face to his the rest was natural his mouth lowered to hers his hands moved from his waist to her bum and he drew her tightly against him she did not protest chapter fourteen the identification of santos body was merely part of police routine while ben kerne knew this he still experienced a moment of ludicrous hope that a terrible mistake had somehow occurred that despite the car later found by the police and the identification within the car the dead boy at the bottom of the cliff in polcare cove was someone other than alexander kerne all fancy of this died however when he gazed at santos face ben had gone to truro alone hed taken the decision that there was no point to exposing dellen to santos autopsied body especially when he himself had no idea what condition the corpse would be in that santo was dead was terrible enough that dellen might have to see anything that had reduced him to death was unthinkable when he looked upon santo though ben also saw that his protection of dellen had been largely unnecessary santos face had been seen to with makeup the rest of him which undoubtedly had been most thoroughly dissected and explored remained beneath an institutional bedsheet ben could have asked to see more to see it all to know every inch of santo as he had not known him since early childhood but he had not it seemed an invasion somehow ben had given a nod in answer to the formal question is this alexander kerne and then hed signed the documents placed before him and listened to what various individuals had to say about police inquests funeral homes burials and the like he was numb to everything during these proceedings especially to expressions of sympathy for they were sympathetic all the people he had to deal with at the royal cornwall hospitals mortuary theyd gone this route a thousand times beforemore than that probablybut the fact had not robbed them of their ability to express fellow feeling for someones grief when he got outside ben began to feel in earnest perhaps it was the light rain falling that melted away his meagre protection because as he walked to his austin in the car park he was struck by sorrow at the thought of the immensity of their loss and he was ravaged by guilt at his part in having brought it about and then there was the knowledge that he would live with forever that his last words to santo had been spoken in a disgust born of his own inability to accept the boy for who he was and that inability came from suspicion one that he would never voice why cant you see how others feel about what you do ben would say to him the constant refrain of a song of relationship theyd sung with each other for years for christs sake santo people are real you act like im a user or something you act like i force my will on everyone and thats not how it is besides you never say a word when do not bloody try that with me all right look dad if i could yes thats it isnt it i i and me me well lets get something straight life is not all about you what were doing here for example is not about you what you think and want does not concern me what you do does here and elsewhere are we clear on that so much had gone unspoken especially unsaid were bens fears yet how could those fears be brought into the open when everything that related to them was swept under the carpet not today though today the present moment demanded an acknowledgement of the past that had brought him here thus when ben climbed into his car and began the drive out of truro meaning to head north in the direction of casvelyn he braked at the signpost indicating the route to st ives and while he waited for the shimmering in his vision to clear he made his decision and he turned for the west ultimately he coursed south on the a the north coasts main artery he had no clear intention in his mind but as the signposts grew more and more familiar to him he made the proper turns by rote working his way over to the sea through an uneven landscape made externally inhospitable by granite intrusions but internally rich with mineral ore in this part of the countryside ruined engine houses stood in mute testimony to generations of cornishmen working beneath the ground digging tin and copper till the lodes gave out and the mines were abandoned to weather and time these mines had long been served by remote stone villages which were forced to redefine themselves or die altogether when mining failed the land was bad for farming too stony and barren and so constantly windswept that only thickets of gorse and the hardiest lowgrowing weeds and wildflowers managed to gain a foothold so people turned to cattle and sheep if they could afford a herd and they turned to smuggling when times were tough cornwalls myriad coves were the provenance of smuggling those who were successful in this line of work were those who knew the ways of the sea and the tide but over time this too gave way to other means of support transportation to the southwest improved and transportation brought tourists among them were summer people who sunned themselves on the beaches and crisscrossed the countryside on walking paths among them ultimately came the surfers in pengelly cove ben saw them from above where the main part of the village stood unpainted granite that was roofed in slate looking bleak and deserted in the wet spring weather three streets only defined the place two that were lined with shops houses two pubs and an inn called the curlew and a third marking a steep and twisting route down to a small car park a lifeboat station the cove and the sea out among the waves lifelong surfers braved the weather for the swells were from the northwest coming in even sets and the grey faces of the waves were building to the barrels for which pengelly cove was known into these the surfers dropped carving across the face of a wave rising to its shoulder fading over the top to paddle out to the swell line and wait for another no one wasted the energy riding a wave to shore not in this weather and not with the waves breaking in mirror images of one another over the reefs some one hundred yards out the shore break was for rank beginners a low wall of white water that gave the neophyte a semblance of success but no respectability ben descended to the cove he did so on foot rather than by car leaving his vehicle in front of the curlew inn and walking back along the street to the junction he wasnt bothered by the weather he was dressed for it and he wanted to experience the cove as hed experienced it in his youth hiking down what had been only a path then with no car park below and nothing else save the water the sand and the deep sea caves to greet him when he reached the bottom his surfboard tucked under his arm hed hoped to go to the sea caves now but the tide was too high and he knew better than to risk it so instead he considered all the ways that the place had altered in the years since hed been here money had come to the area he could see that in the summer houses and the getaway cottages that overlooked the cove long ago there had been only one of themfar out on the end of the cliff an impressive granite structure whose proud white paint and gleaming black gutters and trim spoke of more money than any local family hadbut now there were at least a dozen although cliff house still stood as proudly as ever hed been inside only once at an adolescent party orchestrated by a family called parsons whod taken up residence for five summers in a row a celebration before our jamie heads off to university theyd called the gathering none of the locals had liked jamie parsons whod spent his gap year traveling the globe and who hadnt possessed the common sense to keep quiet about it but all of them had been willing to pretend the kid was everything from best mate to the second coming for a night of carousing inside his home theyd had to look cool though ben remembered that they had to look like kids who experienced this sort of revelry all the time end of summer an invitation that had arrived for gods sake by post a rock band come down from newquay to play tables of food a strobe above the dance area and nighttime bolt holes all over the house where mischief of every imaginable kind could be got up to with no one the wiser at least two of the parsons kids were therehad there been four of them in all perhaps fivebut no parents beer of every imaginable kind as well as the contraband whiskey vodka rum mixed with cola tabs of something no one would identify and cannabis cannabis by the crateful it seemed cocaine as well ben couldnt remember what he did remember was the talk and he remembered that because of surfing that summer and what had come of surfing that summer the great divide it existed any place invaded seasonally by people not born and bred to a spot there were always the towniesand the interlopers in cornwall especially there were those who toiled and scrabbled to make a modest living and there was everyone who arrived to spend their holiday time and money enjoying the pleasures of the southwest the main pleasure was the coast with its brilliant weather crystalline sea pristine coves and soaring cliffs the lure however was the water longtime residents knew the rules anyone who surfed regularly knew the rules for they were easy and basic take your turn do not snake do not drop in when someone else calls a wave give way to the more experienced respect the hierarchy the shore break belongs to beginners with wide boards to kids playing in the water and sometimes to knee boarders and body boarders wanting a quick return for their efforts anyone surfing beyond the shore break rode in at the end of a session but otherwise remained outside dropping off the board or cutting over the shoulder of the wave and down the backside of it to paddle out again long before reaching the area where the beginners were it was simple it was also unwritten but ignorance was never an acceptable excuse no one knew whether jamie parsons operated in ignorance or indifference what everyone did know was that jamie parsons somehow felt that he had certain rights which he saw as rights and not as what they actually were inexcusable blunders this stuff s total shit compared to the north shore you know might have been bearable but declared after a shout of give way mate had acted as the harbinger of snaking one of the locals it was not something destined to impress anyone the lineup meant nothing to jamie parsons hey cope with it was his answer to being informed that he was out of order among the surfers those things didnt matter to him because he wasnt one of them he was better than they because of money life circumstances education possibility or whatever you wanted to call it he knew this and they knew this he just lacked the common sense to keep the fact to himself so a party at the parsons home of course they would go they would dance to his music eat up his food drink down his drink and smoke up his weed they were owed because theyd put up with the sod theyd had him round for five summers in a row but this last one had been the worst jamie parsons ben thought now he hadnt considered the bloke in years hed been too consumed with dellen nankervis even though as things turned out it was jamie parsons and not dellen nankervis who had actually determined the course of his life it came to ben as he stood at the edge of the car park and looked out at the surfers that everything hed become was the result of decisions hed made right here in pengelly cove not in pengelly cove the village but in pengelly cove the geographical location at high tide a horseshoe of water beating against slate and granite boulders at low tide a vast sandy beach far beyond the cove itself a beach that stretched in two directions intruded upon by reefs and lava dykes and backed by sea caves that twisted into cliffs in which rich mineral veins could still be seen maws in the rock created by eons of geologic cataclysms and oceanic erosion the sea caves had served as ben kernes destiny from the moment hed seen them as a very young child the dangers they presented made them utterly compelling the privacy they offered made them utterly necessary his history was inextricably tied to pengelly coves two largest sea caves they represented all the firsts hed experienced his first cigarette his first spliff his first drunk his first kiss his first sex they also charted the storms that patterned the trajectory of his relationship with dellen for if his first kiss and first sex had been shared with dellen nankervis in one of the coves two great brooding sea caves so also had those two caves borne witness to every betrayal theyd committed against each other christ cant you escape the bloody cow his father demanded shes making you into a madman boy cut her loose god damn it before she chews you up and spits you into the dirt hed wanted to but he found that he couldnt the hold she had on him had been too profound there were other girls but they were simple creatures compared to dellen gigglers teasers superficial natterers endlessly combing their sunstreaked hair and asking a bloke did he think they looked fat they had no mystery no complexity of character most important not a single one of them needed ben as dellen did she always came back to him and he was always ready and if two other blokes made her pregnant during those frenzied years of their adolescence hed done no worse to her by the time he was twenty and hed even managed to equal their score the third time it happened he asked to marry her for shed proved the very nature of her love shed followed him to truro with no money to speak of and only what shed been able to fit in a canvas holdall shed said its yours ben and so am i with the inchoate curve of her belly telling the tale it would be better now hed thought they would marry and marriage would put an end forever to the cycles of connection betrayal breakup longing and reconnection so the story was that hed removed from pengelly cove to truro for a fresh start that had not come about hed removed from truro to casvelyn for the very same reason with much the same result indeed with a far worse result this time for santo was dead and the insubstantial fabric of bens own life was torn asunder it seemed to ben now that the idea of lessons needing to be taught had started everything what an excruciating realisation it was that lessons needing to be taught had ended everything as well only the student and the teacher were different the crucial fact of acceptance remained the same lynley settled on the idea of a drive down the coast to pengelly cove once di hannaford had identified it as the village from which the kerne family had originated its a two birds and one stone situation he explained to which hannaford had shrewdly replied youre avoiding a bit of responsibility here arent you what is it about dr trahair that you dont want me to know detective superintendent he wasnt avoiding at all he told her blithely but as the kernes needed looking into and as he was intended to garner daidre trahairs trust on di hannafords own instructions to him it seemed that having a rational reason for suggesting a drive to daidre it doesnt have to be a drive hannaford protested it doesnt have to be anything you dont even have to see her to sift through her details and i expect you know that yes of course he said but here was an opportunity all right all right just mind you bloody well stay in touch so he took daidre trahair with him an arrangement which was easy enough to effect because he began by keeping his word to her and he went to her cottage to repair the window hed broken hed decided that the replacement of such could hardly involve a serious mental workout and as an oxford graduatealbeit with a degree in history which hardly applied to matters vitriche certainly had the brainpower to sort out how the repair needed to be made the fact that hed never in his life engaged in a single instance of home improvement did not dissuade him surely he was a man to match the mountain of the job there would be no problem involved this is so good of you thomas but perhaps i ought to arrange for a glazier daidre had said she sounded doubtful about his intentions of wielding glass and putty nonsense its all very straightforward he told her have youi mean before this many times other projects i mean as far as windows are concerned i admit to being something of a virgin nowlets see what we have what they had was a cottage of two hundred years possibly older because daidre wasnt sure she kept meaning to do a history of the place she told him but so far shed not got round to it she did know it had begun its life as a fishing hut used by a great house near alsperyl that house was vanishedits interior long ago destroyed by fire and its stones eventually carted away by locals who used them for everything from building cottages to defining property linesbut as it had dated to there was every chance that this little building was of a similar age this meant of course that nothing was straight including the windows whose frames had been precisely constructed to fit apertures that were themselves without precision lynley discovered this to his dismay when he held the glass up to the frame once the debris of the broken window was cleared away a slight horizontal drop existed he saw just enough to make the placement of the glasssomething of a challenge he should have measured both ends he realised he felt his neck grow hot with embarrassment oh dear daidre said and then quickly as if she believed her remark spoke of a lack of confidence well im sure its only a matter of putty he said i beg your pardon this merely calls for a greater amount of putty at one end theres no real problem oh thats lovely she said thats good thats excellent she took herself off to the kitchen at once murmuring obscurely about brewing tea he struggled with the project the putty the putty knife the glass the placement of the glass the falling rain that he should have damn well known was going to make the entire enterprise impossible she stayed in the kitchen she remained there so long that he drew the conclusion she was not only laughing at his ineptitude but also hiding the fact that she herself could have repaired the window with one hand tied behind her back after all she was the woman whod used him as a mop when it came to darts when at last she emerged hed managed to get the glass in but it was obvious that someone with more skill than he was going to have to repair his repair he admitted as much and apologised he had to go down to pengelly cove he told her and if she had the time to accompany him there hed make everything up to her with dinner pengelly cove why she asked police business he replied does di hannaford think there are answers in pengelly cove and shes setting you after them why not one of her own policemen daidre asked when he hesitated about giving her an answer it took her only a moment to understand she said ah so youre not a suspect any longer is that wise of di hannaford what to dismiss you from suspicion because youre a cop fairly shortsighted isnt it i think shes had trouble coming up with a motive i see her voice had altered and he knew shed put the rest of it together if he was no longer a suspect she still was she would know that there was a reason for this and she would probably know why he thought she might refuse to go with him but she didnt and he was glad he was seeking a way to get to the truth of who she was and what she was hiding and with no easy resources at hand to do this gaining her trust through companionship did seem the best way miracles proved to be his means of access theyd driven up from the cove and they were winding through stowe wood on their way to the a when he asked her if she believed in miracles at first she frowned at the question then she said oh the internet paperwork you saw no i dont actually but a friend of minea colleague at the zoo the primate keeper as a matter of factis planning a trip for his parents because they believe in miracles and theyre in rather bad need of one at the moment a miracle that is not a trip thats very good of you to help him out he glanced over at her her skin was blotchy your what was the colleague to her he wondered your lover your boyfriend your erstwhile partner why this reaction its an act of friendship she said as if hed asked those questions pancreatic cancer theres no real coming back from that diagnosis but hes not an old manpaul says his dads only fiftyfourand they want to try everything i think its futile but who am i to say so i told him idwell id look for the place with the best statistics rather silly isnt it not necessarily well of course it is thomas how does one apply statistics to a place dominated by mysticism and earnest if misplaced belief if i bathe in these waters are my chances for a cure better than if i scribbled my request on a scrap of paper and left it at the foot of a marble statue of a saint what if i kiss the ground in medjugorje or is the best course to stay home and pray to someone on the fast track for a halo they need miracles to get their sainthood dont they what about that route it would at least save money that we cant afford to spend anyway she drew a breath and he glanced her way again she was leaning against the car door and her face looked rather pinched sorry she said i do go on but one so hates to see people divorce themselves from their own common sense because a crisis has arisen if you know what i mean yes he said evenly as it happens i do know what you mean she raised her hand to her lips she had stronglooking hands sensible hands a doctors hands with clipped clean nails oh my god i am so bloody sorry ive done it again sometimes my mouth goes off its all right it isnt you would have done anything to save her im terribly sorry no what you said is perfectly true in crisis people thrash about looking for answers trying to get to a solution and to them the solution is always what they want and not necessarily whats actually best for anyone else still i didnt mean to cause you pain i dont ever mean that for anyone for that matter thank you from there he couldnt see how to get to her lies except to tell a few of his own which he preferred not to do surely it was up to bea hannaford to question daidre trahair about her alleged route from bristol to polcare cove it was up to bea hannaford to reveal to daidre exactly what the police knew about her putative lunch at a pub and it was up to bea hannaford to decide how to utilise that knowledge to force the vet into an admission of whatever it was that she needed to admit he used the pause in their conversation to head in another direction he said lightly we started with a governess have i told you that completely nineteenth century it only lasted till my sister and i rebelled and put frogs into her bed on guy fawkes night and at that time of year believe me frogs werent easy to find are you saying you actually had a governess as a child poor jane eyre with no mr rochester to rescue her from a life of servitude dining in her bedroom alone because she wasnt upstairs or downstairs either it wasnt as bad as that she dined with us with the family wed begun with a nanny but when it was time for school the governess came onboard this was for my older sister and me by the time my brother was bornhes ten years younger than i have i told youthat had all been put to rest but its soso charmingly antique lynley could hear the laughter in daidres voice yes isnt it but it was that boarding school or the village school where we would mix with the local children with their ghastly cornish accents daidre noted the very thing my father was determined that we would follow in his educational footsteps which did not lead to the village school my mother was equally determined we wouldnt be packed off to boarding school at seven years of age wise woman so their compromise was a governess until we drove her off with her sanity barely intact at which point we did go to the local school which was what we both wanted anyway my father must have tested our accents every day however it seemed so god forbid that we should ever sound common hes dead now years and years lynley ventured a look she was studying him and he wondered if she was considering the topic of schooling and wondering why they were talking about it he said what about you and tried to make it casual noting his discomfort as he did so in the past attempting to work a suspect round to a trap had presented no problem for him both of my parents are hale and hearty i meant school he said oh it was all tediously normal im afraid in falmouth then yes im not of the sort of family that packs its children off to boarding school i went to school in town with all the riffraff she was caught it was the moment at which lynley would have ordinarily sprung the trap but he knew he could have missed a school somewhere she could have attended an institution now closed he found that he wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt he let matters go they made the rest of the journey to pengelly cove in a companionable fashion he spoke of how a privileged life had led to police work she spoke of a passion for animals and how that passion had taken her from rescuing hedgehogs seabirds songbirds and ducks to veterinary school and ultimately to the zoo the only creature from the animal world that she didnt like she confessed was the canada goose theyre taking over the planet she declared well at least they seem to be taking over england her favourite animal she declared to be the otter freshwater or sea she wasnt particular when it came to otters in the village of pengelly cove it was a matter of a few minutes in the post officea single counter in the villages allpurpose shopto discover that more than one kerne lived in the vicinity they were all the progeny of one eddie kerne and his wife ann kerne maintained a curiosity that he called ecohouse some five miles out of town ann worked at the curlew inn although the job appeared to be a sinecure at this point since she was aging badly after a stroke some years ago theres kernes crawling all over the landscape the postmistress told them she was the lone labourer in the shop a greyhaired woman of uncertain but clearly advanced years whom theyd come upon in the midst of sewing a tiny button onto a childsize white shirt she poked her finger with the needle as she worked she said bloody hell damn and pardon and then wiped a spot of blood onto her navy cardigan before going on with you go outside and shout the name kerne ten people on the streetll look up and say what she examined the strength of her repair and bit off the thread id no idea lynley said while daidre looked at a dismal arrangement of fruit just inside the shop door he was making a purchase of postcards that he would never use along with stamps a local newspaper and a roll of breath mints which he would the original kernes had quite a brood then the postmistress rang up his selections seven in all ann and eddie produced and all of them still round save the oldest that would be benesek hes been gone for donkeys years are you friends of the kernes the woman looked from lynley to daidre she sounded doubtful lynley said that he wasnt a friend he produced his police identification the postmistresss expression altered cops and caution could not have been written more plainly on her face ben kernes son has been killed lynley told her has he she said a hand moving to her heart unconsciously she cupped her left breast oh lord now thats a very sad bit of news what happened to him did you know santo kerne wouldnt be anyone round here who doesnt know santo they stayed with eddie and ann on occasion when he and his sisterthat would be kerrawere little uns annd bring em in for sweets or ices not eddie though never eddie he doesnt come to the village if he can help it hasnt for years why somed say too proud somed say too shamed but not his ann besides she had to work hadnt she so eddie could have his dream of living green shamed about what lynley asked she gave a brief smile but lynley knew it had nothing to do with friendliness or humour rather it had to do with acknowledging the position each of them was in at the moment he the professional interlocutor and she the source of information small village she said when things go bad for someone they cn stay bad if you know what i mean it might have been a statement about the kernes but it also could have been a statement about her own position and lynley understood this postmistress and shopkeeper shed know a great deal about what was going on in pengelly cove citizen of the village she would also know the course of wisdom was to keep her mouth closed about things that did not matter to an outsider youll have to speak to ann or eddie she said anns got a bit of a language problem from the stroke she had but eddiell bend your ear i expect you speak to eddie hell be at home she gave them directions to the kerne property which proved to be a number of acres northeast of pengelly cove a former sheep farm that had been transformed by one familys attempt to live green lynley accessed the land alone daidre having decided to remain in the village until his business with the kernes was completed he entered the property by means of a disintegrating rusty gate which stretched across a stony lane but was unlocked he rattled along for threequarters of a mile before seeing a habitation midway down the hillside it was a mishmash of architecture characterised by wattle and daub stone tiles timbers scaffolding and sheets of heavy plastic the house could have been from any century the fact that it was standing at all made it something of a marvel not far beyond it a waterwheel turned at the base of a sluice both of them roughly constructed the former appeared to be a source of electricity if its connection to a hulking but rusty generator was any indication the latter appeared to be redirecting a woodland stream so that it provided water to the wheel to a pond and then to a series of channels which served an enormous garden this was newly planted by the look of it waiting for the sun of late spring and summer a huge compost pile made an amorphous lump nearby lynley parked near a stand of old bicycles only one of them had inflated tyres and all of them were rusting to the point of disintegration there appeared to be no direct route to the front or back door of the house a path meandered from the bicycles in the vague direction of the scaffolding but once in its near presence it transformed to the occasional brick or two lying together amidst trampled weeds by stepping from one set of bricks to the other lynley finally reached what seemed to be the entrance to the house a door so pitted by weather rot and insect life that it seemed hardly credible to assume it was in working order it was however a few knocks forcefully applied to wood brought him facetoface with an old and badly shaven gentleman one eye clouded by a cataract he was roughly and somewhat colourfully dressed in old khaki trousers and a lime green cardigan that was drooping round the elbows he had sandals and orangeandbrown argyll socks on his feet lynley decided he had to be eddie kerne he produced his identification for the man as he introduced himself kerne looked from it to him he turned and walked away from the door heading wordlessly back into the bowels of the house the door hung open so lynley assumed he was meant to follow which he did the interior of the house wasnt a great improvement over the exterior it appeared to be a work long in progress if the age of the exposed timbers was anything to go by walls along the central passage into the place had long ago been taken down to their framing but there was no scent of freshly replaced wood here instead there was a fur of dust upon the timbers suggesting that a job had been begun years in the past without ever reaching completion a workshop was kernes destination and to get to it he led lynley through a kitchen and a laundry room that featured a washing machine with an oldfashioned wringer and thick cords crisscrossing the ceiling where clothing was hung to dry in inclement weather this room emanated the heavy scent of mildew a sensory ambience only moderately improved upon when they got to the workshop beyond it they reached this spot by means of a doorless opening in the far wall of the laundry room separated from the rest of the house by a thick sheet of plastic that kerne shoved to one side this same sort of plastic covered what went for windows in the workshop a room that had been fashioned more recently than the rest of the house it was made of unadorned concrete blocks it was frigid within like an oldtime larder without the marble shelves lynley thought of the term mancave when he stepped into the workshop a workbench haphazardly hung cupboards one tall stool and myriad tools were crammed within and the overall impression was one of sawdust oil leakage paint spills and general filth it comprised a somewhat dubious spot for a bloke to escape the wife and children with his excuse the crucial tinkering on this or that project there appeared to be plenty of them on eddie kernes workbench part of a hoover two broken lamps a hair dryer missing its flex five teacups wanting handles a small footstool belching its stuffing kerne seemed to be at work on the teacups for an uncapped tube of glue was adding to the other scents in the room most of which were associated with the damp tuberculosis seemed the likely outcome of an extended stay in such a place and kerne had a heavy cough that made lynley think of poor keats writing anguished letters to his beloved fanny cant tell you nothing was kernes opening remark he made it over his shoulder as he picked up one of the teacups and squinted at it comparing a dismembered handle to the spot at which one had been shattered from the cup know why youre here dont i but i cant tell you nothing youve been informed about your grandsons death phoned didnt he kerne hawked but mercifully did not spit gave me the word thats it your son ben kerne he phoned the same good for that he was the emphasis on that indicated what else kerne deemed his son good for which was nothing i understand ben hasnt lived in pengelly cove for a number of years lynley said wouldnt have him round kerne grabbed up the tube of glue and applied a goodsize dollop to both ends of the handle hed chosen for the teacup he had a steady hand which was good for such employment he had an unfortunate eye which was bad the handle clearly belonged to a different cup as the colour wasnt right and the shape was even less so nonetheless kerne held it in place waiting for some acceptable form of agglutination to occur sent him off to his uncle in truro and there he stayed had to didnt he once she followed him there she kerne shot him a look one eyebrow raised it was the sort of look that said you dont know yet the wife he said shortly bens wife the present mrs kerne thatd be her he went off to escape and she was hot on his tail just like he was hot on hers and into hers if youll pardon the expression shes a piece of work and i want no part of her and no part of him whilst he stays with the scrubber source of everything went wrong with him from day one till now that dellen nankervis and you cn note that down in your whatever if you want and note who said it im not shamed of my feelings as every one of thems proved right over the years he sounded angry but the anger seemed to be hiding what had been broken within him theyve been together a long time lynley noted and now santo kerne grabbed another teacup and handle you dont think shes at bottom of that you do some sniffing sniff here sniff truro sniff there youll catch the smell of something nasty and the trail of its leading directly to her he used the glue again with much the same result a teacup and handle like distant relatives unacquainted with each other you tell me how he said he was abseiling mr kerne theres a cliff in polcare cove dont know the spot north of casvelyn where the family live its perhaps a twohundredfoot drop he had a sling fixed on the top of the cliffwe think it was attached to the pillar of a drystone walland the sling failed when he began his descent but it had been tampered with kerne didnt look at lynley but he stopped his work for a moment his shoulders heaved then he shook his head forcefully im sorry lynley said i understand santo and his sister spent a great deal of time with you when they were younger cos of her he spat out the words shed get a new man and bring him home and have him there in her husbands own bed dhe tell you that anyone tell you that no i expect not did that to him when she was a girl and did that to him when she was a woman grown up the chute as well more n once she was made pregnant by someone else lynley asked doesnt know that i know does he kerne said but she told me kerra that is mums got pregnant off someone and shes got to get rid of it she tells us matter of fact she tells me just like that and her nothing but ten years old ten bloody years and what sort of woman lets her little girl know the filthy business shes making of her life dad says shes having a bad patch she tells us but i saw her with the estate agent grandpaor the dance instructor or the science teacher from the secondary school what did it matter to her when she got the itch it had to be scratched and if ben didnt scratch it the way she liked and when she wanted shed damn well see to it someone else would so dont tell me shes not at the bottom of this when shes at the bottom of everything ever happened to that boy not to santo lynley thought kerne was speaking of his son from a well of bitterness and regret and a fathers knowledge that nothing he says or does can change the course of a son whos made the wrong decision in this kerne reminded lynley of his own father and the admonitions hed given throughout lynleys childhood about mixing too closely with anyone the elder man deemed common it had done no good and lynley had always considered himself richer for the experience id no idea he said well you wouldnt would you cos hes not likely to tell anyone but she gets her claws into him when hes a lad and from that point on he doesnt see straight its off and on with them for years and every time me and his mum start thinking hes rid himself of the cow at last and he sees the light and shes out of his hair and out of our hair and he can start to live normal like the rest of us there she is again filling his head with rubbish bout how she needs him and hes the only one for her and shes sorry so sorry that she had a shag with someone else but it wasnt her fault was it cos he wasnt there to take care of her was he he wasnt paying her proper attentionand there she is flashing her knickers at him and he cant think things through cant see what shes like or what shes doing or how hes caught it leads to ruin so we send him off and doesnt she followdoesnt the trollop just pack her bags and follow our ben he set the second badly repaired cup to one side he was breathing jerkily a liquid sound in his chest lynley wondered if the man ever saw a doctor so what we thinkme and his mumis if we say to him youre no son of ours if you dont rid yourself of this bloody cow hell do it hes our boy hes our oldest and hes got his brothers and sisters to think about and they love him they do and they all get on we reckon he only needs to be gone a few years anyway till it all blows over and then he cn return to where he belongs which is with us only it doesnt work does it because he will not shake himself of her shes under his skin and in his blood and theres an end to the matter until what blows over lynley asked eh kerne turned his head from the workbench to look at lynley you said your son needed to be gone a few years only till it all blows over i was wondering what kernes good eye narrowed he said you dont talk like a cop cops talk like the rest of us but you got a voice thatwhere you from lynley wasnt about to be diverted with a discussion of his roots mr kerne if you know somethingand you obviously dothat might be related to the death of your grandson i need to know what it is he turned back to his bench he said what happened happened years ago benesekswhat seventeen eighteen its nothing to do with santo please let me decide that tell me what you know after making the imperative lynley waited he hoped the old mans sorrowsuppressed but so alive in himwould force him to speak kerne finally did so although it sounded as if he talked more to himself than to lynley theyre all surfing and someone gets hurt everyone points fingers at everyone else and no one takes the blame but things get nasty so me and his mum send him off to truro till he isnt likely to get no more squintyeyed looks from people who got hurt how kerne slapped his palm on the bench im telling you its of no account whats it got to do with santo its santo whos dead not his dad some bloody kid gets himself drunk one night and ends up sleeping it off in one of the sea caves down the cove so whats that got to do with santo were they surfing at night lynley asked insistently what happened what dyou think bloody happened theyre not surfing theyre partying and hes partying like the rest of them he mixes drugs of some sort with whatever else hes swallowed and when the tide comes in hes done for tide sweeps into those caves more fast n a man can move cos theyre deep arent they and everyone knows if you go in you best know where the sea is and what its doing cos if you dont you arent coming out oh you might think you are you might think what the bloody hell does it matter cos i cn swim cant i but you get battered and turned about and its no ones fault if youre too bloody stupid to listen when youre told not to go down to the cove when conditions are dicey but thats what happened to someone lynley said thats what happened to whom lad come here for his summers his family has money and they take the big cliff house i dont know them but benesek does all the young ones do cos theyre all down the beach in summers arent they this lad john or jamesyes jameshes the one the one who drowned only his family dont see it that way they dont want to see its his own damn fault they want to blame and they choose our benesek others as well but beneseks at the bottom of what happened so they say they bring the cops from newquay and they dont let up not the family and not the cops you know something and you damn well will tell us they say but he dont know a bleeding thing does he which is what he says over and over and the cops finally have to believe him but at that point the kids dads built a bloody great stupid memorial to the boy and everyones looking at our ben dead funny so we send him to his uncle cos hes got to have a chance in life and hes not bloody likely to have one here lynley said a memorial where out on the coast somewheres up on the cliff likely they thought a memorial like thatd make people never forget what happened i dont walk the coast path so i never saw it but itd be what they wanted so itd stay fresh for people he laughed bleakly theyd spend a good sum probly hoping itd haunt our ben till the day he died only they dint know hed never come home so it went for nought he picked up another teacup this one far more broken than its companions with a large crack running from rim to bottom and a significant chip on each side right where the drinker would place his lips it seemed foolish to repair it but it also seemed clear that eddie kerne was going to make the attempt anyway he said quietly he was a good lad i wanted the best for him i tried to get the best for him what dad doesnt want the best for his lad no dad at all lynley acknowledged an exploration of pengelly cove didnt take a great deal of time after the shop and the two main streets there was either the cove itself an old church sitting just outside of town or the curlew inn to occupy ones time once she was left alone in the village daidre began with the church she reckoned it might be locked up tight as so many country churches were in these days of religious indifference and vandalism but she was wrong the place was called st sithys and it was open sitting in the middle of a graveyard where the remains of this years daffodils still lined the paths giving way to columbine within the church smelled of stones and dust and the air was cold there was a switch for lights just inside the door and daidre used this to illuminate a single aisle a nave and a collection of multicoloured ropes that looped down from the bell tower a roughly hewn granite baptismal font stood to her left while to her right an unevenly placed stone aisle led to pulpit and altar it could have been any church in cornwall save for one difference an honesty stall this comprised a table and shelves just beyond the baptismal font and upon it used goods were for sale with a locked wooden box serving as the till daidre went to inspect all this and found no organisation to it but rather a quirky charm old lace mats mingled with the odd bit of porcelain glass beads hung from the necks of wellused stuffed animals books eased away from their spines cake plates and pie tins offered garden tools instead of sweets there was even a shoe box of historic postcards which she flipped through to see that most of them were already written upon stamped and received long ago among them was a depiction of a gipsy caravan of the sort she hadnt seen in years rounded on the top and gaily painted celebrating a peripatetic life unexpectedly her vision blurred when she picked up this card unlike so many of the others nothing had been written upon it she wouldnt have done so at another time but she bought the card then she bought two others with messages on them one from an auntie hazel and uncle dan that depicted fishing boats in padstow harbour and another from binkie and earl showing a line of surfers standing in front of long malibu boards that were upright in the newquay sand fistral beach scrolled across their feet and this was apparently the location whereaccording to either binkie or earlit happened here weddings next december with these in her possession daidre left the church but not before she looked at the prayer board where members of the congregation posted their requests for collective appeals to their mutual deity most of these had to do with health and it came to daidre how seldom people seemed to consider their god unless physical illness descended upon them or upon someone they loved she was not religious but here was an opportunity she realised to step up to the spiritual cricket pitch the god of chance was bowling and she stood in front of the wicket with the bat in her hands to swing or not and what did it matter were the issues before her shed been searching the internet for miracles hadnt she what was this but another arena in which a miracle might be found she picked up the biro provided and a slip of paper which turned out to be part of the back of an old handout on which a bake sale was being advertised she flipped this to the blank side and she started to write she got as far as please pray for but she found that she could advance no further she couldnt find the words to shape her request because she wasnt even sure it was her request so to write it and then to post it on a board for prayers proved too monumental a task one that was coloured by a hypocrisy that she could not bear to live with she replaced the pen balled up the slip of paper and shoved it into her pocket she left the church she refused to feel guilt anger was easier it might have been the last refuge of the fearful but she didnt care she used terms like i dont need i dont care and i certainly dont owe and these carried her from the church through the graveyard from the graveyard to the road and from there along pengelly coves main street by the time she reached the curlew inn shed dismissed all matters relating to prayer boards and she was helped in her efforts by the sight of ben kerne entering the curlew inn before her shed never met him she knew of him of course and shed heard him mentioned in the midst of more than one conversation in the last two years but she might not have recognised him so readily had she not just that morning been looking at his picture in the watchmans article about his enterprise involving the promontory king george hotel shed been heading for the curlew inn anyway so she followed ben kerne inside she had the advantage as theyd never been introduced consequently it was an easy matter to be his distant shadow she reckoned he was seeking his mother as shed overheard the postmistresss conversation with thomas lynley about ann kernes employment it was either that she decided or he wanted a meal but she thought that was unlikely although it was indeed nearing time for dinner once within ben kerne didnt walk in the direction of the inns restaurant and as he moved it was obvious to daidre that he was quite familiar with this place he bypassed a reception desk and he walked down a gloomy corridor towards a square of light that fell from the window of what seemed to be an illuminated office at the back of the building he entered without knocking on the door which suggested that either he was expected or he wished his appearance to come as a surprise and hence to disarm whoever was inside daidre moved quickly to observe and she was in time to see an older woman rising awkwardly from behind a desk she was grey of hair and colourless of face and part of her dragged a bit and daidre recalled shed suffered a stroke but shed recovered well enough to be able to hold out one arm to her son when he strode to her she embraced him in a grip so fierce that daidre could see its power to crush his body to hers they said nothing to each other instead they merely expressed and rested within the bond of mother and child the sheer force of the moment reached through the office window to daidre and embraced her as well but she felt no succour rushing through her instead she felt a grief she could not bear to experience she turned away chapter fifteen di bea hannaford interrupted her workday because of the dogs she knew this was a feeble excuse that would have proved embarrassing had someone pointed it out to her but that fact did not lessen its efficacy dogs one two and three needed to be fed walked and otherwise attended to and bea told herself that only an inexperienced companion to canines actually believed that dogs were sufficient company for each other during the long hours when their humans had to be away so not too long after her conversation with tammy penrule she checked on the progress among the officers in the incident roomthere was little enough of this and damn if constable mcnulty wasnt studying large surfing waves on the screen of santo kernes computer monitor and doing everything but drooling over themand afterwards she climbed into her car and drove to holsworthy as she suspected would be the case dogs one two and three were delighted to see her and they expressed their enthusiasm with a series of leaps and yelps as they dashed about the back garden seeking something with which they might present her a plastic garden troll from one a halfmasticated rawhide bone from two the toothmarked handle of a trowel from three bea accepted these offerings with suitable oohs and ahhs unearthed the dogs leads from within a pile of boots gloves anoraks and pullovers on a stool just inside the kitchen door and hooked up the labradors without further ado rather than take them on walkies however she led them to the land rover she said in you go as she opened the rear of it and when they cooperatively leapt inside she knew they thought it wasoh frabjous daycountryside time unfortunately they were mistaken it was raytime if he wanted pete bea reckoned ray should also be willing to take on petes animals true they were equally her dogsthey were actually even more her dogs than they were petes dogsbut her hours on this case were going to be long as ray himself had pointed out and the dogs needed watching over as much as did pete she grabbed the animals enormous bag of food along with their dishes and other items guaranteed to lead to doggie pleasure and off they went with dog tails wagging and dog noses pressed messily to the windows when she arrived at rays house bea had two intentions the first was to deliver one two and three into the back garden where rays limited time lack of skill and general indifference had never produced anything more than a square of cement for a patio and a rectangle of lawn for visual relief there were no herbaceous borders for the dogs to rip into and nothing else for them to chew up it was perfect for housing three rambunctious black labs and shed brought fresh rawhide bones a bag of toys and an old soccer ball to make sure the hours spent here did not result in canine boredom this left her free to pursue her second intention which was to get inside rays house she had to deliver the dog food and the dishes and since she would be inside she would just make certain ray was caring for pete properly ray was a man after all and what did a man know about nurturing a fourteenyearold boy nothing yes only a mother knew what was best for her son all of this was part of the general excuse but bea didnt allow her thoughts to travel there she told herself she was acting in petes best interests and since she had a key to rays houseas he had a key to hersit was a small matter to insert it in the lock once she had the dogs happily snuffling the lawn in the garden she could see what she needed to see without anyone being the wiser she told herself ray was at work pete was at school shed leave the food the dishes and a note about the dogs and shed be gone after a quick peek at the fridge and through the rubbish to make sure there were no takeaway pizza boxes or chinese or curry containers among the other debris and while she was there shed have a quick look through rays videos to make certain he had nothing questionable that pete might get into and if evidence of what she knew was rays predilection for curvy blond females under thirty was anywhere about shed get rid of that as well shed got only a step inside the door when it became clear that her plan was not going to be carried out without some fancy footwork however for someone came clattering down the stairsundoubtedly alerted by the happy barking of dogs in the gardenand in a moment she was facetoface with her son he said mum whatre you doing here those the labs with an inclination of his head in the general direction of the garden bea saw he was eating which would have been a mark against his father had petes snack consisted of crisps or chips but he was munching from a plastic bag of apple slices and almonds of all things and the bloody child appeared to be actually enjoying them so she couldnt get riled at that but she could get riled at the fact that he was home at all she said never mind about me whatre you doing here did your father allow you to stay home from school or have you done a bunk whats going on are you alone whos upstairs what the hell are you doing bea knew the game it started with truancy and went on to drugs drugs led to breaking and entering that led to gaol thank you so very much ray hannaford wonderful job father of the year pete took a step backward he chewed thoughtfully and watched her she said answer me at once why arent you at school half day he said what half day today mum theres a conference or something i dont know what i mean i knew but i forgot teachersre doing something i told you about it i brought home the announcement she remembered he had done several weeks ago it was on the calendar shed even told ray about it and theyd discussed whod fetch pete when the shortened day ended still she wasnt ready to apologise for the suspicious leap shed made there remained fertile ground here and she intended to till it she said so howd you get home dad your father and where is he now whatre you doing here alone she was quite determined there had to be something pete was too astute for her his parents own son possessing their ability to cut to the quick he said whyre you always so mad at him that wasnt a question bea was ready to answer she said go say hello to your animals theyre wanting you well talk afterwards mum you heard me he shook his head a teenagers black movement that signaled his disgust but he did as she told him although the fact that he went outside without a jacket telegraphed his intention of not remaining long with the labradors she had little enough time so she ran up the stairs the house had two bedrooms only she made for rays she did not want her son exposed to photos of rays lovers posed suggestively with backs arched and pert breasts thrust skyward nor did she want him looking at their discarded bras and flimsy knickers if there were coy notes and gushing letters lying about she intended to find them if theyd left smears of lipstick playfully on mirrors she would wipe them off she intended to absent the premises of whatever souvenirs his father kept of his conquests and she told herself it was in petes best interests that she do so but there was nothing ray had swept the place clean in advance of petes arrival the only evidence of anything was evidence of his fatherhood on the chest of drawers petes most recent school photo in a wooden frame next to it their daughter ginny and her daughter audra and next to that a photo from christmas ray bea their two children ginnys husband with audra in his arms playing happy extended family which they were not rays left arm around her his right arm around pete she told herself it was better than displaying a photo of brittany or courtney or stacy or katie or whoever she was coyly smiling on a summer holiday bikini clad and tan of skin she checked the clothes cupboard but found nothing there either and she went on to slide her hands under the pillows on the bed in a search for a few bits of lace that would go for night clothes nothing all to the good at least the man was being discreet she turned to head for the bathroom pete was watching from the doorway he was no longer chewing the bag of his carefully prepared guaranteedtobenutritious snack dangled from his fingers his jaw looked slack she said hastily why arent you with the dogs i swear to you pete if you insist on having pets and you dont take care of them why dyou hate him so much the question stopped her dead this time as did his face which bore an expression of pained knowledge that no fourteenyearold boy should carry round on his shoulders she felt deflated i dont hate him pete yeah you do youve always and see i dont get it mum cause hes a decent bloke seems to me he loves you as well i can see that and i dont get why you cant love him back it isnt as easy as that there are things she didnt want to hurt him and the truth would do that it would come at this point of his delicate dawning manhood and it would tear it to pieces she began to move past him to get to the bathroom to complete her futile investigation but he was in the doorway and he didnt move it came to her how much hed grown over the last year he was taller than she now although still not as strong whatd he do pete asked cause he mustve done something cause thats why people get divorced eh people get divorced for lots of reasons did he have a girlfriend or something pete thats really none cause he doesnt have one now if thats what youre looking for and it must be cause it cant be drugs or something like that cause you know he doesnt take drugs but is that it did he or drink or something cause theres this bloke at school called barry and his parents are splitting up cause his dad broke the front window in a rage and he was drunk pete watched her he seemed to be trying to read her face it was double glazed he added she smiled in spite of herself she put her arms around him and pulled him to her double glazed she said now thats a reason to throw a husband out but he jerked away from her dont make fun he went to his room she said pete come on he didnt reply he shut the door instead leaving her looking at its blank panels she could have followed but she went to the bathroom she couldnt stop herself from a final check even though she knew how ridiculous she was being here like everywhere else there was nothing just rays shaving gear damp towels hanging lopsided from a towel bar across the tub a sky blue shower curtain drawn to dry and in the tub nothing other than a soap tray a clothes hamper stood beneath the bathroom window but she didnt go through this instead she sat on the toilet seat and looked down at the floor this was not to study the tiles for evidence of sexual malefaction but to force herself to stop and consider all the ramifications shed done that more than fourteen years ago shed considered the ramifications what it would mean to stay with a man and have his child when day after day what he so plainly told her he wanted was a termination to the pregnancy an abortion beatrice do it now weve raised our child ginnys grown and left the nest and this is our time now we dont want this pregnancy it was a stupid miscalculation and we dont have to pay for it the rest of our lives they had plans he told her they had great and wonderful things to do now ginny was grown places to go sights to see i dont want this kid neither do you one visit to the clinic and its behind us it was odd to think now how ones perception of a person could change in an instant but that was what had happened shed looked at ray with eyes newly born the passion of the man and all of it about killing off their own child shed just gone cold right to her core while hed spoken the truthshe had given up on the idea of a second pregnancy when it hadnt happened within a reasonable period after ginnys birth and with ginny at university and engaged to be married she and ray were free to plan a futureit wasnt a truth carved in stone for her it never had been it had instead been a quiet acceptance that had bloomed from initial disappointment but it wasnt meant to be interpreted as the end all and be all of her life she couldnt come to terms with how ray had arrived at the belief that it was so shed told him to leave shed done it not to shake him and not to make him see things her way shed done it because shed believed shed never really known him at all how could she have known him if what he wanted was to end a life they had created from their love for each other but to tell pete all this to let him know his father had wished to deny him his place on earth she couldnt do that let ray tell him if he wished she went to petes room she knocked on the door he said nothing but she entered anyway he was at his computer he was on arsenals web site surfing through pictures of his idols in a desultory way so completely unlike him she said homework love he said did it already and then after a moment he added i got a perfect mark on the maths exam she went to him and kissed the top of his head i am so proud of you she told him thats what dad says because he is we both are youre our shining star pete he asked me about those internet blokes you date that must have made for some good stories she said did you tell him about the bloke dog two lifted a leg on pete snuffled his form of forgiving laugh that bloke was a real wanker two knew that language pete she murmured she stood for a moment looking at the pictures of arsenal that he continued to click through world cups coming she said unnecessarily the last thing pete would be likely to forget was their plans for a world cup match yeah he breathed world cups coming cn we ask dad if he wants to go hed like us to ask him it was a simple thing really theyd not likely be able to get an extra ticket so what did it matter if she agreed all right she told him well ask dad you can ask him tonight when he gets home she smoothed his hair and kissed his head again are you going to be okay on your own till he gets here pete mum he made it a drawnout and patient multisyllable word im not a baby was the implication okay okay im off she said see you later he told her love you mum she went back to casvelyn the bakery where madlyn angarrack worked was established not any great distance from the police station so she parked in front of that grey squat building and she walked to find it the wind had picked up blowing in from the northwest and carrying with it a chill reminder of winter it would be this way until very late spring that season came slowly in fits and starts a pleasantlooking white building on the corner of burn view lane casvelyn of cornwall was opposite st mevan down bea reached it after a hike up queen street where the pavements still held shoppers and cars still lined the kerb despite the growing lateness of the afternoon it might have been any shopping precinct in any town in the country bea thought as she hurried along it here identifying the shops by name were the ubiquitous dismal plastic signs above doors and windows here beneath them were the tiredlooking mothers pushing their babies in pushchairs and the uniformed schoolchildren smoking in front of a video arcade the bakery was only slightly different to the other shops in that its signage was faux victorian fabricated from wood in its bowfront window trays held row upon row of the golden pasties for which the bakery was known within two girls were boxing some of these up for a rangy young man wearing a hoodie with outer bombora outta sight printed on the back one of these girls would be madlyn angarrack bea reckoned she decided it had to be the slim darkhaired one the other enormously overweight and spotty faced sadly did not appear to be someone who might have been the object of an attractive eighteenyearold boys lust bea entered and waited till they had served the customer who relieved them of the last of the days pasties then she asked for madlyn angarrack and the darkhaired girl as bea had suspected identified herself bea showed her warrant card and asked for a word madlyn wiped her hands down the front of her striped pinny glanced at her companion who looked a bit too interested in the proceedings and said shed talk to bea outside she fetched an anorak she didnt bea noted look surprised to have a detective come calling when they were out on the pavement madlyn said i know about santo that he was murdered kerra told me kerras his sister you wouldnt be surprised that wed want to speak with you then i wouldnt be surprised madlyn gave no other information and she waited as if fully informed of her rights and wanting to see how much bea knew and what if anything bea suspected you and santo were involved santo madlyn said was my lover you dont call him your boyfriend madlyn glanced at the down across the street from them maram and sea lime grasses at its edge were being tossed by the growing wind he started out my boyfriend she said boyfriend and girlfriend thats what we were going on dates hanging about surfingthats how i met him i taught him surfing but then we became lovers and i call it lovers because thats what we were two people in love who expressed their love through sexual intercourse baldly stated most girls her age wouldnt have been so direct bea wondered why she was well thats what it is isnt it madlyns words sounded brittle a mans penis entering a womans vagina all the befores and all the afters as well but it really comes down to a penis entering a vagina so the truth is that santo put his penis into my vagina and i let him do it he was my first i wasnt his i heard he was dead i cant say im sorry about it but i didnt know hed been murdered thats actually all i have to tell you its not all i need to know im afraid bea told the girl look would you like to go some place for a coffee im not off work yet i cant leave and i shouldnt even be out here talking to you if youd like to meet later thats not necessary i dont know anything i have nothing to tell you other than what ive already said and this santo broke up with me nearly eight weeks ago and that was that i dont know why he gave you no reason it was time he said she still sounded hard but for the first time her composure seemed slightly shaken there was probably someone else that hed found but he wouldnt say just that itd been good between us but it was time for it to end one day thingsre fine and the next day theyre over that was probably the way he was with everyone but i didnt know it because i didnt know him before he came to my fathers shop for a surfboard and wanted lessons shed continued looking into the street and to the down beyond it but now she turned her gaze to bea she said is that all i dont know anything else ive been told that santo was embarking on something irregular bea said that was the word used irregular im wondering if you know what that was she frowned what do you mean irregular he told a friend of his a girl here in town that would be tammy penrule i expect she didnt interest him in the way other girls interested him if youve seen her you know why that hed met someone but that the situation was irregular that was his word perhaps he meant unusual or abnormal we dont know but he asked her for advice should he tell everyone involved he asked her madlyn gave a harsh laugh well whatever it was he didnt tell me but he was she stopped her eyes were unnaturally bright she coughed and gave a little stamp with one foot santo was santo i loved him then i hated him i expect he just met someone else he wanted to fuck he liked to fuck you see he definitely liked to fuck but if it was irregularwhy would that be i dont bloody know and i dont bloody care maybe he had two girls at once maybe he had a girl and another bloke maybe hed decided to fuck his own mum i dont know with that she was gone inside the building and shedding her anorak her face was hard but bea had a feeling the girl knew far more than she was saying for the moment however there was nothing else to gain in standing there on the pavement other than giving in to the temptation to purchase a pasty for dinner which would certainly do her no good so she went back to the police station where she found the tag officersthose thorns in her sidereporting their actions to sergeant collins who was dutifully noting their completion on the china board where are we bea asked him weve got two cars that were noticed in the area collins said a defender and a rav in the vicinity of the cliff near santos car where one of them was in alsperylthis is to the north of polcare covebut theres access to the cliff its a bit of a walk across a paddock but easy enough to get to the cove once you reach the coastal path that vehicle would be the defender the rav was just to the south of polcare up above bucks haven which is surfing spot so that might have been why the car was there why might wasnt a good day for surfing in that spot waves were better at widemouth bay constable mcnulty put this in from santos computer bea eyed him and made a mental note to see what hed been up to in the past few hours whatever collins said weve got the dvla running all the defenders and all the ravs from the area you have number plates bea asked feeling a frisson of excitement that was soon enough squashed no luck on that collins said but i reckon there are few enough defenders down here so we might have some joy seeing a familiar name on the list of owners same for the rav although we can expect quite a number of them well have to go through the list and look for a name all fingerprints from all relevant parties had been taken at this point collins continued and all of them were being run through the pnc and being compared to the prints from santo kernes vehicle as well background checks were continuing ben kernes finances were apparently square and the only insurance on santo was enough to bury him and nothing else so far the only person of interest was one william mendick the bloke mentioned by jago reeth he had a record collins informed her now thats lovely bea said what sort of record went down for assault with intent in plymouth and he did time for it as well hes only just got out of open conditions his victim some young hooligan called conrad nelson he got into a brawl with ended up paralysed he did and mendick denied the whole thingor at least he put it down to drink and asked for mercy both of them were drunk he claimed but mendicks got a real problem with it his boozeups led to regular fights in plymouth and part of his parole is attendance at aa meetings can we check on that dont see how unless hes turning in some sort of document to his parole officer proving he was there but what would that mean anyway he could be going to meetings regular as a saint and bluffing his way through the whole programme if you know what i mean she did but will mendick with a drinking problem and will mendick with an assault conviction put a useful wrinkle in the blanket she thought about this about santo kernes black eye as she thought she wandered over to constable mcnultys station she saw on the monitor of santo kernes computer exactly what she thought shed see on the monitor of santo kernes computer an enormous wave and a surfer riding it damn the man she snapped constable what the bloody hell are you doing jay moriarty mcnulty said obscurely what thats jay moriarty he said with a nod at the screen he was sixteen years old at the time guv can you credit that they said that wave measured fifty feet constable bea did her best to restrain herself does the term living on borrowed time meaning anything to you it was mavericks northern california your knowledge astounds me her sarcasm went unnoticed by the man oh i dont know much a bit is all i try to follow it but who really has time what with the little one at home but see the thing is guv this picture of jay moriarty was taken the same week that constable he blinked guv get off that site and get back to work and if i see you looking at one more wave on that monitor ill boot you from here into next week you are supposed to be dealing with santo kernes computer looking for information relevant to his death you are not supposed to be using your time to channel his interests is that clear but the thing is that that bloke mark foo do you understand me constable she wanted to grab him by the ears yes but theres more to this than his email guv santo kerne went to these sites and ive gone to these sites so it stands to reason that anyone yes i see anyone else could go to these sites thank you very much ill go to them myself on my own time and read up all about jay moriarty mark boo and everyone else mark foo he said not mark boo god damn it mcnulty guv from the doorway collins spoke he nodded towards the corridor from which direction hed apparently come as bea and constable mcnulty had been squabbling she said what what sergeant someone to see you below alady he seemed doubtful of the term bea swore beneath her breath she said to mcnulty get back to work and stay back at work before pushing past collins and clattering down the stairs the lady in question was in reception and when she saw her bea assumed it was the womans appearance that had made collins sound hesitant about the reference she was in the process of reading the notice board which gave bea a moment to assess her a yellow fishermans hat sat on her head although it wasnt raining any longer and she wore a lintspeckled donkey jacket over mudcoloured corduroy trousers she had bright red trainersthey appeared to be hightopson her feet she didnt look like anyone who would have information instead she looked like an orphan of the storm yes bea said she was in a hurry and she made no attempt to sound otherwise im di hannaford how may i help you the woman turned and extended her hand when she spoke she showed a chipped front tooth ds barbara havers she said new scotland yard cadan pumped his bicycle like a lost soul fleeing from lucifer which was no mean feat considering it was a trick bike not meant for maniacal street riding pooh clung to his shoulder and squawked in protest occasionally shrieking hang bells from the lamppost a non sequitur he used only on occasions when wishing to indicate the level of his concern the bird had good reason for voicing his trepidation for it was the time of day when people were returning from some of the more distant places of employment so the streets were crowded this was particularly true of belle vue which was part of the main route through town it was a oneway thoroughfare and cadan knew he ought to have gone with the flow of traffic round the circular route long ago laid out to relieve congestion but that would have meant riding out of his way for part of the journey and he was in too much of a hurry to do that so he went against the flow of traffic enduring horns honking and a few shouts of protest they were small enough concerns to him in comparison with his need for escape the truth of the matter was that dellen kernedespite her age which wasnt really all that old was itrepresented exactly the kind of sexual encounter that cadan always looked for hot brief urgent and done with with no regrets and no expectations but the truth of the matter also was that cadan was not an idiot bonking the wife of the boss in the family kitchen nothing like putting a tombstone on ones grave not that bonking in the kitchen per se was what dellen kerne had had in mind as things developed shed released herself from their embraceone that had left cadans head swimming and all the important parts of his body rushing with bloodand continued the sensuous dance shed begun as the latin music from the radio played on within a moment though she was back at him she shimmied against him and walked her fingers up his chest from there it required no complicated set of dance steps for them to be hip to hip and groin to groin and the rhythm of the music provided a primal beat whose intentions were impossible to ignore it was the sort of moment when conscious thought absents itself the big brain stops functioning and the little brainknowing only the most atavistic of motivestakes over until satisfaction is achieved so when dellens hand slithered down his chest and her fingers found the most sensitive part of him he was ready to take her on the kitchen floor if she was ready to allow him the pleasure he grabbed her arse with one hand her breast with the other caught a nipple tightly between his fingers and hungrily shoved his tongue into her mouth this it seemed was the signal she needed she backed away with a breathless laugh and said not here silly boy you know where the beach huts are dont you he said stupidly beach huts because of course the big brain was not functioning at all at this point and the little brain knew and cared nothing of huts beach or otherwise darling the beach huts dellen said down below just above the beach here heres a key which she took from a chain she wore deep between her sumptuous breasts had she had it on yesterday cadan hadnt noticed and he didnt want to think of the implications behind this being a new piece of wearing apparel i can be there in ten minutes she said can you she kissed him as she pressed the key into his palm in case hed forgotten what they were about she reminded him with her fingers again when she released him he looked at the key he was holding he tried to clear his head he looked at her he looked at the key he looked at her then he looked at the doorway kerra was standing there watching them disturbing you am i kerras face was a sheet two spots of colour appeared on her cheeks dellen trilled a laugh oh my god she said its that damn music it always gets into a young mans blood cadan you naughty boy getting me all silly like that goodness im old enough to be your mum she turned the radio off the silence that followed was like an explosion cadan was mute there was simply nothing in his brain at least not in the big brain the little brain hadnt yet caught up to what was happening and between big and little existed a maw the size of the english channel into which he wished he could fall and drown he stared at kerra knowing if he turned his body her way she would see the huge betraying bulge in his trousers andwhat was worsethe damp spot he could feel himself beyond that he was struck dumb by the horror of what she might say to her father about all this beyond that there was the need to escape he did so later he would not be able to say how he managed it but he grabbed up pooh from the back of the chair hed been perched upon and he tore out of the kitchen like mercury on meth leaving behind their voiceskerras mostly and she did no speaking in a pleasant toneand hauling his arse down three flights of stairs and into the afternoon he made for his bicycle and he took off at a gallop pushing it till he had the speed he wanted then he mounted and away they went with him pumping like a bloke whod recently seen the headless horseman and pooh just trying to stay on his shoulder he thought little else other than oh no oh no bloody hell damn fuck wanking idiot he wasnt sure what to do or where to go and by rote it seemed his furiously working legs and arms guided the bike towards binner down he needed advice and he needed it quickly liquidearth was the place where he could get it he made the turn into vicarage road and from there he trundled onto arundel lane it was smooth going and he made good time but pooh protested mightily when they got to the erstwhile airfield with its ruts and potholes it couldnt be helped cadan told the parrot to hold on tight and in less than two minutes he was dumping the bike on the old concrete ramp just outside the hut where his father made surfboards inside the door he set pooh on top of the till behind the counter he said do not dump mate and he went inside the workshop there he found the one person he was looking for not his father who would have undoubtedly greeted cadans forthcoming tale with a lecture about his lifelong stupidity instead he found jago who was engaged in the delicate final process of sanding the rough edges of fiberglass and resin from the rails of a swallowtail board jago looked up as cadan stumbled into the finishing room he seemed to take a reading of cadans state at once because there was music coming from the dusty radio that sat on an equally dusty shelf just beyond the sawhorses holding the board and jago went to this and turned it off he removed his glasses and wiped them on the thigh of his white boiler suit to little effect he said whats happened cade wheres your dad hes all right wheres madlyn his left hand moved spasmodically cadan said no no i dont know what he meant was that he assumed everything was fine with his father and with his sister but the truth was that he had no clue he hadnt seen madlyn since that morning and he hadnt seen his father at all he didnt want to consider what that latter detail might mean because it would be one more piece of information to have to cope with and his head was already bursting he finally said okay i spose i expect madlyn went to work good jago gave a sharp nod he went back to the surfboard he picked up the sandpaper but before he applied it he ran his fingertips along the rails he said you come in here like the devils chasing you cadan said not far from the truth you got a minute jago nodded always hope you know that cadan felt as if someone had kindly withdrawn his thumb from the dyke offering to take over the rescue of the lowlands in his stead the story came forth his fathers disgust cadans dreams of the x games adventures unlimited kerra kerne ben kerne alan cheston and dellen last of all dellen it was all a jumble to which jago listened patiently he sanded the surfboards rails slowly nodding as cadan went from point to point at the end he homed in on what they both knew was the salient detail cadan angarrack caught in a delicto that was just about as flagrante as it could have been short of the two of themhimself and dellen kernehaving been caught writhing and moaning on the kitchen floor jago said sounds like mother like son to me didnt think of that when she played with you cade i didnt expecti didnt know her see i thought something was a bit off with her when she came upon me yesterday but i didnt thinkshes likejago she could be my mum not bloody likely for her faults your mum stuck to her own kind yes what d you mean way madlyn tells itand mind she doesnt think much of your mumwenna angarrack with her list of surnames always sticks to her own age group from what you say this oneand cadan took from jagos tone of aversion that he was referring to dellen kernedoesnt appear to mind what age shes doing it with spect you had signs when you met her she asked me about it cadan admitted it sex she asked me what i did for sex and you didnt think that was a bit off cade woman her age making enquiries like that she was readying you i didnt really cadan shifted his uneasy gaze off jagos shrewd one above the radio hung a poster a hawaiian girl inexplicably wearing nothing but a lei round her neck and a wreath of palm leaves on her head as she surfed a goodsize wave with casual skill it came to cadan as he looked upon her that some people were born with amazing confidence and he was not one of those people you knew what was going on jago said spose you thought you got yourself a threeway girl with no asking eh or worst case a bit of hows yer father either way youre happy he shook his head blokes your age never can think outside of the envelope and we both know what that envelope is she offered me lunch cadan said in his own defence jago laughed bet she did and she was planning to be your pudding he set down his sandpaper and leaned against the board girl like thats trouble cade you got to know how to read her from the start she gets a boy by the short ones by giving him a taste eh a little bit now and a little bit then till hes got the whole then its on again off again till he dont know which part of hers the part to believe in so he believes in it all she makes him feel ways hes never felt and he thinks no one can make him feel the same thats how it works best learn from this and let it go but my job he said i need the job jago jago pointed at him with his trembling hand what you dont need is that family he said look what hooking into the kernes did to madlyn she better off for spreading her legs for that boy of theirs but you let them use your course i did when i saw i couldnt talk her out of letting santo in her knickers least i could do was my best to make certain they were safe about it so i said for them to go to sea dreams but did that help matters made them worse santo used her up and spat her out only good was that at least the girl had someone to talk to who didnt shout the itoldyousos at her reckon you wanted to though bloody right i wanted to but what was done was done so what was the point question is cade are you going to go the way of madlyn therere obvious differences and anyway the job sod the job make peace with your dad come back here we got the work we got too much work with the season nearly here you can do it well enough if youve a mind to jago returned to his own employment but before he began he made a final comment one of you twos going to have to swallow pride cade he took your car keys and your driving licence cos he had a reason to keep you alive not every father makes that kind of effort not every father makes it and succeeds best you start thinking of that my boy youre disgusting kerra said to her mother her voice was trembling this somehow made things seem even worse to her trembling might suggest to dellen that her daughter was feeling fear embarrassment orwhat was truly pathetica form of dismay when all the time what kerra was feeling was rage seething white hot utterly pure and all of it directed towards the woman before her she was feeling far more of it than shed felt towards dellen in years and she wouldnt have believed that possible youre disgusting she repeated do you hear me mum dellen said in turn and what the hell do you think you are coming upon me like a little spy are you proud of yourself kerra said you can turn this on me yes i can you sneak round here like a coppers nark and dont think i dont know it youve been watching me for years and reporting back to your father and anyone else whod listen you absolute bitch kerra said more in wonder than in anger you absolute unbelievable bitch hurts a bit to hear the truth doesnt it so hear some more you caught your mum off guard and now youve got the chance youve waited for to do her in you see what you want to see kerra instead of whats right in front of your nose which is the truth he got carried away by the music you saw for yourself i was pushing him away hes a randy little worm and he saw an opportunity and thats what happened so get out of here with your nasty speculation and find something useful to do with your time dellen moved her head in a way that tossed her hair at the same time as it dismissed whatever conclusions her daughter may have drawn then despite her previous words she apparently decided shed not said enough for she went on with i offered him lunch there cant be a problem with that can there surely that cant possibly meet with your disapproval i turned on the radio well what else was i supposed to do it was easier than making conversation with a boy i barely know he took the music as some sort of sign it was sexy the way latin music always is and he got caught up in shut up kerra said we both know what you had in mind so dont make it worse by pretending poor little cadan tried to seduce you is that his name cadan stop it kerra entered the kitchen she advanced on her mother dellen she saw had taken care with her makeup in that way she had her lips looking fuller her violet eyes large everything highlighted like a catwalk model which was idiotic because the last thing dellen kerne had was a catwalk body but even that shed manage to make look seductive because what she knew and had always known was that men of every age respond to the voluptuous today she was red of scarf red of shoes and red of belt which was little enough colour from which to make a judgement but her jersey was unseasonably thin and its neck plunged downward displaying inches of cleavage and her trousers hugged her hips tightly and from all of that kerra could judge and conclude which she did with an alacrity born of years of experience i saw everything mum and youre a pig youre a cow youre a fucking minge bag youre even worse santos dead and even that doesnt stop you it gives you an excuse poor little meim suffering sobut a nice fuckll take my mind off it all is that what youre telling yourself mum dellen had backed away as kerra advanced she stood butted up against the work top then on a hair her mood altered tears rushed to her eyes please she said kerra you can seeobviously im not myself you know therere timesyou know kerraand it doesnt mean dont you bloody say it kerra cried youve made excuses for years and im finished with hearing your mums got problems because you know what mum we all have problems and mine is standing here in this kitchen looking at me like a lamb thats heading to get the axe all innocence and pain and look at what ive had to suffer when all shes done is make us suffer dad me santo all of us and now santos dead which is probably down to you as well you make me sick how can you say he was my son dellen began to weep no crocodile tears these but the real thing santo she cried my precious your precious dont even start alive he was nothing to you and neither was i we got in your way but dead santo has real value because now you can point to his death and say exactly what youve just been saying its because of santo its because of this tragedy thats befallen our family but its not the reason and it never will be although its perfect for an excuse dont talk to me like that you dont know what i what i dont know what you suffer i dont know what youve suffered for years is that it because all of this has been about your suffering is that what stuart mahler was about about your terrible horrible agonising suffering that no one can ever understand but you stop this kerra please you must stop i saw it you didnt know that did you my first boyfriend and i was thirteen years old and there you were standing in front of him with your top lowered and your bra removed and no no that never happened in the garden mum faded from your memory has it with all the current tragedy youre living through kerra felt on fire so much energy was rushing through her limbs that she didnt know if she could contain it all she wanted to scream and kick holes in the walls let me bloody refresh you all right i dont want to hear stuart mahler mum he was fourteen he came round it was summer and we listened to music in the gazebo we kissed a bit we didnt even use our tongues because we were so bleeding innocent we didnt know what we were doing i went into the house for drinks and jam tarts because the day was hot and we were sweaty andthat was all the time you needed does this sound at all familiar to you please kerra no please dellen that was the game dellen did as she pleased and she still does and the rest of us walk on cats feet all round her because were so afraid well set her off again im not responsible you know that ive never been ablethere are things i cant dellen turned away sobbing she bent across the work top her arms extended her posture suggested submission and penitence her daughter could do what she would with her buckle of belt catoninetails scourge whip what did it matter punish me punish me make me suffer for my sins but kerra knew better than to believe at this point too much water had flowed beneath the arc of this endless bridge they walked upon and all of it went and had always gone in the same direction dont even try that she told her mother i am who i am dellen said weeping so try being someone else daidre tried to pick up the bill for dinner but this was something lynley wouldnt allow it was not only that a gentleman never let a lady pay for a meal that they had enjoyed together he told her it was also that hed dined at her home on the previous night and if they wanted to keep matters on an even keel between them then it was his turn to provide a meal for her and even if she felt otherwise about the situation he could hardly ask her to pay for what shed barely consumed at the curlew inn i am sorry about the meal he told her you can hardly be blamed for my choice thomas i should have known better than to order something referred to as the vegetarian surprise shed wrinkled her nose and then chuckled when shed seen it and he could hardly blame her what had arrived for her consumption was something green baked into a loaf with a side dish of rice and vegetables boiled so thoroughly that they were nearly drained of colour shed gamely washed down the rice and the medley of veg with the curlew inns best winean indifferent french chablis insufficiently cooledbut shed given up after a few bites of the loaf shed cheerfully pronounced herself quite full its amazingly rich a bit like cheesecake and shed looked astonished that he hadnt believed her when hed declared he intended to take her out for a proper dinner she told him it would probably have to be in bristol because there wasnt likely to be a place in cornwall that would meet her gastronomic standards im a troublesome wretch when it comes to food i should broaden my horizons to fish but somehow i cant get my mind round to it they left the curlew inn and went out into the evening where darkness was falling she remarked upon the change in seasons the subtle manner in which daylight began extending itself from winter solstice onward she said she never really understood why people hated winter so much as she herself found it a most comforting season it leads directly to renewal she said i like that about it it always suggests forgiveness to me are you in need of forgiveness they were walking in the direction of lynleys hired car which hed left at the junction of the high street and the lane leading down to the beach he watched her in the fading light waiting to read something revealing in her answer we all are in some way or another arent we using this as a logical segue she told him then of what shed seen ben kerne in the arms of a woman whom shed assumed to be his mother she confessed that shed enquired on the matter it was indeed ann kerne hed visited i dont know if it was forgiveness of course she concluded but it was definitely emotional and they shared the feeling in exchange and because it seemed only fair lynley told her a bit about his visit with ben kernes father not everything because she was after all not above suspicion and despite his liking for the woman he knew better than to forget that fact so what he told her was limited to eddie kernes aversion to his sons wife it seems he sees mrs kerne as the root of whats gone wrong in bens life including santos death i expect hed have it that way as well because of his conversation with the older kerne lynley wanted to explore the sea caves so when they were in the car and hed started the engine he drove not out of town as logic would dictate but rather down the steep lane in the direction of the cove below them he said theres something i want to see if you prefer to wait in the car no id like to come as well she smiled and added ive never actually observed a detective at work this will be less detecting than satisfying my curiosity most of the time i suspect its the same thing when he thought about it lynley couldnt disagree in the car park he pulled parallel to a low seawall that looked to be of recent construction as did the granite lifeboat shed which sat nearby with a rescue torpedo buoy available next to it he got out and looked at the cliffs that formed a horseshoe round the cove they were high with outcroppings like broken teeth and a fall from them would likely prove fatal atop them sat houses and cottages beaming lights in the gloom at the far end of the southernmost cliff the largest house of all sprawled in an impressive declaration of someones wealth daidre came round the car to join him what are we here to see she drew her coat more closely round her body a brisk wind blew caves he said are there caves here where on the water side of the cliffs you can access them at low tide but when the waters in theyre at least partially submerged she mounted the wall and gave a look towards the sea im hopeless at this which is pathetic for someone who spends part of her time on the coast but id say its either going out or coming in but in either case it doesnt make a lot of difference because its a fairly good distance from shore then with a look at him is that at all helpful barely he said thats what i reckoned she hopped down on the sea side of the wall he followed her like so many beaches in cornwall this one began with boulders tumbled one upon the other near the car park these were mostly granite with lava mixed in and the light streaks upon them gave mute testimony to the unimaginable former liquid nature of something now solid lynley extended his hand to help daidre over them together they clambered carefully till they reached the sand on its way out he told her that would be my first piece of detection she paused and frowned she looked round as if to understand how hed reached this conclusion oh yes i see she finally said no footprints but that could be because of the weather couldnt it a bad time of year for the beach yes but look to the pools of water at the base of the cliffs wouldnt they always be there i daresay especially this time of year but the rocks that back them wouldnt be wet and they are the lights from the houses are glittering off them very impressive she said elementary was his rejoinder they made their way across the sand it was quite soft telling lynley they would need to take care quicksand wasnt unheard of on the coast especially in locations like this one where the sea ebbed a considerable distance the cove broadened some one hundred yards from the boulders at this point when the tide was out a grand beach stretched in both directions they turned landward when the cliffs were entirely behind them it was an easy matter then to see the caves the cliffs facing the water were cratered with them darker cavities against dark stone like dusted fingerprints and two of them of enormous size lynley said ah and daidre said id no idea and together they approached the largest a cavern at the base of the cliff upon which the biggest house was built the caves opening looked to be some thirty feet high narrow and roughly shaped like a keyhole turned on its head with a threshold of slate that was streaked with quartz it was gloomy within but not altogether dark for some distance at the rear of the cave dim light filtered from a roughly formed chimney that geologic action had eons ago produced in the cliff still it was difficult to make out the walls until daidre produced a matchbook from her shoulder bag and said to lynley with an embarrassed shrug sorry girl guides ive a swiss army knife as well if you need it plasters too thats comforting he told her at least one of us has come prepared a matchs light showed them at first how deeply the cave was affected at high water for hundreds of thousands of mollusks the size of drawing pins clung to the rough richly veined stone walls making them rougher still to a height of at least eight feet mussels formed black bouquets beneath them and interspersed between these bouquets multicoloured shellfish scalloped against the walls when the match burned low lynley lit another he and daidre worked their way farther in picking through stones as the caves floor gained slightly in elevation a feature that would have allowed the water to recede with the ebbing tide they came upon one shallow alcove then another where the sound of dripping water was rhythmic and incessant the scent within was utterly primeval here one could easily imagine how all life had actually come from the sea its rather wonderful isnt it daidre spoke in a hushed voice lynley didnt reply hed been thinking of the myriad uses a spot like this had seen over the centuries everything from smugglers cache to lovers place of assignation from childrens games of marauding pirates to shelter from sudden rainfall but to use the cave for anything at all one had to understand the tide because to remain in ignorance of the seas acts of governance was to court certain death daidre was quiet next to him as his match burnt down and he lit another he imagined a boy being caught in here in this cave or in another just like it drunk drugged possibly unconscious and if not unconscious then sleeping it off it didnt matter at the end of the day if hed been in darkness and deep within this place when the tide swept in he would likely not have known which way to go to attempt an escape thomas the match flickered as he turned to daidre trahair the light cast a glow against her skin a piece of her hair had come loose from the slide she used to hold it back and this fell to her cheek curving into her lips without thinking he brushed it away from her mouth her eyesunusually brown like his ownseemed to darken it came to him suddenly what a moment such as this one meant the cave the weak light the man and the woman in close proximity not a betrayal but an affirmation the knowledge that somehow life had to go on the match burnt to his fingers he dropped it hastily the instant passed and he thought of helen he felt a searing within him because he couldnt remember what this moment clearly demanded that he remember when had he first kissed helen he couldnt recall and worse he didnt know why he couldnt recall theyd known each other for years before their marriage for hed met her when shed come to cornwall in the company of his closest friend during one holiday or another from university he may have kissed her then a light touch on the lips in farewell at the end of that visit a lovelytohavemetyou gesture that meant nothing at the time but now might mean everything for it was essential in that moment that he recall every instance of helen in his life it was the only way he could keep her with him and fight the void and that was the point to fight the void if he floated into it he knew hed be lost he said to daidre trahair who was only a silhouette in the gloom we should go can you lead us out of course i can she said it shouldnt be difficult she found her way with assurance one hand moving lightly along the tops of the molluscs on the wall he followed her his heart pulsing behind his eyes he believed he ought to say something about the moment that had passed between them to explain himself in some way to daidre but he had no words and even if he had possessed the language necessary to communicate the extent of his grief and his loss they were not necessary for she was the one to break the silence between them and she did so when they emerged from the cave and began to make their way back to the car thomas tell me about your wife she said chapter sixteen lynley found himself humming in the shower the next morning the water coursed through his hair and down his back and he was in the middle of the waltz from tchaikovskys the sleeping beauty before he stopped abruptly and realised what he was doing he felt swept up in guilt but it lasted only a moment what came on its heels was a memory of helen the first one hed had since her death that made him smile shed been completely hopeless about music aside from a single mozart that she regularly and proudly recognised when shed heard the sleeping beauty in his company for the first time shed said walt disney tommy darling when on earth did you start listening to walt disney that seems entirely unlike you hed looked at her blankly till hed made the connection to the old cartoon which he realised she must have seen while visiting her niece and nephew recently he said solemnly walt disney stole it from tchaikovsky darling to which she replied he didnt ever did tchaikovsky write the words as well to which he had raised his head ceilingward and laughed she hadnt been offended that had never been helens way instead shed lifted a hand to her lips and said ive done it again havent i you see this is the reason i need to keep buying shoes so many pairs end up in my mouth and my saliva ruins them she was completely impossible he thought engaging lovely maddening hilarious and wise always at heart wise in ways he would not have thought possible wise about him and wise about what was essential and important between them he missed her in this moment yet he celebrated her as well in that he felt a slight shift within him the first that had occurred since her murder he returned to his humming as he toweled himself off he was still humming towel wrapped round his waist when he opened the door and came facetoface with ds barbara havers he said my god havers said ive been called worse she scratched her mop of badly cut and currently uncombed hair are you always so chipper before breakfast sir because if you are this is the last time im sharing a bathroom with you he could for the moment do nothing but stare so unprepared was he for the sight of his former partner she was wearing floppy sky blue socks in lieu of slippers and she had on pink flannel pyjamas printed everywhere with the image of vinyl records musical notes and the phrase love like yours is sure to come my way she seemed to realise he was examining her getup because she said oh a gift from winston in apparent reference to it would that be the socks or the rest of it the rest he saw this in a catalogue he said he couldnt resist ill need to speak to sergeant nkata about his impulse control she chuckled i knew youd love them if you ever saw them havers the word love does not do justice to my feelings she nodded at the bathroom you finished your morning whatevers in there he stepped aside have at it she passed him but paused before closing the door tea she said coffee come to my room he was ready for her when she arrived dressed for her day he himself was clothed and hed made teahe wasnt desperate enough to face the provided coffee crystalswhen she knocked on his door and said unnecessarily its me he opened it to her she looked round and said you demanded the more elegant accommodation i see ive got something that used to be the garret i feel like cinderella before the glass boot he held up the tin teapot she nodded and plopped herself onto his bed which hed made she lifted the old chenille counterpane and inspected the job hed done hospital corners she noted very nice sir is that from eton or somewhere else in your chequered past my mother he said proper bed making and the correct use of table linens were at the heart of her child rearing should i add milk and sugar or do you want to do your own honours you can do it she said i like the idea of you waiting on me this is a first and it may be a last so i think ill enjoy it he handed her the doctored tea poured his own and joined her on the bed as there was no chair he said what are you doing here havers she gestured at the room with her teacup you invited me didnt you you know what i mean she took a sip of tea you wanted information about daidre trahair which you could easily have provided me on the phone he thought about this and recalled their conversation you were in your car when i phoned you on your mobile were you on your way down here i was barbara he spoke in a fashion to warn her off stay out of my life she said dont flatter yourself superintendent tommy or thomas or whatever but not superintendent tommy thomas not bloody likely are we fine with sir and when he shrugged good di hannaford has no mcit blokes working the case for her when she phoned the met for your identification she explained the situation i got sent as a loan and thats it thats it lynley looked at her evenly her face was a blank an admirable poker face that might have duped someone who knew her less well than he did am i actually meant to believe that barbara sir theres nothing else to believe they engaged in a stare down but ultimately there was nothing to be gained shed worked with him too long to be intimidated by any implications that might hang upon silence she said by the way no one ever put your resignation through channels as far as anyones concerned youre on compassionate leave indefinitely if thats what it takes she sipped her tea again is that what it takes lynley looked away from her outside a grey day was framed by the window and a sprig of the ivy that climbed on this side of the building was blowing against the glass i dont know he said i think im finished with it barbara theyve posted the job not your old one but the one you were in whenyou know webberlys job the detective superintendents position john stewarts applying others as well some from outside and some from within stewarts obviously got the inside track on it and between you and me that would be a disaster for everyone if he gets it it could be worse no it couldnt she put her hand on his arm so rare a gesture it was that he had to look at her come back sir i dont think i can he rose then to distance himself not from her but from the idea of returning to new scotland yard he said but why here in the middle of nowhere you could be staying in town which makes far more sense if youre working with bea hannaford i could ask the same of you sir i was brought here the first night it seemed easiest to stay it was the closest place to what to where the body was found and why are we turning this into an examination of me whats going on ive told you not everything he studied her evenly if shed come to keep a watch over him which was likely the case havers being havers there could be only one reason what did you learn about daidre trahair he asked her she nodded you see you havent lost your touch she downed the rest of her tea and held out her cup he poured her another and put in a packet of sugar and two of the thimbles of milk she said nothing else until hed handed the cup back and shed taken a swig a family called trahair are longtime residents of falmouth so that part of her storys on the upandup the dad sells tyres hes got his own company the mum does mortgages for homes no primary school records for a kid called daidre though you were right about that in some cases that might suggest she was sent off to school in the old way booted out the door when she was five or whatever home for half terms and the holidays but otherwise unseen and unheard till emerging from the great machine of propershe rolled the r to indicate her scorneducation at eighteen or whatever spare me the social commentary lynley said i speak purely from jealous rage of course havers said nothing i would have liked better than to be packed off to boarding school directly after i learned to blow my nose havers you havent lost that tone of martyred patience she noted cn i smoke in here by the way are you out of your mind just enquiring sir she curved her palm around her teacup so while i reckon she could have gone off to primary school it doesnt seem likely to me because there she is in the local secondary comprehensive from the time shes thirteen playing field hockey excelling at fencing singing in the school choir mezzosoprano if thats of interest and youre rejecting the idea of earlier boarding school for what reason first of all because it doesnt make sense i can see it done the reverse way primary day school and then boarding school when she was twelve or thirteen but boarding out through primary school and then returning home for secondary this is a middleclass family what middleclass family sends its kids off at that age and then has them back home when theyre thirteen its been known to happen whats the second of all the second of oh second of all theres no record of her birth not a cracker not a hint not in falmouth that is lynley considered the implications of this he said she told me she was born at home the birth would still have to be registered within fortytwo days and if she was born at home the midwife would have been there yes if her father delivered her did she tell you that if you and she were exchanging intimate details he glanced at her sharply but her face betrayed nothing then wouldnt that have been an intriguing one to share mum doesnt make it to the hospital for some reason like its a dark and stormy night or the car breaks down the electricity goes out theres a maniac loose in the streets theres been a military coup that history failed to record theres a curfew due to racial rioting the vikings having missed the east coast entirely because you know how vikings are when it comes to having a decent sense of direction have emerged from a time warp to invade the south coast of england or maybe aliens they might have landed but whatever the reason there they are at home with mum in labour and dad boiling water without knowing what hes supposed to do with it but nature takes its course anyway and out pops a baby girl they call daidre she placed her teacup on the narrow nightstand next to the bed which still doesnt explain why they wouldnt have registered the birth he said nothing so theres something shes not telling you sir im wondering why her story about the zoo checks out lynley told her she is a large animal veterinarian she does work for the bristol zoo ill give you that havers said i went to the trahairs house once i had a look through the birth registry no one was at home so i spoke to a neighbour theres a daidre trahair definitely she lives in bristol and works at the zoo but when i pressed a bit further for more information the woman dummied up it was just dr trahair is a credit to her parents and a credit to herself and you write that down in that notebook of yours and if you want to know more ill need to speak to my solicitor first before the door was shut in my face too many sodding cop dramas on telly she concluded darkly its killing our ability to intimidate lynley found he was struggling with a fact that disturbed him and it was not a fact about daidre trahair he said you went to the house you spoke to a neighbour havers this was supposed to be confidential did you not understand that she frowned drawing her eyebrows together she used her teeth to pull on the inside of her lip and she observed him he said nothing neither did she from below them came the distant sound of pots and pans clanging as breakfast began to be sorted out at the salthouse inn havers finally said with some evident care these are background checks sir when it comes to murder everyone involved has a background check theres nothing secret about that but not every background check is done by new scotland yard and you identified yourself when you spoke to the neighbour you showed your warrant card you told her where you were from yes course havers spoke carefully and this agitated lynley the idea that his former partner would use care with him whatever her reason but i dont see what that has to do with anything sir if you hadnt come upon the body the way you did have you thought of lynley cut in with it has everything to do with everything she knows i workonce workedfor the met if the mets now investigating herthe met and not the local policedont you see what that will mean to her that prhaps youre behind the investigation havers said well you are behind it and with damn good reason sir let me finish what i was saying you know how this works if you hadnt come upon santo kernes body the first person at the scene would have been daidre trahair and you know the game on that one i dont have to tell you for gods sake she didnt kill santo kerne she didnt show up to pretend she found the body she came into her cottage and discovered me there and i took her to the body because she asked to see it she said she was a doctor she wanted to see if she could help him she could have done that for a dozen reasons and heading the list is the fact that it might have looked damn odd if she hadnt done it she has absolutely no motive okay what if everything youre claiming is true what if she is who she says she is and it all checks out what does it matter that she knows were looking into her story that im looking into it that youre looking into it that father effing christmas is looking into it what does it matter he blew out a breath he knew part of the answer but only part he wasnt willing to give it he drank down his tea he longed for simplicity where there was none he longed for answers that were yes or no instead of an infinite string of maybe the bed creaked as havers rose the floor creaked as she walked across it to stand behind him she said if she knows were investigating her shes going to get nervous and thats where we want her thats where we want them all isnt it nervous people betray themselves betrayal like that works in our favour i cant see how openly investigating this woman yes you can i know you can you can and you do she touched him lightly briefly on the shoulder her voice was cautious but it was also gentle youreyoure in something of a state sir and thats normal after what youve been through now i wish this wasnt a world where people took advantage of others when theyre susceptible but you and i know what kind of world this is the kindness in her voice shook him it was the primary reason hed avoided everyone since helens burial his friends his associates his colleagues and finally his very family he couldnt bear their kindness and their unbounded compassion because it kept reminding him endlessly of the very thing he so desperately wanted to forget havers said youve got to have a care thats all im saying that and this we have to look at her exactly like were looking at everyone else i know that he said knowing is one thing superintendent believing will always be something else daidre sat on a stool at the corner of the kitchen work top against a tin canister of lentils she propped the postcard shed bought in the honesty stall of st smithys church on the previous afternoon she studied the gipsy caravan and the countryside in which it sat with a tiredlooking horse munching grass nearby picturesque she thought a charming image of a time long gone on occasion one still saw these sorts of conveyances on a country lane in this part of the world but nowwith their pleasing curved roofs and gaily painted exteriorsthey mainly served tourists who wanted to play briefly at romany travelers when shed gazed upon the postcard as long as she could without taking action she left the house she got into her car reversed it onto the narrow lane to polcare cove and drove forward down to the beach itself proximity to the beach reminded her of the previous night which she would have preferred not to think about but which she ended up thinking about anyway her slow walk back to the car with thomas lynley his quiet voice talking about his dead wife the darkness nearly complete so that aside from distant lights coming from the houses and cottages above them on the cliff she could barely see anything save his rather disturbing patrician profile helen was her name and shed come from a family not unlike his own daughter of an earl who had married an earl moving easily in the world into which shed been born filled with selfdoubts evidentlyalthough daidre found this piece of information about helen lynley difficult to believebecause of how shed been educated but at the same time extraordinarily kind witty amusing companionable fun loving gifted with the most admirable and desirable of human qualities daidre couldnt imagine his surviving the loss of such a woman and she couldnt see how anyone could ever come to terms with this loss being precipitated by murder twelve years old hed said no one knows why he shot her im so sorry shed said she sounds perfectly lovely she was now daidre made the turn she always made using polcare coves small car park to point her car in the direction that would take her out of the area behind her she heard the breakers collapsing onto the toothy slate reef before her she saw the sweep of the ancient valley and stowe wood above it where the trees were coming into leaf very soon beneath them bluebells would bloom carpeting the woods with a colour that tossed in rhythmic undulations in the springtime breeze like sapphire linen she made her way up and out of the cove she followed the lanes in the crisscrossing pattern dictated by the lay of the land and its ownership in this way she came to the a and there she headed south the drive she intended was an extended one at st columb road she stopped for a coffee and decided to have a pain au chocolat at a bakery café she spoke at length about guiltless chocolate consumption to the young man behind the till and she went so far as to ask that he give her a receipt for her food and her drink which she tucked into her wallet one never knew when the police were going to require an alibi of one she decided wryly best to keep records of ones every movement best to make certain people along the way have a vivid memory of ones visit to their establishment as far as the pain au chocolat was concerned what were a few unnecessary calories in the cause of substantiating a claim of innocence when she set off again she gained the roundabout that took her onto the a from there the distance wasnt great and the route was familiar she skirted redruth recovered quickly from one wrong turn and at last ended up at the junction of b and a numberless lane that was signposted for the village of carnkie this part of cornwall was completely unlike the vicinity of casvelyn here daidre parked her vauxhall in the triangle of pebblestrewn weeds that served as a meeting point of the two roads and she sat with her chin on her hands and her hands on the top of the steering wheel she looked out at a landscape green with spring rippling into the distance towards the sea penetrated periodically by derelict towers similar to those one found in the irish countryside the domiciles of poets hermits and mystics here however the old towers represented what remained of cornwalls great mining industry each of them an enormous engine house that sat atop a network of tunnels pits and caverns beneath the earth these were the mines that once had produced tin and silver copper and lead arsenic and wolfram their engine houses had contained the machinery that kept the mine operational pumping engines that rid the mines of water and whims that hauled both the ore and the waste rock in bucketlike kibbles up to the surface like gipsy caravans the engine houses were the stuff of picture postcards now but once theyd been the mainstay of peoples lives as well as the symbol of so many peoples destruction they stood all over the western part of cornwall and they existed in inordinate numbers particularly along much of the coast generally they came in pairs the tower of the mighty stone engine house rising three or four floors and roofless now with narrow arched windows as small as possible to avoid weakening the overall structure and next to itoften soaring above itthe smokestack which had once belched grim clouds into the sky now both the engine house and the smokestack provided a nesting place for birds above and a hiding place for dormice below and in the crannies and crevices of the structures a growing place for herb roberts pert magenta flowers that tangled with yellow bursts of ragwort as red valerian rose above them daidre saw all this at the same time as she did not see it she found herself thinking of another place entirely on the coast opposite the one towards which she now gazed it was near lamorna cove hed said the house and the estate upon which the house sat were together called howenstow hed saidwith some evident embarrassmentthat he had no idea where the name of the place had come from and from this admission shed concludedincorrectly or nothis ease with the life into which hed been born for over two hundred and fifty years his family had occupied both the house and the land and apparently there had never been a need for them to know anything more than the fact of its being theirs a sprawling jacobean structure into which some longago ancestor had married the youngest son of a baron making a match with the only childthe daughterof an earl my mother could probably tell you everything about the old pile hed said my sister as well my brother and iim afraid weve both rather let down the side when it comes to family history without judiththats my sisterid likely not know the names of my own greatgrandparents and you i suppose i did have greatgrandparents somewhere along the line shed replied unless of course i came like venus via the half shell but thats not very likely is it i think id have remembered such a spectacular entry so what was it like she wondered what was it like she pictured his mother in a great gilded bed servants on either side of her gently dabbing her face with handkerchiefs soaked in rose water as she laboured to bring forth a beloved son fireworks upon the announcement of an heir and tenant farmers tugging their forelocks and hoisting jugs of homebrew as the news went round she knew the image was completely absurd like thomas hardy meeting monty python but stupidly foolishly she could not let it go so she finally cursed herself and she scooped up the postcard shed brought from her cottage she got out of the car into the chilly breeze she found a suitable stone just on the verge of the b the rock was light enough and not half buried which made its removal easy she carried it back to the triangular juncture of the road and the lane and at the apex of this triangle she set the stone down then she tilted it and placed the postcard of the gipsy wagon beneath it that done she was ready to resume her journey chapter seventeen the final remark tammy had hurled at him before getting out of the car in casvelyn was you dont understand anything grandie no wonder everyone left you like they did she hadnt sounded angry as much as sad which had made it difficult for selevan penrule to counter with anything abusive hed have liked to fire a verbal missile in her direction and with the satisfaction that comes from long experience in the field of vocal warfare to watch it hit its mark but there was something in her eyes that prevented him despite the pain that her parting shot caused him perhaps he thought he was losing his touch either that or the girl was getting under his skin he hated to think that might be the case hed confronted her when they were on the road to clean barrel surf shop and he had been quite proud that hed mastered in himself the compulsion to tackle her on the previous afternoon he didnt like secrets and he hated lies that tammy possessed the first and acted on the second disturbed him more than he wanted to admit for despite her oddities of dress behaviour nutrition and intention he liked the girl and he wanted to think her different from the rest of the worlds furtive adolescents who had clandestine secondary lives that appeared to be defined by sex drugs and bodily mutilation hed believed this to be the case about her her essential difference from others of her age but then hed found the envelope under her mattress when hed changed the sheets and he knew from reading its contents that she was indeed very like her contemporaries whatever progress he thought hed made with her was nothing but a sham in some situations that knowledge wouldnt have bothered him nothing was going to happen immediately so he could redouble his efforts and eventually bend her will to hisand to her parents as well but the problem with that belief was that tammys mum was a woman not known for her patience she wanted results and if she didnt get them selevan knew that tammys time in cornwall would be terminated so hed brought forth the envelope hed found beneath her mattress and hed placed it on the dashboard as they drove into town shed looked at it shed looked at him and damn the girl shed taken the offensive youre going through my personal things when im not home shed said sounding for all the world like a fatally wounded spirit thats what you did to auntie nan didnt you he wasnt about to get into a discussion of his daughter and the worthless hooligan to whom shed been married in alleged bliss for twentytwo years he said dont make this about your aunt girl tell me what youre about with this nonsense you cant tolerate anyone who disagrees with you grandie and dads just like you if somethings not part of your experience its not to be bothered with or its bad or evil even well this isnt evil its what i want and if you and dad and mum cant see that its the sort of answer the whole bloody world needs just now in order to stop being the whole bloody world shed grabbed up the envelope and shoved it into her rucksack he thought to snatch it from her and toss it out of the window but what would have been the point where that one came from another could be got her voice was different when she spoke again she sounded shaken the victim of betrayal i thought you understood and anyway i didnt think you were the sort of person who snoops in other peoples belongings that was rather maddening to selevan he was the one betrayed by her wasnt he she was hiding correspondence from him not the other way round when her mum phoned from africa and tammy was the object of discussion he didnt hide that from her and they didnt speak in code so her umbrage was completely out of order now you listen to me hed begun i wont she said quietly not till you start listening to me as well that had been that until shed opened the car door in casvelyn shed made her final statements and trudged to the shop at another time he would have followed her no child of his had ever spoken to him in such a way without feeling the strap the belt the paddle or the palm problem was tammy was not his child an injured generation stood between them and both of them knew whod caused the wounds so hed let her go and hed driven back to sea dreams with a very heavy heart he did some cleaning and he cooked himself a second breakfast of beans on toast hoping that putting something more in his stomach would cure its roiling he took this to the table and he ate it but the food didnt stop him from feeling ill a car door slamming outside diverted selevan from his misery he glanced out of the window and saw jago reeth opening the door of his caravan as madlyn angarrack approached him jago came down the steps and held out his arms madlyn walked into them and jago patted first her back and then her head they went inside the caravan together with madlyn wiping her eyes on the sleeve of jagos flannel shirt the sight pierced selevan he couldnt work out how jago reeth managed what was so bloody impossible for himself being a man to whom young people actually wished to talk obviously there was something to the way jago listened and responded to youngsters that selevan had failed to learn except it was so easy when they werent your relations wasnt it and wasnt that something that jago himself had already said it didnt matter all selevan knew was that jago reeth might possess the key to a grandfathers having one single reasonable conversation with his own granddaughter he needed to find out what that key was before tammys mother pulled the plug and sent the girl elsewhere to take the mental cure he waited till madlyn angarrack had left exactly fortythree minutes after shed arrived then he crossed over to jagos caravan and rapped upon the door when jago opened it selevan saw that his friend was about to head off somewhere as hed put on his jacket the halfbroken specs which he wore only at liquidearth and a headband to keep his long hair away from his face selevan was about to offer an apology for the disruption to jagos plans but the other man stopped him and told him to come inside you got something eating at you he said i cn see that without you telling me mate just let me jago went to a phone and punched in a few numbers he reached an answer machine it seemed because he said lew me going to be late got a bit of mergency here at home madlyn stopped in by the way bit upset again but i think shes sorted theres a board needs checking in the hot cupboard eh he rang off replacing the receiver selevan watched his movements the parkinsons looked bad this morning either that or jagos medication hadnt kicked in old age was a bugger no doubt of that but old age and disease together were the devil as a means of introducing the subject for discussion he took from his pocket the necklace hed removed from tammy on the previous day he laid it on the table and when jago joined him at the banquette that served as a seat he gestured to it found this on the girl selevan told him she was wearing it round her neck said the m means mary do you credit that came right out and said it didnt she bland as could be like it was the most natural thing in the world jago picked the necklace up and examined it scapular he said thats it thats what she called it scapular but the ms for mary thats the concern the mary bit jago nodded but selevan could see that a smile was playing round the corners of his mouth this was a bit of an irritant to selevan easy for jago to have a bleeding laugh at the situation wasnt his granddaughter wearing m for mary round her neck he said somethings happened to the girl somewhere long the line thats all i can reckon from the mess she is now i put it down to africa being exposed to all those native women in the raw walking round the streets of wherever with their privates hanging out s no wonder to me shes got herself confused mother of jesus jago said that and then some selevan intoned jago laughed then and he did so heartily selevan reared up jago said dont get yourself twisted mate you said yourself its m for mary on a scapular that would mean m for mary for the mother of jesus its a devotional thing this is catholics wear them you might see a picture of jesus on one a saint on another st whoever of whatever its a mark of devotion damn selevan muttered no bloody end to this mess tammys mum would have a seizure no doubt about that one more reason to pack tammy up and send her on her way in sally joys mind the only thing worse than being a catholic was being a terrorist st george and the dragon wouldve been better selevan said that image at least could have been seen as patriotic not likely to find st george on one of these jago said allowing the scapular to dangle from his fingers dragons being the work of imagination which makes st george himself something of a question mark eh but thats the general idea of em a believer in this or that holy person puts this thing round his neckor her neck in the case of your tammyand i spose she ends up feeling holy herself i blame the effing politicians selevan said darkly they made the world in the state its in today and thats why the girls working to get herself holy trying to prepare for the end of days she is and theres no one been able to talk her out of it that what she says eh selevan took the scapular and shoved it into the breast pocket of his shirt she says she wants a prayerful life thats her very words i want a prayerful life grandie i believe its what everyone should aspire to as if sitting alone in a cave somewhere and eating grass for your meals and drinking your own piss once a week is going to do one bleeding thing to solve the worlds problems thats the plan is it oh i dont know what the effing plan is no one knows and that includes the girl you see how it is she hears about a cult she can join and she means to join it because this cultunlike the rest of the god damn cults out thereis the one thats going to save the world jago looked thoughtful selevan hoped the other man was coming up with a solution to the problem of tammy but jago said nothing so selevan had to speak again he said i cant get through to the girl cant even begin to found a letter under her bed and they were telling her to come on by and check things out have an interview here sos we cn take the measure of you and see if youre suitable and if we like you and whatever else i show her i found it and she goes off her chump cause im doing the snoop through her things jago looked thoughtful he scratched his head were eh he said whats that you were doing the snoop int that the case i got to if i dont her mums all over me like melted cheese on the radiator she says we need you to make her see the light someones got to make her see the light before its too late thats just the problem jago pointed out thats where the lot of you re going wrong whichs where selevan spoke to his friend without defence if he was going at this problem of tammy in the wrong way he meant to learn the right way at once and hed come to jago because of that the devil of young people jago said is that they got to be allowed to take their own decisions mate but hear me out its part of making their way to being grown they take a decision they make a mistake and if no one rushes like the fire brigade to save them from the outcome they learn from the whole experience tisnt the job of the dador the granddad or the mum or the granto keep them from learning what they got to learn mate what they got to do is help work out the end of the story selevan could see this he could even run it through his mind and largely agree with it but agreement was a process of intellect it had nothing to do with heart jagos position in lifehaving no children or grandkids of his ownmade it simple for him to adhere to this admirable philosophy it also explained why the young people felt able to talk to him they talked he listened likely it was similar to sharing ones secrets with a wall but what was the point if the wall didnt say hang on a minute youre making a bloody fool of yourself or youre choosing wrong damn it or listen to me cos i been alive about sixty years longern you and those years damn well ought to count for something or whats the point in having lived them beyond that didnt parents and grandparents have some right to sort out their offspring not to mention to determine what the offspring would be doing with the rest of their lives that was what had happened to him wasnt it he may not have liked it he may not have wanted it he may not in a hundred years have chosen it for himself but wasnt he a better and stronger person for having rubbished his dreams of the royal navy in favour of a dutiful life on the farm jago was watching him one bushy eyebrow raised above the frame of his wornout specs his expression said that he knew what selevan was thinking about jagoaslistener and he didnt disagree with selevans assessment he said theres more to it than that mate despite what youre thinking if you get to know em you end up caring and you end up hating to see em decide something that you knows for the bad but no one listens when theyre young did you selevan dropped his gaze for that was the fly in the ointment of his life when everything was laid out in front of him he had listened he had chosen as hed been told to choose and doing that hadnt spared him a lifetime of regret indeed it was the single cause of it bloody hell he sighed he put his head in his hands the very thing his friend jago reeth agreed bea hannaford hadnt started her day in the best of moods and her outlook wasnt improving during her meeting with new scotland yards detective sergeant barbara havers upon the sergeants arrival in casvelyn bea had instructed her to check into the salthouse inn and to do some serious trolling through what thomas lynley had so far managed to discover about dr trahair she knew ds havers had long worked with lynley in london and if anyone was going to be able to wring something out of the man it had seemed to hannaford that it was going to be barbara havers but apparently clean so far was the extent of what havers had to report about lynleys excursions into the mysterious daidre trahairs background which made hannaford wonder about her own wisdom in the entire affair she after all had accepted the offer of the mets assistant commissioner sir david hillier to send lynleys former partner on loan to work the murder enquiry the response of he says shes clean so far but hes carrying on in answer to what do we know from superintendent lynley about dr trahair had not been what hannaford wished to hear it had made her wonder about loyalties and where they ought to be lying she herself had spoken to lynley hed reported on his excursion to pengelly cove on the previous afternoon and she could tell his interest was now decidedly caught up in the kernes this was all well and good since everything had to be looked into eventually but digging into the kernes background was not going to keep lynley interested in daidre trahair and interested in daidre trahair was exactly where bea hannaford wanted him to be the vet was a liar no question about it based upon the way she had looked at lynley when bea had seen them togethera bit of a mix among compassion admiration and lustlynley had appeared to be the best road to drive along if the destination was sorting the doctors truths from the doctors lies now bea wasnt so sure so in speaking to barbara havers beas mood was blacker than it had been upon waking and she wouldnt have thought that possible for shed awakened with petes questions and petes comments of the previous day on her mind which meant shed awakened in exactly the same manner as shed fallen asleep why do you hate him so muchhe loves you clearly it was time for another round of internet dating if only she could have spared the hours it would take to troll to select to contact to try to discern if the individual was worth an evening and then somehow to find that evening and thenwhat would be the point really how many more toads was she going to have to dine with drink with or coffee with before one of them showed colours more princely than amphibious hundreds it seemed thousands all that and she wasnt even sure she wanted another relationship anyway she pete and the dogs were doing fine on their own thus when bea faced barbara havers in the vicinity of the china board as they looked over the days activities she examined the met sergeant with a critical eye having more to do with an assessment of her professional commitment than it had to do with an evaluation of her fashion sense which was more deplorable than bea would have thought possible in a female adult today ds havers was wearing a lumpy fishermans sweater over a highnecked tshirt with what looked like a coffee stain on its collar she had on figurereducing olive tweed trouserseasily an inch too short and possibly twelve years too oldand the same red hightop trainers on her feet she looked like a cross between a street vagrant and a refugee fleeing from a war zone with clothing provided from castoffs of oxfam castoffs bea tried to ignore all this she said to her ive got the distinct impression superintendent lynleys dragging his feet on the issue of dr trahair what do you think sergeant she then watched to gauge haverss answer he might well be havers replied easily enough considering all thats happened to him hes not exactly one hundred percent but if shes at the bottom of what happened to this kid and he susses it out hell move on her you can depend on him are you saying i ought to allow him to pursue this in whatever way he sees fit havers didnt reply at once she looked at the china board careful thought could indicate her priorities and bea made this a mark in her favour i think hell be okay havers said the last thing hes about to do is let anyone get away with murder all things considered if you know what i mean of course there was that what made him susceptible also made him a man who would never want another person to go through what he himself had gone through besides that his very susceptibility could work in their favour since a vulnerable person was one in whose presence essential mistakes might be made by another person these would be dr trahairs mistakes naturally where shed made one shed eventually make others bea said all right come with me then weve a bloke in town who did a turn inside for doing the job on someone down the south coast this was a few years ago he ended up crying its the drink to the judge but as the bloke on the receiving end of his attention came up a paraplegic bloody hell ds havers said the judge sent him away hes out now but sos his temper and his proclivity for the drink he knew santo kerne and someone blackened santo kernes eye shortly before his death given its not the sort of beating put this bloke away but he wants a thorough talking to will mendick was at his place of employment a modern brick supermarket looking wildly out of place as it stood at the junction of the top of belle vue and st mevan crescent which bea pointed out to havers as the route to adventures unlimited a visible hulk out on the promontory the market was also a very short distance from the baked delights of casvelyn of cornwall and when they alighted from beas land rover in the car park at the back of the grocery the morning breeze was sending the fragrance of fresh pasties in their direction barbara havers cut into this perfume by lighting a cigarette she pulled at it hungrily as they walked along the side of the building to its front door managing to smoke half of it before they entered in an extremely optimistic embracing of spring the supermarkets management had turned off the heating so it was frigid within custom was sparse at this time of day and only one of the six tills was open a question at it led bea and sergeant havers towards the back of the premises there two swinging doors closed off the warehouse where goods were stored no admittance and staff only were posted upon them bea shouldered through her identification ready they encountered an unshaven man ducking into the employees loo and stopped him with a word police he didnt snap to as bea would have liked but at least he appeared cooperative she asked for will mendick at his response of outside i expect they found themselves heading in the direction from which theyd originally come working their way along the side of the building but within it this time along a gloomy aisle and beneath towering shelves of paper products boxedup tins of this and that and huge cartons printed with enough brands of junk food to keep morbid obesity going for several generations on the south side of the building a loading dock bore pallets of goods in the process of being removed from an enormous articulated lorry bea expected to find will mendick here but the answer to another question pointed her over to a collection of wheelie bins at the far end of the dock there she saw a young man stowing discarded vegetables and other items into a black rubbish bag this apparently was will mendick committing the act of subversion for which santo kerne had created his tshirt he was fighting off the gulls to do it though above and around him they flapped their wings they soared near him occasionally apparently trying to frighten him off their patch like extras in hitchcocks film mendick looked at beas identification carefully when she produced it he was tall and ruddy and he grew immediately ruddier when he saw the cops had come to call definitely the skin of a guilty man bea thought the young man glanced from bea to havers and back to bea and his expression suggested that neither woman fit his notions of what a cop should look like im on a break he told them as if concerned that they were there to monitor his employment hours thats fine with us bea informed him we can talk while youdo whatever it is youre doing dyou know how much food is wasted in this country he asked her sharply rather a lot i expect thats an understatement try tonnes of it tonnes a sellby date passes and out its chucked its a crime it is good of you then to put it to use i eat it he sounded defensive i sorted that bea told him you have to i wager barbara havers noted pleasantly bit tough for it to make it all the way to the sudan before it rots moulds hardens or whatevers costs you next to nothing as well so it has that in its favour too mendick eyed her as if evaluating her level of disrespect her face showed nothing he appeared to take the decision to ignore any judgement they might make about his activity he said you want to talk to me so talk to me you knew santo kerne well enough for him to design a tshirt for you from what weve learned if you know that then youll also know that this is a small town and most people here knew santo kerne i hope youre talking to them as well well get to the rest of his associates eventually bea replied just now its you were interested in tell us about conrad nelson hes operating from a wheelchair these days the way i hear it mendick had a few spots on his face near his mouth and these turned the colour of raspberries he went back to sorting through the supermarkets discards he chose some bruised apples and followed them with a collection of limp courgettes he said i did my time for that which we know bea assured him but what we dont know is how it happened and why its nothing to do with your investigation its assault with intent bea told him its grave bodily injury its a stretch inside at the pleasure of youknowwho when someones got details like that in his background mr mendick we like to know about them especially if hes an associateclose or otherwiseof someone who ends up murdered where theres smoke theres fire havers lit up another cigarette as if to emphasise her point youre destroying your lungs and everyone elses mendick told her thats a disgusting habit while wheeliebin diving is what havers asked not letting something go to waste damn i wish i shared your nobility of character reckon you lost sight of itthat noble part of youwhen you bashed that bloke in plymouth eh i said i did my stretch we understand you told the judge it had to do with drink bea said dyou still have a problem with that is it still leading you to go off the nut that was your claim ive been told i dont drink any longer so its not leading me anywhere he looked into the wheelie bin spied something he apparently wanted and dug down to bring forth a packet of fig bars he stowed this in the bag and went on with his search he ripped open and tossed a loaf of apparently stale bread onto the tarmac for the gulls they went after it greedily i do aa if its anything to you he added and i havent had a drink since i came out i do hope thats the case mr mendick how did that altercation in plymouth begin i told you its got nothing to do he seemed to rethink his angry toneas well as the direction of the conversationbecause he sighed and said i used to get blind drunk i had a dustup with this yob and i dont know what it was about because when i drank like that i couldnt remember what set me off or even if something set me off at all i didnt remember the fight the next day and im damn sorry that bloke ended up like he did because it wasnt my intention i probably just wanted to sort him is that your general method of sorting people when i drank it was its not something im proud of its also over i did my time i made my amends i try to stay clean try bloody hell he climbed up into the wheelie bin he began a more furious rooting through its contents santo kerne took a fairly serious punch sometime before he died bea said i wonder if you can tell us anything about that i cant he said you cant or you wont why dyou want to pin this on me because you look so damn guilty bea thought because youre lying about something and i can read it in the colour of your skin which is flaming now from your cheeks to your ears and even to your scalp thats my job bea told him to pin this on someone if that someones not you id like to know why i had no reason to hurt him or to kill him or to anything howd you come to know him i worked at clean barrel that surf shop on the corner of the strand mendick nodded in the general direction he came in because he wanted a board thats how we met few months after he moved to town but you no longer work at clean barrel surf shop has that something to do with santo kerne as well i sent him to liquidearth for a board and i got found out i lost my job i wasnt supposed to be sending anyone to the competition not that liquidearth is the competition but there was no telling the boss man that was there so i got the sack blamed him for that did you sorry to disappoint you but no it was the right thing to do sending santo to liquidearth he was a beginner hed never even been out he needed a beginners board we didnt have any decent ones at the timejust shit from china if you want to know and we sold that clobber mostly to touristsso i told him to go see lew angarrack whod make him a good one that he could learn on it would cost a bit more but it would be right for him thats what i did thats all i did jesus from nigel coyles reaction you wouldve thought id shot someone santo brought the board by to show me coyle happened to be there and the rest is history santo did you a bad turn then so i killed him waited two years to kill him not likely he felt bad enough about what happened he apologised maybe six dozen times where where what where did he apologise where did you see him wherever he said the towns small like i said on the beach i dont go to the beach in a surfing town like casvelyn you dont go to the beach i dont surf you were selling surfboards but you yourself dont surf whys that mr mendick god damn it mendick rose up he towered above them in the wheelie bin but he would have towered above them anyway for he was tall albeit gangly bea could see the veins throbbing in his temples she wondered what it took for him to control that nasty temper of his and she also wondered what it took for him to unleash it on someone she felt sergeant havers tense next to her and she glanced her way the ds had a hard expression on her face and bea liked her for this for it told her havers wasnt the sort of woman who backed down easily in a confrontation did you compete with other surfers bea asked did you compete with santo did he compete with you did you give it up what i dont like the sea he spoke through his teeth i dont like not knowing whats beneath me in the water because therere sharks in every part of the world and i dont care to become acquainted with one i know about boards and i know about surfing but i dont surf all right i suppose do you climb mr mendick climb what no i dont climb what do you do then i hang with my friends santo kerne among them he wasnt mendick backed off from the rapidity of their conversation as if he recognised how easily he could become trapped if he continued the pace he packed more items into his rubbish baga few seriously dented tins some packages of spinach and other greens a handful of packaged herbs a packet of tea cakesbefore he climbed out of the bin and made his reply santo didnt have friends mendick said not in the normal sense not like other people do he had people he associated with when he wanted them for something such as such as having experiences with them thats how he put it he was all about that having experiences what sort of experiences mendick hesitated which told bea theyd come to the crux of the matter it had taken her longer than she liked to get him to this point and she briefly considered that she might be losing her touch but at least shed got him there so she told herself there was life in her yet mr mendick she said sex he replied santo was dead mad about sex he was eighteen havers noted is there an eighteenyearold boy alive who isnt dead mad about sex the way he was what he was into yeah id say theres eighteenyearolds who arent a bit like him what was he into i dont know just that it was off thats all shed say that and the fact he was cheating on her she bea asked would that be madlyn angarrack what did she tell you nothing just that what he was into made her sick ah that brought them nearly full circle bea thought and in this investigation full circle continually seemed to mean that yet another liar had been revealed close to madlyn are you havers was asking not particularly i know her brother cadan so i know her as well like i said casvelyns small enough given time everyone ends up knowing everyone in what sense would that be bea asked will mendick he looked confused what the knowing bit she said everyone ends up knowing everyone you said i was wondering in what sense you meant that it was clear from mendicks expression that the allusion was lost upon him but that was no matter they had madlyn angarrack where they wanted her chapter eighteen had it not been for the rain on the previous afternoon ben kerne would likely not have seen his father when he went to pengelly cove but because of the rain hed insisted upon driving his mother back to ecohouse from the curlew inn at the end of her workday shed had her large threewheeler with her upon which she daily pedaled to and from work without too much difficulty despite her stroke in earlier years but hed insisted the tricycle would fit into the back of the austin he told her he wouldnt have her on the narrow lanes in bad weather she shouldnt be on them in good weather either if it came down to it she wasnt of an agelet alone in the physical conditionwhere she should be out on a tricycle anyway to her carefully enunciated poststroke words got three wheels ben he said it didnt matter he said his father should have the common sense to purchase a vehicle now that he and his wife were old even as he said this he wondered at the evolution of parentchild relationships in which the parent ultimately becomes the child and he wondered without wanting to wonder if his own fragile connection with santo would have mutated in a similar fashion he doubted it santo seemed at the moment as he would be forever frozen in an eternal youth with no chance to move on to things more important than the concerns of randy adolescence it was the thought of randy adolescence that plagued him throughout the long night that followed his visit to ecohouse yet when he drove down the deeply rutted lane towards the old farmhouse that was the last subject upon which he would have thought his mind would lock instead he followed the rises falls and curves of that unpaved lane and he marveled that the passage of years had done nothing to release him from the fear hed always harboured towards his father apart from eddie kerne he did not have to consider fear nearing him it was as if hed never left pengelly cove his mother had sensed this shed said in that altered voice she hadgod did she actually sound portuguese hed wonderedthat hed find his father very much changed in the years hed been gone to which hed replied he didnt sound any different on the phone mum physically shed said now there was a frailty about him he tried to hide it but he was feeling his age she didnt add that he was feeling his failure as well ecohouse had been the dream of his life living off the land in harmony with the elements indeed hed planned to master those elements so that they worked for him it had been an admirable attempt at living green but hed bitten off too much and he hadnt possessed the jaws to chew it all if eddie kerne heard the austin drive up to ecohouse he didnt emerge nor did he emerge as ben wrestled his mothers tricycle from the back of the car when they approached the wreck of the old front door however eddie was waiting for them he swung it open before they reached it as if hed been watching from one of the filthy and illhung windows despite his mothers warning ben felt the shock when he saw his father old he thought and looking older than he actually was eddie kerne wore old mans spectacleswith thick black frames and thick smeared lensesand behind them his eyes had lost much of their colour one of them was clouded by a cataract which ben knew hed never have removed the rest of him was old as well from his badly matched and badly patched clothing to the places on his face that his razor had missed to the corkscrew of hairs springing out of his ears and his nose his gait was slow and his shoulders were round he was the personification of end of days ben felt a sudden rush of dizziness when he saw him he said dad eddie kerne looked him over one of those abrupt headtotoe movements thatto an offspring of the adult performing themtend to signify assessment and judgement simultaneously he stepped away from the door without comment he disappeared into the bowels of the house under other circumstances ben would have departed then but his mother murmured shush shush from which he took comfort no matter where she was directing the sound it came straight from his childhood and he embraced its meaning mummys here darling no need to cry he felt her hand on the small of his back urging him forward eddie was waiting for them in the kitchen which seemed to be the only remaining usable room in the downstairs of the house it was well lit and warm while the rest of the place was shrouded in shadows packed with bits and bobs and clobber smelling of mildew filled with the skittering of rodents in the walls hed put on the kettle ann kerne nodded towards this meaningfully as if it gave evidence of something within eddie that had altered along with his physical decay he shuffled to the cupboard and brought out three mugs along with a jar of coffee crystals and a raggedy box of sugar cubes when he had this on the chipped yellow table along with a plastic jug of milk a loaf of bread and an unwrapped cube of margarine he said to ben scotland yard not the locals mind you but scotland yard not like you thought eh its biggern the locals didnt spect that did you question is did she ben knew who she was she was who she had always been eddie went on other question is who phoned em who wants scotland yard on the case and whyd they come running like a fires lit under em i dont know ben said wager you dont if its bigger n the locals its bad if its bad its her things is home to roost now benesek knew this would happen didnt i dellens nothing to do with this dad dont say her name round me its a curse it is his wife said eddie in a conciliatory tone and she put her hand on bens arm as if afraid he would bolt but the sight of his father had abruptly changed things for ben so old he thought so terribly old broken as well he wondered how he had failed to understand till now that life had long ago defeated his father hed beaten his fists against ithad eddie kerneand refused to submit to its demands these demands were for compromise and change to take life on lifes terms which required the ability to switch courses when necessary to modify behaviours and to alter dreams so that they could meet the realities that they came up against but hed never been able to do any of that so hed been crushed and life had rolled over his shattered body the kettle clicked off as the water came to a boil when eddie turned to fetch it to the table ben went to him he heard his mother murmur shush and shush another time but he found that comfort unnecessary now he approached his father one man to another he said i wish things could have been different for all of us i love you dad eddies shoulders bowed further why couldnt you shake her off his voice sounded as broken as his spirit i dont know ben said i just couldnt but thats down to me not to dellen she cant bear the blame for my weakness you wouldnt see youre right and now i dont know still yes thats my personal hell do you understand in all these years never once did you have to make it yours eddies shoulders shook he tried and failed to lift the kettle ben lifted it for him and carried it to the table where he poured the water into their mugs he didnt want the coffee it would keep him awake that night when all he wanted was indefinite sleep but he would drink it if that was what was required of him if that was the communion his father wanted all of them sat eddie sat last his head looked too heavy for his neck to bear and it fell forward his chin nearing his chest what is it then eddie ann kerne asked her husband i told the cop he said i couldve tossed him from the property but i didnt do that i wantedi dont know what i wanted benesek i told him everything i knew the restless night that followed thus had a twofold source the coffee hed drunk and the knowledge hed gained for if his conversation with eddie kerne had at least gone some way towards burying some of the excruciating past between them that same conversation had resurrected another part of it for the remainder of the day and into the night hed had to look at that part squarely hed had to wonder about it neither was an activity in which he particularly wished to engage set against the rest of his life one night should have been insignificant a party with his mates and that was all a gathering he wouldnt even have gone to had he not just two days earlier had the courage to break off with dellen nankervis yet another time he was thus morose his life a thing that he believed was in tatters you want cheering up was his mates recommendation that wanker parsons is having a party everyones invited so come with us get your mind off the bloody cow for once that had proved impossible for dellen had been there in a crimson sundress and spiky sandals smooth of leg and tan of shoulder blonde hair soft and long and thick eyes like bluebells seventeen years old and with the heart of a siren shed come alone but she hadnt remained so for she was dressed like a flame and like a flame she drew them his mates were not among them for they knew the trap dellen nankervis presented how she baited it how she sprang it and in the end what she did with her prey so they kept their distance but the others didnt ben watched until he could bear no more palm curved round a glass and he drank it pill pressed into his hand and he took it spliff placed between his fingers and he smoked it the miracle was that he hadnt died from everything hed ingested that night what he had done was welcome the ministrations of any girl willing to vanish into a darkened corner with him he knew there had been three there may have been more it hadnt mattered what counted was only that dellen see take your fucking hands off my sister had brought a sudden end to the game jamie parsons was the hotvoiced speaker acting the part of outraged brothernot to mention gapyear brother wealthy brother travelingtheearthtothehotspotsofsurfingandmakingsureeveryoneknewaboutit brotherdiscovering a lowlife nonce with his fingers in his sisters knickers and his sister shoved up against the wall with one leg lifted and loving it loving it which ben had foolishly loudly and in the presence of everyone in hearing distance declared to be his real crime once jamie parsons had separated them hed been summarily and with no delicacy tossed out and his mates had followed and as far as he had ever known or dared to ask dellen had remained behind christ that bloody wanker needs sorting they all agreed up to their eyeballs with drink with drugs and with resentment towards jamie parsons and after that ben simply didnt know he ran the story through his head all night after returning to casvelyn from ecohouse and pengelly cove hed got back round ten and hed not done more than pace the hotel pausing at windows to look out at the restless bay the hotel was quiet kerra not there alan gone for the day and dellenshe was not in the sitting room or the kitchen of the family quarters and he looked no further for he needed time to sift through what he remembered and to differentiate it from what he imagined he finally entered their bedroom at midmorning dellen lay diagonally across the bed she breathed a heavy druginduced sleep and the bottle of pills that had sent her there was uncapped on the bedside table where the light still burned as it had likely done all night dellen too incapacitated to turn it off he sat on the edge of the bed she did not awaken she hadnt changed out of her clothing on the previous night and her red scarf formed a pool beneath her head its fringe fanning out like petals with dellen its centre the heart of the flower his curse was that he still could love her his curse was that he could look at her now and despite everything and especially despite santos murder he could still want to claim her because she possessed and he feared would forever possess the ability to wipe from his heart and his mind everything else that was not dellen and he did not understand how this could be or what terrible twist of his psyche made it so her eyes opened in them and just for an instant before awareness came to her completely he saw the truth in the dullness of her expression that what he needed from his wife she could not give him though he would continue to try to take it from her again and again she turned her head away leave me she said or kill me because i cant i saw his body ben told her or rather his face theyd dissected himthats what they do except they use a different word for itso they kept him covered up to his chin i could have seen the rest but i didnt want to it was enough to see his face oh god it was just a formality they knew it was santo they have his car they have his driving licence so they didnt need me to look at him i expect i could have closed my eyes at the last moment and just said yes thats santo and not have looked at all she raised her arm and pressed her fist against her mouth he didnt want to evaluate all the reasons why he was compelled to speak at this point all he accepted about himself was that he felt it necessary to do more than relay antiseptic information to his wife he felt it necessary to move her out of herself and into the core of her motherhood even if that meant she would blame him as he deserved to be blamed it would be better he thought than watching her go elsewhere she cant help it hed reminded himself of that fact endlessly throughout the years she is not responsible she needs me to help her he didnt know if this was the truth any longer but to believe something else at this late hour would make more than a quarter century of his life a lie i bear the fault for everything that happened he went on i couldnt cope i needed more than anyone could ever give me and when they couldnt give it i tried to wring it from them thats how it was with you and me thats how it was with santo you should have divorced me why in gods name did you never divorce me she began to weep she turned to lie on her side facing the bedside table where her bottle of pills stood she reached for them as if intending another dose he took up the bottle and said not now i need you need to stay here i cant give them to me dont leave me like this it was the cause the very root of the tree dont leave me like this i love you i love youi dont know whymy head feels like something about to blow up and i cant helpcome here my darling come here come here theyve sent someone down from london he could see from her expression that she did not understand shed strayed from santos death at this point and she wanted to stray further but he would not let her a detective he said someone from scotland yard he spoke to my father why they check everything when someones been murdered they look into every nook and cranny of everyones life do you understand what that means he spoke to dad and dad told him everything he knew about what about why i left pengelly cove but that has nothing to do with its something to look at and thats what they do they look give me the pills no she made a grab for them anyway he held the bottle out of her reach he said i didnt sleep last night being in pengelly cove talking to dadit brought everything back that party at cliff house the drink the drugs groping in the shadows and who the hell cared who saw if things went further and things did go further didnt they i dont remember it was a long time ago ben please give me the pills youll go away if i do but i want you here you need to feel something of what i feel i want that from you because if i dont have that much what he wondered if she couldnt give him what he asked of her now what would he do that he hadnt already tried and failed to do in the past his threats were empty and both of them knew it death asks for death in the end no matter what we do he told her i didnt like santo surfing i believed that surfing could lead him to where surfing had led me and i told myself that was my reason but the truth was that i wanted to take from him the core of who he was because i was afraid it all came down to my believing he had to live the way i live i as much as said live like a dead man and ill love you for it and these he gestured with the pills dellen tried to snatch them so he whipped them away and rose from the bed these make you dead as well dead to the world but in the world is where i want you to be you know whatll happen i cant stop myself i try and i feel like my skull is pounding and its always been that way you know that so you get relief from pills and from drink and if there are no pills and if drink doesnt work give them to me she too rose from the bed he was near the window so it took no effort he opened it and spilled sedatives down the side of the building into the muddy border where springtime plants languished waiting for sun that was long in coming dellen wailed she ran to ben she beat her fists against him he caught them and held them i want you seeing he said and hearing and feeling and remembering if i have to cope with all of this alone i hate you she screamed you want and you want but you wont find someone wholl give you what you want that persons not me it never has been and you wont let me go and i hate you god god how i hate you she tore herself from him and for a moment he thought she meant to dash from the room and scrabble in the mud below them in order to rescue her fastdissolving pills but instead she went to the cupboard where she began yanking clothing from within it was red upon red crimson magenta and every point in between and all of it she threw in a heap on the floor she was looking for the one that said the most he thought like the crimson sundress on that longago evening he said tell me what happened i was with parsonss sister i was doing what i could do to her what shed let me get away with and that was a lot he found us together and he threw me out not because he cared that his sister was about to get stuffed in the corridor of her parents house in the midst of a party but because he liked feeling superior to everyone and this was another way to do it it wasnt a class thing or even a money thing it was a jamie thing tell me what happened between you once i left she continued throwing her clothes on the floor when shed finished with the cupboard she went to the chest here she did the same knickers and bras petticoats jerseys scarves just the red of it all until the clothing was pooled round her feet like the pulp of fruit did you fuck him dellen ive never asked about any of them specifically but this is the one i want to know did you say to him theres a sea cave on the beach where ben and i go for sex and ill meet you there and he wouldnt have known we were finished you and i he would have thought it a good way to sort me so hed meet you there and no hed fuck you like you wanted but hed taken some of the drugs on offerweed coke whatever else was therelsdecstasyand hed mixed them with whatever he was drinking and once hed done what you wanted him to do you just left him passed out cold and deep in the cave and when the tide came in the way it always comes in no you were long gone youd got what you wanted and what you wanted had nothing to do with getting stuffed and everything to do with getting revenge and what you reckoned was thatjamie being jamiehed be the one to make certain i knew hed had you the very next time he saw me but what you hadnt reckoned was the tide would get the better of your plan and i told she screamed she had nothing more belonging to her to throw onto the floor so she reached for the bedside tables lamp and she brandished it i talked and i told everything i knew are you happy now is that what youve wanted to hear from me ben was rendered speechless he wouldnt have thought anything could have robbed him of words at this point but he had none he wouldnt have thought there were any surprises left from his past but that was clearly not going to be the case bea and ds havers walked from blue star grocery to casvelyn of cornwall the bakery was in full production preparing for the delivery of goods to the areas pubs hotels cafés and restaurants hence the heady fragrance of flaky succulent pastry formed a hypnotic miasma in the air it became more powerful as they drew closer to the shop and bea heard barbara havers murmur fervently bloody blooming hell bea glanced at her the sergeant was gazing longingly in the direction of casvelyn of cornwalls front window where the trays of newly baked pasties lay in seductive eyepopping and utterly dietbusting ranks of cholesterol carbohydrates and calories pleasant isnt it bea said to the sergeant its got poptarts beat ill give you that you must have a pasty while youre in cornwall and if youre going to do so these are the best ill make a note of it havers gave a lingering look to them as she followed bea into the shop madlyn angarrack was serving a line of customers while shar heaved trays of the bakerys products out of the enormous kitchen and into the display cases it seemed they had more than pasties going on this day since shar was currently bringing out loaves of artisan bread thick of crust and topped with rosemary although madlyn was busy bea had no intention of standing at the end of a queue she excused herself to the waiting customers by ostentatiously showing her identification and murmuring pardon police business as she passed them by at the till she said at some considerable volume a word miss angarrack here or in the station but in either case now madlyn didnt attempt to temporize she said to her coworker shar will you take the till although she did add meaningfully i wont be a moment to indicate either her cooperation with the police or her intention of immediately demanding a solicitor she then fetched a jacket and went outside this is ds havers bea said by way of introduction shes come down from new scotland yard to assist in the investigation madlyns eyes flicked to havers and then back to bea in a voice that sounded something between wary and confused she said whys scotland yard think about it bea saw that being able to bandy about the term new scotland yard was going to have one or two unanticipated uses it consisted of three words that asked people to sit up and take notice no matter what they knew or did not know about the metropolitan police madlyn was silent she regarded havers and if she wondered what a representative from new scotland yard was doing dressed like a survivor of hurricane katrina she did not say it havers took out a tattered notebook as madlyn watched her and she jotted down a note it was likely a reminder to buy a pasty before leaving casvelyn for the salthouse inn that evening but that didnt matter to bea it looked official and that was what counted i dont appreciate being lied to bea told madlyn it wastes my time it forces me to go over old ground and it throws me off my stride i didnt save us all some time during this second round of the boxing match all right i dont see why you think need a refresher seven and a half weeks ago santo kerne ended your relationship and according to you that was that it was all you knew full stop no window dressing included but as it turns out you knew a bit more than that didnt you you knew he was seeing someone else and something about that made you sick does any of this sound familiar to you miss angarrack madlyns gaze shifted her brain was clearly engaged in calculations and her expression said that the calculations were of the whos the bloody grass variety the suspects were probably not innumerable and when madlyns glance took in the blue star grocery satisfaction played her face like a keyboard resolution followed will mendick bea hannaford decided was likely burnt toast what would you like to tell us bea asked sergeant havers tapped her pencil against her notebook with great meaning it was a chewedup pencil but that was no surprise as possessing a writing utensil in any other condition would have been wildly out of character in the woman madlyns gaze came back to bea she didnt look resigned she looked avenged which to beas way of thinking was not the way a suspect ought to be looking when it came to murder he broke up with me i told you that and it was the truth i didnt lie and you cant make it out that i did and i wasnt under oath anyway so save the legal wrangling havers spoke up far as i know this isnt an episode of the bill you lied you cheated or you danced the polka we dont much care lets get to the facts ill be happy the dill be happy andtrust meyoull be happy as well madlyn didnt look appreciative of this advice she made a moue of distaste but it seemed to be an expression that served the purpose of jockeying for position because when she next spoke she told a completely different tale from the one shed told earlier she said all right i broke up with him i thought he was cheating so i followed him its not something im proud of but i had to know when i knew i ended it it hurt to do it because i was stupid and i still loved him but i ended it anyway thats the story and its the truth so far bea said i just told you followed him where havers asked her pencil poised followed him when and how on foot by car on bicycle on a pogo stick what about his cheating on you made you sick bea asked just the fact of it or was there something else i think off was your choice of description i never said not to us no you never said thats part of the current problem your problem that is when you say one thing to one person and another thing to the coppers it all comes back to bite you in the end so i suggest you consider yourself bitten and do something to get the teeth out of your bum in a matter of speaking rabies being rabies and all ds havers murmured bea stifled a smile she was starting to like the disheveled woman madlyns jaw tightened it seemed that the full reality of her situation was beginning to dawn upon her she could remain obdurate and accept the threats and the ridicule of the other two women or she could talk she chose the option that seemed likeliest to effect their imminent departure i think people should stick to their own she said and santo didnt stick to his own bea asked whats that mean exactly just what i said what havers asked impatiently he was doing altar boys on the side goats sheep the occasional vegetable marrow what stop it madlyn cried he was doing other women all right older women i confronted him when i knew about it and i knew because i followed him were back to that bea said you followed him where to polcare cottage her eyes were bright he went to polcare cove and i followed him he went inside andi waited and waited because i was stupid and i wanted to think thatbut no no so i went to the door after a bit and i banged upon it andyou can work out the bloody rest cant you and thats all i have to say to you two so leave me alone leave me bloody well alone that said she pushed between them and stalked back towards the bakerys door she rubbed at her cheeks furiously as she walked whats polcare cottage ds havers asked a very nice place to pay a call on bea said lynley didnt approach the cottage at once because he saw immediately that there was probably going to be no point she didnt appear to be at home either that or shed parked her vauxhall in the larger of the two outbuildings that stood on her property in polcare cove he tapped his fingers against the steering wheel of his hired ford and he considered what his next move ought to be reporting what he knew to di hannaford seemed to top the list but he didnt feel settled with that decision instead he wanted to give daidre trahair an opportunity to explain herself despite what barbara havers might have thought once they parted at the salthouse inn lynley had taken her comments to heart he was in a precarious position and he knew it although he hated to admit or even think about it he wanted desperately to escape the black pit in which hed been floundering for weeks upon weeks and he felt inclined to clutch just about any life rope that would get him out of there the long walk along the southwest coastal path hadnt provided that escape as hed hoped it would so he had to admit that perhaps daidre trahairs company in conjunction with the kindness in her eyes had beguiled him into overlooking details that would otherwise have demanded acknowledgement hed come upon another of those details upon havers departure earlier that morning neither pigheaded nor blind when it came down to it hed placed another phone call to the zoo in bristol this time however instead of enquiring about dr trahair he enquired about the primate keepers by the time he wended his way through what seemed like half a dozen employees and departments he was fairly certain what the news would be there was no paul the primate keeper at the zoo indeed the primates were kept by a team of women headed by someone called mimsie vance to whom lynley did not need to speak another lie chalked up against her another black mark that needed confrontation what he reckoned he ought to do was lay his cards on the table for the vet he after all was the person to whom daidre trahair had spoken about paul the primate keeper and his terminally ill father perhaps he thought he had misinterpreted or misunderstood what daidre had said certainly she deserved the chance to clarify didnt anyone in her position deserve as much he got out of the ford and approached daidres cottage he knocked on the blue front door and waited as he expected the vet was not at home but he went to the outbuildings just to make sure the larger one was empty of everything as it would have to be for a car to be accommodated within its narrow confines it was also largely unfinished inside and the presence of cobwebs and a thick coating of dust indicated that no one used it often there were tyre tracks across the floor of the building though lynley squatted and examined these several cars he saw had parked here it was something to note although he wasnt sure what he ought to make of the information the smaller building was a garden shed there were tools within it all of them well used testifying to daidres attempts to create something gardenlike out of her little plot of land no matter its proximity to the sea he was studying these for want of studying something when he heard the sound of a car driving up its tyres crunching on the pebbles along the verge he was blocking her driveway so he left the garden shed to move his vehicle out of her way but he saw it wasnt daidre trahair whod arrived rather it was di hannaford barbara havers was with her lynley felt dispirited at the sight of them he had rather hoped havers would have said nothing to bea hannaford about what shed uncovered in falmouth although hed known how unlikely that was barbara was nothing if not a pit bull when it came to an investigation shed run over her grandmother with an articulated lorry if she was on the trail of something relevant the fact that daidre trahairs past wasnt relevant would not occur to her because anything odd contradictory quirky or suspicious needed to be tracked down and examined from every angle and barbara havers was just the cop to do it their eyes met as she got out of the car and he tried to keep the disappointment from his face she paused to shake a cigarette out of a packet of players she turned her back to the breeze sheltering a plastic lighter from the wind bea hannaford approached him shes not here he shook his head sure about that are you hannaford peered at him intently i didnt look in through the windows he replied but i cant imagine why she wouldnt answer the door if she were at home i can and howre we coming along with our investigation into the good doctor youve spent enough time with her so far i expect youve something to report lynley looked to havers feeling a curious rush of gratitude towards his former partner he also felt the shame of having misjudged her and he saw how much the last months had altered him havers remained largely expressionless but she lifted one eyebrow she was he saw putting the ball squarely into his court and he could do with it what he would for now i dont know why she lied to you about the route she took from bristol he told hannaford ive not got much further than that shes very careful with what she reveals about herself not careful enough the di said she lied about knowing santo kerne as things turn out the kid was her lover she was sharing him with his girlfriend without his girlfriend knowing at first that is shethe girlfriendhad some suspicions on that front so she followed santo and he led her straight here he seems to have been a bloke who liked them any way he could get them older younger and in between although he found that his heart had begun beating quickly as the di was speaking lynley said in an even tone im not quite tracking this not tracking what his girlfriend following him and the conclusion youve drawn that he and dr trahair were lovers sir it was havers monitory tone are you mad hannaford said to lynley the girlfriend confronted him thomas confronted him or confronted them him or them what difference does it make all the difference in the world if she didnt actually see anything really and whatd you expect the girl to do jump through the window with a camera while they were doing the deed so she would have evidence to back herself up if she ever had to talk to the coppers she saw enough to have words with him and he told her what was going on he said that dr trahair was his lover what the hell do you think it just seems to me that if he had a taste for older women hed want to go after one more readily available to him dr trahair according to what shes said comes here only for holidays and occasional weekend breaks according to what she bloody says my good man shes lied about nearly everything so far so i think were god damn safe to assume that if santo kerne came to this cottage could i have a word inspector hannaford havers broke in with the superintendent i mean firmly lynley said barbara im no longer with his lordship havers corrected herself acidly with his earlishnesswith mister lynleywith whatever he wishes to be called at this pointif you dont mind guv hannaford threw up her hands take him she began to walk towards the cottage but she paused and pointed her finger at lynley detective if i find youre obstructing this investigation in any way youll have my job lynley said wryly i know he watched her stalk towards the cottage and knock on the door when no one answered she went round the side of the building clearly intending to do what she thought santos girlfriend ought to have done peer through the windows he turned to havers thank you he said i wasnt rescuing you not for that he indicated hannaford with a nod towards the cottage for not giving her the information from falmouth you could have done you ought to have done both of us know that thank you i like to stay consistent she drew in deeply on her cigarette before she tossed it to the ground she removed a bit of tobacco from her tongue why develop a respect for authority at the eleventh hour if you know what i mean he smiled so you see no she said i dont see at least i dont see what you want me to see shes a liar sir that makes her dirty we came here to take her in for questioning more if we need to more an arrest for what it seems to me that if she was having an affair with this boy the motive to kill him sits squarely on someone else not necessarily and please dont tell me you dont know that she glanced at the cottage hannaford was gone from view now at the seaside windows on the west end of the building havers drew a deep breath she coughed a smokers cough youve got to give up tobacco he told her right tomorrow in the meantime we have a bit of a problem come with me to newquay what why because ive got a lead on this case and thats where it is santo kernes father was involved in a death some thirty years ago i think it needs to be checked into santo kernes father sir youre avoiding avoiding what you know she cocked her head at the cottage havers im not come with me to newquay the plan sounded so sensible to him it even had the flavour of old times the two of them doing some digging around talking about leads tossing round possibilities suddenly he wanted the sergeant with him i cant do that sir havers said why not first of all because im here on loan to di hannaford and second she drove her hand through her sandy hair badly cut as always and straight as the route of a martyrs path to heaven it was filled as usual with static electricity much of it stood on end sir how do i say this to you what this youve been through the worst barbara no youve bloody well got to listen to me you lost your wife to murder you lost your child for gods sake you had to shut off their life support he closed his eyes her hand grabbed his arm and held it firmly i know this is hard i know its horrible no he murmured you dont you cant all right i dont and i cant but what happened to helen ripped your world apart and no onebloody no one sirwalks away from something like that with his head on straight he looked at her then youre saying im mad have we come to that she released his arm im saying youre badly wounded youre not coming at this from a position of strength because you cant and to expect anything else of yourself is just bloody wrong i dont know who this woman is or why shes here or if shes daidre trahair or someone whos claiming to be daidre trahair but the fact remains that when someone lies in the middle of a murder investigation thats what the cops look at so the question is why dont you want to i think we both know the answer to that what would that be youre using your lordship voice i know what that means you want distance and you usually get it well im not giving it to you sir im here standing directly in your face and you have to look at what youre doing and why and if you cant cope with the thought of doing it you have to look at that as well he made no reply he felt as if a wave were washing over him breaking through everything hed built to hold it temporarily at bay he finally said oh god but that was all he could say he lifted his head and looked at the sky where grey clouds were promising to transform the day when havers spoke again her voice was altered from hard to soft the change cut into him as much as her declarations had done why did you come here to her cottage have you found out anything else about her i thought he cleared his throat and looked from the sky to her she was so solid and so unutterably real and he knew that she was on his side but he couldnt make that matter at the moment if he told havers the truth shed move upon it the very fact of yet another lie from daidre trahair would tip the balance i thought she might want to go to newquay with me he said it would give me a chance to talk to her another time to try to sort out he didnt complete the thought it sounded now even to his ears so pathetically desperate which is what i am he thought havers nodded hannaford came round the far side of the cottage she was tramping through the heavy growth of marram grass and cowslip beneath the windows it was more than obvious that she fully intended daidre trahair to know that someone had been there lynley told her his intention newquay the police the story of ben kerne and the death of a boy called jamie parsons hannaford was not impressed fools errand she declared whatre we supposed to make of all that i dont know yet but it seems to me i want you on her superintendent is she somehow involved in what happened during the ice age she would have beenwhat four years old five i admit that there may be issues about her that need exploring do you indeed how good to hear so explore them got that mobile with you yes keep it on then she jerked her fuchsiacoloured head towards her car well be off once you locate our dr trahair escort her to the station am i being clear on that you are lynley said completely clear he watched as hannaford headed to her car he and havers exchanged a look before she followed he decided on newquay anyway that being the beauty of his role in the investigation and damn the consequences if he and hannaford disagreed he wasnt obliged to discount his own inclinations in favour of hers he took the most direct route to newquay once he made his way through the tangled skein of lanes that separated polcare cove from the a he hit a tailback caused by an overturned lorry some five miles out of wadebridge which slowed him considerably and he ended up in cornwalls surfing capital shortly after two in the afternoon he became immediately lost and cursed the obedient parentpleasing young adolescent he had been prior to his fathers death newquay his father had more than once intoned was a vulgar town not the sort of place a true lynley frequented consequently he knew nothing of the town while his younger brothernever burdened with the need to pleaseprobably could have found his way round blindfolded having suffered the frustrating oneway system twice and having nearly driven into the pedestrian precinct once lynley gave up the effort and followed the signs to the information office where a kindly woman asked him if he was looking for fistral love by which he took it that he was being mistaken for an ageing surfer she was happy enough to give him directions to the police station however and they were of a detailed nature so he managed to get there without further difficulty his police identification worked as hed hoped it would although it didnt take him as far as hed planned the special constable on duty in reception handed him over to the head of the mcit squad a detective sergeant called ferrell with a globelike head and eyebrows so thick and black that they looked artificial he was aware of the investigation ongoing in the casvelyn area he wasnt however aware that the met had become involved he said this last bit meaningfully the met presence suggested an investigation into the investigation which in itself suggested gross incompetence on the part of the officer in charge in fairness to hannaford lynley disabused ds ferrell of whatever notion he was brewing about hannafords capabilities hed been in the area on holiday he explained hed been present when the body was found the boy he explained was the son of a man who had himself been at least tangentially involved in a death a number of years ago one that had been investigated by the newquay police and that was why lynley had come to newquay for information relating to that situation thirty years ago had obviously seen ferrell not long out of nappies so the ds knew nothing about anyone called parsons about benesek kerne or about a sea cave mishap in pengelly cove on the other hand it wouldnt be tough for him to suss out who did know what in relation to that death if the superintendent didnt mind a bit of a wait lynley chose to do his waiting in the canteen the better to be a hovering presence that might spur things on he bought himself an apple because he knew he ought to eat despite not having felt hungry since his conversation with havers that morning he bit into it was gratified to find it mealy and tossed it into the rubbish bin he followed up with a cup of coffee and wished vaguely that he was still a smoker there was of course no smoking in the canteen these days but having something to do with his hands would have been gratifying even if what he was doing was only rolling an unsmoked cigarette in his fingers at least he wouldnt feel as if he needed to tear packets of sugar into shreds which was what he did as he waited for ds ferrell to return he opened one and dumped it into his coffee the others he dumped into a neat pile on the table where he then ran a plastic stir stick through the mess creating designs as he tried not to think there was no paul the primate keeper but what did that mean really a private person whod been caught looking at sites for miracles shed want to make an excuse for that it was human nature embarrassment led to prevarication this was not a crime but that of course was not the only instance of prevarication on the vets part and this was the problem he faced what to do about daidre trahairs lies and even more what to think about them ds ferrell did not return for a very long twentysix minutes when he did come into the canteen however he had nothing with him but a slip of paper lynley had been hoping for boxes of files he might look through so he felt deflated but there was moderate cheer in what ferrell had to say di running that case retired long before my time he told lynley must be over eighty by now he lives in zennor across from the church and next to the pub he says hell meet you by the mermaids chair if you want to talk the mermaids chair thats what he said said if youre a proper detective you should be able to find it ferrell shrugged and looked a bit embarrassed funny bloke you ask me fair warning and all that i think he may be a bit gaga chapter nineteen daidre trahair not being at home there was nothing for it but to return to the police station in casvelyn which was what bea and ds havers did bea wedged her card into the cottage doorway in polcare cove before they left with a note scribbled upon it asking the vet to phone or to come to the station but she didnt have much faith in that producing any positive results dr trahair was after all without a telephone or a mobile and considering her dealings with the truth so farwhich could best be described as either fast and loose or nonexistentshe wouldnt be entirely motivated to get in touch with them anyway she was a liar they now knew she was a liar she now knew they knew she was a liar with that combination of rather compelling details as the background of beas request that she get in touch why would daidre trahair want to place herself in a position where a nasty confrontation with the cops was likely hes not looking at things the way he ought bea said to ds havers abruptly as they headed upwards and out of polcare cove her thoughts had made a natural segue daidre trahair and polcare cottage led inevitably to thomas lynley and daidre trahair and polcare cottage bea didnt like the fact that lynley had been there acting the part of informal greeting party to her and ds havers even less did she like the fact that lynley had protested a bit too much when it came to daidre trahairs innocence in all matters pertaining to santo kerne hes got a thing about keeping all the possible options in place as possible options havers said the way she sounded was something bea thought of as cautiously casual and the di narrowed her eyes suspiciously the sergeant she saw was looking steadily forward as if as she spoke a study of the lane were imperative for some reason thats all that was that business at the cottage he looks at situations and sees them the way the cps would see them forget an arrest for the moment he thinks the real question is is this good enough to take into court yes or no if its a no he makes everyone keep digging gives you aggroandahalf sometimes but it all comes right in the end that being the case we might ask ourselves why hes reluctant to dig into dr trahairs story mightnt we i think he reckons the newquay angle is stronger but no matter really hell pick up where he left off on her bea eyed havers again the dss body language didnt meet her tone one tense and the other too easy there was far more here than met the eye and bea reckoned she knew what it was rock and a hard place she said to havers what havers glanced at her you sergeant havers thats where you are isnt it loyalty to him versus loyalty to the job question is how will you make the choice if you have to havers smiled thinly clearly without humour oh i know how to choose when it comes to it guv i didnt get where i am by choosing like a fool all of which is defined by the individual isnt it bea noted the choosinglikeafool bit im not an idiot sergeant dont play me for one i hope i wouldnt be that stupid are you in love with that man who then havers eyes widened she had unappealingly small eyes but when she opened them wide bea saw their attractive colour which was highland sky blue dyou mean the super havers used her thumb to point in the direction lynley had taken ahead of them wed make quite the couple wouldnt we she barked a laugh like i said guv i bloody well hope i wouldnt be that stupid bea eyed her and saw that in this she was telling the truth or at least a partial truth and because it was partial bea knew she would have to watch havers closely and monitor her work she didnt like the ideadamn was there no one on this case upon whom she was going to be able to relybut she couldnt see she had a choice back in casvelyn the incident room displayed a gratifying scene of business in motion sergeant collins was making notations on the china board about activities constable mcnulty was beavering away at santo kernes computer in the absence of a civilian typist one of the tag team officers was working at transcribing a stack of notes into holmes in the meantime the dvla had weighed in with a list of owners of cars like the two seen in the vicinity of santo kernes cliff fall the defender as bea had assumed had been the easier one when it came to comparing listed owners of such vehicles with all the principals in the case jago reeth owned a defender very similar to the car seen in alsperyl approximately one mile to the north of the cliff where santo kerne was doing his abseiling as to the rav the vehicle seen to the south of that same cliff likely belonged to one lewis angarrack madlyns standin granddad and madlyns father bea told havers isnt that a lovely detail as to that it was constable mcnulty speaking half risen from behind santo kernes computer he sounded something between hopeful and excited guv theres vengeance havers agreed he takes the girls virtue and cheats on her they take care of him or at least one of them does or they plan it together that sort of thing plays strong when it comes to murder guv mcnulty again fully upright now and both reeth and angarrack wouldve had access to the boys equipment bea said in the boot of his car they wouldve likely known it was there madlyn telling them perhaps but either one of them just could have seen it at one time or another guv i know you wanted me off the bigwave thing mcnulty broke in but you need to have a look at this in a minute constable bea motioned him down let me follow one thought at a time but this one relates its part of the picture damn it mcnulty he sat he exchanged a black look with sergeant collins bloody cow was its message bea saw this and said sharply thatll do constable all right all right what she approached the computer he tapped frantically at the keyboard a web site appeared featuring an enormous wave with a fleasize surfer upon it bea saw this and prayed for patience although she wanted to drag mcnulty from the computer by his ears its what he said about that poster mcnulty told her that old bloke over liquidearth when you and i were talking to him see first of all that kid on the waveriding mavericks he said remembercouldntve been mark foo thats a picture of jay moriarty constable this is all sounding rather too familiar bea cut in but wait look like i said its a picture of jay moriarty and its famous least among surfers who ride big waves not only was the kid sixteen but he was the youngest surfer ever to ride mavericks at the time and that picture of him was taken during the same swell that killed mark foo and this is critically important because because surfers know at least surfers whove been to mavericks know know what exactly the difference between them between jay moriarty and mark foo mcnultys face was alight as if hed cracked the case on his own and was waiting for bea to say just call me lestrade when she did not he continued perhaps less enthusiastically but certainly no less doggedly dont you see that bloke with the defenderjago reethhe said the poster at liquidearth was mark foo mark foo on the wave that killed him he said but hereright here mcnulty tapped a few keys and a photo identical to the poster appeared this is the same picture guv and its jay moriarty not mark foo at all bea thought about this she didnt like to dismiss anything out of hand but mcnulty appeared to be reaching his own enthusiasm for surfing taking him into an area that bore no relevance to the case in hand she said all right so the poster at liquidearth was misidentified by jago reeth where do we go with that to the fact that he doesnt know what hes talking about mcnulty proclaimed just because hes misidentified a poster he likely didnt mount on the wall in the first place hes blowing smoke mcnulty said mark foos last ride is part of surfing history jay moriartys wipeout is the same someone green to the sport might not know who he was and what happened to him but a longtime surfer someone who says hes hung round the scene for decades someone who says hes been all over the world following waves hes going to know and this bloke reeth didnt and now weve got his car near the spot where santo kerne fell i say hes our man bea thought about this mcnulty was borderline incompetent as a detective it was true he would spend his life at the casvelyn police station never rising above the level of sergeant and even that advancement would come only if he was extremely lucky and collins died with his boots on but there were times when out of the mouths of babes and just as much out of the mouths of the bungling dribbled the truth she didnt want to overlook that possibility just because most of the time she wanted to smack the constable on the side of his head she said to sergeant collins whatve we got on the prints from the kerne boys car are jago reeths among them collins consulted a document which he unearthed from a pile on beas desk the boys prints were everywhere on the car as one would expect he said william mendicks were on the exterior on the drivers side madlyn angarracks were nearly everywhere santos were interior exterior inside the glove compartment on the cds others belonged to dellen and ben kerne and still others remained to be identified from the cd and the boot of the car on the climbing equipment collins shook his head most of those arent any good smears largely weve got a clear one of santos and a partial that hasnt been identified but thats the limit mush she said cold porridge nothing they were back to those cars from the vicinity of the fall she spoke more meditatively than directly to anyone present saying we know the boy met madlyn angarrack for sex at sea dreams so that takes care of jago reeths access to his car prints or not ill give you that constable we know the boy got his surfboard from liquidearth so there youve got lewis angarrack for that matter as he was dating madlyn angarrack he wouldve been at her home one time or another so dad couldve picked up the knowledge of the climbing kit there as well thered be others though wouldnt there havers asked she was looking at the china board where ds collins was working on activities anyone who knew the kidhis mates and even his own family yesprobably knew where he kept his kit and wouldnt they have easier access easier access but perhaps less motive no one stands to gain from his death the sister her boyfriend havers turned from the china board and seemed to read something on beas face because she added deferentially devils advocate guv seems like we dont want to slam any doors theres adventures unlimited bea noted family business havers pointed out always a nice motive except they havent opened yet someone wanting to throw a spanner in then stop them from opening a rival bea shook her head nothings as strong as the sex angle barbara so far havers noted the village of zennor was bleak at the best of times a situation arising from its locationtucked into a protective fold of otherwise windswept land perhaps one half mile from the seaand from its monochromatic appearance which was unadorned granite occasionally graced by the oddity of a desiccated palm tree at the worst of times defined by foul weather gloom or the dead of night it was sinister surrounded by fields from which boulders erupted like curses rained down by an angry god it hadnt changed in one hundred years and likely wouldnt change in another one hundred its past sprang from mining and its present relied on tourism but there was little enough of that even at the height of summer as no beach close by was easy to get to and the only attraction even remotely likely to draw the curious into the village was the church unless one counted the tinners arms of course and what that pub could provide in the way of food and drink the size of the car park of this establishment did suggest that in the summer at least a fair amount of business occurred lynley parked there and went inside to enquire about the mermaids chair when he approached the publican lynley found him working a sudoku puzzle he held up a hand in that universal givemeamoment gesture jotted a number in one of the puzzles boxes frowned and rubbed it out when he finally allowed himself to be questioned he removed the possessive from the chair lynley was seeking mermaids not being much inclined to sit if you think about it the publican said thus lynley learned it was the mermaid chair he was looking for and he would find it in zennor church this structure sat not far from the pub as indeed nothing in zennor sat far from the pub since the village consisted of two streets a lane and a path winding past an odoriferous dairy farm and leading to the cliffs above the sea the church had been built some centuries earlier on a modest hillock overlooking most of this it was unlocked as most churches tended to be in the cornish countryside within silence defined the place as did the scent of musty stones colour came from the kneeling cushions which lined up precisely at the base of the pews and from the stainedglass window of the crucifixion above the altar the mermaid chair was apparently the churchs main feature for it had been established in a special spot in the side chapel and above it hung a sign of explanation which gave an account of how a symbol of aphrodite had been appropriated by the christians of the middle ages to symbolise the two natures of christ as man and as god it was a reach as far as lynley was concerned but he reckoned the christians of the middle ages had had their work cut out for them in this part of the world the chair was simple and looked more like a oneperson pew than an actual chair it was formed from ancient oak and it featured carvings of the eponymous sea creature holding a quince in one hand and a comb in the other no one however was sitting upon it waiting for lynley there was nothing for it but to wait himself so lynley took a place in the pew closest to the chair it was frigid in the building and completely silent at this point in his life lynley didnt like churches he didnt like the intimations of mortality suggested by their graveyards and he desired more than anything not to be reminded of mortality at all beyond that he didnt count himself a believer in anything other than chance and mans regular inhumanity to man to him both churches and the religions they represented made promises they failed to keep it was easy to guarantee eternal bliss after death since no one came back to report on the outcome of life lived in rigorous acceptance not only of the moral strictures devised by man but also of the horrors man wrought upon his fellows he hadnt been waiting long when he heard the clank of the church door opening and slamming shut with a disregard for things prayerful he rose at this and left the pew a tall figure was striding purposefully forward in the dim light he walked with vigor and only when he came into the side chapel did lynley see him clearly in a broad shaft of illumination that fell from one of the churchs windows his face alone betrayed his age for his posture was upright and his body was sturdy his face however was deeply lined his nose misshapen by rhinophyma its appearance akin to a floret of cauliflower dipped in beet juice ferrell had told lynley the name of this potential source of information on the kerne family david wilkie retired detective chief inspector from the devon and cornwall constabulary once the di at the head of the investigation into the untimely death of jamie parsons mr wilkie lynley introduced himself he produced his warrant card and wilkie put on a pair of spectacles to examine it off your patch arent you wilkie didnt sound particularly friendly whyre you nosing up the parsons death was it a murder lynley asked never proved as much death by misadventure at the inquest but you and i both know what that means could be anything with proof of nothing so you got to rely on what people say thats why ive come to talk to you ive spoken with eddie kerne his son ben dont need memory jogging lad id still be working the job if regulations let me may we go somewhere to talk then not much for the house of god are you not at present im afraid what are you then fairweather christian lord doesnt come through for you the way you want so you slam the door on his face that it young people bah youre all alike wilkie dug deeply into his waxed jackets pocket and brought out a handkerchief that he wiped with surprising delicacy beneath his terrible nose he gestured with it to lynley and for a moment lynley thought he was meant to use it as well a form of bizarre communion with the older man but wilkie went on saying look at that white as the day i bought it and i do my own laundry what dyou think of that impressive lynley said i couldnt match you there you young cocks you couldnt match me anywhere wilkie shoved the handkerchief back to its home he said itll be here in gods house or not at all sides ive got to dust the pews you wait here ive got supplies wilkie lynley thought was definitely not gaga he could probably have run circles round ds ferrell in newquay doing so on his hands at that when the old man returned he had a basket from which he took a whisk broom several rags and a tin of polish which he prised open with a house key and roughly swished a rag through i cant sort out whats happened to churchgoing he revealed he handed over the whisk broom and gave lynley detailed instructions as to its use upon and beneath the pews hed be following lynley with the polish rag so dont be leaving any spots unseen to he said there werent enough rags if this lothere he indicated the basketgot filthy did lynley understand lynley did which apparently gave wilkie licence to return to his previous line of thought my day the church was filled to capacity two maybe three times on sunday and then for evensong on wednesday night now between one christmas and the next you wont see twenty regular goers some extras on easter but only if the weather is good i put this down to those beatles i do i remember that one saying he was jesus way back when he shouldve been sorted straightaway you ask me long time ago though wasnt that lynley murmured churchs never been the same after that heathen spoke never all those wankers with hair growing down to their arses singing bout getting their satisfactions met and smashing their instruments to nothing those things cost money but do they care no its all ungodly no wonder everyone stopped coming to pay the lord his due respect lynley was considering a reassessment of the gaga bit he also needed havers with him to sort out the old man when it came to his rock n roll history he himself had been a late bloomer when it came to just about everything and rock n roll was among the many areas of pop culture from the past upon which he could not wax eloquently or otherwise so he didnt try he waited until wilkie had run out of steam on the topic and in the meantime he became as admirably industrious with the whisk broom as he could manage within the confines of the pews and in the churchs inadequate lighting presently as hed hoped wilkie concluded with worlds going to hell in a shopping trolley you ask me an assessment with which lynley did not disagree was the parents wanted to see that lad go down for the death the old man spoke suddenly some minutes later as they worked their way along another row of pews benesek kerne parents got their jaws round him and they wouldnt let go that would be the parents of the dead boy dad especially went off his nut when that lad died was the apple of his eye was jamie and jon parsonsthats the dadhe never made bones about it to me mans sposed to have a favourite child he said and the othersre supposed to emlate him to get into the dads good graces there were other children in the family then four in all three young girlsone just a wee toddlerand that boy which died parents waited for the verdict from the inquest and when the verdict was death by misadventure dad came to me few weeks later this was dead crazed poor bloke told me he knew for certain the kerne boy was responsible i ask him why he waits to tell me thiscause im discounting what hes saying as the ravings of a man going mad with griefand he tells me someone grassed after the fact of the inquest this was hes been doing his own nosing round he tells me hes brought in his own investigator and what they came up with was the grass did you think he was telling you the truth isnt that the question who bloody knows this personthe grassnever spoke to you just to parsons so he claimed which as you and i know is damn meaningless since what he wants moren anything is an arrest of someone he needs someone to blame so does the wife they need anyone to blame because they think that accusing arresting putting on trial and imprisoning is going to make them feel better which of course it isnt but dad doesnt want to hear that what dad would running his own investigation is the only thing keeping him from sliding over the edge so im willing to cooperate with him help him out help him through the bloody mess his lifes become and i ask him to tell me who the grass is i cant ecksackly make an arrest on some tittletattle i didnt even hear firsthand of course lynley noted but he wont tell me so what can i do that i hadnt already done eh wed investigated the death of that lad left right and centre and believe me there was sod all to go on the kerne boy didnt have an alibi aside from walking the long way home to clear my head but you dont hang a man for that do you still i wanted to help so we had the kerne boy into the station one more time four more times eighteen more timeswho the bloody hell remembers we nosed round every aspect of his life and all of his friends lives as well benesek didnt like the parsons boywe uncovered that much straightawaybut as things turned out no one else liked the blighter neither did they have alibis his friends all told the same story home and to bed those stories stayed the same and no one broke ranks couldnt get a drop of blood out of them even by using a leech they were either sworn to each other or they were telling the truth now in my experience when a group of lads gets up to no good one of them breaks eventually if you keep pressing but no one ever did which led you to conclude they were telling the truth nothing else to conclude what did they tell you about their relationship with the dead boy what was their story simple one kerne boy and parsons had words that night a bit of a dustup about something during a party at the parsons home kerne left the scene and his mates did the same and cording to them all no one went back later to coax the parsons boy to his end he mustve gone to the beach on his own they said end of story ive learned he died in a sea cave went down there at night the tide came in he got caught up in it and he couldnt get out toxicology showed he was pissed to oblivion and hed done some doping on top of that common thought at first was that hed met a girl in the cave for a poke and passed out either before or after common thought at first the body was well banged up from the cave seebeing slung round for six hours while the tide came in and went outbut pathologist pointed out marks that couldnt be accounted for and these happened to be round the wrists and ankles tied up then but no other evidence faeces in the ears and wasnt that a bit peculiar eh but that was it and there wasnt a witness to anything start to finish it was a case of he said she said we said they said fingerpointing gossiping and that was that without hard evidence without a witness to a thing without even a scrap of circumstantial evidenceall we could hope for was someone to break and that mightve happened had the parsons kid not been the parsons kid which means bit of a wanker sad to say family had money so he thought he was bettern the rest of em and he liked to show it not the sort of thing going to make him popular with the local youngsters you know what i mean but they went to his party free booze free dope no parents at home a chance to snog with the girl of your choice not a lot to do in pengelly cove at the best of times they wouldntve turned down a chance for some fun what happened to them then the other boys the kerne boys mates theyre still round pengelly cove for all i know and the parsons family never went back to pengelly cove as such they were from exeter and they went back there and there they stayed dad had a propertymanagement business in town called parsons andsomeone else cant recall he himself went back to pengelly regular for a bit weekends and holidays trying to get some full stop put to the case but it never happened he hired more n one investigator to take up the pieces as well spent a fortune on the whole situation but if benesek kerne and those boys were behind what happened to jamie parsons theyd learned from the first investigation into his death if theres no hard evidence and no witness to anything keep the mug plugged and no one can touch you i understand he built something of a monument to him lynley noted who parsons and when lynley nodded well the family had the funds to do it and if it gave them some peace more power to the whole idea wilkie had been working his way along the pews and now he straightened and stretched his back lynley did likewise for a moment they stood there in silence in the centre of the church studying the stainedglass window above the altar wilkie sounded thoughtful when he next spoke as if hed given the matter considerable thought over the years that had passed i didnt like to leave things unsettled he said i had a feeling that the dead boys dad wouldnt be able to get a moments peace if we didnt have someone called to account for what happened but i think he paused and scratched the back of his neck his expression said that his body was present but his mind had gone to another time and place i think those boysif they were involveddidnt mean the parsons lad to die they werent that sort not a one of them if they didnt intend him to die what did they intend he rubbed his face the sound of rough skin on rough whiskers sandpapered the air sort him out give him a bit of a scare like i said before from what i learned the boy was full of himself and he didnt mind making clear what he did and what he had that they didnt and hadnt but to tie him up to leave him drunk the lot of them doped up as well they get him down there to the caveprhaps they tell him theyve more dope to selland they jump him they tie him at the wrists and ankles and give him some discipline a talking to a bit of a roughing up smear some poo on him for good measure then they untie him and leave him there and they think hell make his own way home only they dont account for how drunk he is and how doped up he is and he passes out andthats the end of it see thing is like i said there really wasnt a truly bad one mongst those boys not one of em ever been in a spot of trouble and i told the parents that but it wasnt something they wanted to hear who found the body that was the worst bit wilkie said parsons phoned up the cops morning after that party to say his boyd gone missing cops said the usual he probably got into a local girls knickers and hes sleeping off the aftermath in her bed or under it so phone us again if he doesnt turn up in a day or two because otherwise we cant be bothered meantime one of his own girlsthis is one of the boys sisterstells him about the scuffle jamied had with the kerne lad and parsons thinks theres more here than meets the eye so he sets off to have a look round for the boy and hes the one who finds him wilkie shook his head cant imagine what that would be like but i expect it could drive a man to madness favourite child only son no one ever called to answer for what happened and the one name associated with the hours leading up to the death benesek kerne you can see how he fixed on him dyou know benesek kernes own son has died lynley asked he was killed in a fall from one of the sea cliffs his equipment had been tampered with its a murder wilkie shook his head didnt know he said thats bloody unfortunate how olds the boy eighteen same as the parsons lad now thats a bloody shame daidre was shaken what she wanted was the peace shed had a week earlier when all that her life had asked of her was that she look after herself and meet the obligations of her career she might have been alone as a result of this but that was her preference her small existence was safer that way and safety was paramount that had been the case for years now however the smoothmoving vehicle that had been her life had developed serious engine troubles what to do about them was the issue that intruded upon her serenity so on her return to polcare cove shed left her car at the cottage and walked the remainder of the distance down the lane to the sea there shed made for the path and picked her way along its stony ascent it was windy on the path and windier still on the cliff top daidres hair whipped round her face and flicked its ends into her eyes which smarted when going out onto the cliffs she usually removed her contact lenses and wore her glasses instead but she hadnt taken her glasses when shed set out in the morning which had been a matter of vanity she should have stopped into the cottage to get her glasses but at the end of her days journey it had seemed that only a vigorous climb to the cliff top could keep her fixed in present time some situations one came across required a persons intervention she thought but surely this wasnt one of them she didnt want to do what was being asked of her but she was wise enough to know that wanting was not what this was about the sound of an unmuffled engine came to her not long after she reached the top of the cliff shed been sitting upon an outcrop of limestone watching the kittiwakes and following the majestic arcs the birds made in the air as they sought shelter in niches in the cliff but now she stood and walked back to the path a motorcycle she saw was coming down the lane it reached her cottage and veered into the pebbly driveway where it stopped the rider removed his helmet and approached the front door daidre thought of couriers and messengers when she saw him someone carrying a package for her perhaps a message from bristol but she was expecting nothing and from what she could tell the rider had nothing with him he went round her cottage to seek another door or to look into a window or worse she thought she made for the path and began to descend there was no point to shouting because she couldnt have been heard from this distance indeed there was also little point in hurrying the cottage was some way from the sea and she was some way above the lane likely by the time she got back the rider would have left but the thought that someone might be breaking into her cottage spurred her downward she kept her glances going between her footwork and her cottage as she went and the fact that the motorcycle remained in place in her driveway kept her speed up and her curiosity piqued she arrived breathless and dashed in through the gate instead of a housebreaker half in and half out of a window though she found a girl clad in leathers lounging on her front step she was sitting with her back against the bright blue door and her legs stretched out in front of her she had a hideous silver ring through her septum and a turquoisecoloured choker tattooed brightly round her neck daidre recognised her cilla cormack the bane of her own mothers life her gran lived next door to daidres family in falmouth what on earth daidre thought was the girl doing here cilla looked up as daidre approached the dull sun glinted off her septum ring giving it the unappealing look of those rings once used on cows to urge their cooperation when they were attached to a lead she said hey and gave daidre a nod she rose and stamped her feet as if with the need to get the circulation going this is a surprise daidre said how are you cilla hows your mum cow cilla said by which daidre assumed she meant her mother cillas disputes with that woman being something of a neighbourhood legend cn i use your toilet or summick of course daidre unlocked the front door she ushered the girl inside cilla clomped across the entry and into the sitting room through there daidre said she waited to see what would happen next because surely cilla hadnt come all the way from falmouth just to use the loo some minutes laterduring which time water ran enthusiastically and daidre began to wonder if the girl had decided to have a bathcilla returned her hair was wet and slicked back and she smelled as if shed decided to help herself to daidres scent as well better that she said felt like bloody hell i did roadsre bad this time of year ah daidre said would you likesomething tea coffee fag i dont smoke im sorry figgers that cilla looked round and nodded thiss nice innit but you dont live here reglar right no cilla is there something daidre felt stymied by her upbringing one didnt come out and ask a visitor what on earth she was doing visiting on the other hand it was impossible that the girl had just been passing by daidre smiled and tried to look encouraging cilla wasnt the brightest bulb in the chandelier but she did manage to get the point she said my gran asked me would i come said you dint have a mobile daidre felt alarmed has something happened whats going on is someone ill gran says scotland yard came by she says youd best know straightaway cos they were aksing about you she says they went to your house first but when no one was home they started banging doors up an down the street she phoned up bristol to tell you you want there so she reckoned you might be here and she aksed would i come here to let you know whynt you get yourself a mobile eh or even a phone here thatd make sense you know i mean just like in a emergency cos its one hell of a way to get here from falmouth and petroldyou know how much petrol costs these days the girl sounded aggrieved daidre went to the sideboard in the dining room and fetched twenty pounds she handed it over she said thank you for coming it cant have been easy all this way cilla relented she said well gran aksed and shes a good old girl innit she always lets me stop there when mum throws me out whichs about once a week eh so when she aksed me and said it was important she shrugged anyways here i am she said you should know she also said here cilla frowned as if trying to remember the rest of the message daidre wondered that the girls grandmother had not written it down but then it had probably occurred to the elderly woman that cilla was likely to lose a note while a brief message of one or two sentences was not beyond her ability to pass along oh yeah she also said not to worry because she dint tell them nuffink cilla touched her septum ring as if to make sure it was still in place so whys scotland yard nosing round you she asked grinning she added what you done you got bodies buried in the garden or summick daidre smiled faintly six or seven she said thought as much cilla cocked her head youve gone dead white you best sit down put your head she seemed to lose the thread of where ones head was supposed to go you want a glass of water eh no no im fine havent eaten much todayare you sure you dont want something gotta get back she said ive a date tonight mboyfriends taking me dancing is he yeah were taking lessons bit daft that but its summick to do innit were at that one where the girl gets thrown around a bit and you got to keep your back real stiff otherwise stick your nose in the air that sorta thing i got to wear high heels for it which i dont like much but the teacher says were getting quite good she wants us to be in a competition she says brucethats m boyfriendhes dead chuffed bout it and he says we got to practise every day so thats why were going dancing tonight mostly we practise in his mums sitting room but he says were ready to go out in public how lovely daidre said she waited for more more she hoped would consist of cillas leaving the premises so that daidre could come to terms with the message the girl had brought scotland yard in falmouth asking questions she felt anxiety climbing up her arms anyway got to dash cilla said as if reading daidres mind lookit you best think about having a phone put in eh you could keep it in a cupboard or summick plug it in when you want it that sort of thing yes yes i will daidre told her thanks so much cilla for coming all this way the girl left her then and daidre stood on the front step watching her expertly kickstart the motorcycleno electronic ignition for this riderand turn it in the driveway in a few more moments and with a wave the girl was gone she zoomed up the narrow lane curved out of sight and left daidre to deal with the aftermath of her visit scotland yard she thought questions being asked there could be only one reasononly one personbehind this chapter twenty kerras night had been sleepless and much of her following day had been useless shed attempted to carry on as well as possible keeping to a schedule of interviews that shed set up in the preceding weeks the search for potential instructors shed thought she could at least divert herself with the hopeful if unlikely pretence that adventures unlimited was actually going to open in the near future the plan hadnt worked this is it that simple declaration that coy little arrow from this is it to the great sea cave depicted on the postcard the implication that conversations of a nature having nothing to do with business had passed between the writer of those words and the reader of those words what lay behind beneath and beyond those conversationsthese disquieting and turbulent thoughts had been the stuff of kerras day and the sleepless night that had preceded it the postcard now had for some hours been burning a small rectangular patch against her skin from within the pocket where shed stowed it each time shed moved shed been aware of it taunting her she was going to have to do something about it eventually that dull burning told her as much kerra hadnt been able to avoid alan as she would have liked to do that day the marketing office was not far from her own cubbyhole and while shed routinely taken prospective instructors to the firstfloor lounge for their interviews rather than inside her cubbyhole shed greeted them in the vicinity of the marketing office alan had popped out more than once to observe her and she wasnt long in working out what his silent observation meant it was more than disapproval of her choice of candidates all of them female hed made himself clear on that topic earlier and alan wasnt the sort to keep pressing a point when someone was in his opinion being bloodyminded rather his mute scrutiny of her told her that busy lizzie had mentioned kerras visit to pink cottage shed likely told alan about kerras putative need to find a personal possession in alans room and hed be wondering why kerra herself hadnt mentioned it she had her answer ready had he cared to ask her but he hadnt asked she didnt know where her father was shed seen him go out in the direction of st mevan beach some hours ago and as far as she knew hed not returned shed reckoned at first hed gone to watch the surfers for the swells were good and the wind was offshore and she herself had seen a ragtag line of them working their way across the promontory had things been wildly different her brother santo might have been among them lining up out there in the water to get into position her father might have been there as well her father and her brother together as a matter of fact but things were not different and they never would be that appeared to be the familys curse and at the root of that curse dellen it was as if all of them were wandering in a maze trying to get to its mysterious centre while all the time at its mysterious centre dellen waited blackwidowlike the only way to elude her was to purge her but it was far too late for that want something alan spoke kerra was in her office where looking through a meagre stack of applicants was proving to be a dispiriting activity shed been working on sea kayaking and shed spoken to five possible instructors that day only two had the background she was looking for and of them only one had a physique suggestive of experience in the sea the other looked like someone who kayaked on the river avon where the biggest challenge she faced would be taking care not to brain a cygnet with her paddle kerra closed the last of the manila folders with their paltry bits of information she wondered how best to answer alans question she was thinking it overworking on whether irony sarcasm or a display of wit was in her best interestswhen he spoke again kerra want something cup of tea coffee something to eat im going out for a bit and i can stop no thanks she didnt want to be beholden to him even in so small a matter as this instead she examined him and he examined her it was one of those moments when two individuals who have been lovers scrutinise each other like cultural anthropologists studying a tract of land for the remains of an ancient civilization long believed to have dwelt there there should be marks signs indications of a passage how does it go he asked she knew that he was well aware of how it went but she played the game ive come up with several strong possibilities im doing additional interviews tomorrow but the real question is whether were actually going to open isnt it we seem rather without direction especially today have you seen my father not for hours what about cadan did he show up to work on the radiators not sure he may have done but i havent seen him its been rather quiet all the way round he didnt mention dellen on this day she was as she had always been when things went bad the great unmentionable just the thought of herof dellen the malodorous dead elephant in the roomreduced everyone to mute trepidation whatve you been kerra inclined her head towards his office he seemed to take this as welcome for he entered hers although this wasnt what shed intended she wanted him at a distance things were shed decided finished between them now he said ive been trying to get everyone in place for the video despite whats happened i do still think he pulled out a chair from its position between the office wall and the open door when he sat they were virtually knee to knee kerra didnt like this she didnt want any kind of proximity to him this is important alan said i want your dad to see that i know the timing couldnt be worse but not my mother kerra inquired alan blinked he looked momentarily puzzled perhaps by her tone he said your mum as well but shes already onboard so your dad oh is she kerra said but then i suppose she would be his embracing of her mother as a topic was surprising dellens opinion on anything had hardly ever counted since she was incapable of consistency so to hear someone counting it now came as something of a shock yet on the other hand it did make sense alan worked with dellen in marketing on the rare occasions when dellen actually worked at all so they would have talked the video project through before he presented it to kerras father alan would have wanted dellen on his side it meant one vote in the bag and a vote from someone who might have considerable influence with ben kerne kerra wondered if alan had talked to santo as well she wondered what santo had made or would have made of alans ideas for adventures unlimited id like to talk to him again but i havent actually seen alan hesitated then he finally appeared to give in to his curiosity he asked whats going on do you know about what exactly kerra kept her voice polite i heard themearlier in the dayid gone upstairs to look for his face was colouring ah she thought were they there at last to look for now she sounded arch she liked that and wouldnt have thought it was possible to manage arch when what she felt was anything but i heard your mum and dad or rather your mum she was he lowered his head he appeared to be examining his shoes these were twotone saddle shoes and kerra regarded them as he did the same what other man would wear saddle shoes she wondered and what on earth did it mean that he somehow managed to carry off wearing them without looking like bertie wooster i know things are bad he said im just not sure what im meant to be doing at first i thought soldiering on was the ticket but now its begun to seem inhuman your mums clearly in pieces your dads how would you know about that the question came out precipitately kerra regretted it the moment she spoke about what alan looked confused hed been speaking meditatively and her question appeared to have disrupted his chain of thought about the pieces my mother is in as i said i heard her id gone up because no one was about and were at the point when we have to decide whether were still taking bookings or throwing the whole thing into the rubbish concerned about that are you shouldnt we all be he leaned back in his chair he looked at her squarely he folded his hands over his stomach and he spoke again why dont you tell me kerra what i think you know and i think thats a trap you were at pink cottage you went through my room youve got a good landlady what else would you expect so i suppose youre asking me what i was looking for you told her you left something i assume you left something but i cant work out why you didnt ask me to fetch it here for you i didnt want you to bother kerra huge breath drawn in huge breath expelled he slapped his hands onto his knees what in gods name is going on excuse me she managed arch again my brothers been murdered does something else need to be going on for things not to be quite as youd like them you know what i mean theres what happened to santo and god knows thats a nightmare and a gutripping tragedy nice of you to add that last bit but theres also whats happened between you and me and thatwhether you want to admit it or notbegan the same day as what happened to santo murder happened to santo kerra said why cant you say that alan why cant you say murder for the obvious reason i dont want you to feel worse than you already feel i dont want anyone to feel worse than they already feel anyone everyone you your dad your mum kerra she got to her feet the postcard was singeing her skin it begged to be withdrawn from her pocket and flung at him this is it demanded an explanation but the explanation already existed only the confrontation remained kerra knew who needed to be on the other side of that confrontation and it wasnt alan she pardoned herself and she left her office she used the stairs rather than the lift she entered her parents room without knocking the postcard in her hand at some point in the day the curtains had been opened so dust motes swam in an oblong of weak spring sunlight but no one had thought to open the window to refresh the rank air it smelled of perspiration and sex kerra hated the smell for what it stated about her parents and the stranglehold one had upon the other she walked across the room and shoved the window open as wide as she could get it to go cold air swept in when she turned she saw that her parents bed was lumpy and the sheets were stained a pile of her fathers clothes lay on the floor as if his body had dissolved and left this trace of him behind dellen herself was not immediately evident until kerra walked round the bed and found her lying on the floor atop a considerable pile of her own clothing red this was and it seemed to be every article of crimson that she possessed for only an instant as she gazed down upon her kerra felt renewed a bulbs single flower finally being released from both the soil and the stalk but then her mothers lips worked and her tongue appeared between them french kissing the air her hand opened and closed her hips moved then rested her eyelids twitched she sighed seeing this kerra wondered for the first time what it was actually like to be this woman but she didnt want to entertain that thought so she used her foot to flip her mothers right leg roughly off her left leg wake up she told her its time to talk she gazed at the postcards picture to gain the strength she needed this is it her mothers red writing said yes kerra thought this was definitely it wake up she said again more loudly get up from the floor dellen opened her eyes for a moment she looked confused until she saw kerra and then she pulled to her the garments nearest her right hand she clutched these to her breasts and in doing so she uncovered a pair of shears and a carving knife kerra looked from these to her mother to the clothes she saw that every item on the floor had been rendered useless through slashing slicing hacking and cutting i should have used them on myself dellen said dully but i couldnt still wouldnt you have been happy had i done it you and your father happy oh god i want to die why wont anyone help me die she began to weep tearlessly and as she did so she drew more and more of the clothing to her until shed formed an enormous pillow of ruined clothes kerra knew what she was meant to feel guilt she also knew what she was meant to do forgive forgive and forgive until you were the incarnation of forgiveness understand until there was nothing left of you except that effort to understand help me dellen extended her hand then she dropped it to the floor the gesture was useless virtually noiseless kerra shoved the damning postcard back into her pocket she grabbed her mothers arm and hauled her upwards she said get up you need to bathe i cant dellen said im sinking ill be gone soon enough and long before i can and then a wily shift perhaps reading from kerras face a brittleness of which she needed to be wary she said he threw out my pills he had me this morning kerra hehe as much as raped me and then heand then hethen he threw out my pills kerra shut her eyes tight she didnt want to think about her parents marriage she merely wanted to force the truth from her mother but she needed to direct the course of that truth up she said come on come on youve got to get up why will no one listen to me i cant go on like this inside my mind is a pit so deepwhy wont anyone help me you your father i want to die her mother was like a sack of sand and kerra heaved her onto the bed there dellen lay ive lost my child her voice was broken why does no one begin to understand everyone understands kerra felt reduced inside as if something were simultaneously squeezing her down and burning her up soon there would be nothing of her left only speaking would save her everyone knows youve lost a child because everyone else has lost santo too but his motheronly his mother kerra please something snapped within kerra she reached for dellen and pulled her upright forcing her to sit on the edge of the bed stop the drama she said drama as so often had happened in the past dellens mood shifted like an unanticipated seismic event you can call this drama she demanded is that how you react to your own brothers murder whats the matter with you have you no feelings my god kerra whose daughter are you yes kerra said i expect youve asked yourself that question a number of times havent you counting back the weeks and the months and wonderingwho does she look like who does she belong to who can i say fathered her andthis would be critical wouldnt it dellenwill he believe me oh prhaps if i look pathetic enough or pleased enough or happy enough or whatever it is that you look when you know youve got to explain some mess youve made dellens eyes had grown dark shed shrunk away from kerra she said how can you possibly say and her hands rose to cover her face in a gesture that kerra assumed was meant to be read as horror it was time kerra pulled the postcard from her pocket she said oh stop it and she knocked her mothers hands to one side and held the postcard to dellens face she put a hand on the back of her neck so dellen could not remove herself from their conversation she said have a look at what i found this is it mum this is it what exactly what is it what are you talking about kerra i dont you dont what you dont know what ive got in my hand you dont recognise the picture on this card you dont recognise your own bloody writing or is it this you dont know where this card even came from and if you do knowbecause we both damn well know that you know all rightthen you just cant imagine how it managed to get there which is it mum answer me which its nothing its just a postcard for heavens sake youre behaving like like someone whose mother fucked the man she thought she was going to marry kerra cried in this cave where you fucked the rest of them how can you possibly because i know you because ive watched you because ive seen the story play out over and over dellen in need and whos there to help her but a willing male of whatever age because it never bloody mattered to you did it just that you had him whoever he was and whoever he belonged tobecause what you wanted and when you wanted it was more important than kerra felt her hands begin shaking she pressed the card to her mothers face i should make yougod god i should make you no dellen squirmed beneath her youre mad even santo cant stop you santo dead cant stop you i thought this will get through to her but it didnt did it santo deadmy god santo murdereddidnt make a ripple not the slightest diversion in what you planned no dellen began to fight her clawing at her hands and her fingers now she kicked and rolled to get away but kerra was too strong so she began to scream you did this you you dellen grabbed at her daughters hair and eyes she pulled kerra down they rolled on the bed seeking purchase among the mass of linens and covers their voices shrieked their arms flailed their legs kicked their hands grasped they found they lost they grasped again punching and pulling as dellen shrieked you you you did it the bedroom door crashed open footsteps hurried across the room kerra felt herself lifted and heard alans voice in her ear easy he said easy easy jesus kerra whatre you doing make her tell you dellen cried she had fallen to her side on the bed make her tell you everything make her tell you what shes done to santo make her tell you about him santo one arm holding kerra alan began moving towards the door let me go kerra cried make her tell the truth you come with me alan told her instead its time that you and i had a real talk both of the cars similar to those that had been reported in the general area on the day of santo kernes death were standing at one side of liquidearth when bea and ds havers pulled up at the erstwhile royal air station a quick glance through the window showed that lew angarracks rav held a surfing kit along with a short board jago reeths defender held nothing as far as they could see it was pitted with rust on the outsidethe salt air was murder on any car in this part of the countrybut otherwise it was as clean as was possible which wasnt very clean at all considering the weather and the likelihood that he had to keep it parked outside it did have floor mats and on both drivers side and passengers side there was plenty of dried mud for their consideration but mud was a hazard of life on the coast from late autumn through the end of spring so its presence in the defender didnt count for as much as bea would have liked daidre trahair being godonlyknewwhere at this point taking another jaunt over to the surfboard makers establishment had seemed the logical next move every lead needed to be followed up and both jago reeth and lewis angarrack were eventually going to have to explain what they were doing in the general vicinity of santo kernes fall no matter that bea would have vastly preferred to have daidre trahair to the station for the thorough grilling she so richly deserved bea had taken a call from thomas lynley on their way out to the old air station hed gone from newquay to zennor and he was on his way to pengelly cove again he might have something for her he said but that something required additional nosing round the area from which the kerne family had sprung he sounded unduly excited and what about dr trahair she had asked him sharply he hadnt yet seen her he said but then he hadnt expected to he hadnt actually been keeping an eye open for her as a matter of fact and if he was being honest his mind had been on other things this new situation with the kernes bea hadnt wanted to hear about the kernes this new situation or otherwise she didnt trust thomas lynley and this fact cheesed her off because she wanted to trust him she needed to trust everyone involved in looking into the death of santo kerne and the fact that she couldnt made her cut him off abruptly should you see our fair and gamboling dr trahair along the way you bring her to me she said are we clear on that they were clear on that lynley assured her and if youre intent on following up on the kernes then do keep in mind shes part of santo kernes story as well if the angarrack girl was to be believed he noted because a woman scorned oh yes how true shed declared impatiently but bea knew there was some truth in what he was saying madlyn angarrack wasnt looking any more unsoiled than the rest of them inside liquidearth bea introduced ds havers to jago reeth who was sanding the rough edge of fiberglass and resin on one rail of a swallowtail board which hed stretched between two sawhorses these were thickly padded to protect the boards finish and jago was taking care to be gentle with his sanding an enormous cupboard emanating warmth stood open at one side of the room with additional boards loaded within it apparently awaiting his attention liquidearth seemed to be having a profitable preseason and business was continuing to boom if the noise from the shaping room was anything to go by as before jago wore a disposable white boiler suit it masked a lot of the dust that covered his body but none of the dust that covered his hair and his face any exposed part of him was white even his fingers and his cuticles formed ten cheshire smiles at the base of his nails jago reeth asked bea if she wanted lew or himself this time round she said she wanted them both but her conversation with mr angarrack could wait a bit so as to allow her to talk to jago alone the old bloke didnt appear disconcerted by the idea of the police wanting to talk to him alone or otherwise he did say he thought hed told them all he knew about the santoandmadlyn affair but bea informed him pleasantly that she generally liked to make that determination herself he gave her a look but he made no comment other than to tell her he would go on with his sanding if that wasnt a problem it wasnt bea assured him as she spoke the noise from the shaping room died bea thought lew angarrack would join them then but he remained within she asked jago reeth what he could tell her about his defender being in the vicinity of santo kernes fall on the day of his death as she spoke ds havers did her bit with notebook and pencil jago stopped sanding glanced at havers then cocked his head as if he was evaluating beas question vicinity he asked of polcare cove not hardly i dont reckon your car was seen in alsperyl bea told him you count that as near alsperyl might be near like the crow flies but its miles and miles by car a walk along the cliffs would take you from alsperyl to polcare cove easily enough mr reeth even at your age seen on the cliff top was i im not saying you were but the fact of your defender being even remotely in the area where santo kerne met his deathyou can understand my curiosity i hope hedras hut he said whos what sergeant havers asked the question her expression said she thought the term was some sort of expletive peculiar to cornwall old wooden shack built into the cliffs jago explained to her thats where i was may i ask what you were doing there bea said jago seemed to consider the propriety either of her questions or of giving an answer private matter he finally said he applied himself to his sanding again ill have to be the one making that decision bea told him the door of the shaping room opened and lew angarrack came out as before he was attired as jago was and he had a breathing mask and eyewear slung round his neck a circular section of skin round his eyes mouth and nose looked oddly pink against the white of the rest of him he and jago reeth exchanged an unreadable look ah you were in the vicinity of polcare cove as well mr angarrack bea noted in a welcoming manner she clocked the surprise on jago reeths face when was this angarrack removed the breathing mask and goggles from round his neck and set them on top of the surfboard that jago was sanding on the day of santo kernes fall or perhaps better stated on the day of santo kernes murder what were you doing there i wasnt there he said not in polcare cove i said in the vicinity then youre speaking of bucks haven which i suppose is arguably in the vicinity i was surfing a quick look went from jago to lew angarrack the latter man didnt seem to notice it bea said surfing and if i go back to have a look at those charts you lot usewhat do you call them isobar and yes if you go back and have a look youll see the swells were rubbish the wind was wrong and there was no point at all to going out so why did you ds havers asked i wanted to think the seas always been the best place for me to do that if i caught a few waves as well thatd be a bonus but catching waves wasnt why i was there you were thinking about what marriage he said yours im divorced years ago the woman ive been seeing he shifted his weight he looked like a man whod had any number of sleepless nights and bea wondered how many she could realistically ascribe to a gentlemans quandary about his marital state weve been together a few years she wants to get married i prefer things as they are or with a few changes what sort of changes what the hell difference does that make to you its a case of been there done that for both of us but she wont see it that way jago reeth made a noise cousin to a snort it seemed to indicate that he and lew angarrack were at one on this topic he went on with his sanding and lew gave a look to what he was doing he nodded as he ran his fingers along the part of the rail that jago had already seen to so you werewhat bea asked the surfer bobbing in the waves trying to decide whether to marry her or not no id already decided that and your decision was he stepped away from the sawhorses and the board that jago was working on i dont see what that question has to do with anything so let me get us to the point if santo kerne fell from the cliff he was either pushed or his climbing gear failed since my car was some distance away from polcare cove and since i was on the water i couldnt have pushed him which leaves his equipment failing in some way so i expect what you really want to know is who had access to his equipment have i got us there a bit quicker by using the direct route inspector hannaford i find therere usually half a dozen routes to the truth bea told him but you can travel this one if youve a mind to i had no idea where he kept his equipment angarrack told her i still dont know id assume he kept his climbing kit at home it was in his car well of course it would have been on that day wouldnt it he demanded hed gone for a bloody climb woman lewjust doing her job jago spoke soothingly before he said to bea i had access if it comes down to it knowledge as well the boy and his father had one runin too many over what bea interrupted jago reeth and angarrack exchanged a look bea saw this and repeated her question over anything was jagos reply they didnt see eye to eye on much and santo removed his kit from the premises bit of an illshowyou gesture if you know what i mean ill show you what exactly mr reeth ill show youwhatever boys think they got to show their dads this answer hardly satisfied bea said if you know something pertinenteither of youill have it please another look between them this one longer jago said to lew mateyou know its not my place he made madlyn pregnant lew said abruptly and he had no intention of doing anything at all about it next to her bea felt ds havers stir itching to get involved but restraining herself for her part bea had to wonder at the informations being delivered so perfunctorily by the man whod have had the most reason to do something about it cording to santo his dad wanted him to do right by madlyn jago said then he added sorry lew i did still talk to the boy seemed the best what with the baby coming your daughter didnt terminate the pregnancy then bea asked angarrack she intended to keep itthe child intended ds havers asked past tense meaning miscarriage when did all this happen bea asked miscarriage at the beginning of april according to her shed already ended their relationship by then so shed done that in the midst of her pregnancy that would be correct bea glanced at havers the sergeants lips were rounded to an o which was likely short for oh boy they were on a most interesting track how did you feel about this mr angarrack and you as well mr reeth since youd taken such care to see the boy was supplied with condoms i didnt feel good angarrack said but if doing right by madlyn was going to mean theyd marry i was happier they were apart believe me i didnt want her marrying him they were only eighteen and besides he gestured away the rest of what he was going to say besides havers prompted him hed shown his colours he was a little sod i didnt want the girl involved with him any longer dyou mean he wanted her to abort i mean he didnt care one way or another what she did according to madlyn which apparently was his style only she didnt know that at first well none of us did must have made you frantic when you found out so did i kill him in my frantic state lew asked hardly i had no reason to kill him ill use of your daughter being insufficient reason bea asked it was over and done with she wasshe is recovering and he added with a look at jago wouldnt you agree slow process was jagos reply made easier if santo was dead i daresay bea pointed out ive told you i didnt know where he kept his equipment and had i known i knew jago reeth cut in santos dad kept trying to sort him see after madlyn came up pregnant like i said before they rowed part of the row was that actlikeamanforonce challenge dads give their sons sometimes and for santo its easier to apply acting like a man to something other than actliketheproperfatherof ababythatscoming so he takes his climbing kit to do just that nstead of you want me to stand by madlyn ill stand by madlyn it was easier to have it youd rather i climb cliffs than surf then ill climb ill show you a real cliff climber come down to it then off he went to climb now then whenever he kept his kit in the boot of his car i knew it was there may i assume that madlyn knew as well she was with me jago said the two of us had gone to asperyl we made the walk out to hedras hut there was something inside she wanted to be rid of it was the last thing that tied her to santo kerne aside from santo himself bea thought she said and what would this be jago set his sanding block gently on the deck of the surfboard he said look she fell dead hard for santo he waspardon lew no dad likes to hear thishe was her first in bed when things ended with them she was in a bad way about it and then came the matter of losing that baby she was having trouble getting past it all and who wouldnt so i told her to get rid of everything santo start to finish shed done that but there was this one last bit so thats what we were doing there theyd carved their initials in the hut stupid kid stuff with a heart and everything if you cn believe it we went there to destroy it not the hut mind you its been therechrist what a hundred years we didnt want to hurt the hut just the initials we left the heart as it was why not carry all this to the logical end bea asked him which would be what the obvious mr reeth havers put in why not give santo kerne the chop as well lew angarrack said hotly you hang on just a god damn minute bea cut him off is she a jealous girl has she a history of striking back when shes hurt either of you can answer by the way if youre trying to say im trying to get to the truth mr angarrack did madlyn tell youor you mr reeththat santo was seeing someone else in the midst of all this and i do use seeing as a euphemism by the way he was shagging one of the older women hereabouts at the same time as he was shagging and impregnating your daughter shes told us as much at least the shagging part well she had to as weve caught her in more than one lie so far and im afraid shed lied herself into a brick wall as things turn out shed followed the boy and there they were in this womans home the virile energetic and young white ram enthusiastically tupping the ageing ewe did you know about this did you mr reeth lew angarrack said no no his drove his hand through his greying hair dislodging a sand fall of polystyrene dust ive been caught up in my own affairsi knew she and the boy were done for and i thought that with timemadlyns always been edgy ive long thought it was due to her mum and the fact she left us and the fact that madlyn doesnt cope well with being left well that seemed natural enough to me and she always got past it in the end if something died between herself and someone else i believed shed get past this as well even past the loss of the baby so when she was asas disturbed as she was i did what i could or what i thought i could to help her through it which was i sacked the boy and i encouraged her to get back to her surfing get back in shape get back on the circuit i told her no one goes through life without getting their heart broken into bits but people recover like you had havers asked if it comes to it yes and what did you know of this other woman bea asked him nothing madlyn never saidi knew nothing you mr reeth jago picked up his block and examined it he nodded slowly she told me she wanted me to have a word with the boy i spose it was to try to set him straight but i told her it wouldnt do much good that age a boy int thinking with his brain and didnt she see that i tell her theres lots of fish in the sea like they say i say lets be rid of this sorry piece of business girl and get on with our lives its the only way he didnt seem to realise what he had just said bea eyed him carefully she could tell that havers was doing the same bea said irregular is the term thats been used for what santo was up to on the side while he was seeing madlyn and santo himself was the one to use it he was advised to be honest about it about the irregular bit he may have been but he apparently wasnt with madlyn was he honest with you mr reeth you appear to have something of a touch with young people i only knew what our madlyn knew jago reeth said irregular you say that was the word was used irregular yes irregular enough for him to ask advice about it having it on with an older woman mightve been irregular enough lew noted but enough to seek advice about it bea asked more to herself than to them spose jago said it depends on who the woman was eh it always comes down to that in the end chapter twentyone despite jagos warning cadan couldnt help himself it was complete insanity and he damn well knew it but he engaged in it anyway the soft silken feel of her thighs tightening round him the sound of her moaning and then the heightened growing rapturous yes of her response and this set against a backdrop of waves crashing against the nearby shore the mixed scents of the sea of her female smells and of wood rot from the tiny beach hut the eternal female salt of her where he licked as she shrieked and yes yes as her fingers dug into his hair the dim light from the cracks round the door casting a nearly ethereal glow on skin that was slick but lithe and firm and willing god so eager and ever so willing it could have been like that cadan thought and despite the growing lateness of the day he wasnt all that far from establishing pooh in the sitting room hauling his bicycle out of the garage and pedaling frantically to adventures unlimited to take dellen kerne up on her offer to meet at the beach huts hed seen just enough films in the cinema to know that the older womanyounger man bit was never perfectlet alone permanentwhich was a plus as far as he was concerned the very idea of having it on with dellen kerne was all so right in cadans mind that it had moved quite beyond rightness into another realm altogether into the sublime the mystical the metaphysical the only metaphorical monkey in the barrel was alas dellen herself the woman was a nutter no question about it despite his longing to press his lips to various parts of her body cadan knew barm when he saw barm providing barm was actually a word which he seriously doubted but if it wasnt a word it needed to be one and she was barm in spades she was the walking talking breathing eating sleeping personification of barm and the one thing cadan angarrack was besides randy enough to take on a herd of sheep was clever enough to give barm a wide berth he hadnt gone to work that day but he hadnt been able to face any questions from his father about why he was hanging about the house so to keep lew from venturing into that conversational territory cadan had risen as usual had dressed as usualgoing so far as to don his paintspattered jeans which he considered a very nice touch indeedand had shown up as usual at the breakfast table where madlyn was eating a virtuous half grapefruit and lew was sliding a decent fryup from the pan onto his plate seeing cadan lew had gestured towards the food in a surprisingly affable fashion cadan took this as a peace offering and as acknowledgement of his efforts at selfrehabilitation through gainful employment so he accepted the food with a fantastic dad ta and tucked right in asking his sister how she was coping madlyn cast him a baleful glance that recommended a change in conversational direction so cadan gave his father a moments study and realised lew had about him the ease of movement that had in the past signified recent sexual release he decided that his father was unlikely to be wanking in the midst of his morning shower and he said to him get back with ione dad in a mantoman tone whose implication could not be misconstrued and lew definitely did not misconstrue cadan could tell that much for his fathers swarthy skin darkened ever so slightly before he went back to the cooker to prepare a second fryup this he did in silence so much for the warm familial colloquy but no worries since there was to be no additional sound among them beyond that which was made by mastication and swallowing the entire issue of cadans employment did not come up on the other hand cadan was burning to ask what the big deal actually was if they exchanged a few bawdy words about lew successfully talking ione out of her pique long enough to pin her manfully to the mattress all right madlyn was there and perhaps one ought to show deference to her femininitynot to mention everything that had gone wrong for her recentlyby not bringing up the coarser aspects of malefemale relationships on the other hand a wink between men wouldnt have gone amiss and in finer days lew had not been averse to allowing his son a wee bit of knowledge in the area of triumphant conquests which made cadan wonder what was going on had lew moved on to another woman it was definitely in his nature a succession of women had come into the lives of the small angarrack clan women who had generally ended up weeping ranting or trying to be reasonable with conversation at the kitchen table or the front door or in the garden or wherever because lew angarrack would not commit to them but when another woman was being worked into the picture lew generally brought her home to meet the kids prior to sex because bringing her home to meet the kids always gave the impression that something was actually possible between themlike a future so what did it mean that here lew was in the kitchen loose of limb and looking like a man whos properly oiled a womans hinges when no one had been brought by at all the kids were older true enough but some things were written in concrete round here and one of them had long been lews behaviour which brought to mind dellen kerne not that she was far from cadans mind at any one moment but it seemed to him that lews secrecy meant there was reason for secrecy and reason for secrecy implied the illicit and illicit definitely led one down the mental garden path to adultery a married woman christ he concluded his father had got to dellen first he didnt know how but he reckoned it had happened he felt a stab of real jealousy so he had plenty of time during the day to dwell on the whatcouldstillbes of a runin with dellen he had the feeling she wouldnt take it amiss to be doing a fatherandson shag but the truth was that he didnt want to make things with his father worse than theyd already been so he ended up trying to occupy himself with other thoughts the trouble here was that he was a doer not a thinker heavy thinking bound him up in anxiety the cure for which lay in two directions one of them was action and the other was drink cadan knew which of the two he ought to choose with respect to his history but he damn well wanted to choose the other and as the hours wore on the wanting increased when the wanting pressed him to the point at which rational thought was no longer possible he gave pooh a fruit plate to keep him occupiedamong other edibles the parrot was particularly partial to spanish orangesand he fetched his bicycle binner down house was his destination cadans purpose was to acquire a companion in the booze drinking alone more than once in a week suggested that a man might have something of a problem with moodaltering substances of the liquid variety and cadan didnt wish to be labeled as anything other than a bon vivant so he settled on will mendick as a likely partner in drink nothing having progressed for will in the madlyn arena it stood to reason he might well want to get soused once getting soused was accomplished they could both sleep it off at binner down house with no one ever the wiser it seemed like a grand idea will lived at binner down house with nine surfers male and female he was the odd man out he didnt ride the waves because he didnt like sharks and he wasnt overly fond of weever fish either cadan found him on the south side of the property which was an ancient place in the sort of condition a property gets into when its near the sea and no one takes proper care of it so the land surrounding it was overgrown with gorse bracken and a tangle of sea grasses a single gnarled cypress in what went for a front garden needed trimming and weeds took the place of a lawn that had too long fought the good fight against them the building itself was in sore need of repair especially with regard to roof tiles and the wood surrounds of windows and doors but the occupants had more important concerns than property maintenance and a disreputable shed in which their surfboards lined up like colourful place markers in a book served as ample evidence of this as did their wet suits which generally hung to dry from the lower branches of the cypress the south side of the house faced binner down from whose environs floated the lowing of cows along the wall of the building a triangular sort of greenhouse had been fashioned its glass roof tilted into the house with one side of it also glass and the other comprising the existing granite of the old building but painted white to reflect the sun this was a vinery cadan had learned its purpose being to grow grapes cadan found will inside he was bent to accommodate the tilted glass of the ceiling digging round the base of an infant grapevine when cadan entered will straightened and said fuck all its about bloody time before he saw who it was coming through the door sorry he then said i thought it was one of them he was cadan knew referring to his surfing housemates still not helping round here hell no they might actually have to get off their bums will had been using a pitchfork to work the soilwhich didnt look to cadan the best way to go about it considering the size of the plants but he said nothingand will tossed the tool aside he took up a cup of something sitting on a ledge and he quaffed the rest of whatever was in it it was warm in the greenhouse as it was supposed to be despite the hour of the day and he was sweating which made his wispy hair cling to his skull he was going to be bald by the time he was thirty cadan decided and he gave silent thanks for his own thick locks i owe you cadan told will by way of prefatory remarks i came by to tell you that will looked confused he reached for his pitchfork and resumed his digging you owe me what exactly an apology for what i said will straightened again he wiped his arm across his forehead he was wearing a flannel shirt partially unbuttoned he had on his usual black tshirt beneath it what did you say that bit about madlyn the other day you know when you stopped by cadan thought that the less said about madlyn the better life would be for them both but he did want to make sure will knew what he was talking about thing is man how the hell do i know who has a chance with my sister and who hasnt oh i expect youd know well enough as youre her brother not as things turn out cadan told him she was talking about you this morning at breakfast as it happens i heard that and i realisedlisten man i was dead wrong and i want you to know it he was lying of course but he reckoned he could be forgiven for that a greater good was involved here he didnt actually know his sisters mind on the subject of romantic entanglements did heaside from how she felt about santo kerne at the moment and he wasnt altogether sure of that eitherand besides that he needed will mendick just now so if a small prevarication was going to get will to open a bottle with him that certainly could be forgiven what im sayings that you shouldnt write her off shes been in a bad way for a bit and i reckon she needs you even if she doesnt know that yet will went to the far end of the greenhouse where supplies were kept and fetched down a box of fertiliser from a shelf cadan followed him so i reckoned we could hoist a brewcadan cringed internally at the bizarre expression he sounded like someone on american tellyand let bygones be bygones what dyou say cant will said i cant leave at the moment thats where youre lucky i wasnt actually talking about leaving cadan told him frankly i reckoned we could booze up here will shook his head he returned to his vines and his pitchfork cadan had the distinct impression that something was eating at his friends peace of mind cant sorry will picked up the pace of his work and clarified his situation by adding tersely cops were at the grocery cade they gave me a grilling what about what the hell dyou think it was about santo kerne yeah santo kerne is there another subject why you for gods sake the hell i know theyve been talking to everyone howd you escape will dug furiously once again cadan said nothing he felt ill at ease all at once speculatively he looked at will the fact that the cops had sought him out suggested things cadan didnt want to begin to consider well he said in the expansive tone that always indicates an end to a conversation yeah will said grimly well cadan made his farewell soon after this and was thus at a loose end once again will and wills troubles aside fate seemed to be telling him that action was called for and action meant the single deedaside from drinkingthat cadan had not been able to get out of his brain christ but his mind seemed fixed on her she might as well have been a deadly infection eating away at his brain cadan knew that his choices were simple he had to get rid of her or he had to have her yet having her was not unlike committing ritual suicide and he knew that if nothing else so he rode from binner down house to the only place left in his limited list of escape hatches from the self the royal air station he couldnt come up with any other alternative hed lie to his father about having gone to work if it came to that he just needed to be somewhere that wasnt at home alone or at adventures unlimited in the vicinity of that woman as luck had it his fathers car wasnt there but jagos was which seemed a godsend if anyone could act the part of confidant it was jago reeth unfortunately someone else had the same idea cadan walked in to find the two daughters of ione soutar in the reception area and the door to the inner workshops closed jennie was scrupulously attending to her school prep at the card table that served as his fathers desk while the redoubtable leigh was pressing one finger to the side of her nostril a tube of super glue on the counter in front of her along with a compact mirror into which she gazed mums inside cadan leigh told him with that perpetual maddening interrogatory inflection of hers which always suggested she was speaking to a fool shes said its personal so youre not to go in i expect shes talking to jago bout your dad jennie added frankly she was sucking on her lower lip as she rubbed out pencil marks shed made on her paper she said its over but she keeps crying at night in the bath when she thinks we cant hear so i reckon its not as over as she wants it to be she needs to give him the permanent heaveho leigh said i mean no offense cadan but your fathers a dickhead women need to stand up for themselves and they need to stand firm and they especially need to kick arse when theyre not being treated the way they deserve to be treated i mean like what sort of example is she setting for the two of us what the hellre you doing to your face cadan asked mummy wouldnt let her get her nose pierced so shes gluing a stone on jennie informed cadan in the friendly fashion that was her nature cn you do long division cade god dont ask him leigh said to her sister he didnt even pass one gsce you know that jennie cadan ignored her you want a calculator he asked jennie shes supposed to show her work leigh told him she inspected her nose stud and said to the mirror im not stupid im not going to rubbish up my face like id ackshully do that she rolled her eyes what dyou think jennie jennie said without looking i think youre going to have a real row with her now cadan couldnt disagree leigh looked like someone with a large spot of blood on the side of her nose she should have chosen a differentcoloured stone mums going to make her take it off jennie went on itll hurt when she does as well cos the super glue holds it real good youll be sorry leigh shut up leigh said i only said shut up put a sock in it cram your fist down your throat gag yourself with a shovel you arent sposed to talk to me like the inner door swung open ione stood there shed been crying massively by the look of her damn but she actually must love his father cadan thought he wanted to tell her to let his dad go and to get on with her life lew angarrack wasnt available and he probably wouldnt ever be hed been dumped by the bounderhis one true eternal childhood loveand hed not got past it none of them had that was their curse but how could one explain it to a woman whod managed to carry on with her life when her marriage had ended there was no way it looked however as if jago had made a heroic effort in that direction he stood behind ione with a handkerchief in his hand he was folding this and returning it to the pocket of his boiler suit leigh took one look at her mother and rolled her eyes she said i suppose this means we wont be surfing any longer jennie added loyally i didnt like it anyways as she gathered up her schoolbooks lets go girls ione said she cast a look round the workshop nothing more to be said matters are quite finished here cadan she ignored altogether as if he were a carrier of the family disease he stepped out of the way as she herded her offspring out of the shop she was setting off in the direction of her own shop in the air station as the door swung closed behind her poor lass was jagos comment on the matter whatd you tell her jago went back into the glassing room the truth which is no one changes a leopards spots what about the leopard jago was carefully peeling some blue tape from the rail of a pintail short board cadan noticed how bad his shakes were today eh jago said cant a leopard change its own spots ill wager you cn think that one through cade people do change nope jago said that they dont he applied sandpaper to the resin seam his glasses slipped down on his nose and he pushed them back into place their reactions prhaps what they show to the world if you see what i mean that part changes if they want it to change but the inside part it stays the same you dont change who you are just how you act jago looked up a long hunk of his lank grey hair had come loose from his perennial ponytail and it fell across his cheek whatre you doing here cade me less youve changed your name lad arent you meant to be at work cadan preferred not to answer that question directly so he had a wander round the workshop as jago continued to sand the rails of the board he opened the shaping roomscene of his former attempt at employment at liquidearthand he gazed inside the problem he decided was having been assigned to shaping boards he had no patience for it shaping required a steady hand it demanded the use of an endless catalogue of tools and templates it asked one to consider so many variables that keeping them all in mind was an impossibility the curve of the blank single versus double concavity the contours of the rails the fin positions length of board shape of tail thickness of rail one sixteenth of an inch made all the difference and bloody hell cadan cant you tell those channels are too deep i cant have you in here cocking things up all right fair enough he was wretched at shaping and glassing was so boring he wanted to weep it frayed his nerves all the delicacy required the fiberglass unspooling from its roll with just enough excess not to be considered wasteful the careful application of resin to fix the glass permanently to the polystyrene beneath it in such a way as to prevent air bubbles the sanding then the glassing again then more sanding he couldnt do it he wasnt made for it you had to be born a glasser like jago and that was that hed wanted to work in the spray room from the first applying the paint to his own board artwork but that hadnt been allowed his father had told him he had to earn his way into that position by learning the rest of the business first but when it had come down to it lew hadnt demanded as much from santo kerne had he youll take over the business santo wont so you need to learn things top to bottom had been his fathers excuse i need an artist and i need one now santo knows how to design he knows how to fuck madlyn you mean cadan had wanted to say but really what was the point madlyn had wanted santo employed there and madlyn was the favoured child and now who knew theyd both disappointed their father in the end but there was a chance that madlyn had finally disappointed him more im ready to come back here cadan said to jago what dyou think jago straightened from the board and set down his sanding block he examined cadan before he spoke whats going on he asked cadan riffled through his brain to try to come up with a good reason for his change of heart but there was only the truth if he were to stand a chance of getting back into his fathers good graces with jagos assistance he said you were right i cant work there jago but i need your help jago nodded she got you bad eh cadan didnt want to spend another moment on the subject of dellen kerne either mentally or conversationally he said no yes whatever ive got to get out of there will you help course i will the old man said kindly just give me some time to plan an approach after his conversation in zennor with the former detective lynley had returned to david wilkies house which was no particular distance from the church there hed ventured into the attic with the old man an hour of rooting through cardboard boxes had produced wilkies notes on the unresolved case of jamie parsons these notes had in their turn produced the names of the boys whod been so thoroughly questioned in the matter of jamies death wilkie had no idea where those boys now resided but lynley thought it possible that at least one or two of them still lived in the vicinity of pengelly cove if he was correct they were waiting there to be questioned this same questioning occupied lynleys thoughts as he returned to that surfing village he gave a great deal of consideration to how he wanted to make his next move as it turned out with ben kerne in casvelyn one of the boys prematurely dead of lymphoma and another having emigrated to australia only three of the original six still resided in pengelly cove and it was not difficult to find them lynley tracked them down by starting at the pub where a conversation with the publican led him to an auto body repair shop chris outer the local primary school darren fields and a marine engine maintenance business frankie kliskey in very short order at each place of employment he did and said the same thing he produced his police identification gave minimal details about the death under investigation in casvelyn and asked each man if he could free himself up to talk about ben kerne in another location in an hours time the death of ben kernes son santo appeared to work the necessary magic if magic it could be called each of the men had agreed lynley had selected the coastal path for their conversation not far outside the village stood the memorial to jamie parsons that eddie kerne had spoken of high up on the cliff it comprised a tallbacked stone bench forming a curve round a circular stone table in the middle of the table jamie was deeply incised along with the dates of his birth and his death once he arrived lynley remembered having seen this memorial during his lengthy walk along the coast hed sat in the shelter that the bench provided from the wind and hed stared not out to sea but at the boys name and the dates that marked the brevity of his life lifes brevity had filled his mind along with her of course along with helen on this day he realised once he sat on the bench to wait that aside from a few minutes upon waking hed not thought about helen and the recognition of that fact brought her death even more heavily upon him he found he didnt want not to think of her daily and hourly even as he understood that to exist in the present meant that she would move farther and farther into his past as time went forward yet it wounded him to know that beloved wife longedfor son both of them gone and he would recover even as this was the way of the world and of life the very fact of his recovery seemed unbearable and obscene he rose from the bench and walked to the edge of the cliff another memorialless formal than jamie parsonss table and benchlay here a wreath of dead and disintegrating evergreens from the previous christmas a deflated balloon a sodden paddington bear and the name eric written in black marking pen on a tongue depressor there were a dozen ways to die along the cornish coast lynley wondered which one of them had taken this soul the sound of footfalls on the stony path just to the north of where he stood drew his attention to the route from pengelly cove he saw the three men come over the rise together and he knew theyd contacted one another hed expected as much when hed first spoken to them hed even encouraged it his design was to lay his cards on the table they had nothing to fear from him darren fields was obviously their leader he was the biggest of them and as head teacher of the local primary school he was likely in possession of the most education he walked at the front of their line up the path he was the first to nod at lynley and to acknowledge the selection of meeting site with the words i thought as much well weve said all there is to be said on that subject years ago so if youre thinking im here about santo kerne as i told you lynley said about ben kerne as well if my intentions were anything more than that id hardly have been so transparent with you the other two looked to fields he evaluated lynleys words he finally jerked his head in what went for a nod and all of them returned to the table and its bench frankie kliskey appeared to be the most nervous of them an unusually small man he chewed on the side of his index fingerin a spot that was dirty from engine oil and raw from frequent chewingand his glance shot rabbitlike among them for his part chris outer seemed prepared to wait for matters to unfold in whatever way they would he lit a cigarette in the cave of his hand and he leaned against the bench with the collar of his leather jacket turned up his eyes narrowed and his expression reminiscent of james dean in a scene from rebel without a cause only the hair was missing he was as bald as a chicken egg i hope you can see this isnt a trap of any kind lynley said as a means of preamble david wilkieis the name familiar to you yes i see that it isbelieves that what happened to jamie parsons all those years ago was likely an accident wilkie doesnt think nownor did he apparently ever thinkthat what was premeditated among you was his death the boys blood showed both alcohol and cocaine wilkie thinks you didnt understand his condition and expected him to make it out on his own when you were finished with him they said nothing an opaqueness had come into darren fieldss blue eyes however and this suggested to lynley a determination to hold fast to whatever had been said in the past about jamie parsons that made very good sense from darrens perspective whatever had been said in the past had kept them out of the judicial system for nearly three decades why make an alteration now heres what i know lynley said hang on man darren fields snapped not a minute ago you were telling us that youd come about another matter bens kid chris outer pointed out frankie kliskey said nothing but his glance kept pingponging among them yes ive come about that lynley acknowledged but the two deaths have one man in commonben kerneand that has to be looked at its the way these things work theres nothing more to be said i think there is i think there always was so does dci wilkie if it comes to that but the difference between us isas ive saidthat wilkie believes what happened wasnt intentional while im far from certain of that i could be reassured but for that to happen one of you or all of you are going to have to talk to me about that night and the cave the three men made no reply although outer and fields exchanged a look one couldnt take a look to the bank however not to mention to di hannaford so lynley pressed forward heres what i know there was a party at that party there was an altercation between jamie parsons and ben kerne jamie had already needed sorting for any number of reasons most of which had to do with who he was and how he treated people and the way he dealt with ben kerne that night was apparently the final straw so he got sorted in one of the sea caves i believe the object was humiliation hence the boys missing clothing the marks on his wrists and ankles from having been tied up and the faeces in his ears my guess is that you likely pissed on him as well but the urine would have been washed away by the tide where the faeces were not my question is how did you get him down there to the cave ive thought about this and it seems to me that you had to have something that he wanted if he was already drunk and perhaps already drugged it cant have been the promise of getting high that leaves a form of contraband that he didnt want others at the partyperhaps his sisters who mightve grassed to their parentsto see being exchanged but not wanting to have others see him in possession of something that they themselves might have wanted seems out of character in the jamie ive heard described having what others needed wanted admired respected whateverthat seems to have been how he operated showing these things off to people showing off full stop being better than everyone else so i cant see him agreeing to meet in a cave to take ownership of something illegal that then seems to leave us with something more private that was promised him which seems to lead us to sex frankies eyes did it blue their pupils enlarged lynley wondered how hed managed to keep quiet when questioned by wilkie away from his friends but perhaps that had been it away from his friends he wouldnt know what to say so hed say nothing in their presence he could wait for their lead young menadolescent boyswill do just about anything if sex is part of the picture lynley said i expect jamie parsons was no different to the rest of you when it came to that so the question is was he homosexual and did one of you make a promise to him that was meant to be kept when he got down to the cave silence they were very good at this but lynley was fairly certain he could go them one better it would have had to be more than merely a promise though he said jamie wasnt likely to respond to the mere suggestion of buggery i reckon it would have had to be a move of some sort a trigger a signal so that he would know it was safe to proceed what would that be a knowing look a word a gesture hand on bum stiffie pressed up to him in a private corner the sort of language thats spoken by no one heres a poof it was darren who spoke not surprisingly lynley realised as he was a teacher of young children and had the most to lose and none of the others were either the rest of your group lynley clarified thats what im telling you but it was sex wasnt it lynley said im right in that he thought he was meeting someone for sex who silence finally the past is dead it was chris outer this time and he looked as steely as darren fields the past is the past lynley countered santo kerne is dead jamie parsons is dead their deaths may or may not be related but theyre not fields said but until i know otherwise i have to assume there may be a connection between them and i dont want the connection to be that each investigation ends in the same way with an open verdict santo kerne was murdered jamie parsons was not all right ill accept that dci wilkie believes it as well youre not going to be prosecuted more than a quarter century after the fact for having been so bloody stupid as to have left the boy in that cave all i want to know is what happened that night it was jack jack the admission fairly burst from frankie kliskey as if hed been waiting nearly thirty years to make it he said to the others jacks dead now and what does it matter i dont want to carry this im that bloody tired of carrying it darren god damn i held my tongue back then and look at me look he held out his hands they were shaking like a palsy a cop comes round and its all back again and i dont want living through it another time darren pushed his body away from the table a gesture of disgust but it was also a gesture of dismissal one that could be interpreted as have it your way then there was another tight little silence among the men in it the gulls cawed and far below a boat gunned its motor in the cove she was called nancy snow chris outer said slowly she was jack dustows girlfriend and jack was one of us hes the one who died of lymphoma lynley said that would be jack that would be jack he talked nan intodoing what was done we could have used dellenthats bens wife now dellen nankervis as she wasbecause she was always ready for action she was there that night lynley asked oh aye she was there shes what started things because she was there he sketched out the details an adolescent relationship gone sour two youngsters each showing the other one up with a willing new partner jamie reacting to his sisters becoming openly entangled with ben kerne jamies attack on ben he needed sorting anyway like you said frankie kliskey finished none of us liked the bloke so jack got nan snow to heat him up end product was jamie wanted sex right there in the house preferably where everyone could see he was getting it darren fields added where jack could see he was getting it chris pointed out thats what jamie was like but nan said no frankie went on with the story no way shed do it with him where others could watch especially where jack could see she said lets go down to the cave to do it so thats what they did thats where we were waiting she knew what the plan was jack told her chris said she knew get jamie down to the cave for sex dont meet him there because hes not stupid and hell smell a rat and wont go down take him there instead act like you want it as bad as he does well handle the rest so down they came round half past one in the morning we were in the cave and nan handed him over the restyou can work it out the odds were good six of you and one of him no darren said his voice was harsh ben kerne wasnt ever there where was he then gone home he was stupid about dellen always stupid christ if it hadnt been for her we wouldnt have been at the bloody party at all but he needed cheering up so we said lets go and have his drink and eat his food and listen to his music only she was there that bloody dellen with some new bloke so ben got into the wrong girls knickers in reaction to seeing dellen and after that he just wanted to go home which was what he did the rest of us talked to nan and nan went back to the party and darren gestured in the direction of the cave down below them tucked into the cliff lynley carried the story on saying you stripped him in the cave and you tied him up you smeared faeces on him did you piss on him no what then toss off one of you all of you he cried darren said thats what we wanted thats all we wanted when he started to cry we were finished with him we untied him we left him to make his way back up the cliff the rest you know lynley nodded the story made him feel queasy it was one thing to surmise another to hear the truth of the matter there were so many jamie parsons on earth and so many boys like these men before him there was also the great divide between them and how that divide was or was not negotiated jamie parsons had likely been unbearable but being unbearable did not amount to being deserving of death lynley said im curious about one thing they waited all of them looked at him darren fields sullen chris outer as cool as hed likely been twentyeight years ago frankie kliskey expectant of a psychological blow of some sort how did you manage to hold fast to the same story when the police went after you initially before they went after ben kerne i mean we left the party at half past eleven we parted at the high street we went home it was darren speaking and lynley got the point three sentences only endlessly repeated they may have been bloody stupid those five boys involved but they had not been ignorant of the law what did you do with his clothes countrysides filled with adits and mine shafts chris said thats the nature of this part of cornwall what about ben kerne did you tell him what had happened we left the party at half past eleven we parted at the high street we went home so lynley thought ben kerne had always been as ignorant of what had happened as everyone else had been aside from the original five boys and nancy snow what happened to nancy snow lynley asked how could you be sure shed not talk she was pregnant by jack darren told him three months along she had an interest in keeping jack out of trouble what happened to her they married after he died she moved off to dublin with another husband so you were safe we were always safe we left the party at half past eleven we parted at the high street we went home there was in short nothing more to be said it was the same situation that had existed after jamie parsons death nearly thirty years earlier did you not feel some sense of responsibility once the police focused their attention on ben kerne lynley asked them someone grassed on him was it one of you darren laughed harshly not bloody likely only person whodve grassed on ben wouldve been someone wanting to cause him trouble chapter twentytwo she thinks you killed santo alan didnt make the stunned declaration until they were well away from adventures unlimited hed manhandled kerra out of her mothers bedroom marched her along the hotel corridor and down the stairs shed struggled and snarled let me go alan let me god damn go but hed been obdurate hed been strong as well who would have believed that someone as wiry as alan cheston could be so strong hed taken her out of the hotel entirely through the dining room door onto the terrace up the stone stairway and along the promontory in the direction of st mevan beach it was too cold to be out there without a pullover or a jacket but he didnt stop to fetch something to protect them from the rising sea wind in fact he didnt look as if he was even aware that the wind was brisk and soon to be biting they went down to the beach and at this point kerra gave up her struggle submitting herself to be led wherever he was leading she didnt give up her fury however she would unleash it upon him when they got to where hed decided to take her this turned out to be the sea pit at the far end of the beach they climbed up its seven crumbly steps and stood on the surrounding concrete deck they looked down into the sandstrewn bottom of the pool and for a moment kerra wondered if he intended to throw her into the water like some primitive heman taking control of his woman he didnt instead he said she thinks you killed santo and then he released her had he said anything else kerra would have gone on the attack verbally physically but the statement demanded an answer that was at least marginally rational because the tone of it was both confused and frightened he spoke again ive never seen anything like that you and your mum that was a brawl it was the sort of thing one sees he didnt seem to know where one would see such a sight but that would be typical alan was hardly the type to frequent locations where women got into hairpulling bodyscratching screamingandshrieking engagements with one another neither was kerra if it came to that but dellen had pushed her to the breaking point and there was a reason for what had happened between them alan would have to admit to that at least he said i didnt know what to do that was so far beyond what ive ever had to cope with she rubbed her arm where hed held on to her she said santo stole madlyn he took her off me and i hated him for that dellen knows it so it was easy for her to go from that to saying i killed him thats her style alan looked if anything even more confused he said people dont steal people from other people kerra in my family they do among the kernes its something between a kneejerk reaction and an outright tradition thats rubbish madlyn and i were friends then santo came along and gave her the eye and madlyn went mad for him she couldnt even talk about anything else so we ended upmadlyn and iwe ended up with nothing because she and santoand what he didand god it was just so typical he was just like dellen he didnt want madlyn he just wanted to see if he could get her away from me now that she was finally putting it all into words kerra found she couldnt stop she ran a hand through her hair grasped it hard and pulled as if pulling it would cause her to feel something different from what shed felt so long he didnt need madlyn he couldve had anyone so could dellen if it comes to that she can have anyone she has had anyone any time shes felt the itch she doesnt needshe doesnt alan stared at her as if she were speaking a language whose words he understood but whose underlying meaning was foreign to him a wave hit the side of the sea pit and he flinched as if surprised at its strength and proximity the spray from it hit them both it was fresh and cold salty against their lips he said im completely lost she said you know perfectly well what im talking about as it happens i dont i honestly dont now was the moment there was nothing left but to present him with the evidence shed gathered and to speak the truth as she understood it kerra had left the postcard in her mothers bedroom but the fact of the postcard still existed she said i went to the cottage alan i looked through your belongings i know that all right you know that i found the postcard what postcard this is it that postcard pengelly cove the sea cave dellens writing on it in red and an arrow pointing straight to the cave we both know what that means we do stop it youve been working in that marketing office with her forhow long i asked you not to i asked you to take a job some place else but you wouldnt would you so you sat in the office with her day after day and you cant tell meyou bloody well cannot claim that she didntyoure a man for gods sake you know the signs and there were more than just signs werent there he stared at her she wanted to stomp her feet he could not possibly be so obtuse hed decided this was the way to go to feign ignorance until she simply threw up her hands in defeat how clever of him but she was not a fool where were you the day that santo died she asked him christ you cant be thinking that i had something to do with where were you you were gone so was she and you had that postcard it was in your room it said this is it and we both know what she meant shed begin with red the lipstick a scarf a pair of shoes when she did thatwhen she does that kerra felt as if she would weep and the very thought of weeping because of this because of her because of them caused all of her anger to come roaring back swelling within her to such an extreme that she thought it might explode from her mouth a foul effluent capable of polluting whatever remained between her and this man whom shed chosen to love because she did love him only love was dangerous love put one where her father was and that she could not begin to bear alan was apparently beginning to track all this because he said i see its not santo at all is it its your mum you think that iwith your mumthe day santo died and this was supposed to have happened in that cave on the postcard she couldnt reply she couldnt even nod she was working too hard to get back under control so that if she had to feel somethingindeed if she had to show that she felt somethingwhat that something would be was rage alan said kerra i told you we talked about the video your mum and i id spoken to your dad about it as well your mum kept telling me about a spot along the coast that she thought would serve our purposes well because of the sea caves and the atmosphere they provided she handed me that card and you are not that stupid and neither am i he looked away from her not at the sea but in the direction of the hotel from the lip of the sea pit the old promontory king george hotel could not be seen but the beach huts could that neat blue and white line of them the perfect spot for assignations alan sighed i knew what she had in mind she suggested we go to the caves and have a look and i knew shes rather painfully obvious and not very creative when it comes to innuendoes but then i dont expect shes ever had to be creative shes still a beautiful woman in her way dont kerra said finally theyd come to it and she found she couldnt bear to hear the details it was at heart the same bloody story with the same bloody plot only the leading men altered i will alan said and youll listen and decide what you want to believe she claimed the sea caves were perfect for the video she said we had to go have a look i told her id have to meet her there and i used as an excuse the fact that i had errands to run because i had no intention of riding in the same car with her so we met there and she showed me the cove the village and the sea caves and nothing happened between us because i had no intention of anything other than nothing ever happening between us hed kept his gaze on the beach huts as he spoke but now he looked back at her his expression was earnest but his eyes were wary kerra could not make out what that meant he said so now you get to decide kerra you get to choose then she understood what would she believe him or her instincts what would she select trust or suspicion she said hollowly they take from me everything that i love he said quietly darling kerra thats not how it works its the way its always worked in our family perhaps in the past perhaps youve lost people you didnt wish to lose perhaps youve let them go yourself perhaps youve cut them off the point is that no one gets taken away who doesnt want to be taken away in the first place and if someones taken thats no reflection on you how can it possibly be she heard the words and she sensed their warmth the warmth made her go quiet inside it was very strange it was equally unexpected with what alan said kerra felt a subtle release within her something indefinable was giving way as if a great internal bulwark were dissolving she also felt the prick of tears but she would not allow herself to go that far you then she said me then what i suppose i choose you just suppose i cant more than that just nowi cant alan he nodded gravely then he said i took a videographer with me that was the errand i went on before pengelly cove i fetched the videographer i didnt go to the sea caves alone why didnt you just tell me why didnt you say because i wanted you to choose i wanted you to believe shes sick kerra anyone with sense can see that shes sick shes always been so shes always been so sick and spending your life reacting to her sickness is going to make you sick as well youve got to decide if thats how you want to live i for one do not shell still keep trying to very likely she will or shell get help shell make up her mind or your dad will insist on it or shell end up out on the street on her ear and shell have to make a change to survive i dont know the point is i intend to live my life the way i want to live my life regardless of what your mum does with hers what exactly do you want to do the same or something else the same she said her lips felt stiff but imso afraid were all afraid at the end of the day because theres no guarantee of a single thing thats just how life is she nodded numbly a wave broke against the sea pit she flinched alan she said i didnt hurti wouldnt have done anything to santo of course you wouldnt no more would i bea was alone in the incident room when she logged on to the computer shed sent barbara havers back to polcare cove to haul daidre trahair into casvelyn for a têteà tête if shes not there wait for an hour bea told the detective sergeant if she doesnt show up call it a day and well lasso her tomorrow morning the rest of the team shed sent to their respective homes after a lengthy postmortem on the days developments have a decent meal and a good nights sleep she told them things will look different clearer and more possible in the morning or so she hoped she considered logging on to the computer a last resort a giving way to constable mcnultys fanciful approach to detective work she did it because before she and ds havers had left liquidearth earlier that day shed paused in front of the poster that had so fascinated the young constablethe surfer wiping out on the monstrous waveand shed said in reference to it so this is the wave that killed him both men were with her lew angarrack and jago reeth angarrack was the one who said who mark foo isnt this mark foo on the mavericks wave that killed him true enough that foo died at mavericks lew said but thats a younger kid jay moriarty jay moriarty yeah angarrack had cocked his head curiously why mr reeth said this was mark foos last wave angarrack glanced at jago reeth howd you come up with foo he said if nothing else the boards all wrong jago came to the door that separated the work area from the reception area and showroom where the poster was pinned among others to the wall he leaned against the jamb and nodded at bea top marks he told her and said to lew theyre doing the job theyre meant to be doing taking note of everything the way they ought had to check didnt i hope you dont take it personally inspector bea had been irritated everyone wanted a piece of a murder investigation if the victim was known to them but she hated anything that wasted her time and she disliked being tested in that way even more she disliked the way jago reeth watched her after this exchange with that kind of knowing look men often adopted when forced to do business with a female whose position was superior to theirs shed said to him dont do that again and left liquidearth with barbara havers but now alone in the incident room she wondered if jago reeth had made the misstatement about the poster because he was in truth testing the strength of the investigation or for another reason entirely there were only two other possibilities that bea could see hed misstated the surfers identity because he hadnt known it in the first place or hed deliberately misstated the surfers identity to draw attention to himself in either case the question was why and she didnt have a ready answer she spent the next ninety minutes floating round the vast chasm of the internet she searched out moriarty and foo discovering that both of them were dead their names led to other names so she followed the trail laid down by this list of faceless individuals until she finally had their faces on the computer screen as well she studied them hoping for some sort of sign as to what she was meant to do next but if there was a connection between these bigwave riders and a sea cliff climbing death in cornwall she could not find it and she gave up the effort she walked over to the china board what did they have after these days of effort three pieces of equipment damaged the condition of the body indicating hed taken a single heavy punch in the face fingerprints on santo kernes car a hair caught up in his climbing equipment the reputation of the boy himself two vehicles in the approximate vicinity of his fall and the fact that he had likely twotimed madlyn angarrack with a veterinarian from bristol that was it there was nothing substantial they could work with and certainly nothing upon which they could base an arrest it was more than seventytwo hours since the boy had died and there wasnt a cop alive who didnt know that every hour that passed without an arrest from the time of a murder made the case that much more difficult to solve bea studied the names of the individuals who were involved either directly or tangentially in this murder it seemed to her that at one time or another everyone who knew him had had access to santo kernes climbing equipment so there was little point to going in that direction thus what bea appeared to be left with was the motive behind the crime sex power money she thought hadnt they always been the triumvirate of motives perhaps they were not generally obvious to the investigator in the initial stages of an enquiry but didnt they turn up eventually look at jealousy anger revenge and avarice just as a start couldnt you trace each one of them back to a progenitor of sex power or money and if that was the case how did those three originating motives apply in this situation bea took the only next step she could think to take she made a list on it she wrote the names that seemed probable to her at this juncture and next to each she logged that individuals possible motive she came up with lew angarrack avenging a daughters broken heart sex jago reeth avenging a surrogate granddaughters broken heart sex again kerra kerne eliminating her brother in order to inherit all of adventures unlimited power and money will mendick hoping to make an inroad into madlyn angarracks affections there was sex once more madlyn operating from a hellhathnofury perspective sex yet again alan cheston desiring a more significant handhold on adventures unlimited power daidre trahair putting an end to being the other woman by ridding herself of the man more sex so far the parents of santo kerne didnt seem to have a motive to do away with their own son nor did tammy penrule what then was she left with bea wondered motives aplenty opportunity aplenty and the means at hand the sling was cut and then rewrapped with santo kernes identifying tape two chock stones were perhaps the chock stones were the key since strands of heavy wire formed the cable that made it it would require a special tool to cut bolt cutters perhaps cable cutters find that tool and she would find the killer it was the best possibility she had what was notable though was the leisurely nature of the crime the killer was relying upon the fact that the boy would use the sling or one of the damaged chock stones eventually but time was not of the essence nor was it necessary to the killer that the boy die in an instant since he might have used the sling and the chock stone on a much simpler climb he might only have fallen and been hurt requiring the killer to come up with another plan thus they werent looking for someone desperate perpetrator of a crime of passion they were looking for someone crafty craftiness always suggested women as did the approach that had been used in this crime invariably when women killed they did not use a handson method that line of thought shot her directly back to madlyn angarrack to kerra kerne and to daidre trahair which in turn made her wonder where the bloody hell the vet had taken herself to for the day that in turn led her inevitably to consider thomas lynley and his presence at polcare cove that morning which took her over to the telephone to punch in the number of the mobile shed given him so what do we have she asked when her third attempt to get a connection to wherever he was proved successful and where in gods name are you detective he was on his way back to casvelyn he told her hed made a day of newquay zennor and pengelly cove to her question of how the dickens this got them to daidre trahair whom she still wished to see by the way he told her a tale of adolescent surfers adolescent sex adolescent drugs drink parties caves on the beach and death rich kids poor kids and inbetween kids and the cops failing to solve a case despite someone grassing about ben kerne lynley told her his friends thought from the first that dellen was the grass this is dellen kerne bens father thinks so as well and this is relevant for what reason bea asked wearily i think the answer to that is in exeter are you heading there now tomorrow he told her he paused before saying i havent run into dr trahair by the way has she turned up he sounded far too casual for beas liking she wasnt a fool not a sign of her and may i tell you how little i like that it could mean anything she may have gone back to bristol oh please i dont believe that for a moment he was silent that was enough of a response ive sent your sergeant havers out there to bring her in if shes slithered home bea told him shes not my sergeant havers lynley said id not be so quick about saying that bea said shed not rung off from him for five minutes when her mobile chimed with sergeant havers herself ringing nothing was her brief report mostly broken up by a terrible connection shll i wait longer can do if you want not often that i get to smoke in peace and listen to the surf youve done your bit bea said shove off home then your superintendent lynleys heading towards the inn as well hes not my superintendent lynley havers told her what is it with you two bea asked and rang off before the sergeant could work up an answer she decided her last task before leaving for the day was to phone pete and make mother noises about his clothing his eating his schoolwork and football shed enquire about the dogs as well and if by chance ray answered the phone shed be polite pete answered though saving her the trouble he was all afire about arsenals acquisition of a new player someone with an indecipherable name fromhad he actually said the south pole no he had to have said são paolo bea made the appropriate noises of enthusiasm and ticked football off her list of topics she went though eating and schoolwork and was about to go on to clothinghe hated to be asked about his underwear but the fact of the matter was that he would wear the same pair of undershorts for a week if she didnt stay on top of him about itwhen he said dad wants you to tell him when the next sports day is at school mum i always tell him when the next sports day at school is she replied yeah but i mean he wants to go with you not come on his own he wants or you want bea asked shrewdly well itd be nice wouldnt it dads all right ray was making further inroads bea thought well she could do nothing about that just now she said they would see and she told pete she loved him he returned the sentiment and they rang off but his remarks about ray sent bea back to the computer where this time she went to her dating site pete needed a permanent man about the house and she believed she was ready for something more defined than dating and the occasional bonk when pete was staying the night at rays she scrolled through the offerings trying not to scrutinise the photos first telling herself that keeping an open mind was essential but a quarter hour of this topped up her dating despair in ways that nothing else ever could she decided that if every person who indicated a love for romantic strolls on the beach at sunset actually took romantic strolls on the beach at sunset the resulting mass of humanity would resemble oxford street during the christmas season it was such rubbish whose interests actually were candlelit dinners romantic beach strolls wine tasting in bordeaux and intimate chats in hot tubs or in front of a blazing coal fire in the lake district was she meant to believe this bloody hell she thought the dating scene was bleak it got worse every year making her more and more resolved to stick to her dogs for companionship they might very well enjoy a soak in a hot tub those three and at least shed be spared the pseudointimate conversation that went along with it she logged off the computer and headed out sometimes going homeeven alonewas the only answer ben kerne completed the cliff climb in good time and his muscles were burning from the effort hed done it as santo had intended to do it abseiling down and then making the climb on the return although he could just as easily have parked below in polcare cove and done everything in reverse he could even have hiked up the coastal path to the top of the cliff and just done the abseil by itself but hed wanted to walk in santos footsteps and that required that he park his austin not in the car park of the cove itself but in the layby not far from stowe wood where santo had left his own car from there he trudged along the public footpath to the sea as santo would have done and he fixed his sling to the same stone post where santos own sling had failed him everything else was a matter of muscle memory the abseil down took no time at all the climb up required skill and thought but that was preferable to being in the vicinity of adventures unlimited and dellen at the end of the climb ben wanted to be exhausted he sought to be drained but he found that he was as agitated as hed been when hed begun the whole enterprise his muscles were weary but his mind was rattling along on autopilot as ever it was dellen he thought of it was dellen and the understanding he now had of what hed done with his life in the pursuit of her he hadnt understood at first what she was talking about when shed shouted i told and then when her meaning began to dawn upon him he didnt want to believe her for believing her would mean accepting that the cloud of suspicion under which hed lived in pengelly covethat very cloud of suspicion that had ultimately driven his final removal to trurohad been deliberately created by this woman he loved so to avoid both belief and its aftermath he said to her what the hell are you talking about and he concluded that she was striking out at him because hed made accusations of her because hed thrown her pills from the window and because in doing so hed demanded something of her that she could not cope with at the moment her face was screwed up with rage you know she cried oh you bloody well know you always believed i was the one who grassed you i saw how you looked at me afterwards i could see in your eyesand then off to truro you go and you leave me there with the consequences god i hated you but then i didnt because i loved you so much and i love you now and i hate you and why cant you leave me alone youre why the cops came back to me he said hollowly thats what you mean you spoke to them i saw you with her you wanted me to see you and i saw and i knew you meant to fuck her and how do you think i felt so you decided to go one better you took him down to the cave had him left him and i couldnt be who you wanted me to be i couldnt give you what you wanted but you had no right to end things between us because id done nothing and then with his sisteri saw because you wanted me to see because you wanted me to suffer and so i wanted you to suffer in turn so you fucked him no her voice rose to a scream i did not i wanted you to feel how i felt i wanted you to hurt like i hurt how you made me hurt by wanting from me all those things that i could never give you why did you break with me and whywhywont you leave me now so you accused me there hed finally said it directly yes i did because youre so good youre so god damn bloody good and its your miserable sainthood that i could not tolerate not then and not now you keep turning the other god damn cheek and when you do that i completely despise you and whenever i despised you you broke with me and thats when i loved you and wanted you most he was left with saying only youre mad then he had to get away from her to remain in the bedroom meant he was going to have to come to terms with having built his life on a lie for when the newquay police had focused their enquiries upon him for week after week and month after month he had turned to dellen for comfort and strength she made him whole hed thought she made him what he was yes she was difficult yes they had their occasional troubles but when it was right between them werent they better than they could ever have been with anyone else so when shed followed him to truro hed embraced what he decided that meant when her trembling lips had pronounced the words im pregnant again hed embraced this announcement as if an angel had appeared before him in a dream as if the imaginary walking staff he daily carried had indeed bloomed with lilies upon his waking and when she got rid of that baby as welljust as shed done with the babies before it his and the offspring of two othershed soothed her and agreed that she wasnt quite ready that they werent quite ready that the time wasnt right he owed her the allegiance shed shown him he decided she was a troubled spirit he loved her and he could cope with that when they finally married he felt as if hed captured an exotic bird she was not to be held in a cage however he could only have her if he set her free youre the only one i truly want she would say forgive me ben its you that i love now on the top of the cliff bens breath returned to normal from the climb the sheen of sweat he wore chilled him in the sea breeze and he became aware of the lateness of the day he realised that in making the abseil down the face of the cliff hed ultimately stood in the very spot where santo had lain dead or dying and it came to him that while walking in santos footsteps along the path from the road while fastening the sling to the old stone post while rappelling down and preparing for the climb back up hed not thought of santo once hed come to do so and hed still not managed it his mind had been filledas alwayswith dellen this seemed to him the ultimate betrayal the monstrous one not that dellen had betrayed him by casting suspicion on him all those years ago but that he himself had just betrayed santo a pilgrimage to the very spot where santo had perished had not been enough to exorcise the boys mother from his thoughts ben realised that he lived and breathed her as if she were a contagion afflicting only him away from her he might as well have been with her which was the reason hed kept returning he was in this he thought as sick as she was indeed he was sicker for if she could not help being the dellen she was and had always been he could stop being the perversely loyal benesek whod made it far too simple for her just to continue when he rose from the boulder on which hed sat to catch his breath he felt stiff from cooling down in the breeze he knew hed pay in the morning for the rapidity of the climb he went to the stone post where the sling was looped and he began drawing the rope back up the cliff looping it carefully and just as carefully examining it for frays even in this he found he could not concentrate on santo there was a moral question involved in all this ben knew but he found he lacked the courage to ask it daidre trahair had been waiting in the public bar of the salthouse inn the better part of an hour when selevan penrule came through the door he looked round the room when he saw that his daily drinking companion was not nursing a guinness in the inglenook which selevan and jago reeth regularly commandeered for themselves and he ventured over to join daidre at her table by the window thought hed be here by now selevan said without preamble as he pulled out a chair rang me to say hed be late he did cops were there talking to him and lew copsre talking to everyone talk to you yet he gave a sailors salute to brian whod ventured out of the kitchen upon selevans entrance brian said the regular and selevan said aye and then back to daidre even talked to tammy they did though that was cos the girl had something to tell them and not cos they had questions of her well why should they she knew the boy but that was the extent of it wished it otherwise and i dont mind saying that but she wasnt interested all for the best as things turned out eh bloody hell though i wish theyd get to the bottom of this feel sorry for the family i do daidre would have preferred it if the old man hadnt decided to join her but she couldnt come up with an excuse that would politely communicate her desire to be left in peace for shed never come into the salthouse inn prior to this for the purpose of having a bit of peace so why would he assume that now no one would come to the salthouse inn for peace as the inn was where denizens of the area gathered for gossip and conviviality not for meditation she said they want to talk to me and she showed him the note shed found at her cottage it was written on the back of di hannafords card ive spoken to them already she said the day santo died i cant think why they want to question me again selevan looked at the card turning it over in his hands looks serious he told her with them leaving their cards and the like i think its more that i dont have a phone but ill speak with them of course i will mind you get yourself a solicitor tammy didnt but thats cos tammy had something to tell them and not the reverse like i said s not as if she was hiding something she had information so she handed it over he cocked his head at her you hiding something yourself my girl daidre smiled and pocketed the card as the old man returned it to her we all have secrets dont we is that why youre suggesting a solicitor didnt say that selevan protested but youre a deep one dr trahair weve known that bout you from the first no girl throws a dart like you without having something tricky in her background you ask me im afraid that roller derby is as dark as my secrets get selevan whats that then she tapped his hand with the tips of her fingers youll have to do your research and find out my friend through the windows then she saw the ford as it bumped into the inns uneven car park lynley got out of it and started to walk in the direction of the inn but he turned as another car entered the car park behind him this one a rather decrepit mini whose driver honked the cars horn at him as if he were in the way that jago then selevan was not in a position to see the car park from where he sat he said cheers mate to brian who brought him his glenmorangie and he slurped down his first gulp with satisfaction no daidre said slowly it isnt as she watched the car park she could hear selevan nattering on about his granddaughter tammy had a mind of her own it seemed and nothing was going to put her off a course shed set for herself got to admire the lass for that selevan was saying prhaps were all being too hard on the girl daidre made appropriate listening noises but she was concentrating on the action outside what little there was of it lynley had been accosted by the driver of the bangedup mini this was a barrelshaped woman in droopy corduroy trousers and a donkey jacket buttoned to her neck their conversation lasted only a moment a bit of arm waving on the womans part suggested a minor altercation about lynleys driving behind them then jago reeths defender pulled into the car park heres mr reeth now daidre told selevan best claim our spot then selevan told her and he rose and went to the inglenook daidre continued to watch more words were exchanged outside lynley and the woman fell silent as jago reeth climbed out of his car reeth nodded to them politely as fellow pubgoers do before heading in the direction of the door lynley and the woman exchanged a few more words and then they parted at this daidre rose it took her a moment to negotiate payment for the tea shed had while waiting for lynley by the time she got to the entry to the hotel jago reeth was ensconced with selevan penrule in the inglenook the woman from the car park was gone and lynley himself had apparently returned to his own car for a tattered cardboard box this he was carrying into the inn as daidre entered the dimly lit reception area it was colder here because of the uneven stone floor and the outer door which was frequently off the latch daidre shivered and realised shed left her coat in the bar lynley saw her at once he smiled and said hullo i didnt notice your car out there did you intend to surprise me i intended to waylay you whatve you got there he looked down at what he was holding old coppers notes or coppers old notes both i suppose hes a pensioner down in zennor thats where youve been today there and newquay pengelly cove as well i stopped by your cottage this morning to invite you along but you were nowhere to be found did you go off for the day i like driving in the countryside daidre said its one of the reasons i come down here when i can understandable i like it as well he shifted the box held it at an angle against his hip in that way men have so different to the way women hold something bulky she thought he regarded her he looked healthier than he had four days ago there was a small spark of life about him that had not been present then she wondered if it had to do with being caught up in police work again perhaps it was something that got into ones blood the intellectual excitement of the puzzle of the crime and the physical excitement of the chase youve work to do she indicated the box i was hoping for a word if you had the time were you he lifted an eyebrow the smile again im happy to give it to youthe word the time whatever let me put this in my room and i can meet youin the bar five minutes she didnt want it to be the bar now that jago reeth and selevan penrule were within more of the regulars would be arriving as the time wore on and she wasnt enthusiastic about the prospect of gossip developing over dr trahairs intimate conversation with the scotland yard detective she said id prefer some place a bit more private is there aside from the restaurant whose doors were closed and would be for another hour at least there was really no other spot where they could meet aside from his room he seemed to conclude this at the same moment she did he said come up then the accommodations are monastic but ive tea if youre not averse to pg tips and those grim little containers of milk i believe therere ginger biscuits as well ive had my tea but thanks yes i think your rooms the best place she followed him up the stairs shed never been above in the salthouse inn and it felt odd to be there now treading down the little corridor in the wake of a man as if they had an assignation of some sort she found herself hoping that no one would see and misinterpret and then she asked herself why and what did it matter anyway the door wasnt lockeddidnt seem to be a point as i have nothing here for someone to steal he notedand he ushered her within politely stepping to one side to allow her to precede him into the room he was right in calling it monastic she saw it was quite clean and brightly painted but spare there was only the bed to sit on unless one wished to perch on the small chest of drawers the bed itself seemed vast although it was only a single daidre found herself getting hot in the face when she took it in so she looked away a basin was fitted into the corner of the room and lynley went to this after setting his cardboard box on the floor carefully against the wall he hung up the jacket he was wearingshe could see that he was a man who was diligent about his clothingand he washed his hands now that she was here she wasnt sure of anything instead of the anxiety shed been feeling earlier when cilla cormack had brought her the news of scotland yards interest in her and her family in falmouth she now felt awkward and shy she told herself it was because thomas lynley seemed to fill the room he was a goodsize man several inches over six feet tall and the result of being in such a confined space with him appeared to be having her ridiculously melting into victorianmaidencaughtinacompromisingsituation it was nothing he was doing particularly it was rather the simple fact of him and the tragic aura that seemed to surround him despite his pleasant demeanour but the fact that she was feeling other than she would have liked to be feeling made daidre impatient both with him and with herself she sat at the foot of the bed before she did so she handed him the note shed found from di hannaford he told her that the inspector had arrived at her cottage shortly after his own arrival that morning i see youre in demand he said ive come for your advice this wasnt altogether true but it was a good place to begin she decided what do you recommend he went to the head of the bed and sat about this he gestured with the card i recommend that you talk to her have you any idea what its about he said after a revealing moment of hesitation that he had not but whatever it is he said i suggest you be completely truthful i think its always best to tell investigators the truth in general i think its best to tell the truth full stop one way or another and if the truth is that i killed santo kerne he hesitated a moment before replying i dont believe that is the truth frankly are you a truthful man yourself thomas i try to be even in the middle of a case especially then when its appropriate sometimes with a suspect its not am i a suspect yes he told her unfortunately you are so that would be why you went to falmouth to ask about me falmouth i didnt go to falmouth for any reason yet someone was there talking to my parents neighbours as things turned out it was apparently someone from new scotland yard who would that be if it wasnt you and what is it you would need to know about me that you couldnt ask me yourself he rose he came to her end of the bed and squatted before her this gave her more proximity to him than she would have liked and she made a move to rise he stopped her just a gentle hand on her arm was enough i wasnt in falmouth daidre he said i swear to you then who i dont know he fixed his eyes on hers they were earnest steady daidre have you something to hide nothing that would interest scotland yard whyre they investigating me they investigate everyone when theres been a murder youre involved because the boy died close by your property andare there other reasons is there something youve not told me that youd like to tell me now i dont mean why are they investigating me daidre tried to sound casual but the intensity of his look made it difficult i mean why scotland yard whats scotland yard doing here at all he rose once again he went to the electric kettle surprisingly she found that she was both relieved and sorry that hed moved away from her as there was a form of safety in his proximity that she hadnt expected to feel he didnt answer at once instead he filled the kettle at the basin and switched it on when he did speak in answer to her next question he still didnt look at her she said thomas why are they here he said bea hannaford is undermanned she should have a murder squad working the case and she doesnt i daresay theyre spread too thin just now across the district and the regional constabulary made a request to the met for someone to assist is that usual to have the met involved no its not but it happens why would they be asking questions about me and why in falmouth silence as he messed about with a bag of pg tips and a cup he was frowning a car door slammed outside and then another a happy shout went up as fellow drinkers greeted each other he had finally turned back to her when he made his reply he said as i said in a murder investigation everyone is looked into daidre you and i went to pengelly cove on a similar mission about ben kerne but that doesnt make sense i grew up in falmouth yes indeed but why ask someone to go there and not to bristol where my life is now perhaps theyve someone else in bristol lynley said is this important somehow of course its important what a ridiculous question how would you feel knowing the police were digging into your background for no apparent reason save the fact that a boy fell from a cliff nearby your cottage if i had nothing to hide i dont imagine id care one way or the other so weve come full circle have you something to hide something you wish the police not to know about you perhaps about your life in falmouth about who you are or what you do what could i possibly have to hide he gazed at her steadily before finally saying how could i have the answer to that she felt all on the wrong foot with him now shed come to speak to him if not in high dudgeon then at least believing that she was in a position of strength the injured party but now she felt as if the tables had been turned it was as if shed tossed the dice a bit too wildly and hed ever so deftly scooped them up is there something more you want to tell me he asked her again she said the only thing she could not at all chapter twentythree bea had a new chock stone on her desk when sergeant havers entered the incident room on the following morning shed got its stiff plastic sheathing off by using the blade of a new and consequently highly sharp xacto knife shed had to be careful about it but the operation hadnt taken either skill or much effort she was in the process of comparing the unsheathed chock stone to the array of cutting tools she also had on her desk havers said to her whatre you on to then the ds had obviously made a stop at casvelyn of cornwall on her way to the station bea could smell the pasties from across the room and she didnt need to look for it to know that sergeant havers had a bag of them somewhere on her person second breakfast she asked the sergeant i skipped the first havers replied just a cup of coffee and a glass of juice i reckoned i owed myself a dip into the more substantial food groups she carried her capacious shoulder bag and from this she brought forth the incriminating cornish delicacy well wrapped but nonetheless emitting its telltale aroma a few of those and youll blow up like a balloon bea told her go easy on them will do but i find it essential to sample the local cuisine wherever i am lucky for you its not goats head then havers hooted which bea took as her version of a laugh also felt the need to give a few words of encouragement to our madlyn angarrack havers said you know the sort of thing dont worry lass buck up tuttut tallyho and all that keep your pecker pecking and itll all come out in the wash at the end of the day i found im a veritable fountain of clichés that was good of you im sure she appreciated it bea selected one of the heavier bolt cutters and applied it forcefully to the chock stones cable nothing but pain shooting up her arm that ones a real nonstarter she said right well she wasnt overly friendly but she did accept a wee pat on the shoulder which was easy enough to give as she was loading up the front window at the time hmm and how did miss angarrack take your fond caress she didnt debark from the tuna boat yesterday ill give her that she knew i was up to something were you bea suddenly took more notice of havers the ds was smiling wickedly she was also removing a paper napkin carefully from her shoulder bag she brought it to beas desk and laid it gently down cant use it in court of course she said but there it is all the same for a comparison if youve the mind for it not a regular dna comparison cause theres no skin attached but one of those others mitochondrial i expect we can use it for that if we need to it bea saw as she unfolded the napkin was a single hair quite dark with a slight curl to it she looked up at havers you wily thing from her shoulder i take it youd think theyd have them wear caps or hairnets or something if theyre going to be around food wouldnt you havers shuddered dramatically and took an enormous bite of the pasty i reckoned i needed to do my bit for hygiene in casvelyn and anyway i thought you might like to have it no one has ever brought me such a thoughtful gift bea told her i may be falling in love with you sergeant please guv havers said holding up her hand youll have to get in the queue bea knew that as havers had said the hair was useless in building a crown case against madlyn angarrack considering how the sergeant had got her hands on it they could do nothing with it save assure themselves through comparison that the hair theyd already found caught up in santo kernes equipment was one belonging to his former girlfriend but it was something a shot in the arm that they needed bea placed it in an envelope and labeled it carefully for duke clarence washoe to peruse in chepstow im reckoning its all to do with sex and vengeance bea said when the hair was taken care of havers pulled over a chair and joined her munching the pasty with evident appreciation she shoved a wad of it to one side of her mouth and said sex and vengeance howve you got it playing out i was off and on thinking about it all night and i kept coming back to the initial betrayal santo kerne taking up with dr trahair for which madlyn either seeks vengeance herself with thisbea held up the chock stone in one hand and a bolt cutter in the otherand this or one of the men does it for her after shes supplied him with two of the chock stones which shes nicked out of the boot of santos car shes already done the business on the sling that was easy but the chock stones require rather more strength than she has so she needs a helper she would have known where santo was keeping his equipment all she needed was someone willing to be her assistant that would be someone with a bone to pick with santo anyway or someone hoping to get himself into madlyns good graces by helping her out sounds like that bloke will mendick to me santo treats her badly and will wants to sort him out for her sake will also wants into madlyns knickers thats how i see it bea set the chock stone down have you seen your superintendent lynley this morning by the way hes not my yes yes weve already been through it he says the same thing about you does he havers chewed thoughtfully not sure how i feel about that mull it over later as for now hes off to exeter second half of whatever he was up to yesterday he said but bea narrowed her eyes but havers looked regretful about having to mention the next bit dr trahair came to see him this would be yesterday late afternoon and you didnt bring her i didnt know guv i didnt see her and since i havent yet seen her anyway i wouldnt know her if she flew in front of my car on a broomstick he didnt tell me until this morning did you see him at dinner last night havers looked unhappy before she said yeah i spose i did and he said nothing to you then about her visit that would be the situation but hes got a lot on his mind he might not have thought about telling me dont be absurd barbara he damn well knew we want to talk to her he should have told you he should have phoned me he should have done almost anything but what he did this man is walking on very thin ice havers nodded thats why im telling you i mean not because i know hes on thin ice with you but because i know its important i mean its important not because he didnt tell you but becausenot that she came to see him thats not the important bit what i mean is that its important that shes resurfaced and i thought all right all right jesus in a teaspoon stop i see i cant expect you to grass his mighty lordship no matter the situation so im going to have to find someone willing to grass you and its not like weve the manpower for that is it sergeant what god damn it this last she said to sergeant collins whod come to the door of the incident room he was manning the phones below for what little good it was doing while the rest of the team continued with actions shed assigned them earlier most of which had them going over old ground dr trahair is here to see you guv sergeant collins told her she said you wanted her to come by the station bea pushed her chair back and said well thank god lets hope were about to get someplace an unanticipated hour of research in exeter provided lynley with the name of the property management company that he discovered was no longer owned by jonathan parsons father of the long ago cavedrowning victim in pengelly cove previously called parsons larson and waterfield it was now r larson estate management ltd and it was located not far from the medieval cathedral in an area that looked desirable for doing business its director turned out to be a questionably tanned greybearded individual somewhere in his sixties he appeared to favour jeans exceptionally good dentistry and blindingly white dress shirts worn without a necktie r lynley discovered stood for the unusual nonbritish name of rocco larsons motherlong gone to her eternal rewardhad possessed a devotion to the more obscure catholic saints the man explained it was an equal rights sort of thing his sister was called perpetua personally he didnt use rocco he used rock which lynley was free to call him lynley thanked the man said all things being equal hed prefer mr larson and showed him his scotland yard identification at which point larson seemed happy enough that lynley had decided on maintaining a sense of formality between them larson said ah i suppose you dont have a property you wish to let out youd suppose correctly lynley told him and he asked if larson had a few minutes to spare him id like to talk to you about jonathan parsons he said i understand you were once his partner larson was perfectly willing to have a chat about poor jon as he called him and he ushered lynley into his office this was spare and masculine leather and metal with pictures of the family in stark black frames the much younger blonde wife two children turned out in neat school uniforms the horse the dog the cat and the duck they all looked a bit too professionally polished lynley wondered if they were real or the sort of pictures one finds in frames for sale in shops larson didnt wait to be interrogated he launched into his story and he needed very little encouragement to carry on with it he had been partners with jonathan parsons and a bloke called henry waterfield now deceased both of them were older than larson by ten years or so and because of this hed started out as a junior manager in the firm but he was a gogetter if he did say so himself and in no time hed purchased rights to a full partnership from that point on it was the three of them until waterfields death at which point it was parsons and larson which was a bit of a tongue twister so they hung on to the original name everything went smoothly until the parsons boy died larson told him at that point things began to fall apart poor jon wasnt able to hold up his end and who can blame him he began to spend more and more of his time over in pengelly cove thats where the accidentthe death yes lynley said i know he apparently believed he knew whod left his son in the sea cave right but he couldnt get the police to move on the killer no evidence they told him no evidence no witness and no one talking no matter how much pressure was applied whereverthere was literally nothing they could do so he hired his own team and when they failed he hired another and when they failed he hired another and then another he finally moved to the cove permanently larson considered a photo on the wallan aerial view of exeteras if this would take him back in time i think it must have been two years after jamies death perhaps three he said he wanted to be there to remind people that the murderhe always called it a murder no matter whathad gone unpunished he accused the police of botching the matter from start to finish he wasobsessed frankly but i cant fault him for that i didnt then and i dont now still he wasnt bringing in any money to the business and while i could have carried him for a time he began towell he called it borrowing he was maintaining a house and a familythere are three other children all of them daughtershere in exeter he was maintaining a house in pengelly cove and he was orchestrating a series of investigations with people wanting to be paid for their time and effort things got too much for him he needed money and he took it behind his desk larson steepled the fingers of his hands i felt awful he said but my choices were clear to let jon run us into the ground or to call him on what he was doing i chose its not pretty but i didnt see i had a choice embezzlement larson held up a hand i couldnt go that far couldnt and wouldnt not after what had happened to the poor sod but i told him hed have to hand over the business as it was the only way i could see to save it he wasnt going to stop stop trying to get the killer brought to justice the police thought it was a prank gone very bad not a premeditated murder not a murder at all it certainly could have been but jon didnt see it that way he adored that boy he was devoted enough to all the children but he was particularly mad about jamie he was the sort of dad we all want to be and we all wish we had if you know what i mean they deepseafished they skied they surfed they backpacked in asia when jon said the boys name he just blazed with pride ive heard the boy was lynley sought a word ive heard he was rather difficult for the local children in pengelly cove larson drew his eyebrows together they were thin brows rather womanly lynley wondered if the man had them waxed i dont know about that he was essentially a good kid oh perhaps he was a bit full of himself considering the family probably had a good deal more money than the village childrens families and considering the preferential treatment he got from his dad but what boy that age isnt full of himself anyway larson went on to complete the story one that took a turn that was sad but not unusual given what lynley knew about families who faced the anguish of a childs untimely death not long after parsons lost the business his wife divorced him she returned to university as a mature student completed her education and ultimately became head teacher at the local comprehensive larson thought shed remarried as well somewhere along the line but he wasnt certain someone at the comprehensive would likely be able to tell him what became of jonathan parsons lynley asked he was still in pengelly cove as far as larson knew and the daughters lynley asked larson hadnt a clue daidre had spent part of her early morning thinking about allegiance she knew that some people firmly believed in the principle of every man for himself her problem had always been an inability to adhere to that principle she considered the idea of what she owed other people versus what she owed herself she thought about duty but she also thought about vengeance she considered the ways in which getting even was merely a questionable euphemism for learning nothing she tried to decide whether there actually were life lessons to be learned or whether life was all a mindless tumble through the years without rhyme or reason she ultimately faced the truth that she had no answer to any of the larger philosophical questions about life so she decided to take the action that was directly in front of her and she went into casvelyn to fulfill di hannafords request for a conversation the inspector fetched her personally from reception hannaford was accompanied by another woman whom daidre recognised as the illdressed driver of the mini who had spoken to thomas lynley in the car park of the salthouse inn hannaford introduced her as ds barbara havers she added new scotland yard to this and daidre felt a chill come over her she had no time to speculate on what this meant however for after a marginally hostile come with us then from hannaford she was being led into the bowels of the station a brief journey of some fifteen paces that took them to what appeared to be the sole interview room it was clear that not a lot of interviewing went on in casvelyn past a wall of what seemed to be boxes of toilet tissue and kitchen towels a disabled card table of three straight legs and one with a bulbous elbow held a small cassette recorder that looked dusty enough to seed vegetables on there were no chairs to speak of just a threestep ladder although an angry shout from hannaford in the direction of the stairway obviated the necessity of their having to use the boxes of tissue and towels for that purpose sergeant collinsas he was calledcame on the run he quickly provided them with uncomfortable plastic chairs batteries for the tape player and a cassette this turned out to be an ancient lulus greatest hitsvintage but obviously it was going to have to do daidre wanted to ask the purpose of making a recording of their conversation but she knew the question would be taken as disingenuous so she sat and waited for what would happen next which was ds haverss digging a small spiral notebook from the pocket of her donkey jacket which for some reason she had not removed despite the uncomfortable tropical temperature in the building di hannaford asked daidre if she wanted anything before they began coffee tea juice water daidre demurred she was fine she replied and then found herself wondering about that response what she wasnt at all was fine she was uneasy in the head weak in the palms and determined not to appear that way there seemed only one manner in which to do that by taking the offensive she said you left me this note and produced the dis card with its scrawled message on the back what is it you want to talk to me about id think that was rather obvious hannaford said as were in the middle of a murder enquiry actually its not obvious at all then it will be soon enough my dear hannaford was deft about putting the cassette into the tape player although she looked as if she had her doubts on the matter of its properly working she punched a button gazed at the turning wheel of the cassette and recited the date the time and the individuals present then she said to daidre tell us about santo kerne dr trahair what about him whatever you know this was all routine the first few moves in the catandmouse of an interrogation daidre answered as simply as she could i know that he died in a fall from the north cliff at polcare cove hannaford didnt look pleased with the response how good of you to make that clear to us you knew who he was when you saw him didnt you she made it a statement not a question so our first interaction was based on a lie yes ds havers wrote with a pencil daidre saw it scritched against the notebook paper and the soundnormally innocuouswas fingernails on a blackboard in this situation daidre said i hadnt got a good look at him there wasnt time but you checked for vital signs didnt you you were first on the scene how could you check for signs of life without looking at him one doesnt need to look at the victims face to check for signs of life inspector thats a coy reply how realistic is it to check for vital signs without looking at someone as the first person on the scene and even in the fading daylight i was second on the scene daidre interrupted thomas lynley was first but you wanted to see the body you asked to see the body you insisted you didnt take superintendent lynleys word for it that the boy was dead i didnt know he was superintendent lynley daidre told her i arrived at the cottage and found him inside he might have been a housebreaker for all i knew he was a total stranger completely unkempt as you saw for yourself looking rather wild and claiming there was a body in the cove and he needed to be taken somewhere to make a phone call about it it hardly made sense to me to agree to drive him anywhere without checking first to make sure he was telling me the truth or checking yourself to discover who the boy was did you think it might be santo i had no idea who it was going to be how would i have i wanted to see if i could help in some way in what way if he was injured youre a veterinarian dr trahair youre not an emergency physician how did you expect to help him injuries are injuries bones are bones if i could help and when you saw him you knew who he was you were quite familiar with the boy werent you i knew who santo kerne was if thats what you mean this isnt a heavily populated area most people know each other eventually if only by sight but i expect you knew him a little bit more intimately than by sight then youd expect incorrectly thats not whats been reported dr trahair indeed i have to tell you thats not whats been witnessed daidre swallowed she realised that ds havers had ceased writing and she wasnt sure when that had occurred this told her shed been less aware than she needed to be and she wanted to get back on the footing shed begun with she said to ds havers past the heavy pounding of her own heart new scotland yard are you the only officer from london here to work on this case aside from superintendent lynley i mean hannaford said dr trahair thats nothing to do with new scotland yard the met but you must be from thewhat would they call it the crime side the murder side cid or do they call it something else these days havers made no reply she did however give a glance to hannaford i expect you know thomas lynley as well then if hes from new scotland yard and youre from new scotland yard and you both work in the samethe same field shall i saythen you must be acquainted would i be correct whether sergeant havers and superintendent lynley are acquainted is none of your concern hannaford said weve a witness putting santo kerne at your front door dr trahair weve a witness putting him inside your cottage in times past if youd like to explain how someone you knew only by sight came knocking at your door and gaining admittance to your home wed very much like to listen i expect its you who went to falmouth asking about me daidre said to havers havers looked at her blankly a good poker face but hannaford surprisingly gave away the game she directed her attention suddenly if briefly to havers and there was something of speculation in her look daidre took this for surprise and she drew a logical conclusion from it and i expect thomas lynleyand not di hannafordtold you to do it she stated this flatly she didnt want to dwell on how she felt about the fact and she had no need of a reply because she knew she was right what she did have a need for on the other hand was getting the police out of her life unfortunately there was only one way to do this and it had to do with information naming a name that would take them in a different direction she found that she was willing to do that she turned to hannaford you want aldara pappas she said youll find her at a place called cornish gold its a cider farm finding jonathan parsons former wife ate up another ninety minutes of his time once lynley left rock larsons office he began at the comprehensive where he learned that niamh parsons had long ago become niamh triglia and had also more recently taken her pension shed lived for years not far from the school but whether she was still at that location upon her retirement from educationwho could say that was the limit to what they were able to tell him from there he went to an address he unearthed through the simple means of browsing in the public library as hed suspected the triglias no longer resided in exeter but this was not a dead end showing his identification and questioning a few neighbours turned up their new place of abode like many others before them they had headed for sunnier climes thankfully this did not turn out to be the coast of spain but rather the coast of cornwall which while not atmospherically mediterranean in climate was the best the mainland of england had to offer in conditions that might be deemed temperate by those who were determinedly sanguine the triglias had been among these types they lived in boscastle this meant another long drive but the day was pleasant and the time of year had not yet turned cornwall into an elongated car park with occasional visual diversions he made relatively good time to boscastle and soon enough he was hiking towards a steep lane of cottages which wound up from the ancient fishing harbour an inlet protected by vast cliffs of slate and volcanic lava what went for the high street came first in his climba few shops of unpainted stone that were dedicated to the tourist trade and a few more to meet the needs of the village residentsand after it came old street the location of the triglias home this was nestled not far from an obelisk dedicated to the dead of two world wars it was called lark cottage and it was whitewashed like a santorini hut with thick mounds of heather growing in front and healthylooking primroses planted in window boxes crisp white curtains hung at the windows and green paint glimmered on the front door he crossed a tiny bridge of slate that spanned a deep gutter in front of the building and when he knocked it was only a moment before an apronwearing woman answered her spectacles splattered with what seemed to be grease and her grey hair scraped back from her face and springing up from the crown of her head like a hirsute fountain im doing crab cakes she said seemingly apropos of her general appearance and her more specific harried demeanour sorry but i cant be away from them for more than a moment he said mrs triglia yes yes oh do please be quick i hate to be rude but they absorb dreadfully if you leave them too long thomas lynley new scotland yard as he spoke his full identification he realised that it was the first time hed done so since helens death he blinked at this knowledge and the quick but fleeting pain that it brought him he showed his identification to the woman he said niamh triglia formerly parsons she said yes thats who i am i need to speak with you about your husband jonathan parsons may i come in oh yes of course she stepped back from the door to admit him she led him through a sitting room largely given to bookshelves which were themselves heavily given to paperback books interspersed with family photographs and the occasional seashell interesting stone or piece of driftwood beyond this the kitchen overlooked a small back garden with a patch of lawn neat flower beds bordering it and a leafing tree in its centre here in the kitchen the crab cakes were managing to produce an impressive disorder hot oil splattering onto the cooktop largely characterised the chaos followed by a draining board covered with bowls tins wooden spoons a carton of eggs and a coffee press whose liquid was long since gone and whose remaining grounds looked as if theyd been forgotten ages ago niamh triglia went to the cooker and flipped the crab cakes which produced a new burst of splattering she said the difficulty is managing to get the breadcrumbs to brown without dousing the entire mixture with so much oil that you feel as if youre eating badly done chips do you cook mr it was superintendent though wasnt it yes he said as to the superintendent part as to the cooking its not one of my strengths its my passion she confessed i had so little time to do it properly when i was teaching and once i took my pension i threw myself into it cookery courses at the community centre programmes on the telly that sort of thing problem is the eating bit your efforts dont please you on the contrary they please me far too much she indicated her body which was fairly shrouded by her apron i try to cut the recipes down for one person but maths was never my strong suit and most of the time i make enough for at least four are you alone here then mmm yes she used the corner of the egg turner to lift one of the crab cakes and examine its degree of brownness lovely she murmured from a nearby cupboard she took a plate which she covered with several layers of kitchen towel from the fridge she took a small mixing bowl aioli she said dipping her chin towards the mixture red pepper garlic lemon et cetera getting the balance of tastes just right is the issue with a good aioli that and the olive oil naturally very good evo is essential im sorry evio lynley wondered if this was a style of cooking evo extravirgin olive oil the virginest one can find if there are degrees of virginity in olives to tell the truth ive never been sure what it means when an olive oil is extra virgin are the olives virgins are they harvested by virgins are they pressed by virgins she brought the bowl of aioli to the kitchen table and returned to the cooker where she began carefully depositing the crab cakes onto the kitchen towels that covered the plate she took another set of kitchen towels and laid these on top of the cakes pressing them gently into the concoction to remove as much of the residual oil as she could from the oven then she brought forth three more plates and lynley was able to see what she had meant about failing to reduce her recipes so as to cook for one person only each plate was similarly dressed with kitchen towels and crab cakes it looked as if shed cooked more than a dozen fresh crab isnt essential she told him you can use tinned frankly i find you really cant tell the difference if the crab is going to be used in a cooked dish on the other hand if its going to be eaten in something uncookedsalad a dip for vegetable biscuits or the likeyoure best to go with fresh but you have to make sure its fresh fresh trapped that day i mean she deposited the plates on the table and told him to sit he would she hoped indulge otherwise she feared she herself might eat them all as her neighbours werent as appreciative of her culinary efforts as shed have liked them to be ive no family to cook for any longer she said the girls are scattered to the winds and my husband died last year im sorry to hear that youre very kind he went quickly so it was a terrible shock as hed been perfectly well up till a day before something of an athlete also he complained of a headache that he couldnt get rid of and he died the next morning as he was putting on his socks i heard a noise and went to see what had happened and there he was on the floor aneurysm she lowered her gaze eyebrows drawn together it was difficult not to be able to say goodbye lynley felt the great stillness of memory settling round him perfectly fine in the morning and perfectly dead by the afternoon he cleared his throat roughly yes i expect it is she said well one recovers eventually from these things she shot him a tremulous smile at least thats what one hopes she went to a cupboard and brought out two plates from a drawer she took cutlery she laid the table please do sit superintendent she found him a linen napkin and used her own first to clean off her spectacles without them she had the dazed look of the lifelong sufferer of myopia there she said when shed polished them to her liking i can actually see you properly now my goodness what a handsome man you are youd leave me quite tonguetied if i were your age how old are you by the way thirtyeight well whats a thirtyyear age difference among friends she asked are you married dear my wifeyes yes i am and is your wife very beautiful she is blond like you no shes quite dark then you must be very handsome together francis and ithats my late husbandwere so similar to each other that we were often taken for brother and sister when we were younger you were married to him for a number of years then twentytwo years nearly to the day but id known him before my first marriage ended wed been in primary school together isnt it odd how something as simple as thatbeing in school togethercan forge a bond and make things easier between people if they see each other later in life even if they havent spoken in years there was no period of discomfort between us when we first began to see each other after jon and i divorced she scooped some aioli out of the bowl and handed it to him to do the same she tasted the crab cake and pronounced it doable what do you think of them i think theyre excellent flatterer handsome and wellbred i see is your wife a good cook shes completely appalling she has other strengths then he thought of helen the laughter of her that unrepressed gaiety so much compassion i find she has hundreds of strengths which makes indifferent kitchen skills completely irrelevant theres always takeaway isnt there just she smiled at him and then went on with im avoiding as youve probably guessed has something happened to jon do you know where he is she shook her head i havent spoken to him in years our eldest child jamie ah so you know about jamie and when lynley nodded she continued by saying thoughtfully i suppose we all carry some sort of scars from our childhood for this and that reason and jon had his share his father was a hard man with set ideas about what his boys should do with their lives and hed decided that what they should do was science very stupid to decide your childrens lives for them to my way of thinking but there you have it thats what he did unfortunately neither boy was the least interested in science so they both disappointed him and he never let them forget it jon was determined not to be that kind of father to our children especially to jamie and i have to say he made a success of it we both made a success of parenthood i stayed home with the children because he insisted and i agreed with him and i think that made a difference we were close to the children the children were close to each other although strung along quite a bit in age at any rate we were a very tight and very happy little unit and then your son died and then jamie died she set her knife and fork down and folded her hands in her lap jamie was a lovely boy oh he had his quirkswhat boy his age doesntbut at heart he was lovely lovely and loving and very very good to his little sisters we were all devastated by his death but jon couldnt come to grips with it i thought he would eventually give it time i told myself but when a persons life becomes all about the death of another and about nothing elsei had the girls to think of you see i had myself to think of i couldnt live like that like what it was all he talked about and as far as i could tell it was all he thought about it was as if jamies death had invaded his brain and eaten away everything that wasnt jamies death ive learned he wasnt satisfied with the investigation so he mounted his own he must have mounted half a dozen but it made no difference and each time that it made no difference he went just a bit more mad of course hed lost the business by then and wed gone through our savings and had lost our home and that made things worse for him because he knew he was responsible for it happening but he couldnt get himself to stop i tried to tell him it would make no difference to his grief and his loss to bring someone to justice but he thought it would he was sure it would just the way people think that if the killer of their loved one is put to death thats somehow going to assuage their own desolation but how can it really the death of a killer doesnt bring anyone else back to life and thats what we want and can never have what happened to jonathan when you divorced the first three years or so he phoned me occasionally to give me updates he said of course there never were any viable updates to give me but he needed to believe he was making progress instead of doing what he was really doing which was making it less and less likely that anyone involved in jamies death wouldwould crack i suppose the word is he saw in this an enormous conspiracy involving everyone in pengelly cove with himself the outsider and them the closemouthed community determined to protect its own but you didnt see it that way i didnt know how to see it i wanted to be supportive of jon and i tried to be at first but for me the real point was that jamie was dead wed lost himall of us had lost himand nothing jon could do was going to alter that myi suppose you might call it my focuswas on that one fact and it seemed to merightly or wronglythat the result of what jon was doing was to keep jamies death fresh like a sore that one rubs and causes to bleed instead of allowing it to heal and i believed that healing was what we all needed did you see him again did your girls see him again she shook her head and doesnt that compile tragedy upon tragedy one child died terribly but jon lost all four upon his own choice because he chose the dead over the living to me thats a greater tragedy than the loss of our son some people lynley said quietly have no other way to react to a sudden inexplicable loss i daresay youre right but in jons case i think it was a deliberate choice in making it he was living the way hed always lived which was to put jamie first here let me show you what i mean she rose from the table and wiping her hands down the front of her apron she went into the sitting room lynley could see her walk over to the crowded bookshelves where she extricated a picture from among the large group on display she brought it to the kitchen and handed it over saying sometimes photographs say things that words cant convey lynley saw that shed given him a family portrait in it a version of herself perhaps thirty years younger posed with husband and four winsome children the scene was wintry deep snow with a lodge and a ski lift in the background in the foreground suited up for sport with skis leaning up against their shoulders the family stood happily ready for action niamh with a toddler in her arms and two other laughing daughters hanging on to her and perhaps a yard from them jamie and his father jonathan parsons had his arm affectionately slung round jamies neck and he was pulling his son close to him they both were grinning thats how it was niamh said it didnt seem to matter so very much because after all the girls had me i told myself it was a manman and womanwoman thing and i ought to be pleased that jon and jamie were so close and the girls and i were as thick as thieves but of course when jamie died jon saw himself as having lost it all threequarters of his life was standing right in front of him but he couldnt see that that was his tragedy i didnt want to make it mine lynley looked up from his study of the photo may i keep this for a time ill return it to you of course she seemed surprised by the request keep it whatever for id like to show it to someone ill return it within a few days by post or in person if you prefer ill keep it quite safe take it by all means she said buti havent asked and i ought to have why have you come to talk about jon a boy died north of here just beyond casvelyn in a sea cave like jamie in a fall from a cliff and you think this has something to do with jamies death im not sure lynley looked at the picture again he said where are your daughters now mrs triglia chapter twentyfour bea hannaford didnt like the fact that daidre trahair had managed to take control of the interrogation several times during their interview in beas opinion the veterinarian was too clever by half which made the di even more determined to pin something on the wily wench what they ended up with however was not what bea had expected and hoped to get from her once shed given the piece of potentially useless information about aldara pappas and the cornish gold dr trahair had politely informed them that unless they had something to charge her with shed be off thank you very much the damn woman knew her rights and the fact that shed decided to exercise them at that particular moment was maddening but there was nothing for it but to bid her an extremely lessthanfond farewell upon rising from her chair however the vet had said something that bea had found telling shed directed a question to sergeant havers what was his wife like hes spoken to me about her but hes actually said very little until that moment the scotland yard detective had said nothing during their interview with dr trahair the only sound shed emitted was that which came from her steadily writing pencil at the vets query she rapidly tapped that pencil against her tattered notebook as if considering the ramifications of the question havers finally said evenly she was bloody brilliant it must be a terrible loss for him for a time havers said we thought it might kill him daidre had nodded yes i can see that when i look at him bea had wanted to ask do that often dr trahair but she hadnt shed had enough of the vet and she had larger concerns at the moment beyond what it meantbeyond the obviousthat daidre trahair was curious about thomas lynleys murdered wife one of those concerns was lynley himself after the vet had left them and once bea had sussed out the location of the cider farm she placed a call to lynley as she and havers headed out to her car what the hell had he dug up in exeter she wanted to know and where else were his dubious wanderings taking him he was in boscastle he told her he spun a lengthy tale about death parenthood divorce and the estrangement that can occur between parents and children he ended with ive a photo id like you to have a look at as well as a point of interest or a piece to the puzzle im not quite sure he said she would see him upon his return she told him in the meantime dr trahair had surfaced and backed into a wall had produced a new name for them as well as a new place aldara pappas he repeated thoughtfully a greek cider maker were seeing everything arent we bea said i fully expect dancing bears next she rang off as she and havers reached her car a football three newspapers a rain jacket one doggie chew toy and a bouquet of wrappers from energy bars having been removed from the passenger seat and tossed into the back they were on their way cornish gold was near the village of brandis corner a bit of a drive from casvelyn they reached it by means of secondary and tertiary roads that became progressively narrower in the way of all cornish thoroughfares they also became progressively less passable ultimately the farm presented itself by means of a large sign painted with red letters on a field of brown heavily laden apple trees serving as the signs decoration and an arrow indicating entrance for anyone too limited to understand what was meant by the two strips of stony ground divided by a mustache of grass and weeds which veered off to the right they jolted over this for some two hundred yards finally coming to a surprisingly and decently paved car park optimistically part of it was set aside for tour coaches while the rest was given to bays for cars more than a dozen were scattered along a splitrail fence seven more stood in the farthest corner bea pulled into a space that was near a large timber barn which opened into the car park within two tractorshardly in use considering their pristine conditionwere serving as perches for three stately looking peacocks their sumptuous tail feathers cascading in a colourful effluence across the tops of cabs and down the sides of engines beyond the barn another structurethis one combining both granite and timberdisplayed huge oaken barrels presumably aging the farms product rising behind this building the apple orchard grew and it climbed the slope of a hill row after row of trees pruned to grow like inverted pyramids a proud display of delicate blossoms a furrowed lane bisected the orchard in the distance some sort of tour seemed to be bumping along it an open wagon pulled by a plodding draft horse across the lane a gate gave entrance into the attractions of the cider farm these comprised a gift shop and café along with yet another gate that appeared to lead to the ciderproduction area the perusal of which demanded a ticket or police identification as things turned out bea showed hers to a young woman behind the till in the gift shop and asked to speak to aldara pappas on a matter of some urgency the girls silver lip ring quivered as she directed bea to the inner workings of the farm she said watching over the mill by which bea took it that the woman they were looking for could be found atperhaps a grinding mill what did one do with apples anyway and was this the time of year to be doing it the answers turned out to be sorting washing chopping slicing pressing and no the mill in question was a piece of machineryconstructed of steel and painted bright blueattached to an enormous wooden bin by means of a trough the machinery of the mill itself consisted of this trough a barrellike bath a water source a rather sinisterlooking press not dissimilar to an enormous vise a wide pipe and a mysterious chamber at the top of this pipe which at the moment was open and being seen to by two individuals one was a man wielding various tools against the machinery that appeared to operate a series of very sharp blades the other was a woman who seemed to be monitoring his every move he was wearing a knitted cap that came down to his eyebrows as well as greasestained jeans and a blue flannel shirt she was garbed in jeans boots and a thick but cozylooking chenille sweater she was saying have a care rod i dont want you bleeding all over my blades to which he replied no worries luv i been looking after clobber lots more difficult n this lot since you was in nappies aldara pappas bea said the woman turned she was quite exotic for this part of the world not exactly pretty but striking with large dark eyes hair that was thick and shiny and black and dramatic red lipstick emphasising a sensual mouth the rest of her was sensual as well curves in all the right places as bea knew her former husband might have said she looked to be somewhere in her forties if the fine lines round her eyes were anything to go by the woman said yes and gave one of those womanevaluatingthecompetition sort of looks both to bea and to ds havers she seemed to linger particularly on the sergeants hair the colour of this was sandy the style not so much a style as an eloquent statement about impatience hacked over the bathroom sink seemed to be the best description what can i do for you aldara pappass tone suggested the task was hopeless a bit of conversation will do bea showed her identification she nodded to havers to show hers as well the sergeant didnt look happy about doing so since this required her to conduct an archaeological excavation through her shoulder bag seeking the leather lump that went for her wallet new scotland yard havers told aldara pappas bea watched for a reaction the womans face was still although rod gave an appreciative whistle what you get up to now luv he asked aldara you been poisoning the customers again aldara smiled faintly and told him to carry on ill be at the house if you need me she said she told bea and havers to follow her and she took them through the cobbled courtyard of which the mill formed one edge the other edges consisted of a jam kitchen a cider museum and an empty stall presumably for the draft horse in the middle of the yard a pen housed a pig the approximate size of a volkswagen beetle he snorted suspiciously and charged the fence i could do with less drama stamos aldara told the animal understanding or not he retreated to a pile of what looked like rotting vegetation he stuck his snout into this and flipped a portion of it into the air clever boy aldara said do eat up he was an orchard pig she told them as she ducked through an arched gate that was partially concealed by a heavy vine to the far side of the jam kitchen private was fixed onto a sign that swung from the gates handle his job used to be to eat the unusable apples after the harvest let him loose in the orchard and stand aside now hes supposed to add an air of authenticity to the place for visitors the problem is that he wishes more to attack them than to fascinate them now what can i do for you had they thought aldara pappas meant to make them welcome by leading them towards her house and offering them a nice steaming cuppa they were soon corrected in that notion the house was a farm cottage with a vegetable garden in front of it odoriferous piles of manure sitting at the end of raised beds neatly defined by wooden rails at one side of the garden was a small stone shed she took them to this and dislodged a shovel and a rake from its interior along with a pair of gloves she brought a head scarf from the pocket of her jeans and used it to cover and hold back her hair in the fashion of a peasant woman or for that matter certain members of the royal family thus ready for labour she began to shovel the manure and the compost into the vegetable beds nothing had been planted there yet she said ill continue with my chores while we talk if you dont mind how might i help you we came to talk about santo kerne bea informed her she jerked her head at havers to indicate that the sergeants usual brand of ostentatious note taking was to begin havers obliged she was watching aldara steadily and bea liked the fact that havers didnt seem the least bit cowed by anotherand decidedly more attractivewoman aldara said santo kerne what about him wed like to talk to you about your relationship with him my relationship with him what about it i hope this isnt going to be your style of answering bea said my style of answering what do you mean the little miss echo bit miss pappas or is it missus aldara will do aldara then if it is your stylethe echoing bitwere likely to be with you most of the day and something tells me youd not appreciate that wed be happy enough to oblige however im not sure i understand your meaning the gaff s been blown sergeant havers told her her tone was impatient the chickens flown the coop the orchard pigs in the laundry whatever works what the sergeant means bea added is that your relationship with santo kerne has come to light aldara thats why were here to sort through it you were bonking him till he was blue in the face sergeant havers put in not to put too fine a point on it bea added aldara thrust her shovel into the pile of manure and hefted a load of it onto one of the beds she looked as if she would have preferred hefting it at havers this is your surmise she pointed out this is what we were told by someone who knows bea said she evidently was the one to wash the sheets when you didnt get round to it now since you had to meet at polcare cottage may we assume theres a middleaged mr pappas somewhere who wouldnt be too pleased to know his wife was having it off with an eighteenyearold boy aldara went for another shovelful of manure she was working rapidly but barely took a deep breath and she didnt come close to breaking a sweat you may not assume ive been divorced for years inspector theres a mr pappas but hes in st ives and we see virtually nothing of each other we quite like it that way have you children here then a daughter santos age perhaps or an adolescent son youd prefer didnt see his mummy dropping her knickers for another teenager aldaras jaw hardened bea wondered which of her comments had hit the mark i met santo for sex in polcare cottage for one reason only because both of us preferred it that way aldara said it was a private matter and thats what each of us wanted privacy or secrecy both why embarrassed to be doing a kid hardly aldara drove her shovel into the earth and just as bea thought she intended to take a rest she went for the rake she climbed into the nearest planting bed and began energetically working the manure into the soil she said i have no embarrassment about sex sex is what it is inspector sex and we both wanted sex santo and i with each other as it happens but as this is something difficult for some people to understandbecause of his age and my ownwe sought a private place to she appeared to be looking for a euphemism which seemed completely out of character in the woman to service each other havers offered she managed to look bored an ivehearditallbeforenow expression on her face to be together aldara said firmly for an hour for two or three early on when we were new together andstill discovering i would call it discovering what bea said what pleased the other it is a process of discovery isnt it inspector discovery leading to pleasure or did you not know sex is about giving ones partner pleasure bea let that one pass so this wasnt a loveandheartbreak situation for you aldara cast her a look it spoke of both incredulity and long experience only a fool equates sex with love and im not a fool was he did he love me was this loveandheartbreak as you put it for him i have no idea we didnt speak of that when it comes to it we spoke very little at all after the initial arrangement as ive said this was about sex the physical only santo knew that initial arrangement bea asked are you echoing me inspector aldara smiled but she directed the expression to the earth that she was busily raking briefly bea understood the impulse investigators often had to smack a suspect she said why dont you explain this initial arrangement to us aldara and while youre doing it perhaps you can touch upon your apparent lack of feeling regarding the murder of your lover which as you might surmise certainly looks as if it can be linked rather more directly to you than you otherwise might appreciate i had nothing to do with santo kernes death i regret it of course and if im not prostrate with grief over it that would be because it wasnt a loveandheartbreak situation for you either bea said thats certainly clear as swiss air so what was it what was it exactly please ive told you it was an arrangement he and i had for sex did you know he was getting it elsewhere at the same time he was getting it fromor doing it to or whatever the hell it wasto you of course i knew it aldara sounded placid that was part of it it what the arrangement what was it a threesome hardly part of it was the secrecy of it all the aspect of having an affair the fact that he had someone else i wanted someone with someone else thats how i like it bea saw havers blink as if to clear her vision like alice finding herself down a rabbit hole with a randy bunny when prior experience had led her to expect only the mad hatter the march hare and a cup of tea bea herself didnt feel dissimilar she said so you knew about madlyn angarrack that she was involved with santo kerne yes thats how i met santo in the first place madlyn worked for me here in the jam kitchen santo fetched her at the end of the day several times and i saw him then everyone saw him it was most difficult not to see santo he was a highly attractive boy and madlyns a rather attractive girl she is well of course she would be and so am i if it comes to that an attractive woman i find that attractive people are drawn to each other dont you another glance in the direction of the police made it obvious that aldara pappas didnt consider this question to be one that either of them could answer from personal experience she said we took note of each other santo and i i was at the point of needing someone very like him someone with attachments and i thought he might do as there was a directness to his gaze that spoke of a certain maturity a frame of mind that suggested he and i might speak the same language we exchanged looks smiles it was a form of communication in which likeminded individuals say precisely what needs to be said and nothing more he arrived early one day to fetch madlyn and i took him on a tour of the farm we rode the tractor into the orchards and it was there just like eve beneath the apple tree havers said or were you the snake aldara refused to be drawn out she said this had nothing to do with temptation temptation depends on innuendo and there was no innuendo involved i was forthright with him i said the look of him appealed to me and i had been thinking what it would be like to have him in bed how pleasant it might be for us both if he was interested i told him that if he wanted more than only his little girlfriend as a sexual partner he was to phone me at no time did i suggest he end his relationship with her that would actually have been the last thing i wanted as it might have made him rather too fond of me it might have led to expectations of there being something more than was possible between us on his part these expectations that is on mine there were none i can see it might well have put you in a ludicrous light had he expected more and had you been forced to give it to him in order to keep him bea noted a woman your age going publicas it werewith a teenage boy trotting down the aisle in church on sunday morning nodding to your neighbours and all of them thinking howwell how lacking in something you must be to have to settle for an eighteenyearold lover aldara moved to another pile of manure she fetched the shovel and began to repeat the process shed followed for the first vegetable bed the earth within became rich and dark whatever she intended to plant within the borders of the bed it was going to flourish she said first of all inspector i dont concern myself with what other people think as what other people think about meor anyone else or any thing for that matterdoes not rob me of a single eyelash this was a private matter between santo and me i kept it private so did he not exactly havers noted madlyn found out that was unfortunate he wasnt careful enough and she followed him there was one of those dreadful scenes between themthe accosting the accusing the denial the admission the explaining the pleadingand she ended their involvement on the spot that put me in the very last position i wished to be in as santos sole lover did she know you were the woman inside the cottage when she turned up there of course she knew there was such a scene between them that i thought she might do violence i had to emerge from the bedroom and do something about it which was to separate them to keep her from destroying the cottage or attacking him she leaned on her shovel and looked north in the direction of the orchards as if reliving her initial proposal to santo kerne and what that proposal had ultimately brought about she said as if shed only just thought of the matter it was not supposed to be such a drama when it became one i had to rethink my own involvement with santo did you give him the old heaveho as well havers asked not wanting big drama in your life i intended to but i doubt he would have liked that much havers said what bloke would finding himself out of two dolly birds in one fell swoop instead of just one being reduced to whatwanking in the showerwhen before he was getting it on all sides ill wager he wouldve fought you on that one maybe even told you he could make things a bit tough on you a bit embarrassing if you tried to break it off indeed she said without a pause in her labours had we got to that point he might have done and said all of that as it was we never got to that point i did have to rethink my involvement with him and i decided that we could continue as long as he understood the rules which were more caution and a very clear understanding about the present and the future meaning the obvious about the present i wasnt going to change my ways to suit him about the future there wasnt one and that was perfectly fine with him santo lived largely for the moment what was second of all bea asked aldara looked at her blankly sorry you said first of all before you launched into your lack of concern over what other people think im wondering what second of all consisted of ah it consisted of my other lover aldara said as i said earlier the secrecy of an affair with santo appealed to me the affair charged things and i like to have them charged actually i need to have them charged when they arent she shrugged for me the fire simply goes out the brain as perhaps youve discovered for yourself habituates to anything over time when the brain habituates to a lover as the brain will do the lover becomes less a lover and more she seemed to consider an appropriate term and she chose more an inconvenience when that occurs one disposes of him or one thinks of a way to bring the fire back to the sex i see santo kerne was doing duty as the fire bea said my other lover was a very good man and i quite enjoyed him in all respects his company in and out of bed was good and i didnt wish to lose it but for me to continue to be with himto please him sexually and to be pleased by him in turni needed a second lover a secret lover santo was that do all these lovers of yours know about each other havers asked they would hardly be secret if they did aldara moved from the shovel to the rake her boots bea saw were becoming encrusted with manure they looked expensive and would bear the scent of animal faeces for months she wondered the other woman didnt care about that santo knew naturally he had to know in order to understand thei suppose i could call them the rules but the otherno it was essential that the other never know because he wouldnt have liked it oh that of course but more than that because secrecy is the key to excitement and excitement is the key to fire i notice youve been referring to the other bloke in the past tense was not is why would that be here aldara hesitated as if she realised what her answer was going to connote to the police bea said may we assume the past is just that finito havers added in case aldara didnt get the meaning he and i are having a coolingoff period aldara said i suppose thats what youd call it and this began when some weeks ago instigated by whom aldara didnt reply which was answer enough well need his name bea said the greek woman appeared quite surprised by the request which seemed a largely disingenuous response as far as bea was concerned why he didnthe doesnt know she hesitated she was thinking it over considering all the signs bea concluded yes darling bea said to her indeed its very likely he does she told her about santos conversation with tammy penrule about tammys advice to him about being honest as it turns out santo apparently wasnt asking about whether he should tell madlyn because madlyn found out on her own so it stands to reason he was asking about telling someone else i expect its your gentleman which as you can well imagine puts him rather into the hot seat no he wouldnt have but she hesitated once again the fact that she was tossing possibilities round inside her attractive head was obvious her eyes grew cloudy they seemed to communicate all the ways in which she knew he very well could have im no expert on the subject but i expect most men dont care much for sharing their women bea pointed out its a cave dweller sort of thing havers added my hearth my fire my woolly mammoth my woman me tarzan you jane bea added so santo goes to him and tells him the truth were both having aldara pappas mate and thats how she wants it i just thought you were owed an explanation of where she is when she isnt with you absurd why would santo logically he probably wouldnt have wanted another scene like the scene with madlyn especially if it involved a man who might beat the hell out of him in a confrontation and he was beaten by someone havers pointed out speaking helpfully to bea at least he was well punched out indeed he was bea returned to havers and then went on to aldara with which as you can perhaps imagine does make things look iffy for the other bloke aldara dismissed this no santo would have informed me that was the nature of our relationship he wouldnt have spoken to max she stopped herself max bea looked at havers did you note that sergeant got it in concrete havers said and his surname bea asked aldara pleasantly santo had no reason to tell anyone anything he knew if he did i would end our arrangement which naturally would have devastated him bea noted sardonically as it would have done to any man right but perhaps the whole of santo was more than the sum of the parts you saw that would be the dangly bits havers muttered aldara shot her a look bea said perhaps santo actually felt guilty about what you two were up to or perhaps after the scene with madlyn he wanted more off you than you were giving and he reckoned this was the way to get it i dont know although id like to find out and the way to find out is by talking to your other lover former cooling or otherwise so were at the end point here you can give us his surname or we can talk to your employees and get it from them because if this other bloke wasnt your secret lover like santo was it stands to reason he didnt have to come to you under cover of darkness and you didnt have to slither off to meet him in someones wheelie bin so someone here is going to know who he is and that someone is likely to give us his surname aldara thought about this for a moment from out in the courtyard a whir of machinery started suggesting that rod was having success in his efforts with the mill aldara said abruptly max priestley thank you and where might we find mr priestley he owns the watchman but bea said to havers the town rag hes local then if you think he had anything to do with santos death youre wrong he didnt and he wouldnt well let him tell us that himself you can of course but youre being foolish youre wasting your time if max had knownif santo had told him despite our agreementi would have known about it i would have sensed it i can tell this sort of thing with men thisthis internal disturbance they have any woman can tell if shes attuned bea observed her steadily before responding interesting she thought theyd somehow touched on a tender spot in aldara a psychic bruise that the woman herself had not expected to be bothered by there was a tinge of desperation to her words worry about max bea wondered worry about herself she said to aldara were you in love with this one unexpected for you i wager i didnt say and you do think santo told him dont you becausei believe santo informed you he was going to tell him which itself suggests that i did something to stop santo before he could dont be absurd i didnt and max didnt harm him neither did anyone i know of course take that down sergeant no one she knows and all the relevant et ceteras you can manage to wring from that havers nodded got them in bronze this time bea said to aldara so now that were down to it let me ask you this whos next on the pitch what the excitementandsecrecyprovoking pitch if you were cooling off with max but still bonking santo you needed someone else yes or youd have had only oneonly santoand that wouldnt do so who else have you got when did he climb onboard and can we assume that he too was supposed to know nothing about santo aldara drove her shovel into the earth she did it easily without anger or dismay she said i believe this conversation is at an end inspector hannaford ah so you did get someone onboard prior to santos death someone closer to your age ill wager you seem the sort who learns quickly and i expect santo and madlyn gave you a very good lesson about what it means to take up with a teenager no matter how good he is in bed what you expect does not interest me aldara said right bea said as it doesnt rob you of a single eyelash she said to havers i think we have what we need sergeant and then to aldara save for your fingerprints madam and someone will stop by today to rob you of those chapter twentyfive they got caught behind a lumbering tour coach which made their trip from the cider farm back to casvelyn longer than bea had expected it would be at another time she not only would have been impatient leaning on the horn in an aggressive display of bad manners she also likely would have been foolhardy little prompting would have urged her to make the attempt to overtake the coach on the narrow lane as it was the delay gave her time to think and what she thought about was the unconventional lifestyle of the woman theyd just interviewed she did more than wonder how that lifestyle related to the case in hand however she marveled at it altogether she also discovered she wasnt alone in her marveling ds havers brought the subject up shes a piece of work havers said ill give her that the sergeant bea saw was itching for a cigarette after their talk with aldara pappas shed taken her packet of players from her shoulder bag and shed been rolling a fag between her thumb and her fingers as if hoping to absorb the nicotine epidermally she seemed to know better than to light it though i rather admire her bea admitted truth to tell id bloody love to be like that would you youre a deep one guv got the thing for an eighteenyearold youre keeping hidden its the whole bonding issue bea replied its how shes managed to avoid it she frowned at the coach ahead of them at the black belch of its exhaust emission she braked to put some distance between her land rover and the other vehicle she doesnt seem to be bothered by bonding she doesnt seem to bond at all to her lovers you mean isnt that the very devil of being a woman you attach yourself to a man you form what you think is a bond with him and thenwham he does something to show you that despite the longings stirrings and absurdly romantic beliefs of your sweet little faithful heart he isnt the least bonded to you personal experience havers asked shrewdly and bea felt the other woman studying her of a sort bea said what sort would that be the sort that ends in divorce when an unplanned pregnancy disrupts ones husbands life plans although ive always found that oxymoronic what unplanned pregnancy no life plans what about you sergeant i stay away from it all unplanned pregnancies life plans bonding the whole flipping package the more i see the more i think a womans better off having a deep and loving relationship with a vibrator and possibly a cat as well but only possibly its always nice to have something living to come home to although an aspidistra would probably do in a pinch theres wisdom in that bea acknowledged it certainly keeps one from the entire malefemale dance of misunderstanding and destruction doesnt it but i do think it all comes down to bonding in the end this problem we seem to have with men women bond and men dont its to do with biology and wed probably all be better off if we could simply cope with living in herds or prides or whatever one male of the species sniffing up a dozen females with the females accepting this as the course of life they reproduce while hewhatfetches home the dead whatever for breakfast theyre a sisterhood hes window dressing he services them but they bond to each other its a thought havers said isnt it just the tour coach signaled to turn which finally freed the road ahead bea increased her speed well aldara seems to have taken care of the manwoman problem no bonding for that girl and just in case bonding seems likely lets bring in another man maybe three or four the herd in reverse youve got to admire her they dwelt on this silently for the rest of the trip which took them to princes street and the offices of the watchman there they held a brief conversation with a receptionist cum secretary called janna who said of beas hair brilliant thats just the colour my old gran says she wants whats it called which didnt endear her much to the di on the other hand the young woman happily revealed that max priestley was at that moment on st mevan down with someone called lily and if they wanted to speak to him a brief walk round the corner and up the hill would take them to him bea and havers made the walk it took them to the top of the town where a roughly shaped triangle of maram grass and wild carrot was bisected by a road that led from lower casvelyn to an area called the sawsneck where the upper crust from faraway cities had once come to spend their holidays in a line of grand hotels at the turn of the twentieth century these were now seriously down at heel the aforementioned lily turned out to be a golden retriever who was joyfully bounding through the heavytopped grass in delighted pursuit of a tennis ball her master was lobbing this as far as he could across the down by means of a tennis racket onto which the dog cooperatively deposited the ball once shed nosed it out of the copious undergrowth he was garbed in a green waxed jacket and wellingtons with a peaked cap on his head that should have looked ridiculousso achingly imamaninthecountrysidebut somehow instead made him look like a model in country life it was the man himself who managed this he was the sort one had to identify as ruggedly handsome bea could see his appeal for aldara pappas it was windy on the down and max priestley was the only person there he was calling encouragement to his dog who seemed to need little enough of it although she was panting rather more heartily than might have been good for an animal her age and in her condition bea began to hike in priestleys direction havers trudging behind her there were no paths as such on the down just beaten trails through the grass and standing pools of rainwater where depressions in the land marked the ground neither of them had the proper shoes for a walk in the place but sergeant havers hightop trainers were at least preferable to beas street shoes she cursed as her foot sank into a hidden puddle mr priestley she called as soon as they were within hearing distance could we have a word please she began to reach for her identification he seemed to focus on her fiery hair youd be di hannaford i presume he said my reporters been getting all the pertinent details from your sergeant collins he apparently holds you in some considerable respect and this is scotland yard in reference to havers correct on both fronts bea told him ds havers ill need to keep lily moving as we talk were working on her weight getting it off that is putting it on hasnt been a problem as she shows up at mealtimes as regular as a neerdowell brother and ive never been able to resist those eyes im a dog owner myself bea said then you know what i mean he batted the ball some fifty yards and lily went after it with a yelp he said i expect youve come to talk about santo kerne i reckoned someone would be here eventually who gave you my name is that an important detail it could only be aldara or daidre no one else knew according to santo the worlds general ignorance of the arrangement he was very good to point out would prevent damage to my ego should my ego be inclined towards damage kind of him wouldnt you say tammy penrule knew as things turn out bea told him at least she knew part of it did she indeed so santo lied to me unbelievable who would have expected dishonesty from such a sterling bloke did tammy penrule give you my name no not tammy daidre or aldara then and of the two of them id think aldara daidre plays her cards quite close he was so casual about the entire situation that bea found herself taken aback for a moment shed learned over time to have no expectations of how an interview might or might not go but she was unprepared for max priestleys apparent indifference to being made a cuckold by an adolescent boy she glanced at sergeant havers the ds was making a study of priestley shed taken the opportunity to apply the flame of a plastic lighter to her cigarette and she narrowed her eyes against its smoke and directed her gaze to the mans face it seemed open enough its expression pleasant but there was no mistaking the sardonic quality of what priestley was saying to beas way of thinking his type of frankness generally meant that either his wounds ran deep or hed found himself placed on the receiving end of what he himself had once dished out of course in this current situation there was the third alternative one had to consider a killers attempt to cover his tracks through a show of indifference but that alternative didnt seem likely to her at the moment and bea couldnt say why although she hoped it had nothing to do with his overall magnetism he was regrettably quite a dish wed like to talk to you about your relationship with aldara bea acknowledged shes given us bits and pieces were interested in your side of the affair did i kill santo when i discovered he was having it off with my woman he enquired the answers no youd expect me to say that though wouldnt you your average killers hardly going to admit to being one i do find thats generally the case come on lil priestley shouted suddenly frowning into the distance another dog walker had appeared at the far edge of the down priestleys retriever had noticed and was bounding off in that direction bloody dog he said lily come the dog happily ignored him he chuckled ruefully and looked back to bea and havers and to think i used to have such a magic touch with women it was as good a segue as any bea said it didnt work with aldara it did at first right up till the time i discovered her magic was stronger than mine and then he offered them a quirky smile i got a taste of my own medicine as they say and the flavour wasnt something i liked at this indication that more was forthcoming sergeant havers did her bit with her notebook and pencil her cigarette dangling from her lips priestley noted this nodded said what the hell then and began to complete the picture of his relationship with aldara pappas theyd become acquainted at a meeting of business owners from casvelyn and the surrounding area he was there to do a story on the meeting the business owners were there to glean ideas for increasing tourism during the offseason aldara was a cut above the other proprietors of this surf shop and that restaurant or hotel it was he said a tough job not to take notice of her her history was intriguing priestley said a divorced woman taking on a derelict apple farm and building it into a decent tourist attraction i wanted to do a story on her just a story at first im a newspaperman i look for stories they talked both at the meeting and after the meeting plans were laid although he could have sent one of the watchmans two reporters to gather the facts he did it himself instead admittedly he was attracted to her so the newspaper story was an excuse bea said i intended to do it it got written eventually once you were in her knickers havers asked one can only do a single thing at a time priestley replied which means bea hesitated and then saw the light ah you bedded her at once that very day when you went for the interview is that your usual mo mr priestley or was this something special for you it was mutual attraction priestley said very intense impossible to ignore a romantic he said would have called what happened between aldara pappas and him love at first sight an analyst of love would have called it cathexis and what did you call it bea asked the newspaperman love at first sight so youre a romantic looks like i turned out to be his golden retriever bounded up to him her exploration of the other dogs pertinent orifices complete lily was ready for another throw of the tennis ball priestley whacked it to the far edge of the down something you didnt expect never he watched the dog for a moment before turning back to them prior to aldara id been a player all my life i had no intention of getting hooked into anyone and to prevent that what marriage and babies i always had more than one woman on a string just like her havers noted with a serious exception i had two or three once i had four but they always knew i was honest with them from the start havers said to bea there you are guv it happens sometimes he brought them the dead whatever priestley looked confused bea said to him but in the case of mrs pappas she was like no one else id had it wasnt just the sex thing it was the whole package of her her intensity her intelligence her drive her confidence her sense of purpose theres nothing simpering soft or weak about her theres no manipulation no subtle manouevring no double message and no mixed or confusing signals theres nothing at all to be read or interpreted in her behaviour aldaras like a man in the body of a woman i notice you dont credit her with personal honesty bea pointed out i dont he said that was my mistake hed come to believe aldara pappas was at long last in his life the one hed never thought to marry hed never wanted to marry hed seen enough of his parents marriage to be firm in not wanting ever to live as they had lived unable just to get on with each other to cope with their differences or to divorce theyd never been able to manage any option theyd had nor had they even seen they had options priestley hadnt wanted to live that kind of life and so he hadnt but with aldara it was different he said shed had a terrible first marriage husband was a rotter who let her think she was infertile when they couldnt have kids said hed been tested three ways to sunday and found perfectly fit let her go to doctors and get all sorts of mad treatments while he was shooting blanks the entire time she was dead off men after years with him but i brought her round i wanted what she wanted whatever she wanted marriage fine kids fine a mass of chimpanzees myself in tights and a tutu i didnt care you had it bad ds havers noted looking up from her pad she actually sounded marginally sympathetic and bea wondered if the mans magic touch was rubbing off on her it was the fire thing priestley said the fire didnt die out between us and i couldnt see the slightest sign that it might then i discovered why santo kerne bea said her affair with him kept her hot for you excitement secrecy i was gobsmacked i was bloody reeling he came to me and spilled the whole story out of conscience he said you didnt believe that the conscience bit not on your life not when his conscience didnt take him as far as telling his girlfriend it doesnt concern her he informed me as he had no intention of breaking off with her because of aldara so i wasnt to worry that hesantomight want something more from aldara than she was willing to give it was a sex thing between them youre number one he told me im just there to pick up the slack good at that was he havers asked i didnt wait round long enough to find out i phoned aldara and broke off with her did you tell her why i expect she worked it out either that or santo was as honest with her as he was with me which come to think of it gives aldara something of a motive to kill him herself doesnt it is that your ego speaking mr priestley priestley guffawed believe me inspector ive not much ego left well need your fingerprints are you willing to give them fingerprints toe prints and anything else you want ive nothing to hide from anyone thats wise of you bea nodded to havers who flipped her notebook closed she told the newsman to come to the station where his prints would be taken then she said to him as a point of curiosity did you favour santo kerne with a black eye prior to his death i would have loved to he said but frankly i didnt think he was worth the effort jagos approach when he revealed it to cadan was to employ the mantoman talk if cadan wanted to put distance between himself and dellen kerne there was only one way to do it and that was by facing lew angarrack there was plenty of work at liquidearth so there was no need for jago to take cadans part with his father all that was necessary he said was an honest conversation in which mistakes were admitted apologies extended and amends promised jago made it all sound simple cadan was hot to do it at once the only problem here was that lew had gone for a surfbig swells in widemouth bay today jago informed himso cadan was going to have to wait until his fathers return or he was going to have to go out to widemouth bay to meet him as he finished up his surf this second proposal sounded like an excellent idea since after a surf lews spirits would be high which would likely translate to lews amenability to cadans plans jago lent his car to the endeavour saying mind how you go then he handed over his keys cadan set off without a driving license and mindful of jagos display of trust in him he took supreme care hands at two oclock and ten oclock eyes fixed ahead or flicking to the mirrors the occasional glance at the speedometer widemouth bay lay to the south of casvelyn some five miles down the coast flanked by largely friable cliffs of sandstone it was much as its name suggested a wide bay accessed from a large car park just off the coastal road there was no town to speak of instead summer cottages were sprinkled across the down east of the road and the only businesses that served them surfers and tourists to the area were a seasonal restaurant and a shop hiring out body boards surfboards and wet suits in summer the bay was madness because unlike so many bays in cornwall it was no difficult matter to get to it so it attracted daytrippers by the hundreds holiday makers and locals as well in the offseason it was left to surfers who flocked to it when the tide was mid to high the wind was east and the waves were breaking on the righthand reef conditions were superb on this day with swells that looked to be five feet so the car park was littered with vehicles and the lineup of surfers was impressive even so when cadan pulled in and parked he could make out his father easily lew surfed the way he did most everything else alone it was largely a solitary sport anyway but lew managed to make it even more so his was a figure set apart from the rest farther out content to wait for swells that rose only occasionally at this distance from the reefs to look at him one would think he knew nothing about the sport because certainly he ought to be waiting with the others who were getting fairly consistent rides but that wasnt his way and when a wave finally came that he liked he was on its shoulder effortlessly paddling with a minimum of effort and the experience of more than thirty years on the water the others watched him he dropped in smoothly and there he was angling across the waves green face carving back towards the barrel looking as if at any moment hed catch a rail or the falls would take him but knowing when to carve again so that the wave was his cadan didnt need to see a scoreboard or hear a commentary to know his father was good lew seldom spoke of it but hed surfed competitively in his twenties harbouring a dream of worldwide travel and recognition before the bounder had left him with two small children to care for at that point lew had been forced to rethink his chosen path what hed come up with was liquidearth from shaping his own boards hed gone on to shape boards for others thus he lived vicariously the peripatetic life of a worldclass surfer it couldnt have been easy for his father to give up on what hed hoped to do with his life cadan realised and he wondered why hed never thought about that before now when lew came out of the water cadan was waiting for him hed fetched a towel from within the rav and he handed it over lew propped his short board against the car and took the towel with a nod he pulled off his hood and rubbed his hair vigorously he began to peel off his wet suit it was still the winter suit cadan noted the water wouldnt warm up for two more months whatre you doing here cade lew asked him howd you get here arent you meant to be at work he stepped out of the wet suit and wrapped the towel round his waist from within the car he brought out a tshirt and then a sweatshirt printed with liquidearths logo he donned these and worked on getting out of his swimming suit he said nothing else until he was dressed and loading his kit into the back of the car and then it was to repeat what are you doing here cade how did you get here jago let me use his wheels lew looked round the car park and spotted the defender without your driving licence he said i didnt take chances i drove like a nun thats hardly the point and why arent you at work have you been sacked cadan didnt intend it and didnt want it but he felt the quick anger that always seemed to be the outcome of a conversation with his father he said without considering where it would take them i guess youd think that wouldnt you past history lew stepped past cadan and went for his board there were showers at the far side of the car park and lew could have used them to wash the saltwater from his kit but he didnt do so as the job he could do at home would be more thorough and consequently more to his liking and it seemed to cadan that that was his fathers way about everything to my liking was the motto lew lived by cadan said as it happens i havent been sacked ive been doing a bloody good job over there i see congratulations whatre you doing here then i came to talk to you jago said you were here and he offered his car by the way i didnt ask talk to me about what lew slammed home the back of the rav from the drivers seat he rustled through a paper bag and brought out a sandwich encased in a plastic box he prised open the lid and lifted out half he offered the other half to cadan a peace offering cadan decided he shook his head but was careful to say thanks about coming back to liquidearth cadan said if youll have me he added this last as his own form of peace offering his father had the power in this situation and he knew that his part was to acknowledge that fact cadan you just told me i know what i said but id rather work for you why what happened adventures unlimited not to your liking nothings happened im doing what youve wanted me to do im thinking about the future lew looked out at the sea where the surfers patiently waited for the next good swell i expect you have a plan of some sort you need a sprayer cadan said i need a shaper as well summers coming were behind on our orders were competing with those hollowcore boards and what we have over them is attention to individual needs i know but part of the need is the artwork isnt it the look of the board as well as the shape i can do that thats what im good at i cant shape boards dad you can learn to shape them it always came down to this in the end what cadan wanted versus what lew believed i tried i wrecked more blanks than i shaped properly and you dont want that it wastes time and money youve got to learn its part of the process and if you dont know the process shit you didnt make santo learn the process why didnt he have to learn it start to finish like youre telling me lew gave his attention back to cadan because i didnt build the goddamn business for santo he said quietly i built it for you but how the hell can i leave it to you if you dont understand it so let me spray first get that down pat and go on to shaping afterwards no lew said thats not how its done jesus what the hell difference does it make how its done we do it my way cadan or we dont do it thats always how it is with you do you ever think you might be wrong not in this now get in the car ill drive you back to town ive got i wont have you driving jagos car cade youve had your driving licence taken by you and until you prove to me that youre responsible enough to forget it just bloody fucking forget it dad cadan strode across the car park to where hed left jagos car his father called his name sharply he kept on going he headed back to casvelyn burning all right he thought bloody all right his father wanted proof and he would prove hed prove until he was blue in the face and he knew just the place to do it he drove with far less care on his return to town he blasted over the bridge that spanned the casvelyn canalmindless of the yield to the oncoming traffic sign which earned him two fingers from the driver of a ups vanand he took the roundabout at the bottom of the strand without braking to see if he had the right of way he coursed up the hill and charged down st mevan crescent and onto the promontory by the time he reached adventures unlimited in a lather was the best description of his state his thoughts ran circles round the word unfair lew was unfair life was unfair the world was unfair his entire existence would be so simple if other people would just see things his way but they never did he shoved open the door of the old hotel he used a bit too much force and it hit the wall with a crash that reverberated through the reception area the sound of his entry brought alan cheston out of his office he looked from the door to cadan to his wristwatch werent you meant to be here this morning he asked i had errands cadan said i think errands get done on your own time not on ours it wont happen again i hope not truth is cade we cant have employees who dont show up when theyre intended to show up in a business like this weve got to be able to depend i said it wont happen again what more do you want a guarantee written in blood or something alan crossed his arms he waited a moment before making a reply and in that moment cadan could hear the echo of his own petulant voice you dont much like to be supervised do you alan said no one told me you were my supervisor everyone here is your supervisor until you prove yourself youre rather a bit player if you know what i mean cadan knew what he meant but he was sick to death of proving himself to this person to that person to his father to anyone he just wanted to get on with things and no one was letting him that fact made him want to hurl alan cheston into the nearest wall he itched to do it to act on the impulse and to hell with the consequence it would feel so good he said fuck it im clearing out ive come for my clobber he headed for the stairs have you informed mr kerne you can do that for me itll hardly look good like i almost care he left alan staring after him lips parted as if he was about to say more as if he was going to point outcorrectlythat if cadan angarrack had some sort of kit hed left at adventures unlimited it would hardly be on the upper floors of the building but alan said nothing and his silence left cadan in command which was where he wanted to be he had no kit at adventures unlimited no clobber no gear no anything but he told himself that he would check each room hed been in during his very brief time in the employ of the kernes because one never knew where one had left a possession and after this it would be a bit uncomfortable for him to have to come by and pick up anything he might have left behind room after room door opened a quick look inside door closed a quiet hullo anyone in here as if he expected his supposed forgotten possessions to speak he finally found her on the top floor where the family lived where he could have gone at once had he been practising honesty with himself which he was not she was in santos bedroom at least cadan assumed that it was santos bedroom by the surfing posters the single bed the pile of tshirts on a chair and the pair of trainers that dellen kerne was caressing on her lap when cadan opened the door she was all in black jersey and trousers and a band holding her blond hair off her face she had on no makeup and a scratch marked her cheek her feet were bare she was sitting on the edge of the bed her eyes were closed cadan said hey in what he hoped was a gentle voice she opened her eyes they fixed on him the pupils so large that the violet of her irises was nearly obscured she dropped the trainers to the floor with a soft thud she held out her hand he went to her and helped her to her feet he saw she had nothing on beneath her jersey her nipples were large round and rigid he stirred at this for once he admitted the truth to himself this was why hed come to adventures unlimited jagos advice and the rest of the world be damned he grazed the tip of her nipple with his fingers her eyelids lowered but did not close he knew it was safe to continue he took a step to be nearer a hand on her waist and then circling round cupping her bum while the other hands fingers stayed where they were and played like feathers against her he bent to kiss her her mouth opened willingly beneath his and he pulled her more firmly against him so that she would feel what he wanted her to feel he said when he could that key you had yesterday she didnt reply he knew she knew what he was talking about because her mouth lifted to his once more he kissed her long and deeply and it went on and on till he thought his eyeballs might pop from his head and his eardrums might burst his slamming heart needed some place to go besides his chest because if it didnt find another home he reckoned he could die on the spot he ground against her he began to ache he broke away from her and said the beach huts you had a key we cant not here not in the family quarters and certainly not in santos room it was indecent somehow cant what she leaned her forehead against his chest you know yesterday when we were in the kitchen you had a key you said it was for one of the beach huts lets use it for what what the hell did she think was she the sort who liked it said outright well he could do that i want to fuck you he said and you want to be fucked but not in here in one of the beach huts why becauseits obvious isnt it is it jesus yeah this is santos room right and anyway his dad might come in he couldnt bring himself to say your husband and if that happens she could see it couldnt she what was wrong with her santos dad she said if he walks in on us this was ridiculous he didnt need to explain he didnt want to explain he was ready and he thought she was ready and to have to talk about all of the whys and whereforesobviously she wasnt yet hot enough for him he went for her again mouth on nipple this time through the jersey a gentle pull with his teeth a flicking of the tongue back to her mouth and drawing her near and it was odd that she wasnt doing much in turn but did that really matter jesus get that key he murmured santos dad she said he wont come here how can you be sure cadan examined her more closely she appeared to be marginally out of it but even so it seemed to him that she ought to know they were in her sons room and her husbands house on the other hand she wasnt exactly looking at him now and he didnt know if shed actually seen himas in registering his presencewhen she had looked at him he wont she said he might want to but he cant babe youre not making sense she murmured i knew what i ought to do but hes my rock you see and there was a chance so i took it because i loved him i knew what was important i knew cadan was flummoxed more he was fast deflating losing ground with her and with the moment still he said delldellenbabe to coax her shed spoken well of chances because if there was the slightest chance that he could still get her down to the beach huts he was willing to go for it he took her hand he lifted it to his mouth he ran his tongue across her palm he said huskily what dyou say dell what about that key her reply was who are you what are you doing here chapter twentysix when kerra and her father walked into toes on the nose the café was virtually empty in part this was due to the time of day which was in between one meal and the next in part this was due to the conditions on the water when the swells were good no surfer in his right mind would be hanging about a café shed invited ben out for a cuppa they could have more easily had one in the hotel but shed wanted to be away from adventures unlimited for their conversation the hotel was redolent of santos death and the recent row shed had with her mother for this chat with her father she wanted to be in neutral territory in a place that was fresh not that toes on the nose was fresh in the true sense it was instead an inadequate refashioning of what had once been the green table café a perfect example of ifyoucantbeatthemjointhem long ago taken over by surfers because of its proximity to st mevan beach the café had recent new owners whod seen commercial possibilities in putting up posters of old surfing films and playing music by the beach boys and jan and dean their menu however remained what it had been when theyd bought the place cheesy chips lasagna with chips and garlic bread jacket potatoes with a variety of fillings chip buttiesones arteries could clog just reading the menu kerra ordered a coke at the counter her father ordered coffee then they took a table as far from the music speakers as possible beneath a poster for endless summer ben looked at the riding giants poster across the room his gaze went from it to gidget and he seemed to compare them he smiled perhaps nostalgically kerra saw this and said whyd you give it up he returned his gaze to her she thought for a moment that he wouldnt reply to so direct a question but he surprised her i left pengelly cove he said frankly theres not much surf in truro you could have gone back how far is truro from the sea after all not far he admitted i could have gone back once i had a car thats true enough but you didnt why he looked momentarily pensive and presently he said i was finished with it id faced the fact that it had done me no good ah she thought she knew the reason which at the end of the day was the reason for everything ben kerne did mum she said thats how you met her and yet her reply was based solely on assumption she realized for theyd never once discussed how ben and dellen kerne had actually met it was the sort of question children asked their parents all the time once they became aware that their parents were people separate from themselves how did you and mummy meet but she had never asked and she doubted whether santo had either ben was accepting his cup of coffee with thanks to the cafés owner he didnt reply until kerra had her coke then he said not because of your mum kerra there were other reasons surfing led me to a place id have been better off not going to truro you mean he smiled im speaking metaphorically a boy died in pengelly cove and everything changed that was down to surfing more or less thats what you meant no good came of it thats why i didnt much like santo surfing i didnt want him to fall into a situation that might cause him the sort of trouble id seen so i did what i could to discourage him it wasnt right of me but there you have it he blew across the top of his coffee and sipped he said wryly damn though it was daft to try santo didnt need me interceding in his life at least not about that he took care of himself didnt he not at the end of the day kerra noted quietly no not at the end of the day ben turned his coffee cup in its saucer his gaze on his hands they were silent as the beach boys crooned surfer girl after a verse ben said is that why youve brought me here to talk about santo we havent mentioned him yet have we im sorry for that i havent wanted to talk about him and youve paid the price we all have things were sorry about when it comes to santo kerra said but thats not why i wanted to talk to you she felt suddenly shy about her subject any discussion of santo made her look upon herself and her motives and deem them selfish on the other hand what she had to say was likely going to lift her fathers spirits and the look of him told her his spirits needed lifting what is it then he asked not bad news i hope youre not leaving us are you no i mean yes after a fashion alan and i are marrying he took this in a slow smile beginning to brighten his face are you now thats excellent news hes a fine man when they hadnt set a date she told him sometime this year there was no ring yet but that was to come alan insists she said he wants to have what he calls a proper engagement you know alan and she put her hands round her glass he wants to ask your permission dad does he indeed he said he wants to do things right from beginning to end i know its silly no one asks for permission to marry any longer but its what he wants to do anyway i hope youll give it your permission i mean whyever would i not well kerra looked away how to put it you may have gone a bit off on the whole idea of marriage you know what i mean because of your mother it cant have been a pleasant journey for you i could see how you mightnt want me to take it ben took his turn at avoiding kerras gaze he said marriage is difficult no matter the situation the couple finds themselves in think otherwise and youll be in for a surprise but theres difficult and theres difficult kerra said truly difficult impossible to accept ah yes i know youve thought that the why of it all ive been reading that question on your face since you were twelve years old he looked so regretful as he spoke that kerra felt pained she said did you never thinkdid you never want to he covered her hand with his your mum has had her trying times theres no question about that but her trying times have made her own path rockier than theyve made mine and thats the truth of it beyond that she gave me you and i have to thank her for that whatever her faults may be at this kerra saw that the moment had arrived when shed least expected it she looked down at her coke but something of what she needed to say to her father must have shown in her features because he said what is it kerra how do you know she asked him whether to take the leap with another person you dont know theres never any certainty about the kind of life youll have with someone else is there but at some point no no thats not what i mean she felt the colour come into her face it burned her cheeks and she could imagine it spreading out like a fan towards her ears she said how do you know about us about me for sure because he frowned for a moment but then his eyes widened a little as he took in her meaning she added miserably because of what shes like ive wondered you see from time to time he stood abruptly and she thought he might stride out of the café altogether since he looked towards the door but instead he said to her come with me girl no no leave your things where they are and he took her to a coat rack where a small mirror hung within a seashell frame he stood her in front of that mirror himself behind her his hands on her shoulders look at your face he said and look at mine good god kerra who would you be if not my daughter her eyes burned she blinked the smarting away what about santo she asked his hands tightened on her shoulders reassuringly you favour me he replied and santo always favoured your mum by the time lynley walked into the incident room in casvelyn hed been gone most of the day traversing cornwall from exeter to boscastle he found di hannaford and barbara havers acting the part of audience for constable mcnulty who was expatiating on a topic that seemed dear to his heart this consisted of a set of photos that hed laid out on a table havers looked interested hannaford listened wearing an unmistakable expression of sufferance hes catching the wave here and its a good shot of him you can see his face and the colours of his board right hes got good position and hes got experience he mostly surfs hawaii and the waters cold as the dickens in half moon bay so hes not used to it but what he is used to is the size of the wave hes scared but who wouldnt be if youre not scared then youre mad tonnes and tonnes of water and unless youve caught the last wave in the set its not exactly as if another wave isnt going to come along right after the one you might very well wipe out on and thats going to hold you down and suck you into the trench so you better be scared and you better show some respect he moved to the next picture look at the angle hes losing it here he knows hes going to wipe out and hes wondering how bad its going to be which is what you see here in this next shot he pointed at it a full body slap right into the face of the wave hes moving god only knows how fast and sos the water so what happens when he hits break a few ribs get the breath knocked out of him it doesnt matter which because now hes going the last place anyone would ever want to go at mavericks and thats over the falls here you can just make him out lynley joined them at the table he saw that the constable was talking about a single surfer on a wave the size of a moving hillside the colour of jade in the photo he was referring to the breaking wave had entirely swallowed up the surfer whose ghostly figure could be made out behind the crashing white water a rag doll in a washing machine some of these blokes live to get their pictures taken riding monster waves mcnulty said in conclusion to his remarks and some of them die for just the same reason thats what happened to him who is he lynley asked mark foo mcnulty said thank you constable bea hannaford said very dramatic very grim always illuminating now get back to work mr priestleys fingers await your ministrations and to lynley im going to want a word with you with you as well sergeant havers she jerked her head in the direction of the door she took them to a badly appointed interview room which seemed to have been used mostly as storage for more paper products until the present investigation she didnt sit nor did they she said tell me about falmouth thomas taken up by the events of the day lynley was genuinely confused i was in exeter he told her not falmouth dont be coy im not talking about today what do you know about daidre trahair and falmouth that you havent been revealing to me and dont either of you lie to me again one of you went there and if its you sergeant havers as dr trahair apparently suspects then i reckon theres only one reason you took yourself on that little side trip and it doesnt have a damn thing to do with taking orders from me am i correct lynley intervened i asked barbara to look into as amazing as it sounds bea cut in id already worked that out but the problem is that youre not directing this investigation i am thats not what it was havers said he didnt ask me to go there he didnt even know i was on my way here when he asked me to look into her background oh is that the case is it it is yeah he got me on my mobile in my car i expect he knew that bit of it that i was in my car but he didnt know where i was or where i was going and he had no idea i was going to be able to go to falmouth at all he just asked if i would look into a few details concerning her background as it was i could go to falmouth and as it wasnt far out of the way from where i was headingwhich was here of coursei thought i could go there before are you mad its miles and miles out of the god damn way what is it with you two bea demanded do you always go your own way in an investigation or am i the first of your colleagues to be so honoured with due respect maam lynley began do not call me maam with due respect inspector lynley said im not part of the investigation not officially im not even anhe sought a terman official official are you trying to be amusing superintendent lynley not at all im merely trying to point out that once you informed me id be assisting you despite my own wishes in the matter youre a bloody material witness no one cares about your wishes what did you expect to go merrily on your way which makes it even more irregular he said hes right havers added if you dont mind me saying of course i mind i bloody well mind were not playing fast and loose with the chain of command despite your rank she said to lynley im running this investigation not you you are not in the position to assign activities to anyone including sergeant havers and if you think you are he didnt know havers said i could have told him i was on my way here when he rang me but i didnt i could have told him i was under orders what orders lynley asked but i didnt you knew id be here eventually whose orders lynley asked so when he rang it didnt seem that irregular whose orders lynley asked you know whose orders havers told him has hillier sent you down here what do you think you could just walk out no one would care no one would worry no one would want to intervene do you actually think you could disappear that you mean so little to all right all right bea said retire to your corners my god enough she took a steadying breath this stops here and now all right youto haversare on loan to me not to him i can see there were ulterior motives involved in the offer to send you to assist but whatever those motives were youre going to have to deal with them on your own time not on mine and youto lynleywill from this moment be straightforward with what youre doing and what you know am i being clear you are lynley said havers nodded but lynley could see that she was hot under the collar and wanting to say more not to hannaford but to him fine excellent now lets take daidre trahair from the start and this time lets not hold anything back am i also being clear on that you are lovely regale me with details lynley knew there was nothing more for it there appears to be no dairdre trahair prior to her enrollment at her secondary comprehensive at thirteen years of age he said and although she says she was born at home in falmouth theres also no record of her birth additionally parts of her story about her job in bristol dont match up with the facts which parts theres a daidre trahair whos a vet on staff but the person she identified to me as her friend paulhes supposedly the primate keeperdoesnt exist you didnt tell me that part havers said why didnt you tell me lynley sighed she just doesnt seemi cant honestly see her as a murderer i didnt want to make things more difficult for her more difficult than what hannaford asked i dont know it seemsi admit theres something going on with her i just dont think it has anything to do with the murder and are you supposing youre in any condition to make that sort of judgement hannaford said im not blind he replied i havent lost my wits youve lost your wife hannaford said how do you expect to think straight see straight or do anything else straight after whats happened to you lynley backed away one step only he wanted an end to the conversation and this seemed as good a start to that conclusion as any he could come up with he made no reply havers he saw was watching him he knew he had to make an answer of some sort or shed answer for him which he would find unbearable he said i wasnt hiding facts from you inspector i wanted time for what for something like this i suppose hed been carrying a manila envelope and from it he brought out the photo hed taken away from lark cottage in boscastle he handed it over hannaford studied it who are these people theyre a family called parsons their sonthe boy in the picturedied in a sea cave in pengelly cove some thirty years ago this picture was taken round that time perhaps a year or two earlier niamh the mum jonathan the dad the boy is jamie and the girls are his younger sisters id like to do an age progression on the picture do we have someone who could do it for us quickly an age progression on who di hannaford asked on everyone lynley replied daidre had parked on lansdown road she knew her proximity to the police station didnt look good but she had to see and in equal measure she needed a sign that would tell her what she was meant to do next truth meant trust and a leap of faith but that leap could land her directly in the deadly mire of betrayal and shed had quite enough of betrayal at this point in her life in the rearview mirror she saw them come out of the police station had lynley been alone she might have approached him for the conversation they needed to have but as he was with both sergeant havers and inspector hannaford daidre used this as a sign that the time wasnt right she was parked some way up the street and when the three police officers paused in the stations car park for a few words together she started her car and pulled away from the kerb intent upon their conversation none of them looked in her direction daidre took that as a sign as well there were those she knew who would call her a coward for running just then there were others however who would congratulate her on having sound instincts towards selfpreservation she drove out of casvelyn she headed inland first towards stratton and then across the countryside she got out of her car at long last at the cider farm in the fastfading daylight circumstances she decided were asking her to forgive but forgiveness ran in both directions in every direction if it came down to it she needed to ask as well as to give and both of these activities were going to require practise stamos the orchard pig was snuffling round his pen in the centre of the courtyard daidre went past him and round the corner of the jam kitchen where inside and under bright lights two of the jam cooks were cleaning their huge copper pots for the day she opened the gate beneath the arbour and entered the private part of the grounds as before she could hear guitar music but this time more than one guitar was playing she assumed a record and knocked on the door the music ceased when aldara answered daidre saw the other woman was not alone a swarthy man in the vicinity of thirtyfive was placing a guitar onto a stand aldara had hers tucked under her arm she and the man had been playing obviously he was very good and of course so was she daidre aldara said neutrally what a surprise narno was giving me a lesson narno rojas she added from launceston she went on to complete the introduction as the spaniard rose to his feet and bowed his head slightly in acknowledgement daidre said hello and asked should she come back if youre in the middle of a lesson she added what she thought was leave it to aldara to have found a male teacher of delectable appearance he had the large dark eyes and thick eyelashes of a disney cartoon hero no no weve finished aldara said we were at the point of merely entertaining ourselves did you hear dont you think were very good together i thought it was a recording daidre admitted you see aldara cried narno we should play together im much better with you than i am alone and to daidre hes been lovely about giving me lessons i made him an offer he could not refuse and here we are isnt that the case narno it is he said but youve much more the gift for me it is practise continual for youyou merely need encouragement thats flattery but if you choose to believe it i wont argue anyway thats the part you play youre my encouragement and i adore how you encourage me he chuckled raised her hand and kissed her fingers he wore a wide gold wedding band he packed his guitar into its case and bade them both farewell aldara saw him to the door and stepped outside with him they murmured together she returned to daidre she looked daidre thought like a cat whod come upon an endless supply of cream daidre said i can guess what the offer was aldara returned her own guitar to its case what offer do you mean my dear the one he couldnt refuse ah aldara laughed well what will be will be i have a few things to do daidre we can chat while i do them come along if you like she led the way to a narrow set of stairs whose handrail was a thick velvet cord she climbed and took daidre up to the bedroom where she set about changing the sheets on a large bed that took up most of the space you think the worst of me dont you aldara said does it matter what i think of course it does not how wise you are but sometimes what you think isnt what is she flung the duvet to the floor and whipped the sheets off the mattress folding them neatly rather than balling them up as another person might have done she went to an airing cupboard in the tiny landing at the top of the stairs and brought out crisp linens expensive by the look of them and fragrant as well our arrangement isnt a sexual one daidre aldara said i wasnt thinking of course you were and who could blame you you know me after all here help me with this wont you daidre went to assist her aldaras movements were deft she smoothed the sheets with affection for them arent they lovely she asked italian ive found a very good private laundress in morwenstow its a bit of a drive to take them to her but she does wonders with them and i wouldnt trust my sheets to just anyone theyre too important if you know what i mean she didnt want to to daidre sheets were sheets although she could tell these likely cost more than she made in a month aldara was a woman who didnt deny herself lifes little luxuries he has a restaurant in launceston i was there for dinner when he wasnt greeting guests he was playing his guitar i thought how much i could learn from this man so i spoke with him and we came to an agreement narno will not take money but he has a need to place members of his familyand he has a very large familyin more employment than he can provide at his restaurant so they work for you here i have no need but stamos has a continual need for workers round the hotel in st ives and i find a former husbands guilt is a useful tool i didnt know you still speak to stamos only when it is helpful to me otherwise he could disappear off the face of the earth and believe me i wouldnt bother to wave goodbye could you tuck that in properly darling i cant abide rucked sheets she moved to daidres position and demonstrated deftly how she wanted the sheets seen to she said nice and fresh and ready when she was done then she looked at daidre fondly the light in the room was greatly subdued and in it aldara shed twenty years she said this isnt to say we wont eventually narno will i think make a most energetic lover which is how i like them i see i know you do the police were here daidre thats why ive come so you were the one i suspected as much im sorry aldara but i had no choice they assumed it was me they thought santo and i and you had to safeguard your reputation it isnt that it wasnt that they need to get to the bottom of what happened to him and they arent going to get there if people dont start telling the truth yes i do see what you mean but how often the truth iswell rather inconvenient if one persons truth is an unbearable blow to another person and simultaneously unnecessary for him to know need one speak it thats hardly the issue here but it does seem that no one is quite telling the police everything there is to tell wouldnt you say certainly if they came to you at first instead of to me it would be because little madlyn did not tell them everything perhaps she was too humiliated aldara finding her boyfriend in bed with her employerthat might have been more than she wanted to say i suppose aldara handed over a pillow and its accompanying case for daidre to sort out while she herself did the same with another its of no account now though they know it all i myself told them about max well i had to hadnt i they were going to uncover his name eventually my relationship with max was not a secret so i can hardly be cross with you can i when i also named someone to the police did max know daidre saw from aldaras expression that he did madlyn she asked santo aldara said stupid boy he was wonderful in bed such energy he had between his legs heaven but between his ears aldara gave an elaborate shrug some menno matter their agedo not operate with the sense god gave them she placed the pillow on the bed and straightened the edge of its case which was lace she took the other from daidre and did the same going on to turn down the rest of the linen in a welcoming fashion on the bedside table a votive candle was nestled in a crystal holder she lit this and stood back to admire the effect lovely she said rather welcoming wouldnt you say daidre felt as if cotton were stuffed into her head the situation was so much not what she believed it should be she said you dont actually regret his death do you dyou know how that makes you look dont be foolish of course i regret it i would not have had santo kerne die as he did but as i wasnt the one to kill him youre very likely the reason he died for gods sake i very seriously doubt that certainly max has too much pride to kill an adolescent rival and anyway santo wasnt his rival a simple fact that i could not make max see santo was justsanto a boytoy a boy yes a toy rather but that makes it sound cold and calculating and believe me it was neither we enjoyed each other and thats what it was between us only enjoyment excitement on both parts not just on mine oh you know all this daidre you cannot plead ignorance and you quite understand you would not have lent your cottage had you not you feel no guilt aldara waved her hand towards the door to indicate they were to leave the room and go below once more as they descended the stairs she said guilt implies i am somehow involved in this situation which i am not we were lovers full stop we were bodies meeting in a bed for a few hours thats what it was and if you really think that the mere act of intercourse led to a knock came on the door aldara glanced at her watch then she looked at daidre her expression was resigned which told daidre later that she should have anticipated what would come next but rather stupidly she had not aldara opened the door a man stepped into the room his eyes only for aldara he didnt see daidre he kissed aldara with the familiarity of a lover a greeting kiss that became a coaxing kiss which aldara did nothing to terminate prematurely when it did end she said against his mouth you smell all of the sea ive been for a surf then he saw daidre his hands dropped from aldaras shoulders to his sides id no idea you had company daidres just on her way aldara said dyou know dr trahair my dear daidre this is lewis he looked vaguely familiar to daidre but she couldnt place him she nodded hello shed left her bag on the edge of the sofa and she went to fetch it as she did so aldara added angarrack lewis angarrack which caused daidre to pause she saw the resemblance then for of course shed seen madlyn more than once in the times she herself had been to cornish gold cider farm she looked at aldara whose face was placid but whose eyes shone and whose heart was no doubt beating strongly now as anticipation sent her blood hither and yon to all the proper places daidre nodded and stepped past lewis angarrack outside onto the narrow porch aldara murmured something to the man and followed daidre out she said you see our little problem i think daidre glanced at her actually i dont her boyfriend first and now her father its critical naturally that she never know so as not to upset her further its as lewis wants it what a shame dont you think hardly its the way you want it as well after all secret exciting pleasurable aldara smiled that slow knowing smile that daidre knew was part of her appeal to men well if it must be that way it must be that way youve no morals have you daidre asked her friend my darling have you chapter twentyseven ultimately on that miserable day cadan found himself in a situation in which the chickens of his machinations had finally come home to roost caught in the sitting room of the family home in victoria road with his sister and will mendick madlyn having just returned from work was still in her casvelyn of cornwall getupall stripes the colour of candy floss and a pinny with ruffles along the edges she was slouched on the sofa while will stood in front of the fireplace with a bunch of daylilies dangling from his fingers hed shown good enough sense to buy the flowers and not bring along rejects from the wheelie bin but that was the limit to the good sense he was showing cadan himself was perched on a stool near his parrot hed left pooh alone for most of the day and hed been intent upon making up for that with an elongated bit of bird massage just the two of them with the houseor at least the roomto themselves but madlyn had arrived home from work and on her heels had come will hed apparently taken to heart cadans baldfaced lies about his sister and her affections so i thought will was saying with scant encouragement from madlyn that you might likewell like to go out with who madlyn said withwell with me hed not presented her with the flowers yet and cadan was hoping fervently hed pretend that hed not brought them at all and why would i want to do that exactly madlyn tapped her fingers on the arm of the sofa this gesture cadan knew had nothing to do with nervousness will grew redder in the facehe was already blushing like a bloke with two left feet at a foxtrot lessonand he shot a look towards cadan that said give us a hand here mate studiously cadan averted his eyes will said justperhaps to get a meal out of a bin you mean no god madlyn i wouldnt ask you to look madlyn had that expression on her face cadan knew what it meant but he also knew that will hadnt the first clue that his sisters detonator was doing whatever detonators did just before the bomb went from ux to x she pushed herself to the edge of the sofa and her eyes got narrow just in case you dont know will which you apparently dont i had a talk with the police a quite recent talk with them they caught me out in a lie and they crawled all over me and guess what they knew will said nothing cadan urged pooh onto his fist he said hey what you got to say pooh the bird was usually very good at providing diversions but pooh was silent if he felt the rooms tension he wasnt responding to it in his normal vociferous manner they knew that i followed santo they knew what i saw they knew will that i knew what santo was doing now how do you spose the cops knew that and do you have any idea how that makes me look they dont think that youyou dont need to worry thats hardly the point my boyfriends having it off with a cow old enough to be his mum and hes liking it and this particular cow happens to be the cow i work for and all this is going on under my nose with both of them looking like butter wouldnt melt and hes calling her mrs pappas mind you mrs pappas in front of me and you can bloody well depend on him not calling her mrs pappas when hes fucking her and she knows hes my boyfriend thats part of the fun shes specially friendly to me because of it only i dont know i even have a cup of tea with her and she asks me all about myself i like to get to know my girls she says oh too bloody right dont you see thats why i do not so there they arethose copsand theyre looking at me and i can see what they know and what they think poor stupid cow she is her boyfriendd rather do some old witch than be with her and i didnt need that dyou see it will i didnt need their pity and i didnt need them knowing because now it all gets written down for the world to see and everyone knows and do you knowhave you any ideawhat that feels like it wasnt your fault madlyn that i wasnt enough for him so much not enough that he wanted her as well how could that not be my fault i loved him we had something good or thats what i thought will said stumbling no look it wasnt you why couldnt you seehe wouldve done the samehe wouldve walked away no matter who he was with why couldnt you ever see that why couldnt you just let him i was going to have his baby his baby all right and i thought that meanti thought we wouldoh god forget it wills jaw had dropped with madlyns revelation cadan had of course heard the expression beforesomeones jaw droppingbut hed never imagined how lost it made one look till he saw what wills face revealed will hadnt known about this then but of course how could he it was a private business held within the family and will was not a member of the family or even close to becoming one a fact which he did not appear to understand even now sounding numb he said you could have come to me what madlyn said to me i wouldvei dont know whatever you wanted i could have i loved him no will said you cant you couldnt why wont you see what he was like he was no good but you looked at him and what you saw dont you say that about him dont youdont will looked like a man whos spoken a language that he assumes his listener has understood only to discover shes a foreigner in his country and so is he as a matter of fact and theres nothing to be done about the matter he said slowly and with dawning knowledge you can still defend him even afterand what you just told mebecause he wasnt going to stand by you was he thats not who he was i loved him she cried but you said that you hated him you told me you hated him he hurt me for gods sake but then why did i will looked around as if suddenly waking his glance went to cadan then to the flowers hed brought to give madlyn he tossed these into the fireplace cadan rather liked the drama of the gesture had the fireplace been one that actually worked but as it didnt work the act seemed past its sellby date the sort of thing one saw in old films on the telly the room was filled with a hollow silence then will said to madlyn i punched him out i would have done more if hed even been willing to fight but he wasnt he didnt even bother to care he wouldnt fight not for you not because of you but i did that i punched him out for you madlyn because what she cried what on earth were you thinking he hurt you he was a firstclass wanker and he needed to be taught who asked you to be his teacher i never i never did youmy god what else did you do to him did you kill him as well is that it you dont know what it means do you will asked her that i even hit him once that iyou dont know what that youre sir bloody whoever in sodding armour that im supposed to be happy about that grateful thrilled your handmaiden forever what exactly dont i know i couldve gone back inside he said dully whatre you talking about if i so much as tripped some bloke on the street even accidentally i could go back inside but i was willing to do it because of you and i was willing to sort him because he needed sorting but you didnt know that and even if you did knownow that you do knowit doesnt matter it never mattered i dont matter i never did did i why the hell did you think will looked at cadan madlyn looked at will and then she too looked at cadan for his part cadan thought it was a very good moment to give little pooh his walkies for the evening bea was stretching with the aid of a kitchen chair doing her part to keep an ageing back more or less pain free when she heard a key in the front door the sound of the key was followed by a familiar knockbim bim bim boom boomand then rays voice you here bea id say the cars a fairly good indication of that she called out you used to be a much better detective she heard him coming in her direction she was still wearing her pyjamas but as they comprised a tshirt and the trousers to her tracksuit she was not bothered by someones coming upon her in her morning deshabille ray was done up to the nines she looked at him sourly hoping to impress some bright young thing only you he went to the fridge where she had left a jug of orange juice he held it to the light gave it a suspicious sniff found it apparently to his liking and poured a glass do help yourself she said sardonically theres always more where that came from cheers he replied dyou still use it on your cereal some things never change ray whyre you here and wheres pete not ill is he he has school today i hope youve not let him talk you into early day he said he has something going on in his science course i got him there and made sure he went inside and wasnt planning to bunk off and sell weed on the street corner most amusing pete doesnt do drugs we are blessed in that she ignored the plural whyre you here at this hour hes wanting more clothes havent you washed them i have but he says he cant be expected to wear the same thing after school day after day you sent only two outfits he has clothes at your place he claims hes outgrown them he wouldnt notice that he never gives a toss what hes wearing anyway hed be in his arsenal sweatshirt all day if he had the option and you know that very well so answer me again why are you here he smiled caught me youre very good at grilling the suspect my dear hows the investigation faring you mean how is it faring despite the fact ive no mcit he sipped his orange juice and put the glass on the work top which he leaned against he was quite a tall man and he was trim hed look good bea thought to whatever bright young thing he was dressing himself for despite what you believe i did do the best i could for you with regard to manpower beatrice why dyou always think the worst of me she scowled she didnt reply at once she dipped into a final stretch and then rose from the chair she sighed and said it isnt going far or fast id like to say were closing in on someone but each time ive thought that either events or information have proved me wrong is lynley being of any help god knows he has the experience hes a good man theres no doubt of that and theyve sent his partner down from london i daresay shes here more to keep an eye on him than to help me but shes a decent cop if somewhat unorthodox shes rather distracted by him in love she denies it but if she is its a real nonstarter chalk and cheese doesnt begin to describe them no i think shes worried about him theyve been partnered for years and she cares they have a history however bizarre it may be bea pushed away from the table and carried her cereal bowl to the sink at any rate theyre good cops one can tell that much about them shes a pit bull and hes very quick id like it a bit more if he had fewer ideas of his own however youve always liked your men that way ray noted bea regarded him a moment passed a dog barked in the neighbourhood she said thats rather below the belt is it yes pete wasnt an idea he washe isa person ray didnt avoid her gaze or her comment bea marked this as the first time hed actually done neither youre right he smiled at her in fond if rueful acknowledgement he wasnt an idea can we talk about it beatrice not now she said ive work as you know she didnt add what she wanted to add that the time to talk was fifteen years gone nor did she add that hed chosen his moment with scant consideration for her situation which was damn well typical of how hed always been she didnt think what it meant that she let such an opportunity pass though instead she went into morning mode and got ready for work nonetheless on her drive even radio four didnt divert her enough that she failed to realise ray had just as good as admitted his inadequacy as a husband at long last she wasnt sure what to do with that knowledge so she was grateful when she walked into the incident room to a ringing phone that she scooped up from its receiver before anyone from the team could do likewise they were milling round waiting for their assignments she was hoping that someone on the end of the phone was going to give her an idea of what to tell them to do next it turned out that duke clarence washoe from chepstow was on hand with the preliminaries about the comparison of hairs shed provided him was she ready for that regale me she told him microscopically theyre close he said just close no match cant do a match with what we have were talking cuticle cortex and medulla this isnt a dna thing im aware of that so what can you say theyre human theyre similar they might be from the same person or a member of the same family but might is as far as we go ive got no problem putting myself on record with the microscopic details mind but if you want further analysis its going to take time and money bea thought he wasnt saying that but both of them knew it shall i carry on then he was asking her depends on the chock stone what dyou have on that one cut it went straight through without hesitation no multiple efforts involved no identifying striations either youre looking for a machine not a hand tool and its blade is quite new certain about that a machine for cutting cable narrowed the field considerably she felt a mild stirring of excitement you want chapter and verse chapter will do aside from possibly leaving striations a hand tools going to depress both the upper and the lower parts of the cable crimping them together a machines going to make a cleaner cut resulting endsll be shiny as well he was he said expressing this unscientifically to her did she want the proper lingo bea nodded a good morning to sergeant havers as she came into the room bea looked for lynley to walk in behind her but he didnt appear she frowned inspector washoe said at his end of the line dyou want what youve given me is fine she told him save the science for your formal report will do andduke clarence she grimaced at the poor sods name guv thanks for rushing things with that hair she could hear that he was pleased with her expression of gratitude as he rang off she gathered her team such as it was they were looking for a machine tool she told them and gave them the details on the chock stone as washoe had related them to her what were their options on finding one constable mcnulty she enquired mcnulty seemed to be feeling his oats this morning perhaps as a result of the success hed had tracking down unhelpful photos of dead surfers he pointed out that the erstwhile air station was a good possibility there were any number of businesses set up in the old buildings and doubtless a machine shop was going to be one of them autobody shop would do as well someone else suggested or a factory of some sort came another suggestion then the ideas emerged quickly metal worker iron worker even a sculptor what about a blacksmith well that wasnt likely my muminlaw could do it with her teeth someone said guffaws all round thatll do bea said she gave sergeant collins the nod to make the assignments set out and find the tool they knew their suspects consider them their homes and their places of employment and anyone who might have done work for them at their homes or their places of employment as well then she said to havers id like a word sergeant and she had that word in the corridor she said wheres our good superintendent this morning having a bit of a liein no he was at breakfast we had it together havers smoothed her hands on the hips of her baggy corduroy trousers they remained decidedly baggy did you indeed i hope it was delicious and im thrilled to know hes not missing his meals so where is he he was still at the inn when i sergeant less smoke and more mirrors please something tells me that if anyone on earth knows exactly where thomas lynley is and what hes doing youre going to be that person where is he havers ran a hand through her hair the gesture did nothing at all to improve its state she said all right this is stupid and ill wager hed rather you didnt know what his socks were wet i beg your pardon sergeant if this is some kind of joke its not he hasnt enough clothes with him he washed both pairs of his socks last night and they didnt dry probably she added with a roll of her eyes because hes never had to personally wash his socks in his life and are you telling me that hes at the hotel drying his socks yes thats what im telling you hes using a hair dryer and knowing him hes probably set the building on fire by now were talking about a bloke who doesnt even make his own toast in the morning guv like i said he washed them last night and he didnt put them on the radiator or wherever he just left themwherever he left them as far as the rest of his kit goes bea raised her hand enough information believe me whatever he may have done with his pantaloons is between him and his god when can we expect him haverss teeth pulled at the inside of her lower lip in a fashion that suggested discomfort there was something more going on bea said what is it as from below a couriers envelope was brought up the stairs in the hands of one of the team members already heading out on his assignment it had just come the constable told her two blokes having been working with the relevant software for hours bea opened the envelope the contents comprised six pages not fixed together she flipped through them as she said where is he sergeant and when can we expect him havers said dr trahair what about her she was in the car park when i left this morning i think she was waiting for him was she indeed bea looked up from the paperwork thats an interesting wrinkle she handed the sheets to havers have a look at these she told her what are they then theyre age progressions from that photograph thomas handed over i think youre going to find them of interest daidre trahair hesitated just outside his door she could hear the sound of the hair dryer from within so she knew that sergeant havers had been telling her the truth it hadnt seemed so indeed when daidre had confronted the sergeant in the car park of the salthouse inn asking for thomas lynley the idea that he might not be present because he was actually drying his socks had sounded like the lamest sort of excuse for his absence from sergeant haverss side on the other hand the ds from london hardly had a reason to invent an activity for lynley to be engaging in in order to hide the fact that he might instead be spending yet another day scouring through the detritus of daidres past for it seemed to daidre at this point that hed done as much scouring as hed be able to do without her own participation she knocked on his door sharply the dryer switched off the door swung open sorry barbara im afraid theyre still not he saw it was daidre hullo he said with a smile youre out and about early arent you the sergeant told mei saw her in the car park she said you were drying your socks he had a sock in one hand and the dryer in the other proof of the matter he said i did try to wear them at breakfast but i found theres something particularly disturbing about damp socks shades of world war i and life in the trenches i suppose would you like to come in he stepped back and she passed him into the room the bed was unmade a towel lay in a heap on the floor a notebook had scribbles of pencil in it with car keys sitting on its open pages i thought theyd dry by morning he said foolishly i washed both pairs i hung them by the window all night i even cracked it open for air it was all for nothing according to sergeant havers i should have shown some common sense and considered the radiator you dont mind she shook her head he began his work with the hair dryer again she watched him hed nicked himself shaving and hed apparently not noticed a thin line of blood traced along his jaw it was the sort of thing his wife would have seen and told him about as he left the house in the morning she said this isnt the sort of thing id expect the lord of the manor to be doing what drying his own socks doesnt someone like you havewhat do you call them people well i cant see my sister drying my socks my brother would be as useless as i am and my mother would likely throw them at me i dont mean family people i mean people people servants you know i suppose it depends on what you think of as servants we have staff at howenstowthats the family pile if ive not mentioned its nameand ive a man who oversees the house in london but id hardly call him a servant and can a single employee actually be called staff besides that charlie denton comes and goes fairly at will hes a theatre lover with personal aspirations of what sort of the sort involving greasepaint and the crowd he longs to be onstage but the truth of the matter is that he stands little chance of being discovered as long as he limits his range to what it currently is he vacillates between algernon moncrieff and the porter in macbeth daidre smiled in spite of herself she wanted to be angry with him and part of her remained so but he made it difficult she said why did you lie to me thomas lie to you you said you hadnt gone to falmouth asking questions about me he clicked off the hair dryer he set it on the edge of the basin and considered it ah he said yes ah strictly speaking i realise you were telling me the truth you didnt go personally but you sent her didnt you it wasnt her plan to go there strictly speaking no id no idea she was in the area i thought she was in london but i did ask her to look into your background so i suppose he made a small gesture with his hand a european gesture telling her to complete the thought on her own which she was happy enough to do you lied i dont appreciate that you might have asked me a few questions i did actually you likely didnt think id check on the answers to verify them to make sure that you yourself werent lying i seem so questionable to you so like a murderer he shook his head you seem as unlike a murderer as anyone ive ever come across but its part of the job and the more i asked the more i discovered there were areas in your story i thought we were getting to know each other foolish me we were daidre we are that was part of it but from the beginning there were inconsistencies in what you said about yourself and they couldnt be ignored you mean you couldnt ignore them he gazed at her his expression was frank i couldnt ignore them he said someone is dead and im a cop i see dyou want to share what youve discovered if you like i like bristol zoo i work there has someone claimed that i dont there is no paul keeping primates there and there is no daidre trahair born in falmouth at home or elsewhere do you want to explain are you arresting me no then come along gather your things i want to show you something she headed for the door but paused there she offered him a smile that she knew was brittle or dyou want to phone di hannaford and sergeant havers first and tell them youre coming with me after all i may send you over a cliff and theyll want to know where to find your body she didnt wait to hear him reply or to see whether he took her up on the offer she headed for the stairs and from there out to her car she assured herself that one way or another it didnt really matter if he followed or not she congratulated herself on feeling absolutely nothing shed come a long way she decided lynley didnt phone di hannaford or barbara havers he was a free agent after all not on loan on duty or on anything at all nonetheless he took the mobile with him once hed donned his socksthankfully far drier than theyd been during breakfastand gathered up his jacket he found daidre in the car park her vauxhall idling shed gone rather pale during their conversation but her colour had returned as shed waited for him to join her he got into the car in closer proximity to her he could smell the scent she was wearing it put him in mind of helen not the scent itself but the fact of the scent helen had been citrus the mediterranean on a sunny day daidre wasit seemed like the aftermath of rain fresh air after a storm he passed through a fleeting moment in which he missed helen so much he thought his heart might stop but it didnt of course he was left with the seat belt which he fumbled into place were going to redruth daidre told him do you want to phone di hannaford if youve not already done so just to be safe although since ive seen your sergeant havers already shell be able to tell the authorities i was the last one to see you alive i dont actually think youre a killer he told her ive never thought that havent you i havent she changed the car into gear perhaps i can alter all that for you then they began with a jerk bumping over the uneven surface of the car park and from there out into the lane it was a long drive but they didnt speak she flicked on the radio they listened to the news to a tedious interview with a nasally challenged and selfimportant novelist clearly hoping to be nominated for the booker prize and to a discussion on genetically altered crops daidre asked him at last to sort out a cd from the glove compartment which he did he chose at random and they ended up with the chieftains he put it on and she turned up the volume at redruth she avoided the town centre instead she followed the signs for falmouth he wasnt alarmed but he glanced at her then she didnt look his way her jaw was set but her expression seemed resigned the look of someone whod come to the endgame unexpectedly he felt a brief stab of regret although put to the question he couldnt have said what it was that he regretted a short distance from redruth she turned into a minor road and then into another which was the sort of narrow lane that connects two or more hamlets this last was marked for carnkie but rather than drive upon it she stopped at a junction merely a triangular bit of land where one might pull over and read a map he expected her to do just that as it appeared to him that they were in the middle of a nowhere characterised by an earthen hedge partly reinforced by stone and beyond it an expanse of open land studded occasionally with enormous boulders in the distance an unpainted granite farmhouse stood between them and it ragwort and chickweed along with scrub grass were being seen to by sheep daidre said tell me about the room you were born in thomas it was he thought the oddest sort of question he said why dyou want to know about that id like to imagine it if you dont mind you said you were born at home not in hospital at the family pile im wondering what sort of family pile it is was it your parents bedroom you were born in did they share a room do your kind of people do that by the way your kind of people a battle line had been drawn it was an odd moment for him to feel the sort of despair that had come upon him at other moments throughout his life always reminding him that some things didnt change in a changing world most of all these things he unfastened his seat belt and opened the door he got out he walked to the hedge the wind was brisk in this area as there was nothing to impede it it carried the bawling of the sheep and the scent of wood smoke behind him he heard daidres door open in a moment she was at his side he said my wife was quite clear about it when we married just in case youre considering it none of this separate rooms nonsense she said none of those coy thriceweekly nocturnal conjugal visits tommy we shall do our conjugating when and where we desire and when we fall asleep nightly we shall do so in each others presence he smiled he looked back at the sheep the expanse of land the undulations of it as it rolled to the horizon he said its quite a large room two windows with deep embrasures look down on a rose garden theres a fireplacestill used in winter because no matter central heating these houses are impossible to keep warmand a seating area in front of it the beds opposite the windows it too is large its heavily carved italian the walls are pale green theres a heavy gilt mirror above the fireplace a collection of miniatures on the wall next to it between the windows a demilune table holds a porcelain urn on the walls portraits and two french landscapes family photos on side tables thats all it sounds very impressive its more comfortable than impressive chatsworth neednt worry about the competition it soundssuitable for someone of your stature its just where i was born daidre why did you want to know she turned her head her gaze took in everything the earthen hedge the stones the boulders in the field the tiny junction in which theyd parked she said because i was born here in that farmhouse no here thomas in thiswell whatever you want to call it here she walked over to a stone and from beneath it he saw her remove a card she brought it to him and handed it over as she did so she said did you tell me that howenstow is jacobean it is in part yes i thought so well what i had was a bit more humble do have a look he saw shed given him a postcard with the image of a gipsy caravan on it it was of the type that once embellished the countryside with the flavour of romany the wagon bright red the arched roof green the wheels spokes yellow he studied it since she clearly wasnt of gipsy birth her parents must have been on holiday he thought tourists had done that in cornwall for years they hired wagons and played at being gipsies daidre seemed to read his mind for she said no romance to it at all im afraid no getting caught short on a holiday and no romanies in my background my parents are travellers thomas their parents were travellers as well my aunts and uncles such as they are are travellers also and this is where our caravan was parked when i was born our accommodation was never as picturesque as this one with a nod at the card as it hadnt been painted in years but it was otherwise much the same not quite like howenstow wouldnt you say he wasnt sure what to say he wasnt sure he believed her conditions wereid have to call them rather cramped i suppose although things improved marginally by the time i was eight years old but for a time there were five of us shoehorned together myself my parents and the twins the twins my brother and my sister younger than i by three years and not a single one of us born in falmouth are you not daidre trahair then i am in a way i dont understand in a way what way would you like to meet my real self i suppose i would she nodded she hadnt removed her gaze from him since hed looked up from the postcard she seemed to be trying to evaluate his reaction whatever she read on his face either reassured her or told her there was no further point to obfuscation she said right come along then thomas theres far more to see when kerra came out of her office to ask alans advice on a hiring issue she was greatly surprised to see madlyn angarrack in reception she was alone and wearing her kit from the bakery and kerra had the odd sense that madlyn had come to make a delivery of pasties she looked at the reception desk to see if a box with casvelyn of cornwall written upon it was sitting there no box in sight kerra hesitated she reckoned that madlyn had apparently come on a different sort of errand and she assumed that the errand might have to do with her but she didnt want any more harsh words with madlyn she felt somehow beyond them now madlyn saw her and said her name she spoke tremulously as if in fear of kerras reaction that was reasonable enough kerra decided their last conversation hadnt gone swimmingly and theyd hardly parted as friends they hadnt indeed been friends in ages madlyn had always possessed a glow of health but that was missing at the moment she looked as if she hadnt been sleeping well and her dark hair had lost something of its lustre her eyes however were still her eyes large dark and compelling they drew you in no doubt theyd done as much for santo could i have a word madlyn asked ive asked for a half hour from the bakery i told them personal business what with me then the mention of the bakery made kerra think madlyn must have come about a job and who could blame her for all the relative fame of its pasties one could hardly expect to build a career at casvelyn of cornwall or to have much fun and madlyn could give surfing instruction if kerra was able to talk her father into offering it yes with you could wesomewhere alan came out of his office then he was saying kerra ive just had a word with the video crew and theyll be available when he saw madlyn his look went from her to kerra and rested with kerra his expression was warm he nodded and he said oh ill speak with you later and then hullo madlyn fantastic to see you again then he was gone and kerra was faced with whatever reason madlyn had for coming to speak to her she said i spose we could go up to the lounge yes please madlyn said kerra took her there outside and below she saw that her father was directing two blokes who were making something of a mess out of a flower bed which edged a lawn that was clipped for bowling they had containers of shrubbery meant to go at the back of the bed and kerra could see that the labourers had nonsensically planted the shrubs at the front she muttered what are they thinking and then to madlyn its to give the less adventurous something to do madlyn looked confused what is kerra saw the other girl hadnt even glanced outside so apparently nervous was she she said weve done a pitch for lawn bowling over there beyond the ropeclimbing setup it was alans idea dad thinks no ones going to use it but alan says a gran or granddad might come along with the family and not exactly want to abseil or rope climb or whatever i tell him hes not got the first clue about modern grans and granddads but hes insisted so were letting him have his way hes been right about other things if it doesnt work out we can always do something else with the area croquet or something yes i can see how he would be right that is he always seemedhe seems very clever kerra nodded she waited for madlyn to reveal the reason for this call part of her was prepared to tell the girl up front that ben kerne wasnt likely to offer surfing so do save your breath in that regard part of her wanted to give madlyn a chance to make her case yet another part had a small suspicion this might not be about employment at all so she said helpfully here we are then dyou want a coffee or something madlyn madlyn shook her head she went to one of the new sofas and perched on the edge she waited for kerra to sit opposite her then she said im very sorry about santo her eyes filled quite a change from their previous encounter i didnt say properly when we talked before but im so very sorry yes well i expect you are madlyn flinched i know what you think that i wanted him dead or at least that i wanted him hurt but i didnt not really it wouldnt have been so strange if youd wanted that at least that he be hurt as much as he hurt you he was rotten in the way he treated you i thought he might be i did try to warn you i know you did but see i thought that you madlyn pressed her hand down the front of her pinny the whole kit she wore was terrible on her the wrong colour the wrong style it was amazing to kerra that casvelyn of cornwall could hold anyone in their employment making their girls wear such a getup i thought it was jealousy you see what that i wanted you for myself sexually or something not that but in other ways in friendship ways she doesnt like to share her friends i thought thats what this is all about well yes it was rather you were my friend and i couldnt see how you could be with him and still beit was so complicated because of how he was and what would happen when he threw you over i wondered that you knew hed do what he did then i thought he might it was rather his pattern and then what youd hardly want to come round here and be reminded of him would you even being with me would remind you of him put you into the position of having to hear about him when you werent prepared it was all too difficult i couldnt see a way past it and i couldnt put what i was feeling into words anyway not in any sensible fashion not in a way that would make me sound reasonable i didnt like losing you as a friend yes well there it is kerra thought what now they could hardly pick up where theyd left off in the presanto days too much had occurred and the reality of santos death still had to be dealt with his death and the means of it hung between them even now it was the great unspoken and it would remain so as long as there was the slightest possibility that madlyn angarrack was involved madlyn herself seemed to understand this because she next said im frightened about what happened to him i was angry and hurt other people knew i was angry and hurt i didnt keep it to myselfwhat hed done my father knew my brother knew other people knew will mendick jago reeth one of them you seesomeone might have hurt him but i didnt want that i never wanted that kerra felt a tingle of apprehension along her spine she said someone might have hurt santo to get revenge on your behalf i never wantedbut now that i know her hands balled into fists kerra saw her fingernailsthose nicely clipped crescentsdig into her palms as if telling her she had said enough kerra said slowly madlyn do you know who killed santo no there was a rise to madlyns voice suggesting that what shed come to say had not yet been said but you do know something dont you what its only thatwill mendick came round last night you know him yes that bloke from the grocery i know who he is what about him then he thoughtid spoken to him you see like i said before he was one of the people i told about santo and what happened not everything but enough and will it seemed that madlyn couldnt finish she twisted her hands in the hem of her pinny and looked generally miserable i didnt know he fancied me she concluded youre telling me he did something to santo because he fancied you toto get even with santo on your behalf he said he sorted him hei dont think he did more than that he and santo were friendly it wouldnt have been impossible for him to get to santos climbing kit madlyn i cant think he actuallyhe wouldnt have have you told the police i didnt know you see not till last night and if id knownif id known that hed even planned it or thought about iti didnt want santo hurt or if i wanted him hurt i wanted him hurt not hurt dyou know what i mean hurt inside the way i was hurt and now im afraid she was making a real mess of her pinny shed balled it up and got it hopelessly wrinkled casvelyn of cornwall was not going to like that you think that will mendick killed him for you kerra said someone prhaps and i didnt want that i didnt aski didnt tell kerra saw why the girl had come to her finally the knowledge dawned upon her and with the dawning came a fuller understanding of who madlyn was perhaps it was the central shift within her that had come about because of alan she didnt know but she did feel different about madlyn at long last and she could see things from madlyns perspective she rose from her place opposite the other girl and sat at her side she thought about taking her hand but she didnt too abrupt she thought too soon she said madlyn you must listen to me i dont believe you had anything to do with what happened to santo there was a time when i might have done and i probably did but it wasnt real do you understand what happened to santo wasnt your fault but i said to people what you said to people but i doubt you ever said that you wanted him to die madlyn began to cry whether it was from grief too long withheld or from relief kerra could not tell dyou believe that madlyn asked her i absolutely believe it kerra said in the inglenook of the salthouse inns bar selevan waited for jago reeth in something of a lather which was unusual for him hed phoned his mate at liquidearth and asked could they meet at the salthouse earlier than normal he needed to talk to him jago was good about the matter he didnt ask could they talk on the phone instead he said course thats what makes mates mates eh hed give the word to lew and set out directly soon as he could lew was a decent bloke about things deemed emergencies he could be there insay half an hour selevan said that would do him fine it would mean a wait and he didnt want to wait but he could hardly expect a miracle from jago liquidearth was some distance from the salthouse inn and jago couldnt exactly beam himself there so selevan finished his business at sea dreams packed up the car with everything he would need for the coming trip hed be taking and set out for the inn he knew hed carried things as far as he could and it was time to bring it all to a conclusion so hed gone into tammys cramped little bedroom and from the cupboard hed taken her canvas rucksack which shed first brought with her from africa she hadnt needed it then and she certainly didnt need it now because her possessions were few and pathetic so it was the matter of a moment only to remove them from the chest of drawers a few pairs of knickers of the overlarge sort an old lady might wear a few pairs of tights four vests because the girl was so flat in the chest that she didnt even require a brassiere two jerseys and several skirts there were no trousers tammy did not wear trousers everything she possessed was black except the knickers and the vests these were white hed scooped up her books next she had more books than clothes and these comprised mostly philosophy and the lives of saints she had journals as well her writing within them was the one thing about her that he hadnt monitored and selevan was rather proud about this since during her stay with him the girl had done nothing to hide them from him despite her parents wishes in the matter he hadnt been able to bring himself to read her girlish thoughts and fantasies she had nothing else except a few toiletries the clothes she was currently wearing and whatever she had in her shoulder bag that wouldnt include her passport since hed taken it from her upon her arrival and dont let her keep her bloody passport her father had intoned from africa once hed put her on the plane shes likely to run off if she has it she could have her passport now selevan decided he went to fetch it from the spot where hed hidden it beneath the liner of the dirty clothes bin it wasnt there she must have found it straightaway he realised the little vixen had probably been carrying it round for ages and she had been carrying it on her person as well since he had regularly gone through her bag for contraband well shed always been a step ahead of everyone hadnt she selevan had made a final stab that day at bringing her parents round ignoring the cost and the fact that he could ill afford it hed rung sally joy and david in africa and hed felt them out on the matter of tammy hed said to david listen here lad at the end of the day kids got to follow their own path lets spose it was some ruffian she decided she was in love with eh more you argue against it more you forbid her seeing the bloke more shes going to want to do it its simple psychowhachamacallit thingummybob nothing more or lessn that shes won you over hasnt she david had demanded in the background selevan could hear sally joy wailing what whats happened is that your father whats she done im not saying shes done anything selevan said but david went on as if selevan hadnt spoken id hardly think it was possible for her to do it all things considered its not as if your own kids were ever able to make you see reason were they nough of that son i admit my mistakes with you lot point is though you made lives for yourself and theyre good lives eh the girl wants nothing less she doesnt know what she wants look do you want a relationship with tammy or not because if you dont oppose her in this youll not have a relationship with her i can promise you and if i do oppose her ill have no relationship with her anyway so what would you have me do lad id have you show sense something tammys clearly lost id have you be a model for her a model whatre you on about what sort of model am i meant to be to a girl of seventeen thats rubbish that is theyd gone round and round but selevan had failed to convince his son of anything he couldnt see that tammy was resourceful being sent to england had hardly put her off her stride he could send her to the north pole if he wanted but when it came down to it tammy was going to find a way to live as she wanted to live pack her on home then had been davids final remark before hed rung off selevan could hear sally joy in the background crying but whatll we do with her david selevan had said bah to it all hed set about packing up tammys belongings that was when hed phoned jago hed be fetching tammy from clean barrel surf shop for a final time and he wanted to do so with someones goodwill behind him jago seemed the likeliest someone selevan hadnt been happy drawing jago away from his work on the other hand he needed to set out on his journey and hed told himself that jago would go to the salthouse inn for their regular kneesup later on that day so one way or another he had to tell him he wouldnt be there at their regular time now he waited and felt the nerves come upon him he needed someone on his side and hed be in a state till he got someone there when jago came in selevan waved a hello with no small measure of relief jago stopped at the bar to have a word with brian and came over still in his jacket with his knitted cap pulled over his long grey hair he shed both jacket and cap and rubbed his hands together as he drew out the stool that faced selevans bench the fire hadnt yet been littoo early for that as they were the only two drinkers in the barand jago asked could he light it brian gave the nod and jago put match to tinder he blew on the emergent flames till they caught then he returned to the table he gave a thanks to brian as his guinness was brought to him and he took a swig of it he said whats the brief then mate to selevan you look a right state im heading out selevan said few days a bit more are you then where north place not far from the border what wales scotland jago whistled far piece that want me to keep an eye on things then want me to keep a watch on tammy taking tammy with me selevan said ive done as much as i can here jobs finished now were off time the girl was let to lead the life she wants truth to that jago said i wont be here that much longer myself selevan was surprised to feel the extent of his dismay at hearing this news where you off to jago i thought you meant to stay the season jago shook his head he lifted his guinness and drank of it deeply never stay one place long thats how i look at it im thinking south africa capetown prhaps you wont go till im back though sounds a bit mad this but ive got used to having you round jago looked at him and the lenses of his glasses winked in the light best not to do that doesnt pay to get used to anything course i know that but the bar door swung open but not in its usual fashion with someone swinging it just wide enough to enter instead it opened with a startling bang that would have put an end to all conversation had anyone save jago and selevan been within two women came inside one of them had standup hair that looked purple in the light the other wore a knitted cap pulled low on her face just to her eyes the women looked around and purple hair settled on the inglenook she strode over saying ah wed like a word with you mr reeth chapter twentyeight they drove west they talked very little what lynley wanted to know was why she had lied about details that could be so easily checked upon paul the primate keeper for instance it was a matter of a simple phone call to discover there was no paul caring for primates at the zoo did she not see how that looked to the police she glanced at him shed not worn her contact lenses on this day and a bit of her sandy hair had fallen across the top of the frames of her glasses she said i suppose i hadnt thought of you as a cop thomas and the answers to the questions you asked meand the questions you had in your head but didnt ask mewere private werent they they had nothing to do with santo kernes death but keeping those answers to yourself made you suspect you must see that i was willing to take the risk they drove for a time in silence the landscape altered as they approached the coast from rough and rockstudded farmland whose ownership was delineated with irregular drystone walls patchy with greygreen lichen the undulations of pasture and field gave way to hillside and combe and a horizon that was marked with the great and derelict engine houses of cornwalls disused mines she took a route into st agnes a slate and granite village that tumbled down a hillside above the sea its few steep streets twisting appealingly and lined with terrace cottages and with shops all of them leading inexorably and ultimately like the course of a river down to the pebbled stretch of trevaunance cove here at low water tractors pulled skiffs into the sea and at threequarters tide goodsize swells from the west and southwest brought surfers from surrounding areas to jostle with each other for a place on tenfoot waves but instead of ending up at the cove where lynley thought shed been heading she chose a direction out of town driving north following signs that were posted for wheal kitty he said to her i couldnt ignore the fact that you lied about recognising santo kerne when you saw his body why did you do that dont you see how that threw suspicion on you at the moment that couldnt be important saying i knew him would have led to more questions answering questions would have left me pointing the finger she glanced his way her expression was irked disbelieving have you honestly no idea what it might feel like to be a person who involves people she knows in a police investigation surely you must understand how that might feel youre not insensate there were confidential mattersthere were things id promised to keep to myself oh what am i saying your sergeant would have put you into the picture by now doubtless you had breakfast with her if you didnt speak to her last night i cant imagine shed keep you in the dark about much there were car tracks in your garage more than one set santos aldaras your sergeant would have told you about aldara i expect santos lover the fact that they used my cottage why didnt you just explain that from the first had you done so what you would have stopped short of looking into my past sending your sergeant to falmouth to question the neighbours phoning the zoo doingwhat else have you spoken to lok as well did you track him down did you ask him if hes truly crippled or if i made that up it does sound fantastic doesnt it a chinese brother with spinal bifida brilliant but bent what an intriguing story i know hes at oxford lynley was regretful but there was no help for what hed done it was part of the job thats the extent and you discovered thishow its a small matter daidre theres cooperation between police agencies all over the world let alone in our own country its easier now than it ever was i see you dont you cant youre not a cop neither were you neither are you or has all of that changed he couldnt answer that question he didnt know the answer perhaps some things were in the blood and could not be shaken off merely because one desired to do so they said nothing more at one point in his peripheral vision he saw her raise a hand to her cheek and his fantasy had her weeping but when he looked at her directly he saw that she was merely seeing to the hair that had fallen over the frame of her glasses she shoved it impatiently behind her ears at wheal kitty they did not approach the engine house or the buildings that surrounded it these sat at a distance and cars were parked in front of some of them unlike nearly all of the old engine houses across the county wheal kittys had been restored it was now in use as a place of business and other businesses had sprung up round it these in long low buildings looking nothing like the period from which wheal kitty had come but still built of the local stone lynley was glad to see this he always felt a twinge of sadness when he looked at the ghostly smokestacks and brokendown engine houses that marked the landscape it was good to see them put to use again for round st agnes was a veritable graveyard of mining shafts particularly above trevaunance coombe where a ghost town of engine houses and their accompanying smokestacks marked the landscape like silent witnesses to the lands recovery from mans assault upon it and the land itself was a place of heather and gorse thriving amidst grey granite outcroppings providing nesting spots for herring gulls jackdaws and carrion crows there were few trees the windswept nature of the place did not encourage them to the north of wheal kitty the road narrowed it became a lane first and ultimately a track coursing downward into a steeply sided gully barely the width of daidres vauxhall it descended in a series of switchbacks guarded by boulders to their left and a fastmoving stream to their right it finally ended at an engine house far more ruined than any theyd seen on the trip from redruth it was wildly overgrown with vegetation just beyond it a smokestack shot skyward in a similar state here we are daidre said but she didnt get out of the car instead she turned to him and she spoke quietly imagine this she said a traveller decides he wants to stop travelling because unlike his parents and their parents and the parents before them he wants something different out of life he has an idea thats not very practical because nothing much hes done has ever been practical frankly but he wants to try it so he comes to this place convinced of all things that theres a living to be had from mining tin he reads very poorly but hes done what homework he can on the subject and he knows about streaming dyou know what tin streaming is thomas yes lynley looked beyond her over her shoulder some seventy yards from where they were parked an old caravan stood once white now it was mostly laced the colour of rust which streaked from its roof and from its windows at which yellow curtains printed with flowers drooped accompanying this impermanent structure were a tumbledown shed and a tarpaperroofed cupboard that looked like an outdoor loo its drawing tin from small stones in a stream and following that stream to larger stones shode stones yes daidre said and then following them to the lode itself but if you cant find the lode its a small matter really because you still have the tin in the smaller stones and that can be made intowhatever you wish to make it into or you can sell it to metalworkers or jewellers but the point is you can support yourselfbarelyif you work hard enough and you get lucky so thats what this traveller decides to do of course it takes a lot more work than he anticipated and its not a particularly wholesome kind of life and there are interruptions town councils the government assorted dogooders coming round to inspect the premises this causes something of a distraction so the traveller ends up travelling anyway in order to find a proper stream in a proper location somewhat hidden away where he can be allowed to look for his tin in peace but no matter where he goes there are still problems because hes got three children and a wife to provide for and since he alone cant provide what needs to be provided they all must help hes decided he will give the children lessons at home to save time from their having to be gone for hours to school every day his wife will be their teacher but life is hard and the instruction doesnt actually happen and neither does much else in the way of nurturing like decent food or proper clothing jabs for this or that disease dentistry anything really the sorts of things typical children take for granted when social workers come round the children hide and finally because the family keeps moving they slip through the cracks all three of them for years actually when they finally come to light the eldest girl is thirteen years old and the younger twothe twins a boy and a girlare ten they cant read they cant write theyre covered in sores their teeth are quite bad theyve never seen a doctor and the girlby this i mean the thirteenyearoldactually has no hair it hasnt been shaved its fallen out theyre removed at once large hue and cry local newspapers covering the story complete with pictures the twins are placed with a family in plymouth the thirteenyearold is sent to falmouth there shes ultimately adopted by the couple who begin as her foster parents she is soso filled up by their love for her that she puts her past behind her completely she changes her name to something she thinks of as pretty of course she has no idea how to spell it so she misspells it and her new parents are charmed daidre it is they say welcome to your new life daidre and she never goes back to visit who she was never she puts it behind her and she never speaks of it and no oneno onein her present life knows a thing about it because it is her deepest shame can you understand this no how could you but thats how it is and thats how it remains until her sister tracks her down and insistsbegsthat she come to this place the very last place on earth that she can bear to come the one place she has promised herself that no one from her present life will ever learn of is that why you lied to di hannaford about your route to cornwall lynley asked her daidre didnt reply she opened her door and lynley did likewise they stood for a moment surveying the home shed left eighteen years earlier aside from the caravanunimaginably once the domicile of five peoplethere was little else a ramshackle building seemed to hold the equipment for extracting tin from the stones in which it was found and leaning up against this were three wheelbarrows of ancient vintage along with two bicycles with rusty panniers hanging from their sides at one time someone had planted a few terracotta pots with geraniums but these were languishing two of them on their sides and cracked with the plants sprawled out like supplicants begging for a merciful end my name daidre said was edrek udy do you know the meaning of edrek thomas he said that he didnt he found that he didnt want her to go further he was filled with sadness that hed unthinkingly invaded a life shed worked so hard to forget edrek she said means regret in cornish come along and meet my family jago reeth didnt look the least bit surprised he also didnt look worried he looked as hed looked the first time bea had come upon him at liquidearth willing to be helpful she wondered if they were wrong about him he said that they could indeed have a word with him they could join him and his mate selevan penrule there in the inglenook or they could ask for a more private location bea said she reckoned theyd have their conversation at the station in casvelyn if he didnt mind he said politely fraid i do mind m i under arrest madam it was the madam that gave her pause it was the way he said it with the tone of someone who believes hes sitting in the catbird seat he went on with because less im mistaken i dont need to accept your hospitality if you know what i mean is there some reason youd prefer not to talk to us mr reeth not a bit f that he said but if were to talk well need to do it where i feel a comfort im not likely to feel in a police station if you know what i mean he smiled affably showing teeth long stained by tea and coffee get all tightened up if im indoors too long tightened up i cant speak much at all and i know this inside a station im likely to be tightened permanently if you know what i mean bea narrowed her eyes is that so bit of a claustrophobe i am reeths companion was listening to all this agog his gaze going from bea to jago to bea he said whas this about then jago to which bea replied would you like to bring your friend into the picture reeth said they want a word about santo kerne nother word ive spoke to them already then to bea and im dead chuffed to do it again eh often as you like lets just take ourselves out of the barwe cn decide where and when well do our speaking ds havers was about to say something shed opened her mouth when bea gave her the look hold off it said they would see what jago reeth was up to they followed him into the inns entry the bar door closing behind them they left the barman wiping out glasses and watching curiously they left selevan penrule saying to jago reeth have a care mate when they were alone jago reeth said in a voice altogether different from the one theyd heard him use not only a moment ago but also in their earlier conversations with him im afraid you didnt answer my question am i under arrest inspector should you be bea asked and thank you for discarding the persona inspector please dont play me for a fool youll find i know my rights better than most indeed you can say ive made a study of my rights so you can arrest me if you like and pray youve got enough to hold me at least six hours or nine at the most since you yourself would be doing the review after those first six hours wouldnt you but after thatwhat superintendent on earth will authorise a questioning period of twentyfour hours at this point in your investigation so you must decide what it is you want from me if its conversation then i must tell you that conversation isnt about to happen inside a lockup and if its a lockup that you want then ill have to insist on a solicitors presence and im likely to employ my primary right at that point one so often forgotten by those wishing to be helpful and that is dont please play ignorant with me you know as well as i that i neednt say another word to you despite how that will look frankly i dont care how it looks now what would you and your assistant here prefer a frank conversation or my kind and silent gaze resting upon you or the wall or the floor in the police station and if its to be a conversation then iand not youwill determine where it happens rather sure of yourself mr reeth or should i call you mr parsons inspector you may call me whatever you like he rubbed his hands together the gesture one would use to rid the palms of flour in baking or soil in planting so whats it to be at least bea told herself she had the answer to wily or ignorant as you wish mr reeth shall we ask for a private room here at the inn ive a better location in mind he told her if youll pardon me while i fetch my jacket theres another exit to the bar by the way so youll want to come with me if youre concerned i might do a runner bea nodded to ds havers the sergeant looked only too willing to accompany jago reeth just about anywhere the two of them disappeared into the bar for the length of time it took jago reeth to fetch his belongings and have whatever word he felt necessary with his friend in the inglenook they emerged and jago led the way outside theyd have to drive to get there he said had either one of them a mobile by the way he asked this last with deliberate courtesy obviously he knew they carried mobile phones bea expected him to make the requirement that they leave their mobile phones behind which she was about to tell him was a complete nonstarter but then he made an unexpected request id like mr kerne to be present that bea told him is not about to happen again the smile oh im afraid it must inspector hannaford unless of course you wish to arrest me and hold me for those nine hours you have available to you now as to mr kerne no bea said a short drive to alsperyl i assure you hell enjoy it i wont ask mr kerne i do think youll find that no asking will be necessary you merely need to make the offer a conversation about santo with jago reeth or with jonathan parsons if you prefer mr kerne will be happy to have that conversation any father who wants to know exactly what happened to his son on the dayor the nighthe died would have that conversation if you know what i mean sergeant havers said guv in an urgent tone bea knew she wanted a word and that word would doubtless be one of caution dont place this bloke in a position of power he doesnt determine the course of affairs we do were the cops after all but believing that was sophistry at this point the course was caution to be sure but it was going to have to be caution employed in a scenario devised by their suspect bea didnt like this but she didnt see another route to take other than to let him go on his way they could indeed hold him in custody for nine hours but while nine hours in a cell or even alone in an interview room might unnerve some people and prompt them to talk she was fairly certain nine hours or ninety were not going to unnerve jago reeth she said to him lead on mr reeth ill phone mr kerne from the car only two of them were inside the caravan a woman lay on a narrow banquette a furrylooking blanket tucked round her and her head on a caseless pillow whose edges were stained from perspiration she was an older woman although it was impossible to tell how old because she was emaciated and her hair was thin grey and uncombed her colour was very bad her lips were scaly her companion was a younger woman who could have been any age between twentyfive and forty with quite short hair of a colour and a condition that peroxide encouraged she wore a long pleated skirt of a tartan pattern heavily reliant on blue and yellow red knee socks and a heavy pullover she had no shoes on and she wore no makeup she squinted in their direction as they entered which suggested she either regularly wore or currently needed glasses she said mum heres edrek she sounded weary got a man with her as well not a doctor are you not brought a doctor have you edrek i told you were finished with doctors the woman on the banquette stirred her legs slightly but did not turn her head she was gazing at the water stains that hovered above them on the ceiling of the caravan like clouds ready to rain down rust her breathing was shallow and quick as evidenced by the rise and fall of her hands which were clasped in a disturbing corpselike posture high on her chest daidre spoke this is gwynder thomas my younger sister this is my mother my mother till i was thirteen that is shes called jen udy lynley glanced at daidre she spoke as if he and she were observers of a tableau on a stage lynley said to gwynder thomas lynley im not a doctor just afriend gwynder said posh voice and continued what shed been doing when they entered which was carrying a glass to the woman on the banquette it contained some sort of milky liquid she said in reference to it want you drinking this mum jen udy shook her head two of her fingers rose then fell wheres goron daidre asked and wheresyour father gwynder said your father s well no matter what you like although her choice of words could have carried a bitter undercurrent they did not do so where are they where else would they be daylight at the stream or in the shed dont know do i theyre wherever mum you got to drink this good for you the fingers lifted and fell again the head turned slightly trying to pull itself towards the back of the banquette and out of sight are they not helping you care for her gwynder daidre asked told you past the point of caring for her arent we and on to the point of waiting you cn make a difference in that gwynder sat at the top of the banquette by the stained pillow shed placed the glass on a ledge that ran along a window whose thin curtains were shut against the daylight shedding a jaundiced glow against her mothers face she lifted both the pillow and her mothers head and slid herself under them she reached for the glass again she held this to jen udys lips with one hand and with the othercurved round her headshe forced her mothers mouth to open liquid went in liquid came out the womans throat muscles moved as she swallowed at least part of it you need to get her out of here daidre said this place isnt good for her and it isnt good for you its unhealthy and cold and miserable know that dont i gwynder said thats why i want to take her you cant possibly believe that will do any good its what she wants gwynder shes not religious miracles are for believers to take her all the way tolook at her she doesnt even have the strength for the journey look at her for heavens sake miracles are for everyone and theyre what she wants what she needs f she doesnt go shes going to die she is dying s that what you want oh i expect it is you with your posh boyfriend there cant believe you even brought him down here hes not myhes a policeman gwynder slowly clutched at the front of her pullover as she took in this detail she said whyve you brought and to lynley were doing nought wrong cant make us leave the town council knowweve the rights of travellers arent bothering anyone and to daidre are there more of them out there you come to take her she wont go without a fight shell begin to scream cant believe that you would do this to her after everything after what exactly daidres voice sounded pinched after everything she did for me for you for all three of us you seem to have a very short memory and yours goes back to the start of time eh gwynder forced more of the liquid into their mothers mouth the result was much the same as before what drained out of her dribbled down her cheeks and onto the pillow gwynder tried to sort this out by brushing it off with little success she can be in hospice daidre said it doesnt have to go on this way were meant to leave her there alone without her family lock her up and wait till they give us the word shes gone well i wont do that will i and if you come to tell me thas the limit of what you mean to do to help her you leave with your fancy man whoever he says he is because hes not a cop cops dont talk like him gwynder please see reason get out edrek asked for your help and you said no thas how it is and well cope from here ill help within reason but i wont send the lot of you to lourdes or medjugorje or knock or anywhere else because it isnt reasonable it doesnt make sense there are no miracles are and one could happen to her shes dying of pancreatic cancer no one walks away from that shes got weeks or days or perhaps even hours andis this how you want her to die like this in this place inside this hovel without air or light or even a window to look at the sea with people who love her there is no love in this place there never was dont you say that gwynder began to weep just becausejust becausedont you say that daidre made a move towards her but stopped she raised a hand to her mouth behind her glasses lynley saw that her eyes filled with tears leave us to our weeks or days or hours then gwynder said just go do you need go lynley put his hand on daidres arm she looked at him she removed her glasses and wiped her eyes with the sleeve of her coat which shed not removed he said to her come and he urged her gently to the door hard fucking cunt gwynder said to their backs dyou hear me edrek hard fucking cunt keep your money keep your fancy boy keep your life dont need you or want you so dont come back hear me edrek im sorry i even asked you in the first place dont come back outside the caravan they paused lynley saw that tremors ran through daidres body he put his arm round her shoulders im terribly sorry he said who the hellre you lot the question came in a shout lynley looked in its direction two men had emerged from the shed they would be goron and daidres father he decided they approached in a hurry whas this then the older man said the younger said nothing there seemed to be something wrong with him openly he scratched at his testicles he snuffled loudly and like his twin in the caravan he squinted he nodded at them in a friendly fashion his father did not what dyou lot want udy asked his gaze went from lynley to daidre and back to lynley he seemed to be assessing everything about them but most particularly their shoes for some reason lynley saw why when he looked at udys own feet he wore boots but they were long past their prime the soles were split at the toes paying a call daidre had stepped away from lynleys embrace facetoface with her father she bore no resemblance either to him or to her brother what you doing here then udy said we got no need of dogooders round here we make it on our own and always have done so you lot clear out thiss private property this is and theres a sign posted it came to lynley that while the women in the caravan knew who daidre was the men did not that for some reason gwynder had sought and found her sister on her own perhaps knowing at some level that her mission was futile hence udy had no idea that he was speaking to his own daughter but when lynley considered this it seemed reasonable the thirteenyearold who had been his daughter was someone from the past not the accomplished educated woman before him lynley waited for daidre to identify herself she did not do so instead she gathered herself together fumbling with the zip on her jacket as if with the need to do something with her hands she said to the man yes well were leaving you do that he said we got a business were running here and we dont fancy trespassers comin round on the offseason we open in june and therell be bits and bobs aplenty for sale then thank you ill remember that and mind the sign as well if it says no trespassing thats what it bloody means and itll say no trespassing till were opened understand certainly we understand there was actually no posted sign that lynley had seen either one forbidding trespass or one indicating this desolate spot was a place of business but there seemed little enough reason to point out the mans delusion to him far wiser to clear out and to put this place and its people and their way of life behind them he understood then that this was exactly what daidre had done he also saw what her struggle now was he said come away and he put his arm round her shoulders once again and led her in the direction of her car he could feel the stares of the two men behind them and for reasons he didnt wish to consider just then he hoped they wouldnt realise who daidre was he didnt know what would happen if they realised it nothing dangerous surely at least nothing dangerous as one typically thought of danger but there were other hazards here besides the removal of ones personal safety there was the emotional minefield that lay between daidre and these people and he felt an urgency to remove her from it when they returned to the car lynley said he would drive daidre shook her head she said no no im fine when they climbed inside though she didnt start the engine at once instead she pulled some tissues from the glove box and blew her nose then she rested her arms on the top of the steering wheel and peered out at the caravan in the distance so you see she said he made no reply again her hair had fallen over the frames of her glasses again he wanted to push it away from her face again he did not they want to go to lourdes they want a miracle they have nothing else to hang their hopes on and certainly no money to finance what they want which is where i come in which is why gwynder found me so do i do this for them do i forgive these people for what they did for how we lived for what they couldnt be am i responsible for them now what do i owe them besides life itself i mean the fact of life and not what ive done with it and what does it mean anyway to owe someone for having given birth to you surely thats not the most difficult part of taking on parenthood is it i hardly think so which means the rest of itthe rest of being a parentthey utterly mangled he did touch her then he did what hed seen her do herself take the hair and tuck it back his fingers touched the curve of her ear he said why did they come back your brother and sister were they never adopted there wasthey called it an accident their foster parents they called it goron playing with a plastic bag but i think there was more to it than that it probably should have been calledwhatever it wasdisciplining an overactive little boy in the wrong way in any event he was damaged and deemed unadoptable by people who saw him and met him gwynder might have been adopted but she wouldnt be parted from him so they moved from home to home together through the system for years when they were old enough they came back here she smiled bleakly as she looked at him i wager this placeas well as this storyisnt much like what youre used to is it thomas im not certain it matters he wanted to say more but he was unsure how to put it so he settled with are you willing to call me tommy daidre my family and friends she held up her hand i think not she said because of this no because this matters to me jago reeth made it clear that he wanted ben kerne alone with no hangerson from his family present he suggested hedras hut for the venue and he used the word venue as if a performance would be given there bea told him he was a bloody damn fool if he expected the lot of them to traipse out to the sea cliff where that ancient perch was he replied that fool or not if she wanted a conversation with him he knew his rights and he was going to employ them she told him that one of his rights was not the right to decide where their meeting with ben kerne would occur he smiled and begged to differ with her it might not have been his right he said but the fact of the matter was that she probably wanted him to be in a location where he felt easy with conversation and hedras hut was that location theyd be cosy enough there out of the cold and the wind snug as four bugs rolled in the same rug if she knew what he meant hes got something up his sleeve was sergeant haverss assessment of the situation once they set off trailing jago reeths defender in the direction of alsperyl theyd wait at the village church for mr kerne jago had informed them best phone the superintendent and let him know where were going havers went on id have backup as well those blokes from the station got to be a way they can hide themselves round the place not unless they disguise themselves as cows sheep or gulls bea told her this blokes thought of all the angles lynley bea found wasnt answering his mobile which made her curse the man and wonder why shed bothered to give him a phone in the first place wheres the blasted man got off to she asked and then replied to her own question with a grim declaration of well i wager we know the answer to that dont we at alsperyl which was no great distance from the salthouse inn they remained in their respective cars parked close to the village church when ben kerne finally joined them theyd been sitting there for nearly thirty minutes during this time bea had phoned the station to give the word where they were and phoned ray to do likewise ray said beatrice are you barking mad dyou have any idea how irregular this is ive got half a dozen ideas she told him ive also got sod all to work with unless this bloke gives me something i can use you cant think he intends i dont know what he intends but there will be three of us and one of him and if we cant manage youll check him for weapons im a fool but not a bloody fool ray im having whoevers out on patrol in your area head to alsperyl dont do that if i need backup i can easily phone the casvelyn station for it i dont care what you can and cannot do theres pete to consider and if it comes down to it theres myself as well i wont rest easy unless i know youve got proper backup christ this is bloody irregular as youve said whos with you at present sergeant havers another woman where the hell is lynley what about that sergeant from the station he looked like he had half a wit about him for gods sake bea ray this blokes round seventy years old hes got some sort of palsy if we cant take care of ourselves round him we need to be carted off nonetheless goodbye darling she rang off and shoved the mobile into her bag shortly after she finished her phone callsalso telling collins and mcnulty at the casvelyn station where she wasben kerne arrived he got out of his car and zipped his windcheater to the chin he glanced at jago reeths defender in some apparent confusion he then saw bea and havers parked next to the lichenous stone wall that defined the churchyard and he walked over to them as he approached they got out of the car jago reeth did likewise bea saw that jago reeths eyes were fixed on santo kernes father she saw that his expression had altered from the easy affability that hed shown them in the salthouse inn now his features fairly blazed she imagined it was the look seasoned warriors had once worn when they finally had the necks of their enemies beneath their boots and a sword pressing into their throats jago reeth said nothing to any of them he merely jerked his head towards a kissing gate at the west end of the car park next to the churchs notice board bea spoke if were meant to attend you mr reeth then i have a condition as well he raised an eyebrow the extent to which he apparently intended to communicate until they got to his preferred destination put your hands on the bonnet and spread your legs and trust me im not interested in checking to see what sort of cobblers youve got jago cooperated havers and bea patted him down his only weapon was a biro havers took this and tossed it over the wall into the churchyard jagos expression said satisfied bea said carry on he headed in the direction of the kissing gate he did not wait there to see if they were accompanying him he was apparently perfectly certain that they would follow ben kerne said to bea whats going on whyve you asked me who is that inspector youve not met mr reeth before this thats jago reeth santo spoke about him the old surfer working for madlyns dad santo quite liked him id no idea no ive not met him i doubt hes actually a surfer although he talks the talk he doesnt look familiar to you should he as jonathan parsons perhaps ben kernes lip parted but he said nothing he watched reeth trudging towards the kissing gate wheres he going he asked where hes willing to talk to us and to you bea put her hand on kernes arm but youve no need to listen youve no need to follow him his condition to speak to us was to have you present and i realise this is half mad and the other half dangerous but hes got usthats the cops and not youby the short and curlies and the only way were going to get a word from him is to play it his way for now on the phone you didnt say parsons i didnt want you driving here like a madman and i dont want you like a madman now we already have one on our hands i believe and two would be overwhelming mr kerne i cant tell you how far out on a limb we are with this entire approach so i wont even go into it are you able to listen to what he has to say more are you willing did he kerne seemed to search for a way to put it that wouldnt make what he had to say into a fact he might have to accept did he kill santo thats what were going to talk to him about are you able he nodded he shoved his hands into the pockets of his windcheater and indicated with a tilt of his head that he was ready they set out towards the kissing gate on the other side of this gate a field provided grazing for cows and the way towards the sea edged along a barbedwire fence the path they walked on was muddy and uneven marked deeply by ruts made from a tractors wheels at the far end of the field lay another field fenced off from the first by more barbed wire and accessed through yet another kissing gate ultimately they walked perhaps half a mile or more and their destination was the southwest coast path which crossed the second field high above the sea the wind was fierce here coming onshore in continuous gusts on these the seabirds rose and fell kittiwakes called herring gulls replied a lone green cormorant shot up from the cliff side as up ahead jago reeth approached the edge the bird dove down rose and began to circle looking for prey bea thought in the turbulent water they headed south on the coastal path but within some twenty yards a break in the gorse that stood between the path and perdition indicated a set of steep stone stairs this bea saw was their destination jago reeth disappeared down them she said to her companions hang on then and she went to see where the stone steps led she was reckoning they were a means to get to the beach which lay some two hundred feet below the cliff top and she intended to tell jago reeth that she had no intention of putting her life haverss life and ben kernes life at risk by following him down some perilous route to the water but she found the steps went down only as far as fifteen of them could descend and they terminated in another path this one narrow and heavily grown on each side with gorse and sedge it too headed south but for no great distance its conclusion was an ancient hut built partially into the face of the cliff that backed it jago reeth she saw had just reached the huts doorway and swung it open he saw her on the steps but made no further gesture their eyes met briefly before he ducked inside the old structure she returned to the top of the cliff she spoke above the sound of the wind the sea and the gulls hes just below in the hut he might well have something stowed inside so im going in first you can wait on the path but dont come near till i give you the word she went down the steps and along the path the gorse brushing against the legs of her trousers she reached the hut and found that jago had indeed prepared for this moment not with weapons however either he or someone else had earlier supplied the hut with a spirit stove a jug of water and a small box of supplies the man was incredibly brewing tea the hut was fashioned from the driftwood of wrecked ships of which there had been countless numbers over the centuries it was a small affair with a bench that ran round three sides and an uneven stone floor as long as it had been in this place people had carved their initials into its walls so they had the appearance now of a wooden rosetta stone this one immediately comprehensible and speaking both of lovers and of people whose internal insignificance made them seek an outward expressionany outward expressionthat would give their existence meaning bea told reeth to step away from the spirit stove which he did willingly enough she checked it and the rest of his supplies of which there were few enough plastic cups sugar tea powdered milk in sachets one spoon for shared stirring she was surprised the old man hadnt thought of crumpets she ducked back out of the door and motioned havers and ben kerne to join her once all four of them were inside the hut there was barely room to move but jago reeth still managed to make the tea and he pressed a cup upon each of them like the hostess of an edwardian house party then he doused the flame on the stove and set the stove itself on the stones beneath the bench perhaps as a way of reassuring them that he had no intention of using it as a weapon at this bea decided to pat him down again for good measure having put the spirit stove in the hut in advance of their arrival there was no telling what else hed stowed in the place but he was weaponless as before with the huts double door shut and fastened the sound of the wind and the gulls crying was muted the atmosphere was close and the four adults took up nearly every inch of the space bea said youve got us here mr reeth at your pleasure what is it youd like to tell us jago reeth held his tea in both hands he nodded and spoke not to bea but to ben kerne and his tone was kind losing a son youve got my deepest sympathy its the worst grief a man can know losing any childs a blow ben kerne sounded wary it appeared to bea that he was trying to read jago reeth as was she the air seemed to crackle with anticipation next to bea sergeant havers took out her notebook bea expected reeth to tell her to put it away but instead the old man nodded and said ive no objection and to kerne have you when ben shook his head jago added if youve come wired inspector thats fine as well there are always things wanting documentation in a situation like this bea wanted to say what shed earlier thought hed considered all the angles but she was waiting to see hear or intuit the one angle he hadnt yet considered it had to be here somewhere and she needed to be ready to deal with it when it raised its scaly head above the muck for a breath of air she said do go on but theres something worse about losing a son jago reeth said to ben kerne unlike a daughter a son carries the name hes the link between the past and the future and its more even than just the name at the end of the day he carries the reason for it all for this he gave a look around the hut as if the tiny building somehow contained the world and the billions of lifetimes present in the world im not sure i make that sort of distinction ben said any lossof a childof any child he didnt go on he cleared his throat mightily jago reeth looked pleased losing a son to murder is a horror though isnt it the fact of murder is almost as bad as knowing who killed him and not being able to lift a finger to bring the bloody sod to justice kerne said nothing nor did bea or barbara havers bea and kerne held their tea undrunk in their hands and ben kerne set his carefully on the floor next to her bea felt havers stir that parts bad jago said as is the not knowing not knowing what exactly mr reeth bea asked the whys and the wherefores about it and the hows bloke can spend the rest of his life tossing and turning wondering and cursing and wishingyou know what i mean i expect or if not now you will eh its hell on earth and theres no escaping i feel for you mate for what youre going through now and for whats to come thank you ben kerne said quietly bea had to admire him for his control she could see how white the tops of his knuckles were i knew your boy santo lovely lad bit full of himself like all boys are when theyre that age eh but lovely and since this tragedy happened to him since he was murdered bea corrected jago reeth murder reeth said is a tragedy inspector no matter what kind of game of scentandchase you lot might think it is its a tragedy and when it happens the only peace available is in knowing the truth of what happened and having others know it as well if he added with a brief smile you know what i mean and as i knew santo ive thought and thought about what happened to the lad and ive decided that if an old brokendown bloke like myself can give you any peace mr kerne thats what i owe you you dont owe me we all owe each other jago cut in its forgetting that that leads us to tragedies he paused as if to let this sink in he drained his tea and put the cup next to him on the bench so what i want to do is tell you how i reckon this happened to your boy because ive thought about it see as im sure you have and sure the cops here have as well who wouldve done this to such a fine lad i been asking myself for days howd they manage it and why none of that brings santo back does it ben kerne asked steadily course not but the knowingthe final understanding of it all i wager theres peace in that and thats what ive got to offer you peace so heres what i reckon was no i dont think so mr reeth bea had a sudden glimmer what reeth intended and in that glimmer she saw where this could lead but ben kerne said let him go on please i want to hear him out inspector this will allow him to please let him continue reeth waited affably for bea to concur she nodded sharply but she wasnt happy to irregular and mad she had to add provocative so heres what i reckon jago said someone has a score to settle and this someone sets out to settle that score on the life of your lad what sort of score you wonder right could be anything couldnt it new score old score it doesnt matter but a form of accountings waiting out there and santos lifes the means of settling it so this killercould be a man could be a woman doesnt much matter does it because the point is the lad and the lads death see which is what cops like these two always forgetthis killer gets to know your lad because knowing hims going to provide access and knowing the lad leads to the means as well because your boys an openhearted sort and he talks about this and that but as things turn out he talks a lot about his dad same as most boys do he says his dads riding him hard for lots of reasons but mostly because he wants women and surfing and not settling down and who can blame him as hes only eighteen his dad on the other hand has his own wants for the boy which makes the boy roil and talk and roil some more which makes him look forwhat dyou call it a substitute dad a surrogate dad bens voice was heavier now that would be the word or perhaps a surrogate mum of course or a surrogatewhat priest confessor priestess whatever at any rate this personman or woman young or oldsees a door of trust opening and heor she of coursewalks right through it if you know what i mean he was keeping his options open bea concluded he was as he had said himself no bloody fool and the advantage he had in this moment was the years hed had to think about the approach he wanted to use when the time came for it so this personlets call him or her the confessor for want of a better termthis confessor makes cups of tea and cups of chocolate and more cups of tea and more cups of chocolate and offers biscuits but more important offers a place for santo to do whatever and to be whoever and the confessor waits and soon enough reckons that means are available to settle whatever score needs settling the boys had yet another blowup with his dad its an argument that goes nowhere like always and this time the lads taken all of his climbing equipment from where hes kept it in the pastright alongside dadsand hes stowed it in the boot of his car what does he intend its that classic thing ill show him i will ill show him what sort of bloke i am he thinks im nothing but a lout but ill show him and what better way to do it than with his own sport which ill do better than hes ever managed so that puts his equipment within the grasp of the confessor and the confessor sees what well call the way at this ben kerne lowered his head bea said mr kerne i think this is he said no he raised his head with effort more he said to jago reeth the confessor waits for an opportunity which presents itself soon enough because the lads open and easy with his belongings one of which is his car this is nothing at all to get into as its never locked and a quick manoeuver opens the boot and there it all is selection is the key perhaps a chock stone or a carabiner or a sling even the harness will do all four perhaps no that likely would beif youll pardon the expressionoverkill if its a sling theres not a problem in the world as its nylon or whatever and easily cut by shears a sharp knife a razor whatever if its something else things are a bit trickier as everything else save the ropeand rope seems too bloody obvious a choice not to mention too noticeableis metal and a cutting device is going to be necessary how to find one purchase one no that would be traceable borrow one again someones going to recall the borrowing yes use one without the knowledge of the owner that seems more possible and decidedly more sensible but where to find one friend associate acquaintance employer someone whose movements are intimately known because theyve been watched just as intimately any of those yes so the confessor chooses the moment and the deed is done one cut does it and afterwards no sign is left behind because as weve said the confessors no fool and he knowsor she knows because as weve seen she is as possible as he when it comes to thisthat its crucial there be no evidence afterwards and the beauty of it all is that the equipments been marked with tape by the lador even by his father perhapsso that it can be distinguished from everyone elses because this is what climbers do you see they mark their equipment because so often they climb together its safer that way climbing together you see and this tells the confessor that theres little to no chance that anyone other than the lad will use this sling this carabiner this harnesswhatever it was that was damaged because of course i myself dont know but ive thought about it and heres what ive come up with the one thing the confessor has to take care with is the tape used to identify the equipment if heor she of coursebuys more tape theres a chance the new tape wont match exactly or can be traced back god knows how but theres that possibility so the thing is to keep that tape usable the confessor manages this and its quite a project because that tape is tough like electrical tape heor she of course like i saidrewraps it just so and maybe its not quite as tight as it once was but at least its the same and will the lad even notice unlikely and even if he does what hes likely to do is smooth it down apply more tape on top something like that so once the deed is done and the equipments replaced all thats left is waiting and once what happens happensand it is a tragedy no one doubts thattheres nothing really that cant be explained away theres always something mr reeth bea said jago looked at her in a kindly way fingerprints on the boot of the car in the interior on the keys to the car inside the boot the confessor and the boy spent hours together perhaps they even worked together atlets say it was at his dads business they each rode in the others car they were mates they were pals they were surrogate father and surrogate son they were surrogate mother and surrogate son they were surrogate brothers they were lovers they wereanything it doesnt matter you see because it all can be explained away hair inside the boot of the car the confessors someone elses same thing really the confessor planted someone elses or even his own or her own because it can be a woman weve already seen that what about fibres clothing fibresperhaps on the tape that marked the equipment wouldnt that be lovely but the confessor helped wrap that equipment or he or she touched that equipment becausewhy because the boot was used for other things as wella surfing kit perhapsand things would get moved round here and there and in and out what about access to the equipment everyone had that every single person in the poor lads life what about motive well nearly everyone it seems had that as well so at the end of the day there is no answer there is only speculation but no case to present which the killer probably considers the beauty of the crime but which you and i know mr kerne is any crimes biggest horror that the killer simply walks away everyone knows who did it everyone admits it everyone shakes a head and says what a tragedy what a useless senseless maddening i think thats enough mr reeth or mr parsons bea said horror because the killer walks away now heor she of coursehas done his business i said thats enough and the killer cant be touched by the cops and all the cops can do is sit there and drink their tea and wait and hope to find something somewhere somedaybut they get busy dont they other things on their plates they shove you to one side and say dont ring us every day man because when a case goes coldlike this one willtheres no point to ringing so well ring you if and when we can make an arrest but it never comes does it that arrest so you end up with nothing but ashes in an urn and they may as well have burnt your body on the day they burned his because the soul of you is gone anyway he was finished it seemed his recital completed all that was left was the sound of harsh breathing which was jago reeths and outside the cry of gulls and the gusting of the wind and the crash of the surf in a suitably wellrounded television drama bea thought reeth would rise to his feet now he would dash for the door and throw himself over the cliff having at long last achieved the vengeance hed anticipated and having no further reason to continue living hed take the leap and join his dead jamie but this unfortunately was not a television drama his face seemed lit from within spittle had collected at the corners of his mouth his tremors had worsened he was waiting she saw for ben kernes reaction to his performance for ben kernes embracing of a truth that no one could alter and no one could resolve ben finally lifted his head and gave the reaction santo he said was not my son chapter twentynine the cry of the gulls seemed to grow louder and from far below them the slamming of waves on rock indicated that the tide was in ben thought what this meant and the irony of it excellent surfing conditions today the breathing that had been jago reeths stopped drawn in and held as perhaps the old man decided whether to believe what ben had told him for ben it no longer mattered what anyone believed nor finally did it matter at all that santo had not been his by blood for he saw that they had been father and son in the only way that mattered between a man and a boy which had everything to do with history and experience and nothing to do with a single blindly swimming cell that through sheerest chance makes piercing contact with an egg thus his failures were every bit as profound as a blood fathers would have been towards a son for hed made every paternal move out of fear and not love always waiting for santo to show the colours of his true origins since after their adolescence ben had never known any one of his wifes lovers he had waited for dellens least desirable characteristics to surface in her son and when anything remotely dellenlike had appeared that had been bens focus and passion he as much as moulded santo into his mother so great was the emphasis he had placed upon anything in the boy that had seemed like her he wasnt ben repeated my son how pathetically true he realised now jago reeth said youre a bloody liar you always were i only wish that was the case ben saw another detail now it fell into place neatly and corrected his previous misunderstanding he said to reeth she talked to you didnt she i thought she meant the police but she didnt she talked to you di hannaford said mr kerne youve no need to say anything ben said he needs to know the truth i had nothing to do with what happened to jamie i wasnt there jago reeth said abruptly liar youd say that wouldnt you because its the truth id had a scuffle with him he tossed me out of his party but i went for a wander and then i went home what dellen told you he wasnt sure then that he could go on but he knew that he had to if only to do the only thing that could be done to avenge santos death what dellen told you she told you out of jealousy id been with your daughter a snog wed got carried away dellen saw us and she had to get even because thats what she and i did to each other tit for tat together and apart in love and in hate it never mattered we were bound by something that we couldnt break free of youre a liar now as you were then so she went to you and she told you i didwhatever she told you i did but what i know about that night is what you know and thats what ive always known jamieyour sonwent down to that cave for some reason after that party and thats where he died dont you bloody claim that reeth said fiercely you ran off you left pengelly cove and you never returned you had a reason to leave and we both know what it was yes i had a reason because no matter what i told him my own dad like you believed i was guilty with damn good cause what you will mr parsons as you wish now and forever if you like but i wasnt there so i suppose your job isnt done is it because what she told youand it was you she told wasnt it she lied why would she ever why would anyone ben saw it the reason the cause beyond the tit for tat and the love and hate beyond the parry and thrust of what had gone for their relationship for nearly thirty years he saw because thats who she is he said because thats simply what she does he left it at that he got to his feet at the huts doorway he paused one small matter left unclear to him he said to reeth have you watched me all these years mr parsons has that really been the extent of your life how youve defined yourself waiting till i had a boy the very same age as jamie was when jamie died and then moving in for the kill you dont know what its like reeth said but you will man you bloody sodding will or did you find me because of ben considered this because of adventures unlimited the purest chance reading the newspaper somewherewherever you wereand seeing that story poor alan worked so hard to arrange was that it that story in the mail on sunday then dashing here and establishing yourself and waiting because youd got so bloody good at biding your time because you thoughtyou believedthat if you did to me what you were so sure id done to you that wouldwhat give you peace close the circle finish things properly how can you believe that youre going to know reeth said youre going to see because what ive said hereevery word of it manis speculation i know my rights i made a study of my rights so when i walk out of here dont you see it doesnt matter ben replied because im walking out of here first he did so he closed the door behind him and strode along the path towards the steps his throat ached with the strain of holding back everything hed been holding backeven without acknowledging that factfor so many years he heard his name called and he turned di hannaford joined him she said hes made an error somewhere mr kerne they always make an error were going to find it no one thinks of everything i want you to hang on ben shook his head it doesnt matter he said again will it bring santo back hes got to pay thats how this works hes already paying and even if he isnt hes going to see the only thing there is to see theres no peace for him in what hes done he cant scrub it from his brain none of us can do that nonetheless hannaford said well be pursuing this if you must ben said but not for my sake for santos sake then hes owed he is god how he is hes just not owed this ben walked from her making his way along the path and up the stone steps to the top of the cliff there he followed the southwest coast path the short distance to the pastures theyd crossed and he returned to his car they could do with jago reeth or jonathan parsons what they wished to do or indeed what they were able to do within the confines of the law and the rights he said he knew so well for whatever they did or did not do would not be sufficient to absolve ben of the burden of responsibility that would always be his this responsibility he saw went far beyond santos death it was described by the choices hed made time and again and what those choices had done to mould the very people hed claimed to love in days to come he knew he would weep he couldnt now he was numb but the grief of loss was inescapable and he accepted that for the first time in his life when he got home he went in search of her alan was at work in his office on the phone with someone and standing at a bulletin board on which hed affixed two lines of index cards which ben recognised as the plan for the video he wished to make about adventures unlimited kerra was talking to a tall blond youth a prospective instructor no doubt ben didnt bother either of them he climbed the stairs she wasnt in the family quarters nor did she appear to be anywhere else in the building he felt a fluttering in his chest at this and he went to the wardrobe to check but her clothing was still there and the rest of her belongings were in the chest of drawers he finally saw her from the window a figure in black on the beach whom he might have taken as a surfer in a wet suit had he not possessed a lifetime of knowledge about the shape of her and the texture of her hair she was standing with her back to the hotel as the tide was high most of the beach was covered and the water was lapping round her ankles it would still be frigid this time of year but she wore no protection against it he went to join her he saw when he reached her that she was carrying a bundle of photographs she was hollow eyed she looked nearly as numb as he himself felt he said her name she said i hadnt thought of him in years but there he was in my mind today like hed been waiting to get in all this time who hugo a name hed never once heard before and not one he cared about hearing now he said nothing far out in the waves five surfers formed a lineup a swell rose behind them and ben watched to see who would be in position to drop in none of them were the wave broke too far ahead of them leaving them waiting for the next one in the set and another attempt at a ride dellen continued i was his special one he made a fuss over me and he asked my parents could he take me to the cinema to the seal sanctuary to the christmas panto he bought me clothes he wanted to see me in because i was his favourite niece weve got something special he said i wouldnt buy you these things and take you to these places if you werent especially special to me out to sea one of the surfers was successful ben saw he dropped in and caught the wave and he carved seeking what every surfer seeks the racing green room whose shimmering walls rise and curve and endlessly shift enclosing and then releasing it was a beautiful ride and when it was over the surfer dropped down onto the board and made his way out to the others again accompanied by the yelps of his mates jokingly they barked like dogs when he reached them one of them touched fists with him ben saw this and felt a sore place in his heart he forced himself to attend to what dellen was saying it felt wrong she said but uncle hugo said it was love the special part was being singled out not my brother not my cousins but me so if he touched me here and asked me to touch him there was that bad or was it just something that i didnt understand ben felt her look at him and he knew he was meant to look at her as well he was meant to look at her face and read the suffering there and he was meant to meet her emotion with his own but he couldnt do it for he found that a thousand uncle hugos couldnt change a single one of the facts if indeed there was an uncle hugo at all next to him he felt her move he saw she was riffling through the pictures she had with her he halfexpected her to produce uncle hugo from within the stack but she didnt instead she brought forth a photograph he recognised mum and dad and two kids on summer holiday a week on the isle of wight santo had been eight years old kerra twelve in the picture they were at a restaurant table no meal in evidence so they must have handed the camera to the waiter as they first sat asking him to snap the happy family all of them were smiling as required look at how were enjoying ourselves pictures were the things of happy memories they were also the instruments one used retrospectively to avoid the truth for in kerras small face ben could now read the anxiety that desire to be just good enough to stop the wheel from turning another time in santos face he could see the confusion a childs awareness of a present hypocrisy without the accompanying comprehension in his own expression he could see the gritty determination to make things right and in dellens facewhat was always there knowledge and anticipation she was wearing a red scarf twined through her hair they gravitated towards her in the picture all of them slightly leaning in her direction his hand was over hers as if hed hold her there at the table instead of where she doubtless wished to be she cant help herself hed said time and again what hed failed to see was that he could he took the picture from her and said to his wife its time for you to go she said where im not sure he said st ives plymouth back to truro pengelly cove perhaps your familys there still theyll help you if you need help if thats what you want at this point she was silent he looked from the photo to her her eyes had darkened she said ben how can you after whats happened dont he said its time for you to go please she said how will i survive youll survive he told her we both know that what about you kerra what about the business alans here hes a very good man and otherwise kerra and i will cope weve learned to do that very well selevan had found that his plans altered once the police came to the salthouse inn he told himself that he couldnt just selfishly head out with tammy for the scottish border without knowing what was going on and more important without discovering if there was something he could do to assist jago should assistance be required he couldnt imagine why such assistance might be necessary but he thought it best to remain where he wasmore or lessand wait for further information it wasnt long in coming he reckoned jago wouldnt return to the salthouse inn so he himself didnt wait there instead he went back to sea dreams and paced in the caravan for a while taking a nip now and then from a flask hed filled to see him on the trip to the border and finally he went outside and over to jagos caravan he didnt go within he had a duplicate key to the place but it just didnt feel right although he reckoned jago wouldnt have minded had he entered instead he waited on the top of the metal steps where a wider one played the role of porch and was suitable for his bum jago rolled into sea dreams some ten minutes later selevan got creakily to his feet he shoved his hands into the pockets of his jacket and walked over to jagos preferred spot to park the defender he said you all right then mate when jago got out they didnt give you aggro down the station did they not a bit jago told him when it comes to the cops a small measure of preparation is all thats needed things go your way then instead of theirs surprises them a bit but thats what life is one bloody surprise after another spose selevan said but he felt a twinge of uneasiness and he couldnt exactly say why there was something about jagos way of talking something in the tone that wasnt altogether the jago he knew he said warily they didnt rough you up mate jago barked a laugh those two cows not likely we just had a bit of a conversation and that was the end of it long time in coming but its over now whas going on then nothing mate something went on long time ago but thats all finished my work here is done jago passed selevan and stepped up to the door of the caravan he hadnt locked it selevan saw so thered been no need for him to wait on the steps in the first place jago went inside and selevan followed he stood uncertainly just at the door however because he wasnt sure what was going on he said you made redundant jago jago had gone into the bedroom at the end of the caravan selevan couldnt see him but he could hear the noise of a cupboard opening and of something being dragged from the shelf above the clothing rail in a moment jago appeared in the doorway a large duffel bag drooping from his hand what he asked i asked were you made redundant you said your work was finished you been sacked or something jago looked as if he was thinking about this which was strange as far as selevan was concerned one was made redundant or not one was sacked or not surely the question didnt need consideration finally jago smiled quite a slow smile that wasnt much like him he said thats exactly it mate redundant i was made redundantlong time ago he paused and looked thoughtful and next spoke to himself more than a quarter of a century he said a long time in coming what selevan felt a restless urgency to get to the root of the matter because this jago was different to the jago hed been sitting in the inglenook with for the last six or seven months and he vastly preferred that other jago who spoke directly and not inwell in parables or the like he said mate has something happened with them cops did they do something to you dont sound like yourself selevan could imagine what the cops might do true theyd been women but fact was that jago was an old codger round the same age as selevan and he was in poor condition for his years besides that had they taken him to the station thered be blokes thereother copswho could rough him up and cops could rough one up in places where no evidence was left selevan knew that he watched telly especially american films on sky hed seen how it was done bit of pressure on the thumbnails couple of sewing needles screwed into the skin it wouldnt take much on a bloke like jago onlyhe wasnt acting like a man whod suffered some sort of humiliation at the hands of the cops was he jago put the duffel on his bedselevan could see this much from where he still stood unsure whether to sit or stand to go or remainand he began opening the drawers of the builtin chest and what came to selevan then was what should have come the moment he saw the duffel in jagos hands his friend was leaving he said where you off to jago what i said jago came to the door again this time a small stack of neatly folded shorts and vests in his hands thingsre finished here its time for me to shove off never stay in one place long anyway follow the sun the surf the seasons but the seasons here its just coming on its round the corner where you going to find a better season than what youd get here jago hesitated half turned towards the bed it seemed that this was something hed not considered the where of his journey selevan saw his shoulders alter there was something less definite about his posture selevan pressed the point and anyways you got friends here that counts for something lets face it you see a doctor yet for those shakes of yours i reckon theyre going to get worse and then wherell you be if you set off on your own jago seemed to think about this doesnt much matter like i said my work is finished alls left is the waiting for what foryou know neither one of us is a hatchling mate for dying you mean thas rubbish you got years what the bloody hell did those coppers do to you not a sodding thing cant believe you jago if youre talking of dying dyings got to be faced sos living for that matter theyre part of each other and theyre meant to be natural selevan felt a margin of relief when he heard this he didnt like to think of jago pondering the idea of dying because he didnt like to think what this suggested about his friends intentions he said glad to hear that at least the natural bit because jago smiled slowly as comprehension dawned he shook his head in the way a fond grandparent might react to a beloved childs mischief oh that well i could end it easy enough couldnt i since ive finished up here and theres not much point in carrying on theres lots of places to do it in these parts cause itd look like an accident and no oned know the difference eh but if i did that might end it for him as well and we cant have that no theres no end to something like this mate not if i can help it cadan had just arrived at liquidearth when the phone call came he could hear that his father was in the shaping room and jago was nowhere to be found so he answered it himself a bloke said that lewis angarrack and when cadan said no he said fetch him eh got to talk to him cadan knew better than to bother lew in the middle of shaping a board but the bloke insisted that this couldnt wait and no he didnt want to leave a message so cadan went to fetch his father not opening the door but pounding on it to be heard over the tools the power planer switched off lew himself appeared his mask lowered and his eye gear around his neck when cadan told him there was a phone call for him lew looked into the glassing area and said jago not back didnt see his car outside whatre you doing here then cadan felt that old plummeting of his spirits he stifled a sigh phone he reminded lew lew took off the latex gloves he wore for work and he strode to the reception area cadan followed for want of anything better to do although he peeked into the spraying room and considered the lineup of shaped boards to be painted as well as the kaleidoscope of bright colours that had been tested against the walls in reception he could hear his father saying whats that you sayno of course notwhere the hell is he cn you put him on the phone cadan wandered back out lew was behind the counter where the phone sat amid the mounds of paperwork on the card table that served as his desk he glanced at cadan and then away no lew said to the bloke on the other end of the line i didnt knowi damn well would have appreciated it if hed told mei know hes not well but all i can tell you is what he told me had to step out to speak to a mate in a bit of bother up at the salthouseyou then you know more than i do cadan clocked that they were talking about jago and he did question where the old man was jago had been nothing if not a model employee for his dad during the time hed worked at liquidearth indeed cadan often felt that jagos performance as a stellar worker bee was one of the reasons he himself looked so bad at work on time never out for illness not a complaint about anything nose to the grindstone perfectionist in what he had to do for jago not to be here now brought up the subject of why and made cadan listen more closely to the conversation his dad was having redundant god no no reason for that ive a pile of work and the last thing on my mind is making anyonewell then what did he sayfinished finished lew looked round the reception area particularly at the clipboard on which the orders for boards were attached there was a thick stack of them the mark of longtime surfers respect for lew angarracks work no computer design and computer shaping here but the real thing all of it done by hand so few craftsmen could do what lew did they were a dying breed their work an art form that would pass into surfing lore like the earliest long boards fashioned of wood in their place would come the hollowcore boards the computerised designs everything programmed into a machine that would belch out a product no longer lovingly shaped by a master who rode waves himself and consequently knew what an extra channel or the degree of tilt of a fin would truly do to a boards performance it was a pity really gone altogether lew was saying damnno theres nothing more i can tell you you seem to know more than i do anywayi couldnt sayive been busy myself he didnt seem any differenti cant say that i did shortly thereafter he rang off and he spent a moment staring at the clipboard jagos gone then he finally said what dyou mean gone cadan asked for the day forever something happen to him lew shook his head he just left what casvelyn thats it who was that cadan nodded at the phone although his father hadnt looked at him to see the nod bloke jago lives by in the caravan park talked to him as he was packing up but couldnt get much sense out of him lew took off his headphones and dropped them onto the table he leaned against the counter with its display of fins wax and other paraphernalia his hands supporting him and his head lowered as if he were studying what was inside the case well that buggers us he said a moment passed during which cadan saw lew reach up and rub his neck where it was no doubt sore from shaping the surfboard blanks he said good thing i came by then whys that i cn help you out lew raised his head he said cade im far too tired to argue with you just now no i dont mean what you think cadan told him i cn see how youd reckon i was seizing my moment now hell have to let me spray the boards but thats not what this is what is it then justme helping you i cn shape if you like not as good as you but you can show me or i cn glass or spray or do the hand sanding doesnt matter to me and why would you want to do that cadan cadan shrugged youre my dad he said bloods thicker thanwell you know what about adventures unlimited that didnt work out cadan saw his fathers expression alter to one of resignation he hastened to add i know what youre thinking but they didnt sack me its just that id rather work for you weve got something here and we shouldnt let itdie die there was the frightening word cadan hadnt realised just how frightening die actually was until this moment because hed spent his life so focused on another word entirely and that word was leave yet trying to stay one step ahead of loss didnt prevent loss from happening did it the bounder still bounded and other people still walked away as cadan himself had done time and again before it could be done to him as cadans father had done for much the same reasons but some things endured in spite of ones dread and one of them was the blessing of blood i want to help you cadan said ive been playing it stupid youre the expert after all and i reckon you know how i can learn this business and thats what you want to do learn this business right cadan said what about the bike the x games or whatever they are at the moment this is more important ill do what i can to keep it important cadan peered at his father closely then that good enough for you dad i dont understand why would you want to do it cade because of what i just called you you nutter what was that dad cadan said selevan had watched jago drive off and he wondered about all the time hed spent with the bloke he could come up with no answers to the questions that were filling his head no matter how he looked at things he couldnt suss out what the other man had meant and something told him that the entire subject didnt bear too much consideration anyway hed phoned liquidearth nonetheless in the hope that jagos employer might shed some light on the situation but what hed learned told him that whatever jago had meant by finished it wasnt connected to surfboards beyond that he realised he didnt want to know perhaps he was being an outandout coward but some things he decided were none of his business tammy wasnt one of them he got into the car with all her possessions packed and he drove to clean barrel surf shop he didnt go in at once to fetch her as there was time to dispense with before she closed the shop for the day so he parked down on the wharf and he walked from there to jills juices where he purchased a takeaway coffeeextra strong then he returned to the wharf where he walked the length of it on its north side edging along the canal several fishing boats nudged the dock here barely bobbing in the water mallards floated placidly near theman entire family of them with mum and dad and unbelievably a dozen babiesand a kayaker paddled silently in the direction of launceston taking exercise in the late afternoon selevan realised that it felt like spring it had been spring for more than six weeks now of course but that had been a spring of the calendar until this point this was a spring of weather true there was brisk wind off the sea but it felt different as the wind does when the weather shifts on it the scent of newly turned earth came to him from someones garden and he saw that in the window boxes of the towns library winter pansies had been replaced with petunias he walked to the end of the wharf where the old canal lock was closed holding back the water till someone wanted to go out to sea in one of the fishing boats from this vantage point he could see the town rising above him to the north with the old promontory king george hotela place for adventurous tourists nowacting as doorman to a different world things change selevan thought that had proved the case in his life even when it had seemed to him that nothing was ever going to change at all hed wanted a career in the royal navy to escape what hed seen as a life of unfaltering drudgery but the fact of the matter was that the details of that life had altered in minute ways which led to big ways which led to life not being drudgery at all if one just paid attention his kids grew he and the wife turned older a bull was brought by to service the cows calves were born the sky was bright one day and threatening the next david moved off to join the army nan ran off to marryone could call it good or bad or one could just call it life and life continued a bloke didnt get what he wanted all the time and thats just how it was one could thrash about and hate that fact or one could cope hed seen that daft poster in the library one time and hed scoffed at it when life gives you lemons make lemonade bloody stupid hed thought but not really he saw now not altogether he took a deep breath one could taste the salt air in this spot more than at sea dreams because sea dreams was way up on the cliff and here the sea was close yards away and it beat against the reefs and wore them down patiently drawn by the course of nature and physics or magnetic forces or whatever it was because he didnt know and it didnt matter he finished his takeaway coffee and crushed the cup in his hand he carried this back to a bin and paused there to light a fag which he smoked on the way to clean barrel there tammy was working at the till the cash drawer was open and she was counting up the days take alone in the shop she hadnt heard him come in he observed her in silence he saw dot in her which was odd as hed never seen the similarity before but there it was in the way she cocked her head and exposed an ear and the shape of that earthat little dip in the earlobeit was dot all right and he remembered that becauseoh this was the worst of it but hed seen that earlobe time and again as hed mounted her and done his loveless business on her and there couldnt have been a scrap of pleasure in it for the poor woman which he regretted now he hadnt loved her but that hadnt been a fault of hers had it although hed blamed her for not being whatever it was hed thought she should be in order for him to love her he harrumphed because things were dead tight inside him and a good harrumph had always loosened them up a bit the noise made tammy raise her head and when she saw him she looked a bit wary and who could blame her theyd been having rather a dicey time of it shed not spoken to him other than in polite response to what he said to her since hed found that letter under her mattress and waved it in her face shouldnt be in here alone he told her why not she put her hands on either side of the cash drawer and for a moment selevan thought she was doing it because she expected him to leap on the funds and shove them down the front of his flannel shirt but then she pulled it out altogether and carried it to the back room where extra inventory and cleaning supplies and the like were kept along with an overlarge antique safe she stowed the cash drawer inside this safe slammed its door home and twirled the combination lock then she shut the back room door locked this as well and put the key in a hidey spot that had been created for it on the underside of the telephone selevan said to her best ring up your guv girl he was aware that his voice was gruff but it was always gruff when he spoke to her and he couldnt make it any different she said why time to leave here her expression didnt change but her eyes did the shape of them just like her auntie nan selevan thought just like the time hed told nan that she could sodding shove off if she didnt like the house rules one of which was her dad deciding bloody who his daughter would see and when she would see him and believe you me lass its not going to be that yob with the motorbikes over my dead body five of them mind you five bleeding motorbikes and every time hed roar up on a new one with his fingernails all gone to grease and his knuckles blacked and who the bloody hell would have thought hed make a go of it and create thosewhat did they call them choppings chopped no choppers that was it choppers just like in america where everyone was bloody crazy and rich enough to buy just about anything werent they this is what you want hed bellowed at nan this this tammy didnt argue as nan might have done she didnt storm round the shop and slam things about to make a scene she said all right then grandie and she sounded resigned she added but i dont take it back whats that what i said before selevan frowned and tried to recall their last conversation which had been a conversation and not merely a request to pass the salt or the mustard or the bottle of brown sauce he recalled her reaction when hed waved the letter in her face he said that well cant be helped can it can be helped but it doesnt matter now this doesnt change anything you know no matter what you think whats that this sending me off mum and dad thought it would change things as well when they made me leave africa but it wont change a thing think that do you i know it i dont mean the bit about leaving and the things changing in your head i mean the bit about what i think she looked confused but then her expression altered in that quicksilver way of hers did every adolescent do that he wondered spose he said your grandies moren he seems to be ever reckon that i wager not so collect your belongings and make that phone call to your guv tell him where youll leave the key and lets shove off having said that he left the shop he watched the traffic coming up the strand as townsfolk returned from their jobs in the industrial estate at the edge of town and farther away as far as okehampton some of them in time tammy joined him and he set off back towards the wharf with her trailing at a slower pace that he took as she likely meant it reluctant cooperation with her grandfathers plans for her he said to her got your passport with you i take it how longve you had it out of its hidey place she said a while whatd you mean to do with it didnt know at first but you do now do you i was saving up for what to go to france france is it you heading for gay paree lisieux she said leerwhat lisieux thats whereyou know oh a pilgrimage is it or something more it doesnt matter i dont have enough money yet anyway but if i had it id be gone from here she came up to his side then and walked along with him she said as if finally relenting its nothing personal grandie didnt take it that way but im glad you didnt do a runner wouldve been a rough one to explain to your mum and dad off to france she is praying at the shrine of some saint that she read about in one of her sainty books thats shes not supposed to be reading anyways but i let her read cos i reckoned wordss not going to do much to her head one way or nother thats not precisely true you know anyways im glad you didnt scarper cos theyd have my skin for that one your mum and dad you know that dont you yes but grandie some things cant be helped and this is one of them is it thats how it is sure of it are you because thats what they all say when the cults get hold of them and send them out on the streets to beg money which they then take off them by the way so theyre trapped like rats on a sinking ship you know that dont you some big guru with an eye for girlsjust like youwhore meant to have his babies like a sheik in a tent with two dozen wives or one of them you know polygammers polygamists she said oh you really cant think this is like that grandie youre joking about it only i dont think its funny see theyd reached his car she looked in the back as she got in and she saw her old duffel bag her lip jutted out but she drew it back in home to africa her expression said which meant home to mum and dad until they thought of another plan to shake her resolve theyd tick send her to her grandfather off their list and come up with the next idea something like send her to siberia or send her to the australian bush she got into the car she fastened her seat belt and crossed her arms she looked stonily forward at the canal and her expression didnt soften even when she took in the ducklings and how their little webbed feet raised them above the water when they hastened to follow their mother making them look like tiny runners on the surface of the canal just the sort of harkening back to a miracle that selevan reckoned shed appreciate she didnt however she was concentrating on what she thought she knew how long a drive it was to heathrow or gatwick and whether her plane left for africa tonight or tomorrow likely tomorrow which would mean a long night in a hotel somewhere perhaps even now she was making her plan to escape out of the hotel window or down the stairs and then to france by hook or by crook he wondered if he should let her think that was where he was taking her but it seemed cruel to let the poor lass suffer truth of the matter was that shed suffered enough shed held firm through everything that had been thrown at her and that had to mean something even if it meant what none of the rest of them could bear considering he said as he started up the car i made a phone call i did day or two ago she said dully well youd have to wouldnt you truth in that they said come along wanted to talk to you as well but i told em you were unavailable at present ta for that at least tammy turned her head and examined the scenery they were passing through stratton heading north on a there was no easy way to get out of cornwall but that had long been part of its draw i dont much want to talk to them grandie weve already said all there is to say think that do you weve talked and talked weve rowed ive tried to explain but they dont understand they dont want to understand theyve got their plans and ive got mine and thats how it is didnt know youd talked to them at all selevan made his voice deliberately thoughtful a man considering the ramifications of what his granddaughter was telling him what dyou mean you didnt know id talked to them tammy demanded thats all we did before i got here i talked mum cried i talked dad shouted i talked they argued with me only i didnt want to argue because far as i can tell theres nothing to argue about you understand or you dont and they dont well how could they i mean mums whole way of living shouldve told me shed never be able to come onboard a life of contemplation not very likely when your real interest is looking at fashion magazines and gossip magazines and wondering how you can make yourself into posh spice while youre living in a place where frankly theres not a whole lot of designer shops and you weigh about fifteen stone more n she does anyway or whatever shes called these days who what dyou mean who posh spice posh whoever mum has hello and ok sent over by the lorry load not to mention vogue and tatler and whatever else and thats her ambition to look like all of them and to live like all of them and its not mine grandie and it never will be so you can send me home and nothingll be different i dont want what they want i never have and i never will i didnt know you talked to them he repeated they said theyd not talked to you what do you mean she flung herself round in the seat so that she faced him the mother whateversheis he said the abbot lady what dthey call her tammy hesitated then her tongue came out and licked her lips and then her teeth caught the lower one and she sucked on it in a childlike reaction selevan felt his heart twist at the sight of this so much of who she was was still a little girl he could see how her parents couldnt bear the thought of watching her disappear behind convent doors not this sort of convent at least where no one emerged till they emerged in a coffin it didnt make sense to them it was soso ungirllike wasnt it she was supposed to care about pointy shoes with tall heels about lipstick and hair thingummy dandershoots about short skirts long skirts or inbetween skirts about jackets or not waistcoats or not about music and boys and film stars and when in her life she should lower her knickers for a bloke but what she was not supposed to think about at the age of seventeen was the state of the world war and peace hunger and disease poverty and ignorance and what she definitely was never supposed to think about was sackcloth and ashes or whatever it was they wore a small cell with a bed and a prayer stand and a cross a set of rosary beads and getting up at dawn and then praying and praying and praying and all the time locked away from the world tammy said grandie but she didnt seem to trust herself to finish the sentence he said thas who i am girl the granddad who loves you you phoned well thats what the letter said didnt it phone the mother whosis to arrange for a visit girls sometimes find they cant cope she said they think theres a romance to this kind of life and i assure you there isnt mr penrule but we offer retreats to individuals and to groups and if shed like to take part in one wed welcome her tammys eyes were nans eyes once again but nans eyes as they should have been when she looked on her dad not as theyd become as shed listened to him rage she said grandie youre not taking me to the airport course not he said as if it were the most reasonable thing in the world for him to fly in the face of her parents wishes and drive his granddaughter to the scottish border to spend a week in a carmelite convent they dont know and they arent going to know but if i decide to stayif i want to stayif i find its what i think it is and what i needyoull have to tell them and then what you let me worry about your parents he said but theyll never forgive you if i decideif i think its best theyll never agree theyll never think girl selevan said to his granddaughter theyll think what they think he reached in the side compartment of his door and brought out an a to z for the uk he handed it over to her he said open that up if were going to be driving all the way to scotland im going to need a bloody good navigator think youre up for the job her smile was blinding it crushed his heart i am she told him then lets carry on the reaction to the days events that stayed with bea hannaford the longest was the one that led her towards looking for someone to blame she began with ray he seemed the most logical source of the difficulties that had resulted in a killers being able to walk blithely away from a murder charge she told herself that had ray only sent her the mcit blokes shed needed from the very beginning she would not have had to rely on the tag team he had sent her men whose expertise was limited to heavy lifting and not to the finer points of a homicide investigation she also would not have had to rely on constable mcnulty as part of that team a man whose mad release of critical information to the dead boys family had put the police in a position of having virtually nothing that was known only to the killer and to themselves sergeant collins at least she could live with as hed never left the station long enough to cause trouble and as for ds havers and thomas lynleybea wanted to blame them for something as well if only for their infuriating loyalty to each other but she didnt have the heart to do so aside from withholding information about daidre trahair which hadnt turned out to be germane to the case anyway despite her own stubborn beliefs in the matter theyd only done as shed requested more or less what she didnt really want to consider was how everything came down to her in the end because she was after all in charge of the investigation and she had maintained a pigheaded position on more than one topic from daidre trahairs culpability to her own insistence upon an incident room here in the town and not where ray had told her it should be which was where incident rooms generally were which was also where more adequate personnel were stationed and shed held firm to that desire to work in casvelyn and not elsewhere simply because ray had told her she was wrong to do so so while it all came down to ray in the end it also came down to her this sort of thing put her future on the line no case to present were there four worse words oh perhaps our marriage is over were equally bad and god knew enough coppers heard those words spoken by a spouse who couldnt take the life of a cops partner any longer but no case to present meant leaving a bereaved family in the lurch with no one brought to justice it meant despite the long hours the slog the sifting through data the forensics reports the interviews the discussions the arranging of this piece that way and that piece this way there was nothing left to do save begin the entire process again and hope for a different result or to leave the case open and declare it cold only how could it be cold really when they knew very well who the killer was and he was going to walk away that was hardly a cold case a cold case still shone with a glimmer of hope should something more turn up whereas this case shone not in the slightest the regional force might well ask her what she needed to make things right in casvelyn but that was more or less in her dreams because what the regional force were far more likely to ask was how shed cocked this up so badly ray was how she told herself ray had no interest in her success he was out to get her for almost fifteen years of estrangement no matter that hed brought them about himself for want of another direction she told the team to start sifting through the data again to see what they could come up with to pin jago reeth aka jonathan parsons to the wall of murder charge what she asked them did they have that could be handed to the cps that could light the fire beneath those crown prosecutors and set them off there had to be something so theyd begin this process on the following day and in the meantime they should all go home and get a decent nights rest because theyd not be sleeping much till they had this matter sorted then she followed her own prescription when she got to holsworthy she opened the cupboard in which she kept her brooms her mops and also her wines she chose a bottle at random and carried it to the kitchen red she discovered shiraz something from south africa called old goats roam in villages that sounded interesting she couldnt recall when or where shed bought it but she was fairly certain shed made the purchase solely because of the name and the label she opened it poured herself a brimming mug and she sat at the table where her position forced her to contemplate her calendar this proved to be as depressing as thinking about the last six days once she considered her most recent internet date which had occurred nearly four weeks previously an architect hed looked good on the screen and hed sounded good on the phone a bit of chit and a bit of chat and nervous laughter and all that rubbish but that was to be expected right after all this wasnt the normal way men and women met whatever went for normal these days because she didnt know any longer a cup of coffee perhaps theyd asked each other a drink somewhere certainly fine hed showed up with photos of his holiday home more photos of his holiday boat extra photos of his holiday on skis and additional photos of his car which may or may not have been a vintage mercedes because by the time theyd got to it bea hadnt cared me me me his conversation had declared all me baby and all the time shed wanted either to weep or to sleep by the end of the evening shed had two martinis and she shouldnt have driven herself anywhere but the desire to flee had overcome her sense so shed puttered carefully along the road and prayed shed not get stopped hed said to her with an affable smile hell talked only about myself didnt i well next time and shed thought wont be a next time darling which was what shed thought of all of them god how wretched this couldnt be how life was meant to be lived and nowshe couldnt even dredge up his name just the moniker shed given him boat wanker which distinguished him from all the other wankers was there a way she wondered to find a man in her age group without baggage or a man who might be a person first and a profession leading up to the acquisition of countless possessions second she was beginning to think not unless that man was one of a score of divorcés shed also met blokes with nothing to their names but a heap of a car a bedsit and a mountain of credit card bills yet there had to be something in between those two extremes of male availability or was this how ones remaining years were intended to go when an unmarried woman reached what had once been coyly referred to as a certain age bea downed her wine she ought to eat she thought she wasnt sure if there was anything in the fridge but certainly she could rustle up a tin of soup or perhaps a few of those beef sticks pete liked for snacks an apple perhaps a jar of peanut butter well certainly there was marmite to spread on mouldy bread this was england after all she dragged herself to her feet she opened the fridge she stared into its cold and heartless depths there was sticky toffee sponge she discovered so she could check pudding off her menu list and far in the back was an old minced beef and onion roll this could do as a main course now for the starter perhaps pot noodle in the veg department there had to be a tin of somethingchickpeas carrots and turnips bea wondered what shed been thinking when shed last done the shopping probably nothing she decided shed likely been pushing the trolley along the aisles without an idea in her head as to what she might cook the thought of proper nutrition for pete had probably prompted a spontaneous visit to the market but once there shed got distracted by something like a call on her mobile and the end result wasthis she took out the sticky toffee sponge and decided to skip the starter the entrée and the veg altogether getting right down to the pudding which after all everyone knew was the best part of the meal and why should she deny herself that when she wanted cheering up and this had the best potential to do the job she was about to tuck into it when bim bim bim boom boom sounded on her front door followed by the scrape of rays key in the lock he came in talking he was saying spirit of compromise mate to which pete replied pizza is a compromise dad when ones set on mcdonalds dont you dare buy him a big mac bea called you see ray said mum quite agrees they came into the kitchen they were wearing matching baseball caps and pete had his arsenal sweatshirt on ray was in jeans and a paintstained windcheater petes jeans had a great hole in the knee wherere the dogs bea asked them back at home ray said weve been mum dad found this wicked paintball place pete announced it was fantastic kapowee he mimicked shooting his father blim blam bash you put on these boiler suits and they load you up and off you go i got him so good didnt i dad i snuck round sneaked bea corrected patiently she watched their son and she didnt resist the smile that came to her as he demonstrated the stealth whereby hed managed to obliterate his father with paint it was just the sort of game shed always sworn to herself that her son wouldnt play a mimicry of war and yet in the end wouldnt boys always be just that you didnt think id be that good did you pete asked his father playfully punching him in the arm ray reached out hooked his arm round petes neck and pulled him over he planted a loud kiss on his sons head and rubbed his knuckles through petes thick hair go get what you came for paintball wizard he told him weve got dinner to attend to pizza curry or chinese thats the best ill offer or we can have calves liver and onions at home served with sprouts and broad beans on the side pete laughed he darted out of the room and they heard him dash up the stairs he wanted his cd player ray told bea he smiled as they listened to pete crashing about his room truth is he wants an ipod and he thinks if he demonstrates how many cds hes got to carry round with him when he could be carrying this device the size ofwhat size are they i cant keep up with technology these days thats what kids are for when it comes to technology im utterly out of the loop without pete ray watched her for a moment as she spooned up a portion of sticky toffee sponge she saluted him with it he said why do i think thats your dinner beatrice because youre a cop so it is hmm are you on the fly wish she said but thats not the word id choose to describe where i am or where the case is she decided to tell him he was going to learn it all sooner or later so it might as well be sooner and from her she gave him all the details and waited for his reaction damn he said thats a real he seemed to look for a word cockup she offered generated by yours truly i wasnt going to say that exactly but you were thinking it the cockup part yes not the part about you bea turned away from the expression of friendly compassion on his face she stared at the window that in daylight would have looked upon a bit of her garden or what went for her garden which she knew should have been mulched by this time of the year but was instead offering itself to whatever stray seeds were dropped by skylarks and linnets in flight those seeds were germinating into weeds and in another month or two shed have a right royal mess of work on her hands good thing all she saw in the window was her reflection and rays behind her she thought they provided a bit of distraction from the work shed created for herself through lack of attention to her garden she said i was set to blame you for the cockup inadequate incident room no mcit blokes for love or money there i am hanging out to dry with constable mcnulty and sergeant collins and whomever you deign to send me thats not how it was oh i know that her voice was weary because she was weary she felt as if shed been swimming upstream for far too long and im the one who sent constable mcnulty to tell the kernes the death was murder i thought hed use sense but of course i was wrong and then when id learned what hed told them i thought wed surely uncover something more some scrap some detailit didnt matter what it was just something useful as a trip wire for the moment the killer came sauntering by but we didnt you may still i doubt it unless you count a remark made about a surfing poster which isnt likely to amount to anything in the eyes of the cps she set down the container of sponge ive told myself for years theres no perfect murder forensic science is too advanced as long as theres a body to be found there are too many tests too many experts no one can kill and leave not a single trace of himself behind its impossible simply cant be done theres truth in that beatrice but what i failed to see is the loopholes all the ways a killer could plan and organise and commit thisthis ultimate crimeand do it in such a way that every bit of it could be explained even the most minute forensic bits could be deemed a rational part of ones daily life i didnt see that why didnt i see that perhaps you had other things on your mind distractions such as other parts of your own life you do have other parts to your life no matter your attempts to deny that she wanted to avoid ray clearly he didnt intend to let her youre not a cop to the exclusion of everything else he said good god beatrice youre not a machine i wonder about that sometimes well i dont a blast of music came from upstairs pete deciding among his cds they listened for a moment to the shriek of an electric guitar pete liked his music historical jimi hendrix was his favourite although in a pinch duane allman and his medicine bottle would do just fine god ray said get that lad an ipod she smiled then chuckled hes something that child our child beatrice ray declared quietly she didnt reply instead she took the sticky toffee sponge and tossed it in the rubbish she washed the spoon shed been using and set it on the draining board ray said can we talk about it now you do choose your moments dont you beatrice ive wanted to talk about it for ages you know that i do but at the present timeyoure a cop and a good one you can see how i am get the suspect in a weak moment create the weak moment if you can its elementary stuff ray this isnt what elementary beatrice how many ways can a man say to you that he was wrong and how many ways can you say to a man that forgiveness isnt part of yourwhat your repertoire when i thought that pete shouldnt be dont say it i have to say it and you have to listen when i thought that pete shouldnt be bornwhen i said you should abort you said thats what you wanted i said lots of things i say lots of things and some of them i say without thinking especially when im what i dont know frightened i suppose of a baby wed already had one not of that but of change the difference it would make in our lives as we had them arranged things happen i understand and i would have come to understand that then if youd allowed me the time to it wasnt only a single discussion ray yes all right i wont claim it was but i will say that i was wrong in every discussion we had i was wrong and ive grieved over thatthat wrongness if you will for years fourteen of them to be exact more if you include the pregnancy itself i didnt want it this way i dont want it this way andthem she asked you had your diversions what women for gods sake beatrice im not a monk yes there were women over the years a whole bloody succession of them janice and sheri and sharon and linda and whoever else because i dont remember them all and i dont remember them because i didnt want them i wanted to blot outthis he indicated the kitchen the house the people within it so what im asking you is to let me back in because this is where i belong and both of us know it do we we do pete knows it as well so do the bloody dogs she swallowed it would be so easybut then again it wouldnt the stuff of men and women together was never easy mum pete was shouting from upstairs whered you put my led zepppelin cd lord bea murmured with a shudder someone please get that lad an ipod at once mum mummy she said to ray i love it when he still calls me that he doesnt often hes becoming so grownup she called back dont know darling check under your bed and while youre at it put any clothes you find there in the laundry and bring old cheese sandwiches down to the rubbish detach the mice from them first very funny he shouted and continued to bang about he said dad make her tell me make her she knows where it is she hates it and shes hidden it somewhere ray called to him son i learned long ago that i cant make this madwoman do anything then he said to her quietly can i my dear because if i could you know what it would be she said that you cant to my eternal regret she thought about his words those hed just said and those hed said before she said to him not really eternal not exactly that she heard him swallow do you mean it beatrice i suppose i do they looked at each other the window behind them doubling the image of man and woman and the hesitant step each of them took towards the other at precisely the same moment pete came pounding down the stairs he shouted found it ready to go dad are you as well ray asked bea quietly for dinner and for what follows dinner she drew a long breath that matched his own i think i am she told him chapter thirty they spoke little on the drive back from st agnes and when they did speak it was of mundane matters she needed to stop for petrol so theyd take a diversion from the main road if he didnt mind he didnt mind at all did she want a cup of tea while they were at it surely there was a hotel or tea shop along the way where they might even have a proper cornish cream tea scones clotted cream and strawberry jam she remembered the days when it was difficult to find clotted cream outside of cornwall did he yes and proper sausages as well not to mention pasties hed always enjoyed good pasties but theyd never had them at home as his father had considered themthere he stopped himself common was the word of choice vulgar in its most precise usage she supplied it for him using the former term she added and you werent that were you he told her his brother was a narcotics user because that was the truth of the matter tossed out of oxford his girlfriend dead with a needle in her arm himself in and out of rehab ever since he said he thought that hed failed peter altogether when he should have been there for the boypresent he meant present in every possible way and not just a warm body occupying a sofa or somethinghe hadnt been well these things happen she said and you had your own life as you have yours she didnt say what another woman in her same position might have said at the end of the day theyd just spent together and do you think this levels the playing field thomas but he knew she was thinking it for what else could she think upon his mentioning peter in the midst of nothing vaguely related to the topic in spite of that he wanted to add more life details piling them up so that she would be forced to see similarities instead of differences he wanted to tell her that his brotherinlaw had been murdered some ten years earlier that he himself had been suspected of the crime and had even been carted off to gaol and held twentyfour hours for a grilling because hed hated edward davenport and what edward davenport had wrought upon his sister and hed never made a secret of that but to tell her that seemed too much a begging for something that she wasnt going to be able to give him he deeply regretted the position hed put her in because he could see how she would interpret his reaction to everything shed revealed that day no matter his declarations to the contrary there was an enormous gulf between them created first by birth second by childhood and third by experience that the gulf existed only in her head and not in his was something he could not explain to her such a declaration was facile anyway the gulf existed everywhere and for her it was something so real that she would ever fail to see it was not equally real to him you dont actually know me he wanted to tell her who i am the people i move among the loves that have defined my life but then how could you newspaper storiestabloids magazines whatevertaken up from the internet reveal only the dramatic bits the heartrending bits the salacious bits those elements of life comprising the valuable and unforgettable everyday bits are not included they lack drama even as ultimately they define who a person is not that that mattered who he was it had ceased to matter with helens death or so he had told himself except that what he felt now indicated something different that he should care for anothers suffering spoke ofwhat rebirth he didnt want to be reborn recovery he wasnt sure he wanted to recover but a sense of who he was at the core of who he appeared to be prompted him to feel at least something of what daidre herself was feeling caught out in the spotlight naked when shed worked so hard to fashion clothing for herself id like to turn back time he told her she looked at him and he saw from her expression that she thought he was talking of something else of course you would she said my god who wouldnt in your position not about helen he said although id give nearly anything to bring her back to me if i could then what this what ive brought you to its part of your job she said but it wasnt his job he wasnt a cop hed walked away from that part of his life because he couldnt bear it a moment longer because it had taken him away from helen and had he known how many hours upon hours hed be away from her and each of those hours trickling through a glass in which the remaining days of her life were contained he would have called a halt to all of it no he said not part of my job thats not why i was here well they asked you to she asked you i cant think you did it all on your own came up with the plan whatever i did he said it heavily and he regretted having to say it at all but i want you to know that if id knownbecause you see you dont seem like like them she asked im cleaner more educated more accomplished better dressed more wellspoken well ive had eighteen years to put themitthat whole terriblei want to call it an episode but it wasnt an episode it was my life it made me who i am no matter who i try to be now these sorts of things define us thomas and that defined me thinking that he told her negates the last eighteen years doesnt it it negates your parents what they did for you how they loved you and made you part of their family youve met my parents youve seen my family and how we lived i meant your other parents the ones who were your parents as parents are meant to be the trahairs yes but they dont change the rest of it do they they cant the rest isthe rest and its there as it always will be thats no cause for shame she looked at him shed found the petrol station she was seeking and theyd pulled into its forecourt shed turned off the ignition and rested her hand on the door handle hed done the same ever the gentleman unwilling to let her pump the petrol herself she said thats just it you see what he asked her people like you please dont he said there is no peoplelikeme there are just people theres just the human experience daidre people like you she persisted nonetheless think its about shame because thats what you would feel in the same circumstances travelling about living most of the time in a rubbish tip bad food castoff clothing loose teeth and illformed bones shifty eyes and sticky fingers why read or write when one can steal thats what you think and youre hardly wrong but the feeling thomas has nothing at all to do with shame then sorrow regret like my name were the same then you and i he told her despite the differences she laughed a single weary note we are not that she replied i expect you played at it you and your brother and your sister and your mates your parents may have even found you a gipsy caravan and parked it somewhere quite hidden away on the estate you could go there and play dressup and act the part but you couldnt have lived it she got out of the car he did the same she went to the pumps and studied them as if trying to decide which type of petrol she needed when she probably knew very well what was required for her car as she hesitated he went for the nozzle himself he began to fill the tank for her she said i expect your man does that for you he said dont she said i cant help it ill never be able to help it she shook her head in a fierce little movement as if to deny or obliterate all that was left unspoken between them she climbed back into the car and shut the door he saw that she looked straight ahead afterwards as if there was something in the window of the petrol stations shop that she needed to memorise he went to pay when he climbed in the car he saw shed put a neat stack of notes on his seat to cover the cost of the petrol he took them folded them neatly and put them into the empty ashtray just above the gearshift she said i dont want you to pay thomas he said i know but i hope you can cope with the fact that i intend to do so she started the car they reentered the road they drove for some minutes in silence with the countryside passing and evening dropping round them like a shifting veil he finally said to her the only thing worth saying the only request he had that she might grant at this point hed asked once and been denied but it seemed to him that she might reconsider although he couldnt have explained why they were jouncing across the car park of the salthouse inn where theyd begun their day when he spoke a final time will you call me tommy he asked her again i dont think i can she replied he wasnt particularly hungry but he knew he had to eat to eat was to live and it appeared to him that he was doomed to go on living at least for now after he watched daidre drive off he went inside the salthouse inn and he decided that he could face a bar meal but not the restaurant he ducked inside the low doorway and found that barbara havers had possessed the same idea she was in the otherwise abandoned inglenook while the rest of the bars patrons crowded on stools round the few scarred tables and at the bar itself behind which brian was pouring pints lynley went to join her drawing out the stool opposite the banquette that she herself occupied she looked up from her food shepherds pie he saw the obligatory sides of boiled carrots boiled cauliflower boiled broccoli tinned peas and chips shed used ketchup on the lot of it save the carrots and the peas which shed moved to one side altogether didnt your mum insist you eat all your veg he asked her thats the beauty of adulthood she replied shoving some of the mash and minced beef onto her fork one may ignore certain foods altogether she chewed thoughtfully and observed him well she asked he told her as he did so he realised that without anticipating or wanting it hed passed into another stage of the journey he was on one week ago hed not have spoken at all or if hed done so it would have been to make a remark that served to abbreviate the conversation as much as possible he finished with i couldnt actually make her see that this sort of thingthe past her family or at least the people who gave birth to herits not important really course not havers said genially absobloodylutely not not in a bottle not on a plate and specially not to someone who never lived it mate havers weve all got something in our pasts hmm right she forked up some broccoli doused in ketchup carefully removing a single pea that had got mixed in she said except not all of us have silver serving dishes in ours if you know what i mean and whats that big thing you lot have sitting in the centre of your dining room tables you know what i mean all silver with animals hopping about it or vines and grapes or whatever you know epergne he told her its called an epergne but you cant possibly be thinking that something as meaningless as a piece of silver not the silver the word see you knew what to call it dyou think she knows how much of the rest of the world ever knows thats hardly the point thats just the point therere places sir that the hoi polloi arent going to and your dinner table is one of them youve eaten at my dinner table yourself im the exception you lot find my ignorance charming she cant help it you think consider where she came from you tell people sort of like saying poor thing shes american she doesnt know any better havers hang on ive never once thought doesnt matter she said waving her fork at him she had chips on it now although they were barely discernible through the ketchup i dont care you see i dont mind then but she does and thats the bit that gets one into trouble the minding bit dont mind and you can swan round in ignorance or at least pretend to mind and youre all thumbs and fumbling with the cutlery sixteen knives and twentytwo forks and why are these people eating asparagus with their fingers she shuddered dramatically she went for more shepherds pie she washed it down with what she was drinking which appeared to be ale he watched her and said havers is it my imagination or have you been drinking rather more than your usual tonight why am i slurring my words not slurring exactly but im owed a stiff one fifteen stiff ones if thats what it takes im not driving and i should be able to make it up the stairs just whats going on he asked her for it wasnt like havers to drink to excess she was generally a oneaweek sort of drinker she told him then jago reeth benesek kerne hedras hutwhich she referred to as some mad cabin on the edge of the cliff where we all mightve died mind youand the result which was no result at all jonathan parsons and pengelly cove santo kerne and are you saying he confessed lynley said how extraordinary sir youre missing the point he didnt confess he supposed he supposed this and he supposed that and in the end he supposed himself right out of that hovel and on his way revenge is sweet and all that rubbish and thats it he said what did hannaford do what could she do what could anyone do if this had been written by the greeks i suppose we could hope that thor would hit him with a bolt of lightning in the next couple days but i wouldnt count on that good grief lynley said and then after a moment he added zeus what zeus havers thors norse zeuss greek whatever sir i am we know one of the hoi polloi point is this the greeks arent exactly involved here so he walks away she intends to keep after him but shes got sweet fa to work with thanks to that idjit mcnulty whose sole contribution appears to be one surfing poster that and giving out information when hes meant to keep his mug plugged tight its a right bloody mess and im glad im not responsible for it lynley blew out a breath ghastly for the family he said isnt it just she replied she examined him you eating or what sir i thought to have something he told her hows the shepherds pie shepherds pieish one cant be too choosy when it comes to shepherds pie as a bar meal i find lets put it this way jamie olivers got nothing to worry about tonight she forked up a sample and handed it over he took it and chewed it would do he thought he started to get up to order himself a plate from the bar her next remarks stopped him sir if you dont mind she spoke so carefully that he knew what was coming yes will you come back to london with me he sat down again he looked not at her but at her plate the remains of the shepherds pie and the carefully avoided peas and carrots it was all so vintage havers he thought the meal the carrots the peas the conversation theyd been having and the question as well he said havers please she said he looked up at her ill featured ill dressed ill shorn so quintessentially who she was behind the mask of indifference she presented to the world he saw what hed seen in havers from the first the earnestness and the truth of her a woman among millions his partner his friend he said in time not now but in time when she asked can you at least say when he looked to the window which faced the west he thought about what lay in that direction he considered the steps hed taken so far and the rest of the steps that remained to be taken ive got to walk the rest of the path he told her after that well see will we she asked yes barbara we will acknowledgments id like to express grateful acknowledgment to those people who assisted me in gathering the information necessary to write this novel both in the uk and in the us in cornwall id like to thank nigel moyle and paul stickney of zuma jays surf shop in bude for the assistance they gave me in understanding what surfing is like in cornwall so different from surfing in huntington beach california where i lived for many years id also like to thank adrian phillips of fluidjuice surfboards in st merryn and kevin white of beach beat surfboards in st agnes for everything they shared with me about shaping boards both from styrofoam blanks and from the new carbon hollowcore blanks just north of widemouth bay rob byron of outdoor adventures put me in the picture with regard to cliff climbing and everything related to that sport i gathered additional details from toni carver in st ives alan mobb of the devon and cornwall constabulary was good enough to bring me up to date on policing in cornwall and he was kind enough to do it twice when i discovered my tape recorder hadnt been working the first time through the information i gathered other information at geevor tin mine blue hills tin streams the lost gardens of heligan the cornish cyder farm gwithian parish church zennor church and at the home of des sampson in bude swati gamble once again proved an invaluable resource in london cheerfully fielding questions from me on a variety of topics for which i am extremely grateful in the us longtime surfers barbara and lou fryer were the first people to tell me about mark foos last ride and they also gave me additional details about surfing so that i could attempt to write my moments in the water with at least a degree of verisimilitude dr tom ruben supplied me with medical details susan berner once again graciously consented to read a second draft of the book giving it her usual fine critical appraisal and my assistant leslie kelly did outstanding research on more topics that i could list here from roller derby to bmx bike riding perhaps the greatest kindness was done by lawrence beck who took the time to unearth for me the one photograph of the late jay moriarty that i needed to complete the novel books that i found useful were inside mavericks portrait of a monster wave edited by bruce jenkins and grant washburn tapping the source by kem nunn surf uk by wayne alderson bude past and present by bill young and bryan dudley stamp and assorted guides on the southwest coast path finally i thank my husband thomas mccabe for his consistent support enthusiasm and encouragement my assistant leslie kelly for the myriad services she performs in order to free my time to write my editors in the us and the ukcarolyn marino and sue fletcher respectively for never asking me to write something outside my vision of the work and my literary agent robert gottlieb who pilots the craft and charts the course and of course those
