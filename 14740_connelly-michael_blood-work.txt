michael connelly blood work her last thoughts were of raymond she would see him soon he would awaken as he always did his welcomehome embrace warm and sustaining she smiled and mr kang behind the counter smiled back thinking her brightness was for him he smiled at her every night never knowing that her thoughts and smiles were actually for raymond for the moment still to come the sound of the bell shaken by the opening door behind her made only a peripheral entry into her thoughts she had the two dollar bills ready and was handing them across the counter to mr kang but he didnt take them she then noticed that his eyes were no longer on her but focused on the door his smile was gone and his mouth was opening slightly as if to form a word that wouldnt quite come she felt a hand grip her right shoulder from behind the coldness of steel pressed against her left temple a shower of light crashed across her vision blinding light in that moment she saw a glimpse of raymonds sweet face then everything turned dark mccaleb saw her before she saw him he was coming down the main dock past the row of millionaires boats when he saw the woman standing in the stern of the following sea it was half past ten on a saturday morning and the warm whisper of spring had brought a lot of people out to the san pedro docks mccaleb was finishing the walk he took every morningcompletely around cabrillo marina out along the rock jetty and back he was huffing by this part of the walk but he slowed his pace even more as he approached the boat his first feeling was annoyancethe woman had boarded his boat uninvited but as he got closer he put that aside and wondered who she was and what she wanted she wasnt dressed for boating she had on a loose summer dress that came to midthigh the breeze off the water threatened to lift it and so she kept one hand at her side to keep it down mccaleb couldnt see her feet yet but he guessed by the taut lines of the muscles he saw in her brown legs that she wasnt wearing boat shoes she had raised heels on mccalebs immediate read was that she was there to make some kind of impression on someone mccaleb was dressed to make no impression at all he had on an old pair of jeans ripped by wear not for style and a tshirt from the catalina gold cup tournament a few summers before the clothes were spattered with stainsmostly fish blood some of his own blood marine polyurethane and engine oil they had served him as both fishing and work clothes his plan was to use the weekend to work on the boat and he was dressed accordingly he became more selfconscious about his appearance as he drew closer to the boat and could see the woman better he pulled the foam pads of his portable off his ears and turned off the cd in the middle of howlin wolf singing i aint superstitious can i help you he asked before stepping down into his own boat his voice seemed to startle her and she turned away from the sliding door that led into the boats salon mccaleb figured she had knocked on the glass and was waiting expecting him to be inside im looking for terrell mccaleb she was an attractive woman in her early thirties a good decade or so younger than mccaleb there was a sense of familiarity about her but he couldnt quite place it it was one of those déjà vu things at the same time he felt the stir of recognition it quickly flitted away and he knew he was mistaken that he did not know this woman he remembered faces and hers was nice enough not to forget she had mispronounced the name saying mc cal ub instead of mc kay leb and used the formal first name that no one ever used except the reporters thats when he began to understand he knew now what had brought her to the boat another lost soul come to the wrong place mccaleb he corrected terry mccaleb sorry i uh i thought maybe you were inside i didnt know if it was okay to walk on the boat and knock but you did anyway she ignored the reprimand and went on it was as if what she was doing and what she had to say had been rehearsed i need to talk to you well im kind of busy at the moment he pointed to the open bilge hatch she was lucky not to have fallen into and the tools he had left spread out on a drop cloth by the stern transom ive been walking around looking for this boat for almost an hour she said it wont take long my name is graciela rivers and i wanted look miss rivers he said holding his hands up and interrupting im really you read about me in the newspaper right she nodded well before you start your story i have to tell you youre not the first one to come out here and find me or to get my number and call me and im just going to tell you what i told all of the others im not looking for a job so if this is about you wanting to hire me or have me help you some way im sorry but i cant do it im not looking for that kind of work she didnt say anything and he felt a pang of sympathy for her just as he had for the others who had come to him before her look i do know a couple of private investigators i can recommend good ones that will work hard and wont rip you off he stepped over to the stern gunwale picked up the sunglasses he had forgotten to take on his walk and put them on signaling the end of the conversation but the gesture and his words went by her the article said you were good it said you hated it whenever somebody got away he put his hands in his pockets and hiked his shoulders you have to remember something it was never me alone i had partners i had the lab teams i had the whole bureau behind me its a lot different than one guy running around out there on his own a lot different i probably couldnt help you even if i wanted to she nodded and he thought that he had gotten through to her and that would be the end of this one he started thinking about the valve job on one of the boats engines that hed planned to complete over the weekend but he was wrong about her i think you could help me she said maybe help yourself too i dont need the money i do okay im not talking about money he looked at her for a beat before replying i dont know what you mean by that he said injecting exasperation into his voice but i cant help you ive got no badge anymore and im not a private investigator it would be illegal for me to act as one or to accept money without a state license if you read the story in the paper then you know what happened to me im not even supposed to be driving a car he pointed toward the parking lot beyond the row of docks and the gangway you see the one wrapped up like a christmas present thats mine its sitting there until i get my doctors approval to drive again what kind of investigator would that make me id be taking the bus she ignored his protest and just looked at him with a resolute expression that unnerved him he didnt know how he was going to get her off the boat ill go get those names for you he walked around her and slid open the salon door after going in he pulled the door shut behind him he needed the separation he went to the drawers below the chart table and began looking for his phone book he hadnt needed it in so long he wasnt sure where it was he glanced out through the door and watched her step to the stern and lean her hips against the transom as she waited there was reflective film on the glass of the door she couldnt see him watching her the sense of familiarity came over him again and he tried to place her face he found her very striking dark almondshaped eyes that seemed both sad and understanding of some secret at the same time he knew he would easily remember if he had ever met her or even just observed her before but nothing came his eyes instinctively went to her hands in search of a ring there was none he had been right about her shoes she wore sandals with twoinch cork heels her toenails were painted pink and showed off against her soft brown skin he wondered if this was how she looked all the time or if she had dressed to entice him into taking the job he found his phone book in the second drawer and quickly looked up the names jack lavelle and tom kimball he wrote their names and numbers on an old marine service flier and opened the slider she was opening her purse as he stepped out he held up the paper here are two names lavelle is lapd retired and kimball was with the bureau i worked with both and either will do a good job for you pick one and call make sure you tell him you got his name from me hell take care of you she didnt take the names from him instead she pulled a photo out of her purse and handed it to him mccaleb took it without thinking he realized immediately that this was a mistake in his hand was a photo of a smiling woman watching a small boy blowing out candles on a birthday cake mccaleb counted seven candles at first he thought it was a picture of rivers a few years younger but then he realized it wasnt her the woman in the photo had a rounder face and thinner lips she wasnt as beautiful as graciela rivers though both had deep brown eyes the eyes of the woman in the photo did not have the same intensity as the eyes of the woman now watching him your sister yes and her son which one what which one is dead the question was his second mistake compounding the first by drawing him further in he knew the moment he asked it that he should have just insisted that she take the names of the two private detectives and been done with it my sister gloria torres we called her glory thats her son raymond he nodded and handed the photo back but she didnt take it he knew she wanted him to ask what had happened but he was finally putting on the brakes look this isnt going to work he finally said i know what youre doing it doesnt work on me you mean you have no sympathy he hesitated as the anger boiled up in his throat i have sympathy you read the newspaper story you know what happened to me sympathy was my problem all along he swallowed it back and tried to clear away any ill feeling he knew she was consumed by horrible frustrations mccaleb had known hundreds of people like her loved ones taken from them without reason no arrests no convictions no closure some of them were left zombies their lives irrevocably changed lost souls graciela rivers was one of them now she had to be or she wouldnt have tracked him down he knew that no matter what she said to him or how angry he got she didnt deserve to be hit with his own frustrations as well look he said i just cant do this im sorry he put a hand on her arm to lead her back to the dock step her skin was warm he felt the strong muscle beneath the softness he offered the photo again but she still refused to take it look at it again please just one more time and then ill leave you alone tell me if you feel anything else he shook his head and made a feeble hand gesture as if to say it made no difference to him i was an fbi agent not a psychic but he made a show of holding the photo up and looking at it anyway the woman and the boy seemed happy it was a celebration seven candles mccaleb remembered that his parents were still together when he turned seven but not much longer his eyes were drawn to the boy more than the woman he wondered how the boy would get along now without his mother im sorry miss rivers i really am but there is nothing i can do for you do you want this back or not i have a double of it you know two for the price of one i thought youd want to keep that one for the first time he felt the undertow in the emotional current there was something else at play but he didnt know what he looked closely at graciela rivers and had the sense that if he took another step asked the obvious question he would be pulled under he couldnt help himself why would i want to keep it if im not going to be able to help you she smiled in a sad sort of way because shes the woman who saved your life i thought from time to time you might want to remind yourself of what she looked like who she was he stared at her for a long moment but he wasnt really looking at graciela rivers he was looking inward running what she had just said through memory and knowledge and coming up short of its meaning what are you talking about it was all he could manage to ask he had the sense that control of the conversation and everything else was tilting away from him and sliding across the deck to her the undertow had him now it was carrying him out she raised her hand but reached past the photo he was still holding out to her she placed her palm on his chest and ran it down the front of his shirt her fingers tracing the thick rope of the scar beneath he let her do it he stood there frozen and let her do it your heart she said it was my sisters she was the one who saved your life out of the corner of his eye he could just see the monitor the screen was grainy silver and black the heart like an undulating ghost the rivets and staples that closed off blood vessels showing like black buckshot in his chest almost there a voice said it came from behind his right ear bonnie fox always calm and comforting professional soon he saw the snaking line of the scope move into the monitors xray field following the path of the artery and entering the heart he closed his eyes he hated the tug the one they say you wont feel but you always do okay you shouldnt feel this she said right dont talk then there it was like the slightest tug on the end of a fishing line a scrap fish stealing your bait he opened his eyes and saw the line of the scope as thin as a fishing line still deep in the heart okay we got it she said coming out now you did good terry he felt her pat his shoulder though he couldnt turn his head to look at her the scope was removed and she taped a gauze compress against the incision in his neck the brace that had held his head at such an uncomfortable angle was unstrapped and he slowly straightened his neck bringing his hand up to work the stiff muscles dr bonnie foxs smiling face then hovered above his how you feeling cant complain now that its over ill see you in a little while i want to check the blood work and get the tissue over to the lab i want to talk to you about something you got it see you in a bit a few minutes later two nurses wheeled mccalebs bed out of the cath lab and into an elevator he hated being treated as an invalid he could have walked but it was against the rules after a heart biopsy the patient must be kept horizontal hospitals always have rules cedarssinai seemed to have more than most he was taken down to the cardiology unit on the sixth floor while being wheeled down the east hallway he passed the rooms of the lucky and the waitingpatients who had received new hearts or were still waiting they passed one room where mccaleb glanced through the open door and saw a young boy on the bed his body tied by tubes to a heartlung machine a man in a suit sat in the chair on the other side of the bed his eyes staring at the boy but seeing something else mccaleb looked away he knew the score the kid was running out of time the machine would only hold him up for so long then the man in the suitthe father mccaleb assumedwould be staring at a casket with the same look they were at his room now he was moved from the gurney onto the bed and left alone he settled in for the wait he knew from experience that it could be as long as six hours before fox showed up depending on how quickly the blood work was run through the lab and how soon she came by to pick up the report he had come prepared the old leather bag in which he had once carried his computer and the countless case files he had worked on was now stuffed with back issues of magazines he saved for biopsy days two and a half hours later bonnie fox came through the door mccaleb put down the copy of boat restoration he had been reading wow that was fast its slow in the lab how are you feeling my neck feels like it had somebodys foot on it for a couple hours youve already been to the lab yup howd everything come out it all looks good no rejection all the levels look good im very pleased we might lower your prednisone in another week she spoke as she spread the lab report out on the beds food table and doublechecked the good results she was referring to the carefully orchestrated mix of drugs that mccaleb took every morning and night last hed counted he was swallowing eighteen pills in the morning and another sixteen at night the medicine cabinet on the boat wasnt big enough for all the containers he had to use one of the storage compartments in the forward berth good he said im tired of shaving three times a day fox folded the report closed and picked the clipboard up off the bed table her eyes quickly scanned the checklist of questions he had to answer every time he came in no fever at all no im clean and no diarrhea nope he knew from her constant drilling and doublechecking that fever and diarrhea were the twin harbingers of organ rejection he took his temperature a minimum of twice a day along with readings of blood pressure and pulse the vitals look good why dont you lean forward she put the clipboard down with a stethoscope she first warmed with her breath she listened to his heart at three different spots on his back then he lay back and she listened through his chest she took her own measure of his pulse with two fingers on his neck while she looked at her watch she was very close to him as she did this she wore a perfume of orange blossoms which mccaleb had always associated with older women and bonnie fox was not one of them he looked up at her studying her face while she studied her watch do you ever wonder if we should be doing this he asked dont talk eventually she moved her fingers to his wrist and measured the pulse there after that she pulled the pressure collar off the wall put it on his arm and took a blood pressure reading maintaining her silence all the time good she said when she was done good he said whether we should be doing what it was like her to suddenly continue an interrupted or forgotten bit of conversation she rarely forgot anything mccaleb said to her bonnie fox was a small woman about mccalebs age with short hair gone prematurely gray her white lab coat hung almost to her ankles because it had been designed for a taller person embroidered on the breast pocket was an outline of the cardiopulmonary system her specialty as a surgeon she was all business when it came to their meetings she had an air of confidence and caring a combination mccaleb had always found rare in physiciansand in the last years there had been many he returned the confidence and caring he liked her and trusted her in his most secret thoughts there had once been a hesitation when he considered he would one day put his life in the hands of this woman but the hesitation quickly left and caused him only a feeling of guilt when the time came for the transplant it had been her smiling face that was the last he had seen as he was put to sleep in preop there had been no hesitation in him by then and it was her smiling face that welcomed him back to the world with a new heart and new life mccaleb took the fact that in the eight weeks since the transplant there had not been a hitch in his recovery as proof his belief in her was valid in the three years since he had first walked into her office a bond had developed between them that had gone far beyond the professional they were good friends now or so mccaleb believed they had shared meals a half dozen times and countless spirited debates on everything from genetic cloning to the o j simpson trialsmccaleb had won a hundred bucks from her on the first verdict easily seeing that her unwavering belief in the justice system had blinded her to racial realities of the case she wouldnt bet him on the second whatever the subject half the time mccaleb found himself taking the opposing opinion just because he liked battling with her fox now followed her question with a look that said she was ready for another joust whether we should be doing this he said waving a hand around as if to encompass the whole hospital taking out organs putting in new ones sometimes i feel like the modern frankenstein other peoples parts in me one other person one other part lets not be so dramatic but its the big part isnt it you know when i was with the bureau we had to qualify on the range every year you know shoot at targets and the best way to qualify was to go for the heart the circle around the heart on those targets scores more than the head its called the ten ring highest score look if this is the arent we acting like god debate again i thought we were well past that she shook her head smiled and looked him over for a few seconds the smile eventually dropped away whats really wrong i dont know i guess im feeling guilty what about living i dont know dont be ridiculous weve been through this too i have no time for survivors guilt look at the choices here its simple youve got life on one side and then youve got death big decision what is there to be guilty about he raised his hands in surrender she always put things in their clearest context typical she said refusing to let him back off you hang around almost two years waiting for a heart draw your string out and nearly dont even make it and now you wonder if we should have even given it to you whats really bothering you terry i dont have time to be bullshitting with you he looked back at her she had developed a skill at reading him it was something all the best bureau agents and cops he had known had he hesitated and then decided to say what was on his mind i guess i want to know how come you didnt tell me that the woman whose heart i got had been murdered she was clearly taken aback the shock of his statement showed on her face murdered what are you talking about she was murdered how i dont know exactly she got caught in the middle of a robbery in some convenience store up in the valley shot in the head she died and i got her heart youre not supposed to know anything about your donor how do you know this because her sister came and saw me on saturday she told me the whole thing it sort of changes things you know fox sat on the hospital bed and leaned over him a stern look came over her face first of all i had no idea where your heart came from we never do it came through bopra all we were told was that an organ was available with a blood work match to a recipient we had on call and at the top of our list that was you you know how bopra works you watched the film during orientation we get limited information because it works best that way i told you exactly what we knew female twentysix years old if i remember perfect health perfect blood typing perfect donor thats it then im sorry i thought maybe you knew and just held that back i didnt we didnt so if we didnt know who and where it came from how did the sister know who and where it went how did she find you this could be some kind of a scam shes no its her i know how do you know the newspaper article last sunday that whatever happened to column in the times metro section it said i got the heart on february ninth and that id been waiting a long time because my blood type was rare the sister read it and put it together she obviously knew when her sister died knew her heart was donated and knew she also had a rare blood type shes an er nurse up at holy cross and figured out it was me it still doesnt mean you have her sisters she also had the letter i wrote what letter the one everybody writes afterward the anonymous thank you note to the family of your donor the one the hospital mails she had mine i looked at it and its mine i remember what i wrote this is not supposed to happen terry what does she want money no not money dont you see she wants me to find out who did it who killed her sister the cops never closed it its two months later and no arrest she knows theyve given up then she sees this story about me in the paper about what i used to do for the bureau she figures out i got her sisters heart and thinks maybe i can do what the cops apparently cant break the case she spent an hour walking around the san pedro marinas looking for my boat saturday all she had was the name of the boat from the paper she came looking for me this is crazy give me this womans name and ill no i dont want you to do anything to her think if you were her and you loved your sister youd do what she did too fox got off the bed a wideeyed look on her face youre not actually thinking of doing this she said it as a statement a doctors order he didnt answer and that in itself was an answer he could see anger once again working itself into foxs expression listen to me you are in no condition to be doing anything like this you are sixty days posttransplant surgery and you want to run around playing detective im only thinking about it okay i told her id think about it i know the risks i also know that im not an fbi agent anymore it would be a whole different thing fox angrily folded her thin arms across her chest you shouldnt even be thinking about it as your doctor i am telling you not to do this thats an order her voice then changed in tone and softened you have to respect the gift you were given terry this second chance but that respect goes two ways if i didnt have her heart id be dead by now i owe her its that you dont owe her or her family anything more than that note you sent them thats it shed be dead whether you or anybody else got her heart you are wrong about this he nodded that he understood her point but it wasnt enough for him he knew that just because something makes sense on an intellectual level it doesnt play any better in the twists of your guts she read his thoughts but what i dont know its just that i thought if i ever found out what happened i would find out it was an accident thats what i prepared myself for thats what they tell you in orientation and even you told me when we started that ninetynine out of a hundred times its an accident leading to fatal head injury car crash or somebody falls down the steps or dumps their motorcycle but this is different it changes things you keep saying that how can it be different the heart is just an organa biological pump its the same no matter how its original owner dies an accident i could live with all that time i was waiting knowing that somebody had to die for me to live i was getting myself ready to accept it as an accident with an accident its like it was fated or something but a murder that comes with evil intent attached its not happenstance it means that im the benefactor of an act of evil doctor and thats why its different now fox was silent for a few moments she shoved her hands into the side pockets of her lab coat mccaleb thought that she was finally beginning to see his point thats what my life was about for a long time he added quietly i was searching out evil that was my job and i was good at it but in the long run it was better than me it got the best of me i thinkno i knowthats what took my heart but now its like none of that meant anything because here i am i have this new heart a new life this second chance you talk about and the only reason i have it is because of this evil hateful thing that someone did he blew out a deep breath before going on she went into that store to get a candy bar for her kid and she ends uplook its just different i cant explain it youre not making a lot of sense its hard for me to put it into the words i want i just know what im feeling it makes sense to me fox had a resigned look on her face look i know what youre going to want to do youre going to want to help this lady but youre not ready physically no way and emotionally after hearing what you just said i dont think youre ready to investigate even a car accident remember what i told you about the equilibrium between physical and mental health one feeds off the other and im scared that what you have going on in your head now is going to affect your physical progress i understand no i dont think you do you are gambling with your own life here if this goes south if you start getting infection or rejection were not going to be able to save you terry we waited twentytwo months for that heart you have now you think another one with matching blood work is going to just pop up because you messed up this one no chance ive got a patient down the hall on a machine hes waiting on a heart that isnt coming that could be you terry this is your one chance do not blow it she reached across the bed and placed her hand on his chest it reminded him of what graciela rivers had done he felt its warmth there tell this woman no save yourself and tell her no the moon was like a balloon being kept aloft by children poking at it with sticks the masts of dozens of sailboats stood raised beneath it ready to keep it from falling mccaleb watched it hover in the black sky until it finally escaped by slipping behind the clouds somewhere out over catalina as good a hiding spot as any he thought as he looked down at the empty coffee cup in his hand he missed being able to sit in the stern at the end of the day with an icecold beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other but cigarettes had been part of the problem and were gone for good now and it would be a few months before the medication therapy would relax enough to allow a dose of alcohol into the mix for now if he had just one beer it might give him what bonnie fox called a fatal hangover mccaleb got up and went into the boats salon first he tried sitting at the galley table but soon got up turned the tv on and started flipping through the channels without really looking at what was on he turned the tube off and checked the clutter on the chart table but found there was nothing for him there either he moved about the cabin looking for a distraction from his thoughts but there was nothing he moved down the stairs into the forward passageway and into the head he took the thermometer from the medicine cabinet shook it and dipped it under his tongue it was an oldstyle glass tube instrument the electronic thermometer with digital reading display the hospital had provided was still in its box on the cabinet shelf for some reason he didnt trust it looking at himself in the mirror he pulled open the collar of his shirt and studied the small wound left by the mornings biopsy it never got a chance to heal there had been so many biopsies that the incision was always just about covered with new skin when it was opened up again and the artery probed once more he knew it would be a permanent mark like the thirteeninch scar running down his chest as he stared at himself his thoughts drifted to his father he remembered the permanent marks the tattoos left on the old mans neck the coordinates of a radiation battle that served only to prolong the inevitable the temperature reading was normal he washed the thermometer and put it back then took the clipboard with the temperature log sheet off the towel hook and wrote the date and time in the last column undertemperature he drew another dash indicating no change after hanging up the board he leaned into the mirror to look at his eyes green flecked with gray the corneas showing hairline cracks of red he stepped back and pulled the shirt off the mirror was small but he could still see the scar whitish pink and thick ugly he did this often appraised himself it was because he couldnt get used to the way his body looked now and the way it had so fully betrayed him cardiomyopathy fox had told him it was a virus that could have been waiting in the walls of his heart for years only to bloom by happenstance and to be nurtured by stress the explanation meant little to him it didnt ease the feeling that the man he had once been was gone now forever he sometimes felt when he looked at himself he was looking at a stranger someone beaten down and left fragile by life after pulling his shirt back on he went into the forward berth it was a triangularshaped room that followed the shape of the bow there was a double bunk on the port side and a bank of storage compartments to starboard he had turned the lower berth into a desk and used the overhead berth for storage of cardboard boxes full of old bureau files marked on the side of these boxes were the names of the investigations they saidpoetcodezodiacfull moon andbremmer two of the boxes were markedvarious unsubs mccaleb had copied most of his files before leaving the bureau it was against policy but no one stopped him the files in the boxes came from various cases open and closed some filled whole cartons some were thin enough to share space in the same boxes he wasnt sure why he had copied everything he hadnt opened any of the boxes since he had retired but at various times he had thought he would write a book or maybe even continue his investigations of the open cases largely though he just liked the idea of having the files as a physical accounting or proof of what he had done with that part of his life mccaleb sat down at the desk and turned on the wallmounted light momentarily his eyes fell on the fbi badge he had carried for sixteen years it was now encased in a lucite block and hanging on the wall above the desk tacked to the wall next to it was a photo of a young girl with braces smiling at the camera it had been copied from a yearbook many years before mccaleb frowned at the memory and looked away his eyes falling to the desk clutter there was a handful of bills and receipts scattered on the desk an accordion file full of medical records a stack of manila files that were mostly empty three fliers from competing drydocking services and the cabrillo marina dockage rules book his checkbook was open and ready to be put to use but he couldnt bring himself to wade into the mundane task of paying bills not now he was restless but it was not because of a paucity of things on his mind he couldnt stop thinking about the visit from graciela rivers and the sudden change it had put him through he sorted through the clutter on the desk until he found the newspaper clip that had brought the woman to his boat he had read it the day it was published cut it out and then tried to forget about it but that had been impossible the story had drawn a procession of victims to his boat the mother whose teenage daughters body was found mutilated on the beach down in redondo the parents whose son had been hanged in an apartment in west hollywood the young husband whose wife had gone clubbing on the sunset strip one night and had never come back all of them zombies left nearly catatonic by grief and the betrayal of their faith in a god who wouldnt allow such things to happen mccaleb couldnt comfort them he couldnt help them he sent them on their way he had agreed to the newspaper interview only because he was in the reporters debt when he had been with the bureau keisha russell had always been good to him she was the kind of reporter who gave some and didnt always take she had called him on the boat a month earlier to collect on that debt shed been assigned the story for the times s whatever happened to column since a year earlier she had written a story about mccalebs wait for a heart she wanted to update it now that he had finally received the transplant mccaleb wanted to decline the invitation knowing it would disrupt the anonymous life he was now living but russell had reminded him of all the times she had helped himeither holding back details of an investigation or putting them into a story depending on what mccaleb thought would be useful mccaleb felt he had no choice he always made good on his debts on the day the story was published mccaleb had taken it as his official badge of hasbeen status usually the column was reserved for updates on hack politicians who had disappeared from the local scene or people whose fifteen minutes of fame had long ago lapsed every now and then it featured a washedup tv star who was selling real estate or had become a painter because it was his true creative calling he unfolded the clip now and reread it new heart new start for former fbi agent by keisha russell times staff writer it used to be that terrell mccalebs face was a routine fixture on the nightly newscasts of los angeles and his words always found space in the local newspapers it was not a nice routine for him or the city an fbi agent mccaleb was the bureaus point man in the investigations of the handful of serial killers that plagued los angeles and the west in the last decade a member of the investigative support unit mccaleb helped focus the investigations of the local police mediasavvy and always quotable he often took the spotlighta move that sometimes rubbed the locals and his supervisors in quantico va the wrong way but it has been more than two years since he has made even a blip on the public radar screen these days mccaleb no longer carries a badge or a gun he says he doesnt even own a standardissue navy blue fbi suit anymore more often than not he wears old blue jeans and torn tshirts and can be found restoring his foot fishing boat the following sea mccaleb who was born in los angeles and grew up in avalon on nearby catalina island currently lives on the boat in a san pedro marina but plans eventually to moor the vessel in avalon harbor recovering from heart transplant surgery mccaleb says hunting serial killers and rapists is the furthest thing from his mind these days mccaleb says he gave his heart to the bureauhis doctors say severe stress triggered a virus that led to the nearfatal weakening of his original heartbut doesnt miss it when you go through something like this it changes you more than just physically he said in an interview last week it puts things in perspective those fbi days seem like a long time ago ive got a new start now i dont know exactly what im going to do with it but im not too worried ill find something mccaleb almost didnt get the new start because he has a blood type found in less than one percent of the population his wait for a suitable heart lasted almost two years he really strung it out said dr bonnie fox the surgeon who performed the transplant we probably would have lost him or he would have become too weak to undergo the surgery if wed had to wait much longer mccaleb is out of the hospital and already physically active after only eight weeks he says that only on occasion does he think about the adrenalinepumping investigations that once occupied him the former agents case list reads like a whos who of a macabre walk of fame among the cases he worked locally were the nightstalker and poet investigations and he took key roles in the hunts for the code killer sunset strip strangler and luther hatch who became known after his arrest as the cemetery man because of his visits to the graves of his victims mccaleb had been a profiler in the units quantico base for several years he specialized in west coast cases and was flown to los angeles often to assist local police in investigations finally the units supervisors decided to create a satellite post here and mccaleb was returned to his native los angeles to work out of the fbi field office in westwood the move put him closer to many of the investigations in which the fbi was called upon for assistance not all of the investigations were successful and eventually the stress took its toll mccaleb suffered a heart attack while working late one evening in the local field office he was found by a night janitor who was credited with saving the agents life doctors determined mccaleb suffered from advanced cardiomyopathya weakening of the hearts musclesand placed him on a transplant list as he waited he was given a disability retirement by the bureau he traded his bureau pager for a hospital pager and on feb it sounded a heart from a donor with matching blood was available after six hours of surgery at cedarssinai medical center the donors heart was beating in mccalebs chest mccaleb is unsure what hell do with his new lifeother than go fishing he has had offers from former agents and police detectives to join them as a private investigator or security consultant but his focus so far has been on restoring the following sea a twentyyearold sportfishing boat he inherited from his father the boat was left to deteriorate for six years but now has mccalebs fulltime attention at the moment im content to take things a little at a time he said im not worried too much about whats ahead his regrets are few but like all retired investigators and fishermen mccaleb laments the ones that got away i wish i had solved all the cases he said i hated it when somebody got away i still do for a moment mccaleb studied the photo they had used with the story it was an old head shot they had used many times before during his days with the bureau his eyes stared boldly into the camera when keisha russell had come around to do the story on him she had come with a photographer but mccaleb wouldnt let them take a fresh shot he told them to use one of the old photos he didnt want anybody to see the way he looked now not that anyone could tell much unless he had his shirt off he was about thirty pounds lighter but that wasnt what he wanted to hide it was the eyes he had lost that lookthe eyes as piercingly hard as bullets he didnt want anyone to know he had lost that he folded the newspaper clip and put it aside he tapped his fingers on the desk for a few seconds while brooding over things and then looked at the steel paper spike next to the phone the number graciela rivers had given him was scratched in pencil on the scrap of paper that sat at the top of the stack of notes punctured by the spike when he was an agent he had carried with him a bottomless reservoir of rage for the men he hunted he had seen firsthand what they had done and he wanted them to pay for the horrible manifestations of their fantasies blood debts had to be paid in blood that was why in the bureaus serial killer unit the agents called what they did blood work there was no other way to describe it and so it worked on him cut at him every time one didnt pay every time one got away what happened to gloria torres now cut at him he was alive because she had been taken away by evil graciela had told him the story gloria had died for no reason other than that she was in the way of somebody and a cash register it was a simple stupid and ghastly reason to die it somehow put mccaleb in debt to her and her son to graciela even to himself he picked up the phone and dialed the number scratched on the paper it was late but he didnt want to wait and he didnt think she would want him to she answered in a whisper after only one ring miss rivers yes its terry mccaleb you came by my yes is this a bad time no well listen i wanted to tell you that i uh have been thinking about things and i promised you id call you back no matter what i decided yes there was a hopeful tone in just her one word it touched his heart well this is what i think my um my skills i guess youd call them theyre not really suited to this kind of crime from what you described about your sister were talking about a random occurrence with a financial motive a robbery so its different from you know the kind of cases i worked for the bureau the serial cases i understand the hopefulness was bleeding out no im not saying im not going toyou know that im not interested im calling because i am going to go see the police tomorrow and ask about this but thank you i dont know how successful im going to be thats what im trying to say i dont want to get your hopes up is what im saying these things i dont know i understand thank you for just being willing to do this nobody well ill take a look at things he said cutting her off he didnt want her thanking him too much i dont know what kind of help or cooperation ill get from the la police but ill do what i can i owe your sister at least that much to try she was silent and he told her he needed to get some additional information about her sister as well as the names of the lapd detectives on the case they talked for about ten minutes and when he had all of the information he needed written down in a small notebook an uneasy silence played across the telephone line well he finally said i guess thats it then ill call you if i have any other questions or if anything else comes up thank you again something tells me i should be thanking you im glad ill be able to do this i just hope it helps oh it will youve got her heart shell guide you yes he said hesitantly not really understanding what she meant or why he was agreeing ill call you when i can he hung up and stared at the phone for a few moments thinking about her last line then again he unfolded the newspaper clip with his picture he studied the eyes for a long time finally he folded the newspaper clip closed and hid it under some of the paperwork on the desk he looked up at the girl with the braces and after a few moments nodded then he turned off the light when mccaleb had been with the bureau the agents he worked with called this part the hard tango it was the finesse moves they had to make with the locals it was an ego thing and a territorial thing one dog doesnt piss in another dogs yard not without permission there was not a single homicide cop working who did not have a healthy ego it was an absolute job requirement to do the job you had to know in your heart that you were up to the task and that you were better smarter stronger meaner more skilled and more patient than your adversary you had to flatout know that you were going to win and if you had any doubts about that then you had to back off and work burglaries or take a patrol shift or do something else the problem was that homicide egos were often unchecked to the point that some detectives extended the view they had of their adversaries to those who wanted to help themfellow investigators especially fbi agents no homicide cop on a stalledout case wants to be told that maybe someone elseparticularly a fed from quantico might be able to help or could do it better it had been mccalebs experience that when a cop finally gave up and put a case into cold storage he secretly didnt want anyone taking it out and proving him wrong by solving it as an fbi agent mccaleb was almost never asked into a case or called for advice by the lead detective it was always the supervisors idea the supervisor didnt care about egos or hurt feelings the supervisor cared about clearing cases and improving statistical reports and so the bureau would be called and mccaleb would come in and have to do the dance with the lead detective sometimes it was the smooth dance of coordinated partners more often it was the hard tango toes got stepped on egos got bruised on more than one occasion mccaleb suspected that a detective he was working with was holding back information or was secretly pleased when mccaleb was unsuccessful in helping identify a suspect or bringing closure to a case it was part of the petty territorial bullshit of the law enforcement world sometimes consideration of the victim or the victims family wasnt even on the plate it was dessert and sometimes there was no dessert mccaleb was pretty sure he was facing a hard tango with the lapd it didnt matter that they had apparently hit the wall with the gloria torres investigation and could use the help it was territorial and to make matters worse he wasnt even with the fbi anymore he was going in naked without a badge all he had with him when he arrived at seventhirty on tuesday morning at the west valley division was his leather bag and a box of doughnuts he was going to be dancing the hard tango without music mccaleb had chosen his arrival time because he knew that most detectives started early so they could get done early it was the time when he had the best chance of catching the two assigned to the gloria torres case in their office graciela had given him their names arrango and walters mccaleb didnt know them but he had met their commanding officer lieutenant dan buskirk a few years earlier on the code killer case but it was a superficial relationship mccaleb didnt know what buskirk thought about him he decided though that it would be best to follow protocol and start with buskirk and then hopefully get to arrango and walters west valley division was on owensmouth street in reseda it seemed to be an odd place for a police station most of the lapds stations were placed in the tough areas where police attention was needed most they had concrete walls erected at the entranceways to guard against driveby shootings but west valley was different there were no barriers the station was in a bucolic middleclass residential setting there was a library on one side and a public park on the other plenty of parking at the front curb across the street was a row of signature san fernando valley ranch houses after the cab dropped him off out front mccaleb entered through the main lobby threw an easy salute at one of the uniformed officers behind the counter and headed toward the hallway to the left he showed no hesitation he knew it led to the detective bureau because most of the citys police divisions were laid out the same way the uniform didnt stop him and this encouraged mccaleb maybe it was the box of doughnuts but he took it to mean he still had at least some of the look the confident walk of a man carrying a gun and a badge he was carrying neither after entering the detective bureau he came to another counter by pressing against it and leaning over he could look to the left and through the glass window of the small office he knew belonged to the detective lieutenant it was empty can i help you he straightened up and looked at the young detective who had approached the counter from a nearby desk probably a trainee assigned counter duty usually they used old men from the neighborhood who volunteered their time or cops assigned light duty because of injury or disciplinary action i was hoping to see lieutenant buskirk is he here hes in a meeting at valley bureau can i help you with something that meant buskirk was in van nuys at the valleywide command office mccalebs plan to start with him was out the window he could now wait for buskirk or leave and come back but go where the library there wasnt even a nearby coffee shop he could walk to he decided to take his chances with arrango and walters he wanted to keep moving how about arrango or walters in homicide the detective glanced at a plastic wallmounted board with names going down the left side and rows of boxes to be checked that saidin andout as well asvacation andcourt but there were no check marks of any kind made after the names arrango and walters let me check the frontman said your name my name is mccaleb but it wont mean anything to them tell them its about the gloria torres case the frontman went back to his desk and punched in three digits on the phone he spoke in a whisper mccaleb knew then that as far as the frontman was concerned he didnt have the look in a half minute the call was done and the frontman didnt bother getting up from the desk turn around back down the hall first door on the right mccaleb nodded took the box of doughnuts off the counter and followed the instructions as he approached he put the leather bag under one arm so he could open the door but it opened as he was reaching for it a man in a white shirt and tie stood there his gun was held in a shoulder harness under his right arm this was a bad sign detectives rarely used their weapons homicide detectives even less than others whenever mccaleb saw a homicide detective with a shoulder harness instead of the more comfortable belt clip he knew he was dealing with a major ego he almost sighed out loud mr mccaleb thats me im eddie arrango what can i do for you my guy up front said youre here about glory torres they shook hands after mccaleb awkwardly transferred the box of doughnuts to his left hand thats right he was a large man more in horizontal than vertical proportions latino with a full head of black hair feathered with gray midforties with a solid build no stomach over the belt it went with the shoulder harness he took up the whole door and made no move to invite his visitor in is there a place we can talk about this talk about what im going to be looking into her murder so much for finesse mccaleb thought oh shit here we go arrango said he shook his head in annoyance glanced behind him and then back at mccaleb all right he said lets get this over with you got about ten minutes before i toss you outta here he turned around and mccaleb followed him into a room crowded with desks and detectives some of them looked up from their work at mccaleb the intruder but most didnt bother arrango snapped his fingers to draw the attention of a detective at one of the desks along the far wall he was on the phone but looked up to see arrango signal him the man on the phone nodded and held up one finger arrango led the way to an interview room with a small table pushed against one wall and three chairs it was smaller than a prison cell he closed the door have a seat my partner will be in in a minute mccaleb took the chair opposite the table this meant arrango would likely take the chair to mccalebs right or be forced to squeeze behind him to go to the chair on his left mccaleb wanted him on the right it was a small thing but a routine he had always followed as an agent put the subject you are talking to on the right it means they look at you from the left and engage the side of the brain that is less critical and judgmental a psychologist at quantico had once given the tip while teaching a class on techniques of hypnosis and interrogation mccaleb wasnt sure if it worked but he liked to have any edge he could get and he thought he might need one with arrango you want a doughnut he asked as arrango took the chair on his right no i dont want any of your doughnuts i just want you on your way and out of my way its the sister isnt it youre working for the goddamn sister let me see your ticket i cant believe shes wasting her money on i dont have a license if thats what you mean arrango drummed his fingers on the scarred table as he thought about this jesus you know its stuffy in here we shouldnt keep it closed up like this arrango was a bad actor he delivered the line as if he were reading it off a chart on the wall he got up adjusted the thermostat on the wall by the door and then sat back down mccaleb knew that he had just turned on a tape recorder as well as a video camera hidden behind the air duct grill over the door first off you say you are conducting an investigation of the gloria torres homicide is that correct well i havent really started i was going to talk to you first and then go from there but youre working for the victims sister graciela rivers asked me to look into it yes and you have no license in the state of california to operate as a private investigator true true the door opened and the man arrango had signaled earlier stepped into the room without turning around and looking at his partner arrango held a hand up fingers spread signaling him not to interrupt the man mccaleb assumed was walters folded his arms and leaned against the wall next to the door do you understand sir that it is a crime in this state to operate as a private investigator without a license i could arrest you on a misdemeanor right now its illegal not to mention unethical to take money to conduct a private investigation without the proper license yes im aware of that wait youre telling me youre doing this for free thats right as a friend of the family mccaleb was quickly growing tired of the bullshit and wanted to get on with what he was there for look can we skip all the bullshit and turn off the tape and the camera and just talk for a few minutes besides your partner is leaning against the microphone youre not picking anything up walters jumped away from the thermostat just as arrango turned around to see that mccaleb had been right why didnt you tell me walters said to his partner shuddup hey have a doughnut guys mccaleb said im here to help arrango turned back to mccaleb still a bit flustered how the fuck did you know about the tape because youve got the same setup in every detective bureau in the city and ive been in most of them i used to be with the bureau thats how i knew the fbi walters asked fbi retired graciela rivers is an acquaintance she asked me to look into this i said i would i want to help whats your name walters asked obviously he was coming to everything late because he had been on the phone mccaleb stood up and extended his hand walters shook it as mccaleb introduced himself dennis walters was younger than arrango pale white skin slim build his clothes were loose baggy suggesting that his wardrobe had not been updated since he had experienced a dramatic loss in weight he wore no holster at all that mccaleb could see he probably kept his gun in his briefcase until he went out on the street mccalebs kind of cop walters knew it wasnt the gun that made the man his partner didnt i know you he said pointing a finger at mccaleb youre that guy the serial guy what are you talking about arrango said you know the profilers the serial killer squad he was the one they sent out here permanently since most of the nuts are out here he worked the sunset strip strangler what else the code killer that cemetery guy a bunch of cases out here he then put his attention back on mccaleb right mccaleb nodded walters snapped his fingers didnt i read about you recently something in the slimes right once again mccaleb nodded the whatever happened to column two sundays back thats it right you got a heart transplant right mccaleb nodded he knew that familiarity bred comfort eventually they would get down to business walters remained standing behind arrango but mccaleb saw his gaze drop to the box on the table you want a doughnut detective id hate to see them go to waste i didnt get breakfast but im not going to have one if you guys dont dont mind if i do walters said as he came forward and opened the box he glanced anxiously at his partner arrangos face was a stone walters took out a glazed doughnut mccaleb took a cinnamon sugar and then arrango broke and reluctantly took a powdered sugar they ate silently for a few moments before mccaleb reached into his sport coat and pulled out the stack of napkins he had grabbed at winchells he tossed them onto the table and everyone took one so the bureau pensions so short youve gotta pick up pi work huh walters said his mouth full of doughnut im not a pi the sisters an acquaintance like i said im not being paid an acquaintance arrango said thats the second time you said that how exactly do you know her i live on a boat down at the harbor i met her at the marina one day she likes boats we met she found out what i once did for the bureau and asked me to take a look at this whats the problem he didnt know exactly why he was shading the truth to the point of lying other than that he had immediately taken a disliking to arrango he didnt feel he wanted to reveal his true connection to gloria torres and graciela rivers well look arrango said i dont know what she told you about this but this is a convenience store robbery fbi man this isnt charlie manson or ted bundy or jeffrey fucking dahmer its not rocket science this is some mope with a mask and a gun and the right ratio of balls to brains to use it all to make a couple dollars this isnt what youre used to seein is what im saying i know that mccaleb said but i told her id check into it its been what going on two months now i thought maybe you guys wouldnt mind a fresh set of eyes on something you cant be spending much time on anymore walters took the bait our teams pulled four cases since then and eddies been in trial the last two weeks in van nuys he said as far as rivers goes its still active arrango said cutting his partner off mccaleb looked from walters to arrango right sure and weve got a rule that we dont invite amateurs in on active cases amateurs you got no badge no private ticket that says amateur to me mccaleb let the insult go by he guessed arrango was just taking his measure anyway he pushed on thats one of those rules you bring up when its convenient he said but we all know here that i might be able to help you what you need to know is that im not here to show you guys up not at all anything i come up with youll be the first to know suspects leads anything it all goes to you id just like a little cooperation thats all cooperation in exactly what form arrango asked like my partner who talks too much says were kind of busy here copy me the murder book also any video you have im good on crime scenes that was sort of my specialty i might be able to help you there just copy me what youve got and ill get out of your way what youre saying is you think we fucked up that the answers sitting there in the book ready to jump out at you cause youre a fed and the feds are so much smarter than us mccaleb laughed and shook his head he was beginning to think he should have counted his losses and left as soon as he saw the machoman holster he tried once more no thats not what im saying i dont know if you missed anything or not ive worked with lapd many times if i was betting id bet you missed nothing all im saying is that i told graciela rivers id check into things let me ask you something does she call you much the sister too much week in and week out and i tell her the same thing every time no suspects no leads youre waiting on something to happen right give it new life maybe well this could at least be your way of getting her off your back if i see what youve got and go back to her and say you boys did what you could she might back off shell believe it from me because she knows me neither of them said anything what have you got to lose mccaleb prodded wed have to clear any kind of cooperation with the lieutenant arrango said we cant just give out copies of investigative records without his sayso rules or no rules in fact you fucked up there bro you shouldve gone to him before you came to us you know how the games played you didnt follow protocol i understand that i asked for him when i got here but they said he was at valley bureau yeah well he should be back soon arrango said checking his watch tell you what you say youre good with crime scenes yeah if you got a tape id like to take a look at it arrango looked at walters and winked then he looked back at mccaleb we got better than a crime scene tape we got the crime he kicked back his chair and stood up come on he said bring those doughnuts with you arrango opened a drawer in one of the desks crammed into the squad room and took out a videotape he then led the way out of the homicide squad office down the hall and then through the half door of the main detective bureau counter mccaleb could see they were headed for buskirks office which was still empty mccaleb left the doughnuts on the front counter and followed the others in pushed into one corner of the room was a tall steel cabinet on wheels it was the kind of setup used in classrooms and rollcall rooms arrango opened the two doors and there was a television and a videocassette player inside he turned the equipment on and shoved in the tape so look at this and tell us something we dont know yet he said to mccaleb without looking at him then maybe we go to bat for you with the lieutenant mccaleb moved until he stood directly in front of the television arrango hit the play button and soon the blackandwhite image came up on the television screen mccaleb was looking at the view held by an overhead surveillance camera in a small convenience store the frame was drawn around the front counter area it was glasstopped and full of cigars and disposable cameras and batteries and other highend items a printed date and timeline ran across the bottom of the screen the frame was empty for a few moments and then the top of the grayhaired countermans head came into view in the lower left corner as he leaned over the cash register thats chan ho kang the owner arrango said punching the screen with a finger and leaving a smudge of doughnut grease hes spending his last few seconds on the planet here kang had the cash drawer open he broke a roll of quarters against the corner of the counter case and then dumped them into the appropriate section of the drawer just as he shoved it closed a woman entered the frame a customer mccaleb recognized her instantly from the photo graciela rivers had showed him on the boat gloria torres smiled as she approached the counter and placed two hersheys candy bars down on the glass she then pulled her purse up opened it and took out her wallet as mr kang punched keys on the register gloria looked up money in hand when suddenly another figure entered the frame it was a man with a black ski mask covering his face and wearing what looked like a black jumpsuit he moved up behind gloria unnoticed she was still smiling mccaleb looked at the time counter saw it said and then looked back at what was happening in the store it gave him a strange feeling to watch the action take place in this surreal blackandwhite silence from behind the man in the ski mask put his right hand on glorias right shoulder and in one continuous move of the left hand put the muzzle of a handgun against her left temple without hesitation he pulled the trigger baddabing arrango said mccaleb felt his chest clench like a fist as he watched the bullet tear into glorias skull a horrifying mist of blood jettisoning from the entry and exit wounds on either side of her head never knew what hit her walters said quietly gloria jerked forward onto the counter and then bounced backward collapsing into the shooter as he brought his right arm up around her and across her chest stepping backward gloria in front of him as a shield he raised his left hand again and fired a shot at mr kang striking him somewhere in the body the store owner bounced off the wall behind him and then forward his upper body crashing down over the counter and cracking the glass his arms flung out across the counter and his hands grappled for a hold like a man going over a cliff finally he let go his body flopping to the floor behind the counter the shooter let glorias body slide to the ground and her upper body fell outside the view of the video frame only her hand as if reaching across the floor and legs stayed in the picture the shooter moved toward the counter quickly leaning over and looking down at mr kang on the floor kang was reaching into a shelf below the counter frantically pulling out stacks of brown bags the shooter just watched him until finally kangs arm came out a black revolver in his hand the man in the ski mask dispassionately shot kang in the face before he ever got the chance to raise his gun leaning further over the counter his feet in the air the shooter grabbed one of the bullet shells that had ejected and fallen next to kangs arm he then straightened up reached over and took the bills from the open cash register drawer he looked up at the camera despite the mask it was clear the man winked and said something to the camera then quickly left the frame to the left hes picking up the other two shells walters said no sound on the camera right mccaleb said right walters said whatever he said there he said to himself only one camera in the store only one kang was cheap thats what we were told as they continued to watch the shooter made one more pass through the corner of the screen on his way out mccaleb stared blankly at the television stunned by the harshness of the violence despite his experience two lives spent for the contents of a cash drawer you aint gonna see that on americas favorite home videos arrango said mccaleb had dealt with cops like arrango for years they acted as though nothing ever got to them they could look at the worst crime scenes and find the joke it was part of the survival instinct act and talk as if it means nothing to you and youve got a shield you wont get hurt can i see it again mccaleb said can you slow it down this time wait a minute walters said its not over what the good samuel comes in just about now he said it with a hispanic pronunciation sam well the good samuel good samaritan mexican guy comes in the store finds them and tries to help he kept the woman alive but there was nothing he could do for kang then he goes out to the pay phone out front and makesthere he is mccaleb looked back at the screen the timeline now read and a darkhaired darkcomplected man in jeans and a tshirt had entered the picture he first hesitated on the right side of the screen apparently looking at gloria torres and then went to the counter and looked over it kangs body lay on the floor in a lake of blood there were wide ugly bullet wounds in his chest and face his eyes were open and still he was obviously dead the good samaritan returned to gloria he knelt on the floor and apparently hunched over her upper body which was offscreen but almost immediately he was up again and out of the picture he went down the aisles looking for bandages arrango said he actually wrapped her head with masking tape and a kotex a supersize the good samaritan returned and went to work on gloria although all of this was offscreen the camera never picked up a great shot of him arrango said and he didnt stick around after he made the call to nine one one out front he split he never came in later nope we went on the tv news with it you know asking for him to come forward because he mightve seen something that would help the investigation but nothing this guy went up in smoke weird on the screen the man stood up his back still to the camera as he was moving out of the frame he glanced to his left and a brief profile of his face was visible he had a dark mustache he then disappeared from view he now calls the cops mccaleb asked nine one one walters said he said ambulance and they put him through to the fire department why didnt the guy come in we got a theory on that arrango said care to share it the voice on the nine one one tape had an accent walters said latino we figure the guy was an illegal he didnt stick around because he was afraid if we talked to him wed find out and ship him back mccaleb nodded it was plausible especially in la where there were hundreds of thousands of illegals avoiding authorities we put out fliers in the mexican neighborhoods and went on channel thirtyfour walters continued promised he wouldnt be deported if hed just come in and tell us what he saw but we got nothing happens a lot in those neighborhoods hell the places they come from theyre more scared a the cops than the bad guys too bad mccaleb said he was there so soon he probably saw the shooters car maybe got the plate maybe walters said but if he got the plate he didnt bother giving it to us on the tape he did give a halfass description of the carblack car like a truck was how he described it but he hung up before the girl could ask if he got a plate can we watch it again mccaleb asked sure why not arrango said he rewound the tape and they silently watched it again this time with arrango using the slow motion button during the shooting mccalebs eyes stayed on the shooter for every frame that he was on film though the mask hid his expression there were times that his eyes were clearly seen brutal eyes that showed nothing as he gunned down two people their color indiscernible because of the blackandwhite tape jesus mccaleb said when it was over arrango ejected the tape and turned off the equipment he turned and looked at mccaleb so tell us something he said youre the expert help us out here the challenge was clearly evident in his voice put up or shut up they were back to the territorial thing id have to think about it maybe watch the tape some more figures arrango responded dismissively ill tell you one thing mccaleb said looking only at arrango this wasnt the first time he pointed at the dead tv tube no hesitation no panic the quick in and out the calm handling of the weapon and the kick the presence of mind to pick up the brass this guys done this before this isnt the first time and probably not the last plus hed been in there before he knew there was a camerathats why he wore the mask i mean its true that lots of places like that have cameras but he looked right up at this one he knew where it was that means hed been in there before hes either from the neighborhood or he came in earlier to case the place arrango smirked and walters looked quickly from mccaleb to his partner he was about to say something when arrango held up his hand to silence him mccaleb knew then that what he had just said had been accurate and that they already knew it what he asked how many others arrango now held both hands up in a handsoff gesture thats it for now he said we talk to the lieutenant and we let you know what is this mccaleb protested finally losing his patience why show me the tape and stop there give me a shot at this i might help you what have you got to lose oh im sure you can help but our hands are tied let us talk to the lieutenant and well get back to you he signaled everybody out of the office mccaleb thought for a moment about refusing to leave but dismissed it as a bad idea he walked through the door arrango and walters behind him when will i hear from you as soon as we know what we can do for you arrango said give me a number well be in touch mccaleb stood outside the stations lobby waiting for the cab to show he was steaming about how he had allowed arrango to play him guys like arrango got off on holding something out to a person and then snatching it away mccaleb had always known people like arrangoon both sides of the law but there was nothing he could have done about it for now it was arrangos show mccaleb wasnt really expecting to hear from him again he knew that he would have to call him for an answer that was how the game was played mccaleb decided he would give it until the next morning before he would call when the cab got there mccaleb got in the back behind the driver it was a way of discouraging conversation he checked the name on the dashboard license card and saw it was russian and unpronounceable he pulled the small notebook out of his bag and gave the driver the address for the sherman market in canoga park they headed north on reseda boulevard and then west on sherman way until they came to the small market near the intersection of winnetka avenue the cab pulled into the lot in front of the small store the place was nondescript unimpressive its plateglass windows plastered with brightly colored sale signs it looked like a thousand other minimarkets in the city except someone had decided that this one was worth robbing and that it was worth killing two people in order to accomplish that goal before getting out mccaleb studied the signs covering the windows they blocked off a view of the interior he knew that was probably the reason the shooter had chosen this store even if passing motorists glanced over they wouldnt see what was going on inside finally he opened the door and got out he stepped to the drivers window and told the man to wait for him as he went into the store he heard the tinkling of a bell from above the door the cash register counter depicted in the video was set up near the back wall directly across from the door an old woman stood back behind the counter she was staring at mccaleb and she looked scared she was asian mccaleb realized who she might be looking around as if he had come in with a purpose other than to gawk he saw the display racks full of candy and picked out a hersheys bar he stepped to the counter and placed it down noticing that the glass top of the case was still cracked the full realization that he was in the same spot where glory torres had stood and smiled at mr kang then hit him he looked up at the old woman with a pained expression on his face and nodded anything else no just this she rang it up and he paid her he studied her hesitant movements she knew he wasnt from the neighborhood or a regular customer she still was not at ease she probably never would be when she gave him his change mccaleb noticed that the watch she wore on her wrist had a wide black rubber wristband and a large face it was a mans watch and it dwarfed her tiny seemingly fragile wrist he had seen the watch before it had been on chan ho kangs wrist in the surveillance video mccaleb remembered focusing on the watch as the video depicted the wounded kang scrambling for purchase on the counter and then finally falling to the floor are you mrs kang mccaleb asked she stopped what she was doing at the register and looked at him yes i know you no its just i heard about what happened here to your husband im sorry she nodded yes thank you then seemingly needing an explanation or salve for her wounds she added the only way to keep evil out is to not unlock door we cant do that we must have business now mccaleb nodded it was probably something her husband had told her when she worried about his operating a cash business in a violent city he thanked her and left the bell ringing overhead again as he went through the door he got back in the cab and appraised the front of the market again it made no sense to him why this place he thought of the video the shooters hand grabbing the cash he couldnt have gotten much mccaleb wished he knew more about the crime more of the details the phone on the wall to the right of the stores windows caught his eye it was the one the unidentified good samaritan had apparently used he wondered if it had been processed for prints after they realized he wasnt coming forward probably not by then it was too late it was a long shot anyway where to the driver said his accent discernible in only two syllables mccaleb leaned forward to give the man an address but hesitated he drummed his fingers on the plastic backing of the front seat and thought for a moment keep the meter running ive got to make a couple calls first he got out again and headed to the pay phone once more taking his notebook out he looked up a number and charged the call to his card it was answered right away times russell did you say times or slimes funny who is this keisha its terry mccaleb hey howre you doing man im fine i wanted to thank you for that story i shouldve called sooner but it was nice hey youre cool nobody else ever calls to thank me for anything well im not that cool i was also calling because i need a favor you got your terminal on you really know how to spoil a good thing yes my terminal is on whats up well im looking for something but im not sure how to find it you think you could do one of those keyword searches for me im looking for stories that would be about a robber who shoots people she laughed thats it she said you know how often people get shot up in robberies this is la you know yeah i know that was stupid okay how about adding in ski mask and maybe only go back about eighteen months think that will narrow it maybe he heard her keyboard start clicking as she tapped into the newspapers computerized library of story files by using key words like robbery and ski mask and shooting she would be able to draw up all stories that had contained those words so whats going on terry i thought you were retired i am doesnt sound like it this is like the old days are you doing some kind of investigation sort of im checking something for a friend and the lapds being the lapd and its worse when you dont have a badge whats it about its not newsworthy yet keisha if it turns out that way youll be the first i let know she blew out her breath in exasperation i hate it when you guys do that she protested i mean why should i help you when you wont let me decide whether somethings a story or not im the newspaper reporter not you i know i know i guess what im saying is that l just want to keep this to myself until i see what is what ill tell you about it after that i promise first crack at it it probably wont pan out but ill tell you one way or the other did you get anything yes she said in a mock pout six hits in the last eighteen months six what are they six stories ill read you the headlines and you tell me if you think you want me to call up the stories okay okay here goes two shot in robbery attempt then we have man shot robbed at atm after that we have deputies seek help in atm shooting lets see the next three look like one related case the headlines are store owner customer shot in robbery followed by second victim dies was times employeeoh shit i never heard about that ill have to read this one myselfand the last one is police seek good samaritan those are the six mccaleb thought for a moment six stories three different incidents could you pull up the first three and read them if theyre not too long why not he listened as her keyboard started clicking his eyes wandered out past the cab to sherman way it was a fourlane street busy even at night he wondered if arrango and walters had been able to come up with any witnesses to the shooters getaway anybody besides the good samaritan mccalebs eyes moved across the street and in the parking lot of a strip mall he saw a man sitting in a car the man raised a newspaper just as mccaleb noticed this and his face disappeared mccaleb checked the car it was an old beater foreign make which dissuaded him from the possibility that maybe arrango had put a quick tail on him he dismissed it as keisha started reading the newspaper story on her computer screen okay the first one ran on october eighth last year its just a short a husband and wife were shot and wounded thursday by a wouldbe robber who was then wrestled to the ground and captured by a group of passersby inglewood police said thursday the couple were walking along manchester boulevard at eleven when a man wearing a ski mask approached and the guy was captured thats what it says okay skip that one im looking for unsolveds i think okay the next story ran friday january twentyfourth headline is man shot robbed at atm no byline its another short a lancaster man who was withdrawing cash from an automatic teller machine was fatally shot wednesday night in what los angeles county sheriffs deputies called a senseless killing james cordell thirty was shot once in the head by an unknown assailant who then took the three hundred dollars he had just withdrawn from the machine the shooting took place at approximately tenpm at a regional state bank branch in the eighteenhundred block of lancaster road sheriffs detective jaye winston said a portion of the shooting was captured on the atm security camera but not enough to identify the gunman the one glimpse of the gunman on the cameras tape showed he was wearing a dark knit ski mask over his head however winston said that the tape revealed that there was no confrontation or refusal on cordells part to turn over the money it was absolutely coldblooded winston said this guy just walked up shot the victim and took the money it was very cold and brutal this guy didnt care he just wanted the money cordell collapsed in front of the welllighted machine but his body was not found until another customer came approximately fifteen minutes later paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene okay thats that one you ready for the next im ready mccaleb had been jotting down some of the details from the story into his notebook he underlined the name winston three times he knew jaye winston he thought winston would be willing to help himmore so than arrango and walters had been jaye winston was not a hard tango mccaleb felt he had finally caught a break keisha russell started reading the next story okay same thing no byline its short and it ran two days later sheriffs deputies said there were no suspects in the fatal shooting this week of a lancaster man who was withdrawing money from an automatic teller machine detective jaye winston said the department wished to speak with any motorists or passersby who were in the area of the eighteenhundred block of lancaster road on wednesday night and may have seen the assailant before or after the tentwenty shooting james cordell thirty was shot once in the head by a robber who wore a ski mask he died at the scene of the robbery three hundred dollars was taken during the robbery though part of the incident was captured by the regional state banks security camera detectives were unable to identify the suspect because of the mask he wore he had to have had it off at one point winston said of the mask he didnt just walk or drive down the street with a mask on people had to have seen this guy and we want to talk to those people okay thats the end mccaleb hadnt taken any notes from the second story but he was thinking about what keisha had read and didnt respond terry you still there yeah sorry any of it help i think so maybe and you still wont tell me what its about not yet keisha but thanks youll be the first to know he hung up and pulled the business card arrango had given him out of his shirt pocket he decided not to wait for arrango or for the next day he had a lead he could follow now whether or not the lapd cooperated with him while he was waiting for the call to be answered he looked across the street the car with the man reading the newspaper was gone the phone was picked up after six rings and he was eventually transferred to arrango mccaleb asked if buskirk was back yet bad news amigo arrango said the lieutenants back all right but he wants to hold off on turning our book over to you yeah how come mccaleb asked trying to disguise his annoyance well i didnt really ask but i think he was pissed that you didnt come in to see him first i told you that you shouldve followed line of command that was kind of hard to do being that he wasnt there this morning and i told you i did ask for him first did you tell him that yeah i told him i think he was in a bad mood coming from valley bureau he probably got his ass chewed about something so then he chewed mine thats how it goes sometimes right down the food chain anyway look youre lucky we showed you the whole thing on tape you got a good start there we shouldntve done that for you some start you know its amazing that anything ever gets solved with all the bureaucratic bullshit that goes on i thought the fbi was unique we used to call it the federal bureau of inertia but i guess its the same all around hey look we dont need your shit we have a whole plate full of it here my boss seems to think i invited you in here and now hes pissed at me i dont need this if you want to go away mad thats your problem but just go away im gone arrango you wont hear from me until i have your shooter ill bring him in for you mccaleb knew it was bullshit grandstanding as soon as he said it but ever since february ninth he had increasingly found that he had zero tolerance for fools arrango laughed sarcastically in response and said yeah right ill be waiting for you he hung up mccaleb held up a finger to the cab driver and made another call he first thought about jaye winston but decided to wait instead he called graciela rivers at the number she had given him for the nursing station in the emergency room of holy cross medical center she agreed to meet him for an early lunch even though he explained that he hadnt accomplished much he told her to look for him in the emergency room waiting room at eleventhirty the hospital was in a part of the valley called mission hills on the way there mccaleb looked out the window at the passing scenery it was mostly strip shopping centers and gas stations the driver was making his way toward the so that he could head north mccalebs knowledge of the valley had come only through cases there had been many most of them falling under his review only on paper and photo prints and videotape from the body dumps along the freeway embankments or the hillsides fringing the northern flats the code killer had hit four times in the valley before he disappeared like the morning marine layer what are you police mccaleb looked away from the window and over the seat at the rearview mirror the drivers eyes were on him what are you policeman or something mccaleb shook his head no im no one he looked back out the window as the cab labored up a freeway onramp they passed a woman who was holding a sign asking for money another victim waiting to be victimized again he sat in the waiting room on a plastic chair across from an injured woman and her husband the woman had internal pain and kept her arms folded across her midsection she was hunched over protecting the hurt her husband was being attentive repeatedly asking how she felt and going to the intake window to ask when she would be taken back for examination but twice mccaleb heard him quietly ask her what are you going to tell them and each time the woman turned her face away at quarter to twelve graciela rivers came through the double doors of the er ward she suggested that they just go to the hospital cafeteria because she had only an hour mccaleb didnt mind because his taste for food had still not come back since the transplant eating at the hospital would be no different to him than eating at jozu on melrose most days he didnt care what he ate and sometimes he forgot about meals until a headache reminded him that he needed to refuel the cafeteria was almost empty they took their trays to a table next to a window which looked out on a huge green lawn surrounding a large white cross this is my one chance to look at daylight graciela said back in the er rooms there are no windows so i always try to get a window mccaleb nodded that he understood way back when i worked in quantico our offices were below ground the basement no windows always damp freezing in the winter even with the heat on i never saw the sun it wears on you after a while is that why you moved out here no other reasons but i did figure id get a window i was wrong they stuck me in a storage closet at the fo seventeen floors up but no windows i think thats why i live on the boat now i like having the sky close by whats the fo sorry field office it was in westwood in the big federal building near the veterans cemetery she nodded so did you really grow up on catalina like the paper said until i was sixteen he said then i lived with my mother in chicago its funny i spent all the time i was growing up on that island just wanting to get off it now im just trying to get back there what will you do there i dont know ive got a mooring over there my father left me maybe i wont do anything maybe ill just drop a line and sit in the sun with a beer in my hand he smiled and she smiled back if you already have a mooring why cant you go now the boats not ready neither am i yet she nodded it was your fathers boat another detail from the newspaper he had obviously said too much about himself to keisha russell he didnt like people knowing so much about him so easily he lived on it over there when he died it came to me i let it sit in dry dock for years now it needs a lot of work did he name it or was that you his name she frowned and squinted her eyes as if something was sour why did he call it the following sea instead of just following sea it doesnt make sense with the in front of following sea no it makes sense it doesnt refer to the act of following behind the sea there is something known as the following sea or a following sea oh what is it a sea is a wave you know how you hear on surf reports that the seas are two to four feet or whatever right okay well a following sea is the one you have to watch out for its the one that comes up behind a vessel you dont see it coming it hits you from behind and swamps you sinks you the rule is that if youre running in following seas youve just got to be moving faster than they are stay ahead of them he named the boat that because it was like a reminder you know always watch over your shoulder it was something he always said to me when i was growing up even when i went over town over town when i left the island he told me always to watch out for the following sea even on land she smiled now that i know the story i like the name do you miss him he nodded but offered nothing else the conversation drifted away and they began to eat their sandwiches mccaleb hadnt planned on the meeting being about him after a few bites he started filling her in on the mornings lack of solid accomplishment he didnt tell her about watching her sister being murdered on the videotape but he told her about his hunch that the torreskang slayings were connected to at least one other incident he told her how he was further guessing that that other incident might be the atm robbery and shooting recounted in the stories keisha russell had read him what will you do next she asked when he was done take a nap she looked at him curiously im beat he said i havent been running around and doing as much thinking as this for a long time im going back to my boat and resting up tomorrow ill start again im sorry no youre not he said with a smile you were looking for somebody with a reason to get involved in this ive got the reason and im involved but ive got to take it slow at first you being a nurse i hope you understand i do i dont want you to hurt yourself that would make glorys dying even more i understand they were silent for a few moments before he picked up the conversation again your take on the lapd was right on i think theyre in a holding pattern waiting for something to happenprobably for this guy to hit again theyre definitely not working it its a cold case until something happens to warm it up she shook her head theyre not working it but they dont want you to have a try at it that makes a lot of sense its a territorial thing its the way the game is played its not a game i know he wished he had chosen a better word then what can you do well in the morning when im fresh ill try the sheriffs department on this other case the one i think is connected i know the lead on it jaye winston we worked a case once a long time ago it went well and im hoping that will get me in the door at least further in than i got with the la people she nodded but she wasnt all that good at masking her disappointment graciela he said i dont know if you were expecting somebody to just come in and solve this like turning a key in a lock but its not realistic to believe that thats movies this is real in all my years in the bureau most of the cases turned on some little detail some little thing that was missed or didnt seem important at first but then it comes back around to being the key to the whole thing it just takes time to get there sometimes to find that little detail i know i know it just frustrates me that more wasnt done sooner yes when the he was going to say when the blood was fresh what nothing its just that with most cases the more time goes by the harder it gets he knew he wasnt helping her any by telling her the reality of the situation but he wanted her to be prepared for his eventual failure he had been good in his day but not that good he now realized that by agreeing to take the case he had only set graciela rivers up for disappointment his selfish dream of redemption would be another painful dose of reality for her those men just didnt care she said he studied her downcast eyes he knew she was talking about arrango and walters well i do they finished eating in silence after mccaleb pushed his plate aside he watched her as she gazed out the window even in her white polyester nurses uniform with her hair pinned back graciela rivers stirred something in him she had a kind of sadness about her that he wished somehow to soothe he wondered if it had been there before her sister died with most people it is mccaleb had even seen it in the faces of babiesthe sadness already there the events of their lives seemed only to confirm the sadness they already carried was this where she died he asked she nodded and looked back at him she was first taken to northridge stabilized and then transferred here i was here when life support was terminated i was with her he shook his head it must have been very hard i see people dying every day in the er we joke about it to relieve the stress say they are threed definitely done dancing but when its your own i dont joke about it anymore he watched her face as she shook it off shifted gears and moved on away from the trouble spot some people have that fifth gear that they can drop into to get away tell me about her he said what do you mean thats really why i came tell me things about her it will help me the better feel that i have for her the better ill be at this she was quiet a moment her mouth curled in a frown as she thought about how to sum her sister up in a few words is there a kitchen on that boat of yours she finally asked her question caught him off guard what a kitchen on your boat uh its actually called a galley then galley is it big enough to cook real meals sure why are you asking me about my boat you want to know my sister yes then you have to meet her son everything that was good about my sister is in raymond hes all you have to know mccaleb nodded slowly as he understood so how about i bring raymond down to your boat tonight and we make you dinner i already told him about you and about the boat he wants to see it he thought a moment and said tell you what how about we wait until tomorrow that way i can tell you about how my visit to the sheriffs department went maybe ill have something more positive to report tomorrow will be fine and dont worry about cooking dinner dinner will be my job youre turning this all around i wanted to i know i know but you can save that for one night at your home youre coming to my home tomorrow and ill take care of dinner okay okay she said still frowning but realizing he wouldnt be budged then she smiled well be there traffic south on the was intense and the cab didnt drop him off at the marina in san pedro until after two the cab was not airconditioned and he caught a slight headache from the mixture of freeway exhaust fumes and the drivers body odor after he got inside the boat he checked his phone machine and found the only message he had was a hangup call he felt out of sync because his travels that day had involved more physical activity than hed had for a long while his leg muscles were sore and his back was aching he went down to the head and checked his temperature but there was no fever blood pressure and pulse also checked out fine he logged it all on the clipboard then went to his stateroom stripped off his clothes and crawled into the unmade bed despite his physical depletion he had insomnia and lay wide awake on the pillow his mind churned with the thoughts of the day and images from the video after an hour of fooling himself he got up and went up to the salon he dug the notebook out of the jacket he had draped over a chair and read through the notes he had taken earlier nothing stood out but he felt comforted in some way at having started a record of his investigation on a fresh page he jotted down some additional thoughts about the video and a couple of questions he wanted to be sure to cover with jaye winston the next day assuming that the investigators had linked the cases he wanted to know how solid the connection was and whether the three hundred dollars taken from james cordell in the first case was actually taken from the victim or from the atms cash tray he put the notebook aside when he realized he was hungry he got up scrambled three egg whites in a skillet mixed in some tabasco sauce and salsa and made a sandwich with white toast after two bites he put on more tabasco when he had cleaned up the galley he felt the fatigue coming back and finally closing him down he knew he could sleep now he took a quick shower another temperature reading and the evening batch of medications in the mirror he saw he had what looked like a twoday growth of beard even though he had shaved that morning it was a side effect of one of the drugs he was taking prednisone helped fight organ rejection and stimulated hair growth at the same time he smiled at his reflection thinking that the day before he should have told bonnie fox that he felt like a werewolf not frankenstein he was getting his monsters mixed up he went to bed his dream was in black and white they all were now but they had not been before the operation he didnt know what this meant he had told dr fox about it and she had just shrugged in this dream he was in the market he was a player in the video he had been shown by arrango and walters he was at the counter smiling at chan ho kang the store owner smiled back in an unfriendly way and said something what mccaleb asked you dont deserve it mr kang said mccaleb looked down at the counter at his purchase but before he could see what it was he felt the cold ring of steel against his temple he quickly turned and there was the masked man with a gun mccaleb knew in the way knowledge and logic accompany dreams that the man was smiling behind the mask the robber lowered the gun and fired into mccalebs chest his bullet hitting the ten ringthe circle of the heart the bullet went through mccaleb as if he were a paper target but the impact forced him backward a step and then in slow motion he was falling he felt no pain only a sense of relief he looked at the killer as he was going down and recognized the eyes watching through the mask they were his own eyes then came the wink and he kept falling and falling the distant booming of empty cargo containers being unloaded from a ship in the nearby port of los angeles woke mccaleb before dawn as he lay in bed eyes closed but fully awake he pictured the process the crane delicately swinging the container the size of a truck trailer off the ships deck and into the yard then the ground man giving the drop sign early and the huge steel box dropping the last three feet and producing a concussion like a sonic boom echoing across the nearby marinas in mccalebs vision the ground man was laughing each time fucking assholes mccaleb said finally giving up on sleep and sitting up it was the third time in a month it had happened he checked the clock and realized he had slept for more than ten hours he slowly made his way to the head and took a shower after he had toweled off he took the morning reading of vital signs and the prescribed complement of assorted pills and liquid chemicals he logged it all on the progress chart and then got out his razor he was about to spread shaving cream across his face when he looked in the mirror and said fuck it he shaved his neck so he would look neat but left it at that deciding that to shave two or three times a day for the rest of his life or for as long as he was on prednisone wasnt an alternative he had never had a beard before the bureau wouldnt have allowed it after dressing he took a tall glass of orange juice his phone book and the portable phone out to the stern and sat in the fishing chair as the sun came up between gulps of juice he constantly checked his watch waiting for it to hit sevenfifteen which he believed would be the best time to call jaye winston the sheriffs department homicide offices were in whittier on the far side of the county from that location the squads detectives handled all killings committed in unincorporated los angeles county and the various cities the department contracted with to provide law enforcement services one of those cities was palmdale where james cordell had been murdered because the homicide squad offices were so distant mccaleb had decided that it would be foolish to take an hourlong cab ride out there without knowing whether winston would be in when he arrived so he had decided on the sevenfifteen call rather than the surprise visit with a box of doughnuts those assholes mccaleb looked around and saw one of his neighbors buddy lockridge standing in the cockpit of his sailboat a fortytwofoot hunter called the doubledown buddys boat was three slips from the following sea he was holding a mug of steaming coffee in his hand he was in a bathrobe and his hair was standing up on one side mccaleb didnt have to ask whom buddy was calling assholes yeah he said not a good way to start the day point is they shouldnt be allowed to do that all through the night buddy said goddamn nuisance i mean you gotta be able to hear that from here to long beach mccaleb just nodded i talked to them over there in the harbor masters you know told them to make a complaint to the port authority but they dont give a shit im thinking of gettin a little petition going you going to sign it ill sign it mccaleb looked at his watch i know you think its a waste of time no i just dont know if it will work the ports a twentyfourhour operation theyre not going to stop unloading ships at night because a bunch of people on their boats in the marina sign a complaint yeah i know the assholes i wish one of them boxes would drop on them one day then theyd get the idea lockridge was a wharf rat an aging surfer and beach bum he lived a lowcost lowmaintenance life on his boat subsisting mostly on money from odd jobs around the marina like boat sitting and hull scraping the two had met a year earlier shortly after lockridge had moved his boat into the marina mccaleb had been awakened by a middleofthenight harmonica concerto when he got up and left his boat to investigate he traced the sound to a drunken lockridge lying in the cockpit of the doubledown he was playing a harmonica to a tune only he heard on his earphones despite mccalebs complaint that night the two had become friends over time this was largely due to the fact that there were no other liveaboards in that area of the marina each was the others only fulltime neighbor buddy had kept an eye on the following sea while mccaleb had been in the hospital he also often offered mccaleb rides to the grocery store or a nearby mall because he knew terry wasnt supposed to drive in turn mccaleb had lockridge over for dinner every week or so they usually talked about their shared interest in the blues debated sailboats versus power boats and sometimes pulled out mccalebs old file boxes and theoretically solved some of the cases lockridge was always fascinated by the details of mccalebs stories about the bureau and his investigations ive got to make a phone call now bud mccaleb now called over ill talk to you later sure make your call take care of business he waved and disappeared down the hatchway into his boats cabin mccaleb shrugged and made his call after looking up the number he had for jaye winston in his book after a few seconds he was connected jaye its terry mccaleb you remember me after a beat she said course i do how is it going terry i heard you got the new ticker yeah and im doing okay how about you same old same old well you think youll have a few minutes if i swing by this morning you got a case i want to talk about you on the private ticket now terry nah just doin a favor for a friend which one is it the case i mean james cordell the atm case on january twentytwo winston made a hmmph sound but didnt say anything what mccaleb asked well its funny that case has gone cold on me but now youre the second person to call about it in two days shit mccaleb thought he knew who had called keisha russell from the times yup thats on me i asked her for the clips on cordell but i wouldnt tell her why thats why she called you fishing thats what i thought i played dumb so who is the friend who talked you into this mccaleb recounted how he had been asked to look into the murder of gloria torres and how that ultimately led him to the cordell case he acknowledged that he was getting no help from the lapd and that winston was his only alternate route into the case he left out the fact that his new heart had come from gloria torres so did i hit it right he asked at the end are they connected winston hesitated but then confirmed his assumption she also said her case was in a holding pattern at the moment pending new developments listen jaye ill be right up front with you what im hoping to do is come out maybe take a look at the books and whatever else you care to show me then be able to go back to graciela rivers and tell her all that could be done has been done or is being done im not trying to be a hero or to show anybody up winston didnt say anything what do you think mccaleb finally asked you got some time today not a lot can you hold on sure mccaleb was put on hold for a minute he paced around the deck and looked over the side at the dark water his boat floated on terry yo look ive got court at eleven downtown that means i have to be out of here by ten can you make it before then sure hows nine or ninefifteen thatll work okay and thanks look terry i owe you one so im doing this but theres nothing here its just some scumbag out there with a gun this is threestrikes shit thats all what do you mean ive got another call on hold here well talk when you get here before mccaleb got ready to go he stepped up onto the dock and walked over to the doubledown the boat was the marina eyesore lockridge had more possessions than the boat was built to hold his three surfboards his two bikes and his zodiac inflatable were stored on the deck making the boat look like a floating yard sale the hatch was still open but mccaleb saw and heard no activity he called out and waited it was bad marina etiquette to step onto a boat uninvited eventually buddy lockridges head and shoulders came up through the hatch his hair was combed and he was dressed now buddy what do you have going for today whaddaya mean the same thing ive always got going a big goose egg whatd you think i was going to kinkos to update my résumé well look i need a driver for the next few days maybe more you want to do it the jobs yours im paying ten bucks an hour plus any meals youd have to bring a book or something because there will be a lot of sitting around waiting for me buddy climbed all the way up into the cockpit wherere you drivin to ive got to go out to whittier i need to leave in fifteen minutes after that i dont know what is it some kind of investigation mccaleb could see the excitement building in buddys eyes he spent a lot of time reading crime novels and often recounted their plots to mccaleb this would be the real thing yeah im looking into something for somebody but im not looking for a partner buddy just a driver thats okay im in whose car we take yours i pay for gas we take my cherokee i sit in the back its got a passenger side air bag you decide either way is fine with me driving had been forbidden for mccaleb by bonnie fox until at least his ninth month his chest was still closing the skin was healed but beneath the scarred exterior the sternum was still open an impact on a steering wheel or from an air bag could be fatal even in a lowspeed accident well i like the cherokee but lets take mine buddy said id feel like too much of a chauffeur with you in the back in the summer of the body of a woman had been found in a large outcropping of sandstone known as vasquez rocks in the antelope valley in northern los angeles county the body had been there several days decomposition prevented determination of sexual assault but it was assumed the body was clothed but the panties were inside out and the blouse misbuttoneda clear indication that the woman had not dressed herself or had done so only under severe duress cause of death was manual strangulation the means of death in most sexual homicides sheriffs detective jaye winston drew the vasquez rocks killing as lead investigator when the case didnt break quickly with an arrest winston settled in for the long haul ambitious but not burdened by an unchecked ego she contacted the fbi for help as one of her first moves her request was relayed to the serial killer unit and she eventually filled out a case survey for the units violent criminal apprehension program the vicap survey was the means by which mccaleb first became acquainted with winston the case package she had sent to quantico was forwarded to mccalebs storage room office at the los angeles fo in typical bureaucratic fashion the package had gone all the way across the country only to be sent back nearly to its origin for followup through the vicap data base computerwhich compares an eightyquestion survey about an individual killing with those on fileand study of the crime scene and autopsy photos mccaleb matched the vasquez rocks case to another killing a year earlier in the sepulveda pass area of los angeles a similar killing method the dumping of the clothed body on an embankment other small details and nuancesall matched up mccaleb believed they had another serial killer working the la basin in both of the cases it was determined that the woman had been missing two or three days longer than she had been dead this meant the killer had held her captive and alive during that period probably to serve in his ghastly fantasies connecting the cases was only one step identifying and capturing the killer were the obvious following steps however there was nothing to go on mccaleb was curious about the lengthy interval between the two murders the unknown subject as the killer was formally called in fbi documents had gone eleven months before the urges overtook him and he acted out on his fantasies by abducting the second woman to mccaleb this meant that the event was so strongly implanted in the killers mind that his fantasy life could essentially live off it or be fueled by it for almost a year the bureaus serial killer profiling program showed that this interval would grow shorter and shorter each time and the killer would have to seek fresh prey sooner mccaleb worked up a profile for winston but it wasnt much help and they both knew it white male twenty to thirty with a menial job and existence the unknown subject would also have a prior history of sexual crimes or aberrational behavior if this history included incarceration for any lengthy periods it could skew the profiled age span of the subject it was the same old story the vicap profiles were usually deadon accurate but they rarely led to the acquisition of a suspect the profile given to winston could match hundreds maybe thousands of men in the los angeles area so after all investigative leads were played out there was nothing to do but wait mccaleb made a note of the case on his calendar and went on to other cases in march of the following yeareight months from the last murdermccaleb came across the note reread the file and gave winston a call nothing much had changed there still were no leads or suspects mccaleb urged the sheriffs investigator to begin a surveillance of the two body disposal sites and the graves of the two victims he explained that the killer was near the end of his cycle his fantasies would be running dry the urge to freshly recreate the sensation of power and control over another human would be growing and increasingly hard to control the fact that the unknown subject had apparently dressed the bodies after each of the first two murders was a clear sign of the battle raging inside his mind one part of him was ashamed of what he had donehe sought in a subconscious way to cover it up by replacing each victims clothes this suggested that eight months into the cycle the killer would be engulfed in tremendous psychological turmoil the urge to act out his fantasy again and the shame the act would bring were the two sides in a battle for control one way to temporarily placate the urge to kill would be to revisit the sites of his previous crimes in an effort to bring new fuel to the fantasy mccalebs hunch was that the killer would return to one of the disposal spots or visit the graves it would bring him closer to his victims and help him stave off the need to kill again winston was reluctant to instigate a multiple point surveillance operation on the basis of an fbi agents hunch but mccaleb had already received approval for himself and two other agents for stakeout duty he also played upon winstons professionalism telling her that if she didnt do it she would always wonder if the stakeout would have been successful especially if the unknown subject hit again with that kind of threat to her conscience winston went to her lieutenant and counterparts on the lapd case and a surveillance squad was assembled from all three agencies while planning the surveillance winston learned that by coincidence both of the victims were buried in the same glendale cemetery about one hundred yards apart hearing that mccaleb predicted that if the unknown subject was going to show it would be in the cemetery he was right on the fifth night of the surveillance mccaleb winston and two other detectives hiding in a mausoleum with a view of both grave sites watched a man drive into the cemetery in a van get out and climb over the locked gate carrying something under his arm he walked to the grave of the first victim stood motionless in front of it for ten minutes and then headed to the grave of the second victim his actions showed a prior knowledge of the location of the graves at the second grave he unrolled what turned out to be a sleeping bag on top of the grave sat down on it and leaned back against the headstone the detectives did not disturb the man they were recording his visit with a nightvision video camera before long he opened his pants and began masturbating before he returned to the van the man had already been identified through its license plates as luther hatch a thirtyeightyearold gardener from north hollywood released four years earlier from a nineyear folsom prison term for a rape conviction the subject was no longer unknown hatch became a working suspect when his years in prison were subtracted from his age he fit the vicap profile perfectly he was watched around the clock for three weeksincluding during two more visits to the glendale cemeteryuntil finally one night the detectives moved in as he attempted to force a young woman leaving the sherman oaks galleria into his van in the van the arresting officers found duct tape and clothesline cut into fourfoot lengths after receiving a search warrant the investigators tore apart the interior of the van as well as hatchs apartment they recovered hair thread and dried fluid evidence that was later linked through dna and other scientific analysis to the two murder victims quickly dubbed the cemetery man by the local media hatch took his place in the pantheon of multiple murderers who fascinate the public mccalebs expertise and hunches had helped winston break the case it was one of the successes they still talked about in los angeles and quantico on the night they arrested hatch the surveillance team went out to celebrate during a lull in the din jaye winston turned to mccaleb at the bar and said i owe you one we all do buddy lockridge had dressed for his job as terry mccalebs driver as if he were going to a nightclub on the sunset strip head to toe he was clad in black he also carried a black leather briefcase standing on the dock next to the doubledown mccaleb stared at the ensemble without speaking for a long moment whats the matter nothing lets go is this all right its fine but i didnt think youd get so dressed up for just sitting in a car all day you going to be comfortable sure then lets go lockridges car was a sevenyearold silver ford taurus that was well maintained on the way out to whittier he tried three different times to find out what it was mccaleb was investigating but each time the questions were unanswered finally mccaleb was able to deflect the line of questioning by bringing up their old debate over the merits of sailboats versus power boats they got to the sheriffs department star center in a little over an hour lockridge slid the taurus into a spot in the visitors lot and turned off the ignition i dont know how long ill be mccaleb said i hope you brought something to read or youve got one of your harmonicas on you you sure you dont want me to go in with you look bud this might have been a mistake im not looking for a partner all i need is somebody to drive me i spent more than a hundred bucks yesterday on cabs i figured maybe you could use the money instead but if youre going to be asking me questions and okay okay lockridge said cutting in he held his hands up in surrender ill just sit here and read my book no more questions good ill see you mccaleb entered the homicide squad offices on time for his appointment and jaye winston was hovering around the reception area waiting for him she was an attractive woman a few years older than mccaleb she had blond hair that was straight and kept midlength she had a slim build and was dressed in a blue suit with a white blouse mccaleb had not seen her in almost five years since the night they had celebrated the arrest of luther hatch they shook hands and winston led mccaleb to a conference room that had an oval table surrounded by six chairs there was a smaller table against one wall with a doublepot coffeemaker on it the room was empty a thick stack of documents and four videocassettes were sitting on the table you want some coffee winston asked nah im fine then lets get started ive got twenty minutes they took chairs across the table from each other winston pointed at the paper stack and the videos this is all yours i copied everything after you called this morning jeez you kidding thanks with two hands mccaleb pulled the pile toward his chest like a man raking in the pot at the poker table i called arrango over at la winston said he told me not to work with you but i told him you were the best agent i ever dealt with and that i owed you one hes pissed but hell get over it is this la s stuff too yeah weve copied each other back and forth i havent gotten anything from arrango in a couple weeks but thats probably because there hasnt been anything i think its all up to date problem is its a lot of paper and video and it all adds up to nothing so far mccaleb broke the stack of reports in half and started sorting through them it became clear that about twothirds of the work had been generated by sheriffs investigators and the rest by the lapd he gestured to the videotapes what are these youve got both crime scenes there and both shoots arrango told me he showed you the market robbery already yeah well on ours you get even less the shooter enters the frame for only a few seconds just enough for us to see he was wearing a mask but anyway its there for you to look at if you want on yours did the guy take the money from the machine or the victim the machine why i might be able to use that to get some help from the bureau if i need it technically it means the money was taken from the bank not the victim thats a federal offense winston nodded that she understood so how did you connect these ballistics mccaleb asked mindful that her time was limited and he wanted as much from her as he could get she nodded i was working my case already and then a few weeks later im reading the paper and see a story about the other one sounded the same i called la and we got together when you watch the videos terry youll see theres no doubt same mo same gun same guy the ballistics only underlined what we already knew mccaleb nodded i wonder why the guy picked up the brass if he knew the lead would be there what was he using ninemillimeter hardballs federals full metal jacket picking up the shells is just good practice on my case the shot was through and through and we dug the slug out of a concrete wall he probably was guessingmaybe hopingit was too mashed up for a ballistics comparison so like a good little shooter he picked up the brass mccaleb nodded noting the disdain in her voice for her quarry anyway it doesnt really matter she said like i said watch the tapes were dealing with one guy here you dont need ballistics to know it did you or the lapd take it any further than that what do you mean firearms and ballistics yeah who has the evidence we do the la caseloads a little heavier than over here we agreed since our case was first to hold all of the evidence i had f and b do the regular routine you know look for similars et cetera but they drew a blank looks like just these two cases for now mccaleb thought about telling her about the bureaus drugfire computer but decided the time wasnt right yet hed wait until he had reviewed the tapes and the murder books before he started suggesting what she should do he noticed winston check her watch you working this by yourself he asked i am now i caught the lead and dan sistrunk partnered it with me you know him uh was he one of the guys in the mausoleum that night right the hatch surveillance he was there anyway we worked this one together and then other things happened other cases its all mine now lucky me mccaleb nodded and smiled he understood how it went if a case wasnt solved by the team quickly one player got stuck with it you going to get any flak for giving me this stuff no the captain knows what you did for us on lisa mondrian lisa mondrian was the woman found in vasquez rocks mccaleb thought it was unusual that winston had referred to her by name it was unusual because most cops he knew tried to depersonalize the victims it made it easier to live with the captain was the lieutenant back then winston was saying he knows we owe you one we talked and he said give you the stuff i just wish we could pay you with something better than this i dont know what youll be able to do with this terry weve just been waiting meaning they were waiting for the shooter to strike again and hopefully make a mistake unfortunately it often took fresh blood to solve old killings well ill see what i can do with it at least its something to keep me busy what was that you said on the phone about it being threestrikes stuff winston frowned were getting more and more like these ever since they put in the threestrikes law in sacramento i dont know since youve been out of the life if youve followed it but the law says three felony convictions and youre out automatic life without parole right i know about it well with some of these assholes all that did was make em more careful now they wipe out witnesses where before theyd just rob three strikes was supposed to be some kind of deterrent you ask me it just got a lot of people killed like james cordell and the two in that market so you think thats what this guys doing looks it to me you saw one of the tapes theres no hesitation this scumbag knew what he was going to do before he even went up to that atm or into that store he wanted no witnesses so thats the hunch ive been following in my spare time ive been going through the files looking for stickup men with two or more falls already under their belts i think the man in the ski mask is one of them he used to be a robber now hes a robbing murderer natural evolution and no luck yet with the files nope but either ill find him or hell find me hes not the type whos going to suddenly go square and judging by the fact hes shooting people for a few hundred dollars hes decided that under no circumstances is he going back to the cage thats for sure hes going to do this again im surprised it hasnt happened yetits been two months since the last one but when he does maybe hell fuck up just a little and well get him sooner or later we will i guarantee it my victim had a wife and two little daughters im going to get the piece of shit who did this mccaleb nodded he liked her outragefueled dedication it was a full turn away from arrangos view of things he started gathering up the documents and tapes and told winston he would be calling her after he looked over all of the material he told her it might be a few days no sweat she said whatever you can do we can use when mccaleb got back to the taurus he found buddy lockridge sitting with his back to the driversside door and his legs stretched across the front seat he was idly practicing a blues riff on a harmonica while reading a book opened on his lap mccaleb opened the passenger door and waited for him to move his legs as he finally got in he noticed buddy had been reading a book titled inspector imanishi investigates that was pretty quick buddy said yeah there wasnt a lot to say he put the stack of reports and videocassettes on the floor between his feet whats all of that just some stuff i have to go through lockridge leaned over and looked at the top sheet it was an incident report james cordell he read out loud whos that buddy im beginning to think i know i know he took the hint straightened up and started the car he asked nothing more about the documents so where to now now we just go back san pedro i thought you said you needed me for a few days ill stop asking questions i promise there was a slight protest in his voice its not that i still need you but right now i need to go back and go through some of this stuff buddy dejectedly tossed his book onto the dashboard dropped the harp into the door pocket and put the car into gear there was more natural light in the salon than down below in the office stateroom mccaleb decided to work there he also had a television and video player built into a cabinet topside he cleared the galley table wiped it with a sponge and paper towel and then put the stack of reports winston had given him down on top he got a legal pad and a sharpened pencil out of the chart table drawer and brought them over as well he decided that the best way to do it would be to go through the material chronologically that meant the cordell case came first he went through the stack separating out the reports regarding the gloria torres killing and putting them aside he then took what was left and separated the reports into small stacks relating to the initial investigation and evidence inventory followup interviews deadend leads miscellaneous reports fact sheets and weekly summaries when he had worked for the bureau it was his routine to completely clear his desk and spread all the paperwork from a submitted case file across it the cases came in from police departments all over the west some sent thick packages and some just thin files he always asked for videotape of the crime scene big or small the packages were all about the same thing mccaleb was fascinated and repulsed at the same time he became angry and vengeful as he read all while alone in his little office his coat on the door hook his gun in the drawer he could tune everything out but what was in front of him he did his best work at the desk as a field agent he was average at best but at his desk he was better than most and he felt a secret thrill in the back of his mind each time he opened one of those packages and the hunt for a new evil began again he felt that thrill now as he began to read james cordell had a lot going for him a family nice home and cars good health and a job that paid well enough to allow his wife to be a fulltime mother to their two daughters he was an engineer with a private firm contracted by the state to maintain the structural integrity of the aqueduct system that delivered water from the snow melt in the mountains in the central state to the reservoirs that nursed the sprawl of southern california he lived in lancaster in northeast los angeles county which put him within an hour and a half by car of any point on the water line on the night of january twentysecond he had been heading home from a long day inspecting the lone pine segment of the concrete aqueduct it was payday and he stopped at the regional state bank branch just a mile from his home his paycheck had been automatically deposited and he needed cash but he was shot in the head and left for dead at the atm before the machine finished spitting out his money his killer was the one who took the crisp twenties when they rolled out of the machine the first thing mccaleb realized as he read the initial crime reports was that a sanitized version of events had been given to the media the circumstances described in the times story keisha russell had read to him the day before did not mesh cleanly with the facts in the reports the story she had read said that cordells body was found fifteen minutes after the shooting according to the crime report cordell was found almost immediately by an atm customer who had pulled into the bank lot just as another vehiclemost likely the shooterswas speeding out the witness identified as james noone quickly called for help on a cellular car phone because the call was relayed through a cell transponder the operator did not have an automatic address readout of the exact location from which the call had been made she had to take that information the oldfashioned waymanuallyand managed to transpose two numbers of the address noone had given when she dispatched an emergency medical unit in his statement noone said he had watched helplessly as a paramedic ambulance went screaming by to a location seven blocks away he had to call and explain himself all over again to a new operator the paramedics were redirected but cordell was dead by the time they arrived as he read the initial reports it was hard for mccaleb to make a judgment on whether the delay in the arrival of paramedics was of any consequence cordell had suffered a devastating head wound even if paramedics had gotten to him ten minutes sooner it probably would have made no difference it was unlikely that death could have been avoided still the screwup was just the type of thing the media loved to run with so somebody in the sheriffs departmentprobably jaye winstons supervisorhad decided to keep that information quiet the screwup was a side matter that held little interest for mccaleb what did interest him was that there was at least a partial witness as well as a vehicle description according to noones statement he had almost been creamed by a black blur as he had pulled into the banks lot he described the exiting vehicle as a black jeep cherokee with the newer smoother styling he got only a splitsecond view of the driver a man he described only as white and with either gray hair or a gray cap on his head there were no other witnesses listed in the initial reports before moving on to the supplemental reports and the autopsy protocol mccaleb decided to look at the videos he turned on the television and vcr and first popped in the tape made from the atms surveillance camera as with the tape from the sherman market there was a timeline running across the bottom of the frame the picture was shot through a fisheye lens that distorted the image the man mccaleb assumed was james cordell came into the frame and slid his bank card into the machine his face was very close to the camera blocking out a view of almost everything else it was a design flawunless the real purpose of the camera was not to capture robberies but the faces of fraud artists using stolen or gimmick bank cards as cordell typed in his code number he hesitated and looked over his right shoulder his head tracking something passing behind himthe cherokee pulling into the lot he finished typing in his transaction and a nervous look came across his face nobody likes going to an atm at night even a welllighted machine in a lowcrime neighborhood the only machine mccaleb ever used was inside a twentyfourhour supermarket where there always was the safety and deterrent of crowds cordell took a nervous glance over his left shoulder nodded at someone offscreen and then looked back at the machine nothing about the person he looked at had alarmed him further the shooter obviously had not pulled on the mask despite his outward calm cordells eyes dropped down to the cash slot his mind probably repeating a silent mantra of hurry up hurry up then almost immediately the gun came into the frame reaching over his shoulder and just kissing his left temple before the trigger was pulled and james cordells life was taken there was the blast of blood misting the camera lens and the man went forward and to his right apparently going into the wall next to the atm and then falling backward to the ground the shooter then moved into the video frame and grabbed the cash as it was delivered through the slot at that moment mccaleb paused the picture on the screen was a full view of the masked shooter he was in the same dark jumpsuit and mask worn by the shooter in the gloria torres tape as winston had said ballistics werent necessary they would only be a scientific confirmation of something winston knew and now mccaleb knew in the gut it was the same man same clothes same method of operation same dead eyes behind the mask he flicked the button again and the video continued the shooter grabbed the cash from the machine as he did this he seemed to be saying something but his face was not squared to the camera as with the sherman market shootings it was as if he was speaking to himself this time rather than to the camera the shooter quickly moved to the left of the screen and stooped to pick up something unseen the bullet casing he then darted to the right and disappeared from the screen mccaleb watched for a few moments the only figure in the picture was the still form of cordell on the pavement below the machine the only movement was the widening pool of blood around his head seeking the lower ground the blood slid into a joint in the pavement and started moving in a line toward the curb a minute went by and then a man entered the video screen crouching over cordells body james noone he was bald across the top of his head and wearing thinframed glasses he touched the wounded mans neck then looked around probably to make sure he was safe himself he then jumped up and was gone presumably to make the call on his cell phone another half minute went by before noone returned to the frame to wait for help as the time went by noone swiveled his head back and forth apparently fearing that the gunman if not in the car he had seen speeding away might still be around finally his attention was drawn in the direction of the street his mouth opened in a silent scream and he waved his arms above his head as he apparently watched the paramedics speed by he then jumped up and left the screen again a few moments later the screen jumped mccaleb checked the time and saw that it was now seven minutes later two paramedics moved quickly into place around cordell they checked for pulse and pupil response they ripped open his shirt and one of the rescuers listened to his chest with a stethoscope another quickly arrived with a wheeled stretcher but one of the first two looked at the man and shook his head cordell was dead a few moments later the screen went blank after pausing a moment almost in reverence mccaleb put in the crime scene tape next this was obviously taken from a handheld video camera it started with some environmental shots of the bank property and the street in the bank lot there were two vehicles a dusty white chevy suburban and a smaller vehicle barely visible on its other side mccaleb assumed the suburban was cordells it was large and rugged dusty from driving the mountain and desert roads alongside the aqueduct he assumed the other car belonged to the witness james noone the tape then showed the atm and panned downward to the bloodstained sidewalk in front of it cordells body was sprawled in the spot where the paramedics had found it and then left it it was uncovered the dead mans shirt open his pale chest exposed over the next several minutes the video jumped in time through various stages of the crime scene first a criminalist measured and photographed the scene then coroners investigators worked on the body wrapped it in a plastic body bag and removed it on a gurney lastly the criminalist and a latents man moved in to search the crime scene more thoroughly for evidence and fingerprints there was a segment showing the criminalist using a small metal spike to work the bullet slug out of the wall next to the atm finally there was a bonus mccaleb had not been expecting the camera operator recorded james noones first recounting of what he had seen the witness had been taken to the edge of the bank property and was standing next to a public phone and talking to a uniformed deputy when the cameraman wandered up noone was a man of about thirtyfive he appearedin comparison to the deputyto be short and compactly built he now had on a baseball cap he was agitated still pumped by what he had witnessed and apparently frustrated by the screwup with the paramedics the camera had been turned on in midconversation all im saying is that he had a fighting chance yes sir i understand im sure it will be one of the things they take a look at i mean i think somebody ought to investigate how this couldand the thing is were only what a half mile from the hospital were aware of that mr noone the deputy said patiently now if we could just move on for a moment could you tell me if you saw anything before you found the body anything unusual yes i saw the guy at least i think i did what guy is that the robber i saw the getaway car can you describe that sir sure black cherokee the new kind not one of those that look like a shoe box the deputy looked a bit confused but mccaleb understood that noone was describing a grand cherokee model he had one himself i was pulling in and it came tearing out of here almost hit me noone said the guy was a real asshole i blasted my horn at him then i pull in and find this man here i called on my cell phone but then it got all fucked up yes sir can you refrain from that kind of language this might be played in court one day oh sorry can we go back to this car did you happen to see a license plate i wasnt even looking how many people in the vehicle i think one the driver male or female male can you describe him for me wasnt really looking i was just trying not to get plowed into thats all white black asian oh he was white im pretty sure about that but i couldnt identify him or anything like that what about hair color it was gray gray the deputy said it with surprise an old robber it seemed unusual to him i think noone said it was all so quick i cant be sure what about a hat yeah it could have been a hat what do you mean the gray yeah gray hat gray hair i cant be sure okay anything else was he wearing glasses uh i either dont remember or didnt see i really wasnt looking at the guy you know besides the car had dark windows the only time i could really see the guy was through the windshield and i only saw that for a second when he was coming right at me okay mr noone this is a help we are going to need you to make a formal statement and the detectives will need to talk to you is this going to be an inconvenience yes but what are you gonna do i want to help i tried to help i dont mind thank you sir im going to have a deputy take you into the palmdale station the detectives will talk to you there theyll be with you as soon as possible and ill make sure they know you are waiting well okay what about my wheels someone will take you back here when they are done the tape ended there mccaleb ejected it and thought about what he had seen and heard and read so far the fact that the sheriffs department did not give the black cherokee to the media was curious it would be something he would have to ask jaye winston about he made a note of it on the legal pad he had been writing questions on and then started through the remaining reports on cordell the crime scene evidence inventory was a single page that was almost blank collected evidence amounted to the slug removed from the wall a half dozen fingerprints lifted from the atm and photographs of a tire mark possibly made by the shooters car the video from the atm camera was also listed clipped to the report were photocopies of photos of the tread mark and a freeze frame from the atm video of the gun in the shooters hand an ancillary report from the crime lab stated that it was the technicians opinion that the tire mark had been on the asphalt at least several days and was not useful in the investigation a ballistics report identified the bullet as a slightly pancaked ninemillimeter federal fmj stapled to the report was a photocopy of a page from the autopsy showing a topview drawing of the skull the track of the bullet through cordells brain was charted on the drawing the bullet had entered just forward on the left temple then tumbled on a straight line through the frontal lobe and out through the right temple region the track of the tumbling bullet had been an inch wide as mccaleb read it he realized it was probably a good thing the paramedics were late if they had managed to save cordell it probably would have been for a life on a machine in one of those medical centers that were nothing more than vegetable warehouses the ballistics report also contained an enhanced photo of the gun though much of the weapon was hidden in the gloved grip of the shooter the sheriffs firearms experts had identified it as a heckler amp koch p a ninemillimeter pistol with a fourinch barrel and nickel finish the weapon identification was a curiosity to mccaleb the hk p was a fairly expensive weapon about a thousand dollars on the legitimate market and not the kind of weapon normally seen in street crimes he guessed that jaye winston must have assumed that the gun itself had to have been taken earlier in a robbery or burglary mccaleb looked through the remaining supplemental reports and sure enough winston had pulled crime reports from across the county in which an hk p of matching description had been reported stolen it did not appear that she had taken the lead much further than that it was true that many gun thefts went unreported because the people who lost the weapons shouldnt have had them in the first place but as winston had undoubtedly done before mccaleb scanned the list of reported theftsonly five in the last two yearsto see if any names or addresses turned a switch none did all five of the burglaries winston had collected were open cases with no suspects it was a dead end after the burglary list was a report detailing all thefts of black grand cherokees in the county during the last year winston had apparently believed the shooters car was also a contradictiona highline vehicle used in an economically lowline crime mccaleb thought it was a good jump to consider the car was probably stolen there were twentyfour cherokees on the list but no other reports indicating any followup maybe he considered winston had simply changed her mind after connecting her shooting to the torres case the good samaritan had described a getaway vehicle from the market shooting that could be a cherokee since that indicated the shooter had not gotten rid of it it possibly hadnt been stolen after all the autopsy protocol was next and mccaleb flipped through the pages quickly he knew from experience that ninety percent of any autopsy report was dedicated to the minute description of the procedure identifying the characteristics of the victims interior organs and state of health at the time of death most of the time it was only the summary that was important to mccaleb but in the cordell case even that part of the autopsy was irrelevant because it was obvious he found the summary anyway and nodded as he read what he already knew massive brain damage had led to cordells death within minutes of the shooting he put the autopsy report aside the next stack of reports dealt with winstons threestrike theory believing the shooter was an exconvict facing life without parole for another conviction winston had gone to the state parole offices in van nuys and lancaster and pulled files on paroled armed robbers who were caucasian and had two prior felony convictions on their records these were people facing thirdstrike penalties if arrested again under the new law there were seventyone of them assigned to the two parole offices geographically nearest the two robberyshootings winston and other deputies had slowly gone through the list in the weeks since the robberies and murders according to the reports they had paid visits to nearly every man on the list of the seventyone only seven of the men couldnt be found this indicated they had violated parole and had probably left the area or might still be in the area hiding and possibly were more likely to be committing armed robberies and even murders nationwide parole pickup bulletins were issued for all these men on law enforcement computer networks of the men who were contacted initial interviews and investigation cleared almost ninety percent through alibis the remaining eight had been cleared through other investigative meanschiefly because their physical dimensions did not match those of the shooters upper body on the video aside from the missing seven men on the list the threestrikes avenue of investigation was stagnant winston was apparently hoping that one of those seven would eventually turn up and be tied to the shooting mccaleb moved on to the remaining cordell reports there were two followup interviews with james noone at the star center his story never differed in these reports and his recollection of the cherokee driver never got any better there also was a crime scene sketch and four fieldinterview reports on traffic stops of men driving black cherokees they had been stopped in lancaster and palmdale within an hour of the atm shooting by deputies made aware of the cherokees use in the crime by a sheriffs radio broadcast the identification of each driver was run through the computer and they were sent on their way after coming up clean the reports were forwarded to winston the last item mccaleb read was the most recent summary report filed by winston it was short and to the point no new leads or suspects at this time investigating officer is waiting at this point for additional information that may lead to the id of a suspect winston was at the wall she was waiting she needed fresh blood mccaleb drummed his fingers on the table and thought about all he had just read he agreed with the moves winston had made but he tried to think of what she had missed and what else could be done he liked her threestrike theory and shared her disappointment at not being able to cull a suspect out of the list of seventyone the fact that most of the men were cleared through alibis bothered him how could so many twostrikes dirtbags be able to perfectly account for their exact whereabouts on two different nights he had always been suspicious of alibis when he was working cases he knew it took only one liar to make an alibi mccaleb stopped his finger roll on the table as he thought of something he fanned the stack of cordell reports across the table he didnt need to look through them because he knew that what he was thinking of was not in the pile he had realized that winston had never geographically crossreferenced her various theories he got up and left the boat buddy lockridge was sitting in the cockpit of his boat sewing a rip in a wet suit when mccaleb walked up hey you got a job guy over on millionaires row wants me to scrape his bertram its the sixty over there but if you need a ride i can do his thing whenever i want hes a onceamonth weekender no i just want to know if you have a thomas brothers i can borrow mines in my car and i dont want to take the tarp off it to get to it yeah sure its in the bull lockridge reached into his pocket and got his car keys out and tossed them to mccaleb on his way out to the taurus mccaleb glanced over at millionaires row it was a dock with doublewide long slips to handle the girth of the larger yachts that moored in cabrillo marina he picked out the bertram it was a beautiful boat and he knew it had cost its owner who probably used it no more than once a month an easy million and a half after retrieving the map book from lockridges car returning the key and then returning to his own boat mccaleb set to work with the cordell records first he went through the reports on thefts of cherokees and hk p pistols he numbered each reported theft and then charted it by address on the appropriate page of the map book he then went on to the list of threestrike suspects using the same procedure to chart the home and job locations of each man as well lastly he charted the locations of the shootings it took him almost an hour but by the time he was done he felt a sense of cautious excitement one name from the list of seventyone clearly stood out as being geographically relevant to the sherman market shooting and the theft of an hk p the mans name was mikail bolotov a thirtyyearold russian émigré who had already served two stints in california prisons for armed robberies bolotov lived and worked in canoga park his home was off desoto near sherman way a mile or so from the market where gloria torres and chan ho kang were murdered his job was at a clock manufacturing plant located on winnetka only eight blocks south and two blocks east of the market lastly and this was what excited mccaleb the russian also worked only four blocks from a canoga park home from which an hk p had been stolen during a burglary in december reading the burglary report mccaleb noted that the intruder had taken several presents from beneath a christmas tree including a new hk p that had been wrapped as a gift from the homeowner to his wifethe perfect la christmas gift the burglar left no fingerprints or other evidence behind mccaleb read through the entire parole package and investigators report bolotov had a long record of violence though no previous suspicion of homicide and no tangles with the law since his last discharge from prison three years before he routinely made his parole appointments and to outward appearance appeared to be on the straight and narrow bolotov had been interviewed on the cordell matter at his place of employment by two sheriffs investigators named ritenbaugh and aguilar the interview had taken place two weeks after the cordell murder but nearly three weeks before the sherman market murders also the interview had apparently taken place before winston had pulled the reports on hk p thefts this he guessed was why the significance of bolotovs geographic location was missed during the interview bolotovs answers had apparently been sufficient to avoid suspicion and his employer had provided an alibi reporting that on the night james cordell was murdered bolotov had worked his normal twototen shift he showed the detectives pay records and time cards reflecting the hours worked that was enough for ritenbaugh and aguilar cordell had died at about pm it would have been physically impossible for bolotov to get from canoga park to lancaster in ten minuteseven if he had used a helicopter ritenbaugh and aguilar moved on to the next name on the list of threestrike candidates bullshit mccaleb said out loud he felt excited bolotov was a lead that should be rechecked no matter what his boss or the pay records said the man was an armed robber by trade not a clock maker his geographic proximity to key locations relating to the investigation demanded that another look be taken mccaleb felt he had at least accomplished something that he could go back to winston with he quickly wrote a few notes on the legal pad and then set it aside he was exhausted from the work done so far and felt the low pounding of a headache coming on he looked at his watch and saw that time had sped by without his realizing it it was two oclock already he knew he should eat something but he had no desire for any kind of food in particular he decided instead to take a nap and went below to the stateroom refreshed from an hourlong nap during which he had no dreams that he could remember mccaleb made himself a sandwich of white bread and processed cheese he opened a can of coke to go with it and went back to the galley table to go through the gloria torres case he started with the surveillance tape from the sherman market he had seen it twice already in the company of arrango and walters but decided he needed to watch it again he put the tape in and watched it on normal speed then put what was left of his sandwich in the sink he couldnt eat any more his insides were clenched too tight he rewound the tape and started playing it again this time on slowmotion play glorias movements seemed languid and relaxed mccaleb found himself almost ready to return the smile she showed he wondered what she was thinking was the smile for mr kang mccaleb doubted it it was a secret smile a smile for something inside his guess was that she was thinking about her son and he knew then that she had at least been happy in that final conscious moment the tape brought no new ideas just the rekindling of anger toward the shooter he put in the crime scene tape next and watched the documentation measuring and quantification of the carnage glorias body of course was not there and the blood on the floor where she had dropped was minimalthanks to the good samaritan but the store owners corpse was crumpled on the floor behind the counter blood seemingly surrounding it completely it made mccaleb think of the old woman he had seen in the store the day before she stood where her husband had fallen that took a certain kind of courage a kind mccaleb didnt think he had after turning off the tape he started through the stack of reports arrango and walters had not produced as much paper as winston had mccaleb tried not to take this to mean anything significant but he couldnt help it in his experience the size of a murder book reflected not only the depth of the investigation but the commitment of the investigators mccaleb believed there was a sacred bond between the victim and the investigator all homicide cops understood this some took it straight to the heart some less so simply as a matter of psychological survival but it was there in all of them it didnt matter if you had religion if you believed the soul of the departed watched over you even if you believed that all things ended with the final breath you still spoke for the dead your name was whispered on the last breath but only you heard it only you knew it no other crime came with such a covenant mccaleb set aside the thick protocols from the autopsies of torres and kang to read last as with the cordell file he knew the autopsies would provide few salient details beyond what was already obvious he quickly went through the initial crime reports and next came to a thin sheaf of witness reports they were statements of people who each had a little part of the whole a gas station attendant a passing motorist a times pressroom employee who worked with gloria there were also investigative summaries supplemental reports fact sheets crime scene charts ballistics reports and a chronological record of the travels and calls made by the detectives on the case last in this section of the stack was the transcript of the neveridentified good samaritans call made after he stumbled into the shootings aftermath and tried to save glorias life the transcript was of a man speaking english with difficulty as he hurriedly reported a shooting but when the operator offered to switch him to a spanishspeaker he declined caller i must go i go now the girl is shot very bad the man he run he drive away a black car like a truck operator sir please stay on the line sir sir that was it he was gone he had mentioned the vehicle but gave no description of the suspect following this statement there was a ballistics report identifying the bullets recovered in the market and during the autopsy of chan ho kang as ninemillimeter federal fmjs a photo from the store video was analyzed and the weapon was again identified as the hk p it struck mccaleb as he finished an initial reading of the rest of the reports that what was missing from the murder book was a timeline unlike the cordell case which had only one witness the torres case had a variety of minor witnesses and time markers the detectives apparently had not sat down with all of these and collated them into a timeline they had not recreated the sequence of incidents that made up the event as a whole mccaleb sat back and thought about this for a moment why wasnt it there would such a timeline or exact sequence of events even be useful probably not initially he decided in terms of identifying a killer it would give little help and at least initially thats all that mattered but a sequential analysis of the event should have been done later after the dust had settled so to speak mccaleb had often advised investigators who sent their cases to him to create a timeline it could be useful breaking alibis finding holes in witness accounts in simply giving the investigator a better command and knowledge of exactly what had happened mccaleb was fully aware that he was monday morning quarterbacking arrango and walters didnt have the luxury of coming into a case two months after the fact maybe thought of a timeline got lost they had other concerns and other cases to worry about he got up and went to the galley to turn on the coffeemaker he was feeling fatigued again and had been awake only ninety minutes mccaleb hadnt been drinking much coffee since the transplant dr fox had told him to avoid caffeine and on the occasion that he had ignored that advice and had a cup it sometimes caused a fluttering sensation in his chest but he wanted to keep alert and finish his work he took the risk after the coffee was ready he poured himself a mug then overpowered it with milk and sugar he sat back down and silently chastised himself for looking for reasons to excuse arrango and walters they should have taken the time to work the case thoroughly mccaleb was angry with himself for having thought anything else he took up the legal pad and began to read through the witness reports again noting down the salient times and a brief summary of what each witness brought to the case he then overlaid various time notations from the other crime reports it took him an hour to do this during which time he refilled his mug three times without really thinking about it when he was finished he had constructed a timeline on two pages of the pad the problem he realized as he studied his work was that the sequence was inexact in all but a couple of references and contained outright conflicts if not impossibilities pmend of b shift los angles times pressroom chatsworth facility gloria punches out pmapproximategloria leaves with

pronounced dead pmfirst police arrive on scene he read it all again he knew homicide was an inexact science but the timeline bothered him according to the first homicide investigation report the actual shooting was determined by the detectives to have occurred during the sixty seconds between and pm in deciding this the detectives had used the one source of time they knew to be exact and unassailably correctthe time log at the departments emergency dispatch center the first call reporting the shootingfrom the good samaritanhad come in at to a operator using that time and the report by motorist ellen taaffe about hearing the shots sometime after the start of the kfwb news report led to the conclusion that the shooting had to have been after but before when the good samaritan made the call this time frame of course was in contradiction to the time of shown on the stores videotape at the start of the shooting mccaleb looked through the reports again hoping he had missed some page on which there was an explanation of this discrepancy there was nothing he drummed his fingers on the table for a few moments while he thought about things he checked his watch and saw it was almost five it was unlikely any of the investigators would still be around again he studied the timeline he had constructed searching for an explanation for the anomaly his eyes held on the second call to the dispatch center ellen taaffe the motorist who had heard the shooting had called on her mobile phone at to report the shooting and was told it had already been reported he thought about this the detectives had used her hearing of the shots to set the murders within the minute of the very start of the news program yet when she called they already knew about the shooting why had she delayed more than two minutes to make the call and was she ever asked if she saw the good samaritan mccaleb quickly flipped through the stack of reports until he located the ellen taaffe witness statement it was one page with her signature beneath a statement typed below a twoinch information block the statement said nothing about how long she had waited between hearing the shots and calling the dispatch center the statement did say she believed that there were two cars parked in front of the store but she could not identify the type of vehicles they were or remember if there had been any occupants he looked at the information box it said taaffe was thirtyfive years old and married she lived in northridge and was an executive with a headhunting firm she had been driving home from the movies at topanga plaza when she heard the shooting her home and work phone numbers were contained in the witness information box mccaleb went to the phone and dialed the work number a secretary answered corrected his pronunciation of taaffe and said he had just caught her on her way out the door this is ellen taaffe a voice said rhyming the name with waif yes hello mrs taaffe you dont know me my name is mccaleb im an investigator working on that shooting a couple months ago on sherman way the one you heard and talked to the police about he heard her breath going out in a way that indicated she was being put out by the call i dont understand i already talked to the detectives are you with the police no im i work for the family of the woman who was killed there is this a bad time yes im on my way out the door id like to beat the traffic and and frankly i dont know what i can tell you i told everything to the police this will only take a minute i just have a few quick questions this woman had a little boy im just trying to catch the guy who took her away he heard the breath go out again all right ill try to help what are the questions okay one how long did you wait between hearing the shots and calling nine one one on your car phone i didnt wait i called right then i grew up around guns my father was a police officer and i went with him to the range sometimes i knew that what i heard was a gun i called right away well im looking at the police records and they say you thought you heard the shooting around tenforty but didnt call it in until tenfortythree i dont what they dont tell you in those reports is that i got a tape i called right away but i got a tape all the nine one one lines were busy and i was put on hold i dont know how long it was aggravating but when my call finally was put through they said they already knew about the shooting anyway how long do you think you were on hold i just said im not sure maybe a minute maybe more or maybe less i dont know okay the report says you heard a shot and looked out your window at the store then you heard another shot you saw two cars in the lot the next question is did you see anyone outside no there was no one there i told this to the police it seems like if the inside of the store was lit you might be able to see if there was anyone in the cars if there was anyone in either of the cars i dont remember seeing them was one of the cars a sports utility vehicle like a cherokee i dont know the police already asked that but my attention was on the store i looked right past the cars would you say they were dark or light colored i really dont know i just told you that and ive been over this with the police they have every did you hear a third shot a third no only two but there were three shots so you dont know if you heard the first two shots or the last two thats right he thought about this for a second deciding that it was probably impossible to decide for sure whether she had heard the first two or last two shots mrs taaffe thats it thanks a lot youve been a help and im sorry to have bothered you the brief interview helped answer only the question he had about the delay in her call but it still left the discrepancy between the timing of the good samaritans call and the time on the stores surveillance tape mccaleb checked his watch again it was now after five all the detectives would be gone but he decided to call anyway to his surprise he was told when he called west valley division that both arrango and walters were in and asked which one he wanted he decided to try walters since he had seemed sympathetic to his situation the day before walters picked up after three rings its terry mccaleb the gloria torres thing right right i guess you heard i got the books from winston over at the sheriffs yeah were not too happy about that we also got a call from the slimes about it too some reporter that wasnt cool i dont know who youve been talk look your partner put me in a position where i had to look for information where i could get it dont worry about the times theyll sit on the story because there is no story not at the moment and it best stay that way anyway im kind of busy here whatve you got you got a case yeah they just keep dropping like flies out here in the big valley well look i wont hold you up ive just got one question maybe you can help me with mccaleb waited walters didnt say anything he seemed different from the day before mccaleb wondered if arrango was sitting close by and listening he decided to press on i just want to know about the timing he said the video from the store shows the shooting going down athe quickly scanned his timelinelets see ten fortyone thirtyseven then you have the nine one one records and they say the call from the good samaritan came in at exactly ten fortyone oh three see what im getting at howd the guy call it in thirtyfour seconds before the shooting actually happened simple the time on the video was off it was fast oh okay mccaleb said as if the possibility had not occurred to him you guys checked it out my partner did really i didnt see any report on it in the book look he made a phone call to the security company checked it out no report okay the guy who installed that system put it in more than a year agoright after the first time mr kang got robbed eddie talked to the guy he set the camera clock off his own watch back then and hasnt been back in there since he showed mr kang how to set the camera clock in case there was a power outage or something okay mccaleb said not sure where this was going so your guess is as good as mine is it showing the original time set off the installers watch or did the old man set it a few times himself either way it doesnt matter we cant trust it just coming off somebodys watch maybe the watch was fast maybe the camera clock has been gaining a couple seconds every week or two who knows we cant trust it is what im saying but we can trust the nineeleven clock thats the time we know is correct and its the time we went with mccaleb was silent and walters seemed to take it as some kind of judgment look the camera clock is just a detail that doesnt mean anything anyway he said if we worried about every detail that didnt fit wed still be working our first case im busy here man what else you got thats it i guess you guys never checked the surveillance clock right you know to check the time against the dispatch clock nope we went back a couple days later but there had been a power outagesanta anas blew down the line the time on it was useless to us then too bad yeah too bad i gotta go keep in touch you get something you call us before winston or were not going to be happy with you all right ill call you walters hung up mccaleb put the phone down and stared at it for a few moments wondering what his next move should or would be he was drawing a blank but it had always been his practice to go back to the start whenever he hit a stall the start most often meant the crime scene but this case was different he could go back to the actual crime he put the video of the sherman market murders back in the vcr and watched the tape again in slow motion he sat there gripping the edges of the table so hard his knuckles and finger joints began to hurt it wasnt until the third runthrough that he picked up on something he had missed earlier and had been there all along chan ho kangs watch the watch his wife now wore on the video the watch was seen as kang desperately grasped for purchase on the counter mccaleb fished around on the video for a few minutes backing and forwarding the tape until he froze the image on what he believed was the best view of the watchs face the best he could do was a clean look at it but the led readout was not picked up by the video shot from the upper wall the numbers on the watchthe timewere not readable he sat there staring at the frozen image wondering if he should pursue it if he could read the time on the watch he might be able to triangulate the time of the shooting by using the camera clock and the dispatch clock it might clear up a loose end but did it mean anything walters had been right about one thing there are always details that dont add up always loose ends and mccaleb wasnt sure if this one was worth the time it would take to tie it up his private debate was interrupted living on a boat he had learned to read the subtle rises and falls of his home to know whether each was caused by a boat wake out in the fairway or the weight of someone coming on board mccaleb felt the boat dip slightly and immediately looked over his shoulder and out the sliding door graciela rivers had just stepped onboard and was turning around to help a little boy step on next raymond dinner he had completely forgotten shit he said as he quickly turned off the video and got up to go out and greet them you forgot didnt you there was an easy smile on her face noi mean i sort of forgot for the last five hours i got lost in all of this paperwork ive been looking through i meant to go over to the market and well thats okay we can do it another no no are you kidding were going to have dinner is this raymond oh yes graciela turned to the boy who was standing shyly behind her at the stern he seemed small for his age with dark hair and eyes brown skin he wore shorts and a striped shirt he carried a sweater in his hands raymond this is mr mccaleb the man i was telling you about this is his boat he lives on it mccaleb stepped forward and leaned down with his hand out the boy was carrying a toy police car in his right hand and had to transfer it to the other he then tentatively took mccalebs hand and they shook mccaleb felt an unexplainable sadness as he met the boy its terry he said nice to meet you raymond ive heard a lot about you can you fish off this boat sure you can someday ill take you out if you want that would be good mccaleb straightened up and smiled at graciela she looked lovely she wore a light summer dress similar to the one she had worn the first time she had come to the boat it was the kind that the breeze off the water easily pushed against her figure she too carried a sweater mccaleb was in shorts sandals and a tshirt that said robicheauxs dock amp baitshop on it he felt a little embarrassed ill tell you what he said over there theyve got a nice restaurant on top of the marine store theyve got good food and a great view of the sunset why dont we have dinner there sounds good to me graciela said all i have to do is change real quick and raymond i have an idea why dont we drop a line off the stern and you see if you can catch something while i go inside and show graciela a few things ive been working on the boys face brightened okay okay then well fix you up mccaleb left them there and went inside in the salon he took his lightest rod and reel out of the overhead storage rack went to the tackle box under the chart table and got out a steel leader already set with a number eight hook and a sinker he attached the leader to the reel line and then went to the cooler in the galley where he knew he had some frozen squid using a sharp knife he cut off a piece of squid skirt and drove the hook through it he returned to the stern with the rod and reel and handed the rig to raymond crouching behind the boy with his arms coming around him he gave him a quick lesson on casting the bait into the middle of the fairway he then told him how to keep his finger on the line and to read it for nibbles you okay now he asked when the lesson was completed uhhuh are there fish in here by the boats sure ive seen a school of sheepshead swimming right where your line is sheepshead its a fish with yellow stripes sometimes you can see them moving in the water you watch for them okay are you all right now if i go in and get your mother something to drink shes not my mother oh yes iim sorry raymond i meant graciela you okay im okay okay give a holler if you hook one and then start reeling he pointed a finger into the boys side and dragged it up his tiny rib cage mccalebs father had done the same thing to him when he was holding a fishing pole his sides unprotected raymond giggled and maneuvered away never taking his eyes off the spot where his line disappeared into the dark water graciela followed mccaleb into the salon and he closed the slider so the boy would not hear them his face must have been red from the slipup with the boy she read him before he got the chance to apologize thats okay its going to happen a lot now he nodded is he going to stay with you yes im the only one but that doesnt matter ive been around since he was born for him to lose his mother and then me i think it would be too much i want him to stay with me wheres his father who knows mccaleb nodded and decided to step out of that area of questioning you are going to be great for him he said you want a glass of wine that would be great red or white whatever youre having i cant have any right now in a couple months oh then i dont want you to open a bottle of wine just for me i can have please i want to how about a red ive got some good red and if i open it i can at least smell it she smiled i remember glory was like that when she was pregnant she used to sit right next to me and say she just wanted to smell the wine i was drinking the smile turned sad she was a good person mccaleb said i can tell that by the boy thats what you wanted me to see she nodded he went to the galley and got a bottle of red wine out of the sea rack it was a sanford pinot noir one of his favorites while he was opening it she came over to the counter he could smell a light scent of perfume it was vanilla he thought it thrilled him it wasnt so much being close to her as feeling that something was awakening in him after a long dormancy do you have children she asked then me no were you ever married yes once he poured her a glass and watched her taste it she smiled and nodded its good how long ago was that what when i was married lets see i got married about ten years ago lasted three years she was an agent and we worked together in quantico then when it didnt work out and we got divorced we still had to work with each other and it i dont know we were cool about it but it wasnt a good thing you know about the same time my dad was getting sick out here so i gave them the idea of sending someone from the unit out here permanently i sold it to them as a costcutting move i mean i was flying out here all the time anyway a lot of us were i figured they ought to have a little outpost or something out here and save some of that dough they agreed and i got the job graciela nodded turned and looked out the slider to check on raymond he was staring intently into the water where he hoped the fish were how bout you mccaleb asked you ever get married once too kids no she was still looking out at raymond her smile was still in place but straining under the conversation mccaleb was curious about her but decided to let it go by the way you were good with him she said nodding in raymonds direction its a balance you have to teach them and let them find out for themselves that was nice with him she looked at him and he shook his shoulders to indicate it was luck he took her glass and held it up to his nose to savor its aroma and then handed it back to her he then poured himself the last from the coffee pot and added some milk and sugar they clicked mug to glass and drank she said she liked hers he said his tasted like tar sorry she said i feel so bad drinking this in front of you dont im glad you like it silence filled the salon her eyes fell to the stacks of reports and videotapes on the galley table what did you want to show me uh nothing specific i just didnt want to talk in front of raymond he checked on the boy through the glass he was doing fine his focus was still intently on the line cutting through the incoming tide mccaleb hoped he would hook something but guessed it was unlikely below the marinas beautiful surface the water was fouled with pollutants any fish that survived down there was a bottom feeder with the survival skills of a cockroach he looked back at graciela but i wanted to let you know i met with the sheriffs detective this morning she was a lot cooler about it than the lapd guys she jaye winston shes good we worked together before anyway she gave me copies of everything on both cases thats what i spent all day looking through theres a lot he summarized as best he could trying to be gentle about details relating to her sister he didnt tell her he had a videotape of her sisters murder there on the boat with them in the bureau we have this thing called doing a full field he said at the end of the summary it means leaving nothing untouched nothing to chance the bottom line here is that the investigation of your sisters murder was not a full field but at the same time theres nothing that jumps out at me as a gaping hole in what was done there were some mistakes made maybe some assumptions that were made before all the facts were in but they werent necessarily wrong anyway the investigation was thorough enough thorough enough she repeated looking down as she talked mccaleb realized it had been a poor choice of words i mean so this guy is just going to get away with it she said as a statement i guess i shouldve known this is what you were going to tell me well im not telling you that winston over at the sheriffs departmentat least shes still actively pursuing this and im not done either graciela im not saying that i have a stake in this too i know i dont mean to sound unhappy with you its not you at all but im frustrated i understand that i dont want you to be lets go have a nice dinner and well talk more later okay you go on out there with raymond ive got to change after changing into a clean pair of dockers and a yellow hawaiian shirt with flying slices of pineapple on it mccaleb led them down the docks to the restaurant he hadnt bothered reeling in raymonds line hed put the rod in one of the gunwale holders and told the boy theyd check on it when they got back they ate at the table with graciela and raymond on the side that afforded them a view of the sun just starting to set over the forest of sailboat masts graciela and mccaleb ordered the grilled swordfish special while raymond had fish and chips mccaleb repeatedly tried to draw raymond into conversation but was unsuccessful most of the time he and graciela mostly talked about the differences between living on a boat and living in a house mccaleb told graciela about how peaceful and restoring it was to be on the water and its even better when youre out there he said pointing in the direction of the pacific how long before you have your boat ready graciela asked not long as soon as i get the second engine back together it will be ready to run the rest is all cosmetic i can do that anytime on the way back after dinner raymond walked quickly ahead of them along the seawall an icecream cone in one hand and a flashlight in the other his blue sweater on his head bobbing this way and that as he hunted with the light for fiddler crabs scaling the walls the light was almost gone from the sky now it would be time for graciela and raymond to leave when they got back to the boat mccaleb felt as though he was already missing them when the boy got far enough in front of them graciela brought up the case again what else can you do at this point on the case for one thing i have a lead i want to follow something they might have missed what he explained the geographic crossreferencing he had done and how he came up with mikail bolotov when he saw her getting excited he quickly cautioned her against it this guys got an alibi its a lead but it may go nowhere he moved on i also am thinking about going to the bureau to get them involved in the ballistics how so this guy couldve done this elsewhere he uses a very expensive gun the fact that he didnt get rid of it between these two cases means hes hanging onto it and so he mightve used it before somewhere else they have some ballistic evidencethe bullets the bureau might be able to do something with it if i can get them the material she didnt comment and he wondered if her common sense told her that this was a long shot he moved on im also thinking about going back to a couple of the witnesses and interviewing them a little differently especially the man who saw part of the shooting up in the desert and thats going to take some finesse i mean i dont want to step on winstons toes or make her feel i think she dropped the ball but id like to talk to the guy myself hes the best witness id like to talk to him and then maybe a couple of the witnesses to when your sister was you know i didnt know there were witnesses there were people in the store no i dont mean direct witnesses but there was a woman who drove by and heard shots there are also a couple of people in the reports that your sister worked with that night over at the times id just like to talk to all of them myself see if maybe anything changed in their memories about that night i can probably help you set that up i know most of her friends good they walked along in silence for a few moments raymond was still well ahead of them graciela finally spoke i wonder if youd do a favor for me sure glory used to go see this lady in our neighborhood mrs otero she also would leave raymond with her if i wasnt around but glory would go by herself sometimes to talk to her about her problems i was wondering if you would talk to her uh i dont you mean you think she might know something about this or is this like to console her its possible she might be able to help how would she be able to then it dawned on him are you talking about a psychic a spiritualist glory trusted mrs otero she said she was in touch with the angels and glory believed it and shes been calling and saying she wants to talk to me and i dont know i just thought maybe youd go with me i dont know i dont really believe in that sort of stuff graciela i dont know what id say to her she just looked at him and it cut him that he thought he saw disapproval in her eyes graciela i saw too many bad things and bad people to believe in that stuff how can there be angels out there or up there when people do the kinds of things they do down here she still didnt say anything and he knew her silence was a judgment how bout i think about it and let you know fine she finally said dont be upset look im sorry i got you involved in this and i know its a big intrusion i dont know what i thought i guess i just thought youd look dont worry about it im doing it now for me as much as you okay just dont give up hope like i said theres still a few things im going to do and winston isnt going to let this drop either give me a few days if i get stalled out maybe then well go see mrs otero okay she nodded but he could tell she was disappointed she was such a good kid she said after a while having raymond changed everything for her she straightened up moved in with me and just got her priorities right she was going to school in the mornings at cal state thats why she had that night job she was smart she wanted to get into the other side of the newspaper business be a reporter he nodded and kept silent he knew it was good for her to keep talking like this she would have been good at it i think she cared about people i mean look at her she was a volunteer after the riots she went down to southcentral to help clean up after the earthquake she came into the hospital to just be in the er and tell people it would be okay she was an organ donor she gave bloodanytime any hospital called and said they needed blood she came in that rare blood well she was rarer sometimes i really wish i couldve traded places and that it was me who went into that store he reached over and put his arm around her shoulders in a comforting manner come on he said look at all the people you help at the hospital and look at raymond youre going to be great for him you cant think about who was more worthy or about switching places what happened to her shouldnt have happened to anyone but all i know is raymond having his own mother wouldve been better than me there was no way to argue with her he moved his arm and put his hand on her neck she wasnt crying but she looked like she might start he wanted to console her but knew there was only one way he could do that they were almost to his dock raymond was waiting at the security gate which was open a couple of inches as usual the spring return was rusted and the gate never closed on its own we should go graciela said when they caught up to the boy its getting late and you have school what about the fishing pole raymond protested mr mccaleb can take care of that now thank him for the fishing and the dinner and the ice cream raymond put out his little hand and mccaleb shook it again it was cold and sticky its terry and look well do some real fishing soon as soon as i get the boat going well take it out then and well catch you a big one i know a spot on the other side of catalina this time of year well catch calico bass lots of them well go there okay raymond nodded silently as if he guessed it would never happen it sent a shiver of sadness through mccaleb he looked at graciela how about saturday the boat wont be ready but you guys could come down in the morning and we could fish off the jetty you could stay over if you want plenty of room yeah raymond cried well graciela said lets see how the rest of the week goes mccaleb nodded realizing the mistake he had just made graciela opened the passenger door of her rabbit convertible and the boy got in she came over to mccaleb after closing the door sorry about that he said in a low voice i guess i shouldnt have suggested that in front of him its all right she said id like to do it but i might have to juggle some things so lets wait and see unless you need to know for sure right now no thats fine just let me know she took a step closer to him and held out her hand to shake thank you very much for tonight she said hes quiet most of the time but i think he enjoyed it and i know i did mccaleb took her hand and shook it but then she leaned into him brought her face up and kissed him on the cheek as she stepped back she brought her hand to her mouth bristly she said with a smile are you growing a beard thinking about it this made her laugh for some reason she walked around the car and he followed so he could hold open the door when she was in her seat she looked up at him you know you should believe in them she said he looked down at her you mean angels she nodded he nodded back she started the car and drove off back at the boat he went over to the corner of the stern the fishing pole was still in the slot and the line was still in the water as raymond had left it but as he reeled the line in mccaleb could tell there was no drag on it when the line finally came out of the water he saw the hook and weight but no bait something down there had cleaned him out on thursday morning mccaleb was up before the port stevedores had anything to do with it the caffeine of the day before had surged through his veins without ebb and kept him from sleep it fueled disquieting thoughts of the investigation of the differences between angles and angels and of graciela and the boy eventually he gave up on sleep and just waited with eyes open for the first light to filter through the blinds he was showered and finished measuring vital signs and swallowing pills by six oclock he took the stack of investigative reports back up to the table in the salon put on another pot of coffee and ate a bowl of cereal in between he constantly checked his watch and thought about whether to call vernon carruthers without talking to jaye winston first winston wouldnt be in yet but three hours ahead at fbi headquarters in washington dc mccalebs friend vernon carruthers would be in his place in the fat unit of the crime lab mccaleb knew he shouldnt talk to carruthers before getting the goahead from winston it was winstons case but the threehour time difference between la and washington had him anxious at his core mccaleb was an impatient man the urge to get something going and not lose the day was pressing him after rinsing out the bowl and leaving it in the sink he checked his watch once more and decided not to wait he got out his phone book and called carruthers on his direct line he picked up on one ring vernon its terry terrell mccaleb you here in the city nah still in la how are you man how are you i mean like long time no hear i know i know but im doing okay thanks for the cards you sent to the hospital tell marie i said thanks too it meant a lot i know i shouldve called or written im sorry well we tried calling you but youre unlisted and nobody in the fo seemed to have the new number talked to kate and she didnt even know all she knew was you gave up your apartment in westwood somebody else in the fo said you were livin on a boat now you really cut yourself off from everybody well i just thought it would be best for a while you know until i was mobile and everything but everythings good how about you cant complain you coming out here anytime soon you know you still have the room havent rented it out to anybody from quantico yet wouldnt dare mccaleb laughed and told him that unfortunately there were no immediate plans for a trip east he had known carruthers for nearly twelve years mccaleb had worked out of quantico and carruthers had worked out of firearms and toolmarks in the crime lab up in dc but it seemed that the two were often working the same cases whenever carruthers came down to quantico for meetings mccaleb and his then wife kate had put him up in their spare bedroom it beat the spare accommodations of a room in an academy dorm in return whenever mccaleb was in dc carruthers and his wife marie had let him bunk in the room that had belonged to their son he had died years earlier of leukemia when he was twelve carruthers had insisted on the tradeoff even though it meant mccaleb was giving up a decent fbipaid room at the hilton near dupont circle at first mccaleb felt like an intruder sleeping in the boys room but vernon and marie made him feel welcome and the southern cooking and the good company couldnt be touched by the hilton well anytime carruthers said with a returning laugh anytime thanks man so by my estimate its gotta be barely the crack a dawn out there whatre you calling so early for well im calling on a bit of business you business i was about to ask you how the wonderful world of retirement was treating you are you really living on a goddamned boat yeah im on a boat but im not quite into the pasture yet well whats up then mccaleb told him the story including the part about his receiving gloria torress heart mccaleb wanted carruthers to know everything unlike the others involved he knew he could trust him with it and knew he would understand the bond mccaleb had to the victim carruthers had a strong empathy for victims especially the young ones the trauma of watching his son die over time in front of him had manifested itself in a dedication to his job that surpassed that of even the best field agents mccaleb had known halfway through the telling the booming sound of a cargo ship being unloaded began echoing across the marina carruthers asked what the hell it was and mccaleb told him as he took the phone down into the forward stateroom and closed the door to get away as much as possible from the noise so what you want is for me to take a look at a slug from this carruthers asked when mccaleb was finished i dont know that sheriffs department out there theyve got good people i know that im not doubting that i just want a fresh look and mostly i want you to put a laser profile through your computer if you can you never know we might hit something ive got a feeling about this one you and your feelings i remember those all right then who am i getting the package from them or you im going to try to finesse it get the sheriffs department out here to send in the package i dont want you doing this off the books but if you can id like to put some grease on it this shooters a repeater we might save somebodys life if we can get a line on him carruthers was silent a few moments and mccaleb guessed he was running his schedule through his head this is the thing todays thursday i need it by tuesday morning latest and preferably monday so i have time to do it justice next wednesday im flying out to kansas city to testify mob case they think ill be out there the rest of the week so if you want it expedited youve got to expedite it to me if you do ill give it my immediate attention thats not going to cause major problems course it is im backed up two months here what else is new but just get me the package and ill take care of it ill get it to you one way or the other by monday latest okay buddy oh one last thing take my number like i said im not acting in any official capacity on this thing by rights you should communicate with the sheriffs department but id appreciate a headsup if you come up with anything unusual you got it he said without hesitation give me the number and the address marie will want that for christmas cards after mccaleb gave him the information carruthers cleared his throat so you talk to kate lately he asked she called the hospital a couple days after the transplant but i was still out of it we didnt talk long hmmm well you ought to call her just to let her know youre okay i dont know how is she doing fine i guess havent heard anything to the contrary you should call her its better just to leave it alone i think were divorced remember whatever youre the boss ill send her an email just to let her know youre still breathing out there after a few more minutes of catching up mccaleb clicked off the phone and went back up to the salon for more coffee he was out of milk so he took it black it was hair of the dog that bit him but he had to keep the momentum if things went as he hoped he would be on the road most of the day it was now near seven and almost time to call winston he went out onto the deck to take a look at the morning the marine layer had come in strong and thick and the other boats looked ghostlike in the mist it would be a few hours before it burned off and anybody got a look at the sun he looked over at buddy lockridges boat and saw no activity yet at he sat at the salon table with his legal pad and punched jaye winstons number into the cordless phone he caught her just as she was sitting down at her desk i just walked in she said and i didnt expect to hear from you for a couple of days that was a lot of paper i gave you yeah well once i got into it i couldnt put it down i guess what did you think mccaleb knew she was asking what he thought of her investigation asking him to make a judgment i think you run a tight show but i already knew that from before i liked all the moves you made on this one jaye no complaints from me but but ive got a few questions i wrote down here if youve got a few minutes maybe a couple of suggestions if you want em a lead or two maybe winston laughed goodnaturedly you federal guys always have questions always have suggestions always have new leads hey im not federal anymore well i guess it sticks in the blood then go ahead mccaleb looked over the notes he had taken the day before and started right in on the mikail bolotov angle first off ritenbaugh and aguilar you close to them dont even know them theyre not in homicide the captain pulled them out of burglaries and gave them to me for a week that was when we were running down the threestrikes names what about them well i think one of the names that they scratched off that list needs a second look which one mikail bolotov mccaleb heard the rustling of papers as winston looked for the report from ritenbaugh and aguilar okay got it what are you seeing here looks like hes got a solid alibi have you ever heard of geographic crossreferencing what he explained the concept and told her what he had done and how it led to bolotov he further explained that bolotov had been interviewed before the sherman market robberyshooting and therefore the significance of the location of bolotovs home and employment to the market murders and one of the hk p thefts was not as apparent as it was to the other case when he was done winston agreed that the russian needed to be rechecked but she was not as enthusiastic about the prospect as mccaleb look like i said i dont know those two guys so i cant vouch for them but i have to assume theyre not fresh off the boat i have to assume they could handle an interview like this and check out the alibi mccaleb didnt say anything look ive got court this week i cant go check this guy out again i can now she didnt say anything ill be cool mccaleb said just sort of play it by ear i dont know terry youre a citizen now this might be going too far well think about it ive got some other stuff here to talk about fine what else mccaleb knew that if she didnt bring up bolotov again during the conversation she was giving him unofficial permission to check the russian out she just didnt want to sanction what he was doing he glanced down at the legal pad again he wanted to be careful with what he asked next he needed to build up to the big questions he had bring winston along and not let her think he was secondguessing everything um first off i didnt see anything in there about the bank card in the cordell case i know the guy took the money did he take the card no it was in the machine it rolled it out but when he didnt take it the machine automatically swallowed it again its a builtin security measure so people dont leave their cards to be taken mccaleb nodded and drew a check mark next to that question on his pad okay next i have a question about the cherokee how come you didnt put that out to the media well we did put it out but not right away on that first day we were still evaluating things and didnt put it into the first press release i wasnt sure we should put that out because then the guy might see it and just dump the car a few days later when nothing was happening and we were hitting the wall i put out another press release with the cherokee in it trouble is cordell was old news and nobody picked it up a little weekly paper up there in the desert was the only one to run it i know it was a screwup i guess i shouldve put it all out in the first press release not necessarily mccaleb said as he drew another check on the pad i can see your reasoning he read through the notes on the page again couple things in both tapes the shooter says somethingafter the shots hes either talking to himself or the camera there were no reports on that was anything done to theres a guy in the bureau here who has a brother who is deaf he took the tapes to him to see if he could lipread them he couldnt be sure but on the first onethe atm tapehe thought he said dont forget the cashola just as he took the money from the machine on the other tape he was less sure he thought he might have said either the same thing or possibly something along the lines of dont fuck with the something or other the last word was least clear to him on both tapes i guess i never typed up a supp on it you dont miss a thing do you all the time mccaleb said would the lip reader know russian if that was what this guy was saying what oh you mean if it was bolotov no i doubt his brother knows russian mccaleb wrote down the possible translations of what the shooter had said he then drummed the pen against the pad and wondered if he should take his shot now do you have anything else winston finally asked he decided it wasnt the right moment to bring up carruthers at least not directly the gun he said i know i dont like it either the p is not your routine scumbags choice of firearm it had to have been stolen you saw i pulled reports on stolens but like with everything else i hit a wall it got me nowhere i think its a good theory mccaleb said to a point i dont like him keeping it after the first shooting if it was stolen i see him throwing that thing as far out into the desert as he can about ten minutes after he takes down cordell he then goes and steals another for the next time no you cant say that winston said and mccaleb envisioned her shaking her head there is no definitive pattern here he could have been just as likely to keep the gun because he knew it was valuable and you have to remember cordell was a throughandthrough shot he might have figured the lead wouldnt be found or if it had hit the banklike it actually didit would be too mangled for comparison remember he picked up the brass he probably believed the gun had at least one more use i guess youre probably right they took a breather neither one of them talking for a few moments mccaleb had two more things on his page next thing he began carefully the slugs what about them you said yesterday that youre holding the ballistics from both cases thats right its all in evidence lockup what are you getting at have you ever heard of the bureaus drugfire computer no it might work for us for you its a long shot but its worth a shot what is it mccaleb told her drugfire was an fbi computer program designed along similar lines of computerized storage of latent fingerprint data it was the brainchild of the crime lab in the early s when the cocaine wars that broke out in most cities particularly miami were responsible for a jump in murders nationwide most of the slayings were by gunfire the bureau struggling for a means of tracking related murders and killers across the country came up with the drugfire program the unique characteristics of groove marks found on the spent bullets used in drug murders were read by a laser coded for computer storage and entered into a data bank the computers program operated in much the same way as fingerprint computer systems used by law enforcement agencies across the nation the system allowed for the quick comparison of coded bullet profiles eventually the database grew as more ballistic entries were added the program was also widened though it kept the name drugfire to include all cases referred to the fbi whether it was a mob killing in las vegas or a gang killing in south los angeles or a serial killing in fort lauderdale every gunshot case sent to the fbi for analysis was added to the database after more than a decade there were thousands of bullets on file in the computer ive been thinking about this guy mccaleb said he hangs on to that gun whatever the reason whether he stole it or not his hanging on to it is really the only mistake hes made it makes me think weve got a chance of making a match looking at the mo on those tapes chances are he just didnt start popping people beginning with your case hes used a gun beforemaybe even that particular gun but i told you we checked for similars nothing on ballistics we also put out teletypes and a request on the national crime index computer we got blanked i understand but this guys method could be evolving changing maybe what he did with that gun in say phoenix isnt the same as what he did with it here all im saying is that theres a chance that this guy came into town from someplace else if he did then he probably used that gun in that other place and if were lucky the data is sitting there in the bureau computer maybe winston said she went quiet as she brooded over his proposal mccaleb knew what the considerations were drugfire was a long shot and winston was smart enough to know that but if she went for it she would be drawing in federal involvement not to mention acknowledging that she was taking direction from mccaleb an outsider with no real standing in the case what do you think mccaleb finally asked you only need to send them one bullet you have what four of them from the two cases i dont know she said im not so keen on sending our stuff off to washington i doubt la will be either la doesnt have to know youre the keeper of the evidence you can send one bullet if you want and it could be to dc and back inside a week arrango wouldnt have to know it was even sent i already talked to a guy i know in firearms and toolmarks he said hed grease this one if we got him the package mccaleb closed his eyes if there was a point at which she might get outright angry it was now you already told this guy wed be doing this she asked annoyance in her voice no i didnt tell him that i told him i was dealing with a detective out here who was very thorough and dedicated and would probably want to make sure she left no stone uncovered gee where have i heard that before mccaleb smiled theres another thing he said even if we dont get lucky with this well at least have the gun in the computer somewhere down the road it might match up with something she thought about this for a moment mccaleb was pretty sure he had painted her into the corner like watching the cemetery for luther hatch she had to go for it or shed wonder about it always okay okay winston finally said ill talk to the captain about it ill tell him i want to do this if he gives the goahead ill send a package one bulletthats all thats all it takes mccaleb filled her in further on carrutherss need to get the package by tuesday morning and urged her to get in with the captain as soon as possible this created another silence all i can say is its worth the shot jaye he said by way of reinforcement i know its just that well never mind give me your guys name and his number mccaleb clenched his fist and punched it into the air in front of him it didnt matter how long a shot it was they were rolling the dice it felt good to him to be getting something going after he gave winston the direct number and address for contacting carruthers she asked if there was anything else mccaleb wanted to talk about he looked down at his pad but what he wanted to talk about wasnt written down on it ive got one last thing thats probably going to put you on the spot he said oh no winston said with a groan serves me right for answering the phone on a court day give it to me mccaleb what is it james noone the witness what about him he saw the shooter he saw the shooters car yeah a lot of good it did us theres only about a hundred thousand of those cherokees in southern california and his description of the guy is so vague he cant tell if the guy was wearing a hat or not hes a witness but just barely but he saw him it was during a stress situation the more stress the deeper the imprint noone would be perfect perfect for what to be hypnotized buddy lockridge pulled the taurus into an open spot in the parking lot of video grafx consultants on la brea avenue in hollywood lockridge was not dressed hollywoodcool for his second day as mccalebs driver this time he was wearing boat shorts and a hawaiian shirt with ukuleles and hula girls floating on an ocean blue background mccaleb told him he didnt think he would be long and got out vgc was a business used mostly by the entertainment industry it rented professional video equipment as well as video editing and dubbing studios adult filmmakers whose product was almost exclusively shot on video were its main clients but vgc also provided one of the best videoeffects and imageenhancing labs in hollywood mccaleb had been inside vgc once before working on loan to the field offices bank unit it was the downside of his being transferred from quantico to the fo outpost technically he was under the command of the fos special agent in charge and whenever the sac thought things were slowif they ever werein the serials unit he would yank mccaleb out and put him on something else usually something mccaleb considered menial when he had walked into vgc the previous time he had a videotape from the ceiling camera of a wells fargo bank in beverly hills the bank had been robbed by several masked gunmen who had escaped with in cash it was the groups fourth bank robbery in twelve days the one lead agents had was on the video when one of the robbers had reached his arm across the tellers counter to grab the bag she had just stuffed her cash into his sleeve had caught on the edge of the marble counter and was pulled back the robber quickly pulled the sleeve forward again but for a split second the form of a tattoo was seen on the inside of his forearm the image was grainy and had been shot by a camera thirty feet away after a tech in the field office lab said he could do nothing with it it was decided not to send the tape to washington hq because it would take more than a month to have it analyzed the robbers were hitting every three days they seemed agitated in the videos on the verge of violence speed was a necessity mccaleb took the tape to video grafx a vgc tech took the frame from the video and in one day enhanced it through pixel redefinition and amplification to the point that the tattoo was identifiable it was a flying hawk clutching a rifle in one claw and a scythe in the other the tattoo broke the case its description and a photocopy were teletyped and faxed to sixty field offices across the country a supervisor in the butte office then retransmitted the information to the smaller resident agency in coeur dalene idaho where an agent recognized the tattoo as the insignia he had seen on a flag flown outside the house of a member of a local group of antigovernment extremists the group had intermittently been under bureau observation and suspicion because of its recent purchases of huge tracts of rural land outside the city the supervisor of the ra was able to provide the los angeles fo with a list of members names and social security numbers agents then began checking hotels and soon found seven members of the group staying at the airport hilton the group was placed under surveillance and the following day watched as they robbed a bank in willowbrook thirty agents were poised in surveillance points outside and ready to go in at the first sign of violence there wasnt any the robbers were followed back to their hotel and systematically arrested in their rooms by agents posing as room service waiters and housekeeping staff one of the robbers eventually cooperated with agents and admitted that the group had been robbing banks in order to raise capital to buy more land in idaho the group wanted the land so members could safely sit out the armageddon their leader promised was coming to the united states now mccaleb was back as he stepped to the reception counter he noticed that the letter of thanks under the bureaus seal that he had sent following the bank robbery investigation was framed on the wall behind the receptionist he leaned over the counter until he could read the name of the man he had sent the letter to can i help you the receptionist asked mccaleb pointed at the letter and said id like to talk to tony banks she asked mccaleb his name didnt seem to recognize it though it was on the letter that hung on the wall above her and then put in a call shortly after a man mccaleb recognized as tony banks came out to greet him he didnt recognize mccaleb until he started recounting the bank video story right right i remember you sent the letter he pointed to the framed letter thats me so what can i do for you another bank job he was eyeing the videotape mccaleb had in his hand well ive got another case here im wondering if you could take a look at this tape theres something on it i want to see if i can get a better look at well lets take a look always glad to help out he led mccaleb down a hallway of gray carpet past several doors that he knew from his previous visit were editing booths business was good there were occupied signs on all of the doors from behind one of them mccaleb heard muffled cries of passion banks looked over his shoulder at him and rolled his eyes its not real he said theyre editing a tape mccaleb nodded banks had explained the same thing to him when he had been there before banks opened the last door in the hallway he ducked his head inside to make sure the room was empty then stepped back and signaled mccaleb inside there were two chairs set in front of a video editing machine with twin thirtyinch monitors above it banks turned on the equipment pushed a button and the left side cassette cradle opened now this is going to be pretty graphic mccaleb said somebody gets shot if you want you can go outside and ill just move it to the frame i want you to look at banks took a moment to think about the offer he was a thin man of about thirty with limp hair dyed so blond it was almost white it was long on the top and shaved around the sides a hollywood haircut ive seen graphic he said put it in none like this i dont think theres a difference between graphic real life and the stuff they put in movies put it in mccaleb put the tape in the slot and banks began to play it mccaleb heard the younger mans breath catch as he watched gloria torres get grabbed from behind and the gun placed against her head and fired mccaleb reached over and put his hand on the pause button at the right moment after chan ho kang had been shot and his body had fallen across the counter and then slid back he pushed the button and froze the frame then by using a dial he could move the picture backward and forward slowly until he had exactly the image he wanted he looked at banks the man looked as though all of the evil of humanity had just been revealed to him you okay its horrible yes it is how can i help you taking a pen from his shirt pocket mccaleb pointed at the screen and tapped it on the watch on kangs wrist the watch yes i want to know if it is possible to blow this frame up or do something that would let me read the watch i want to know what time it was at this point of the video time what about this he pointed to the timeline running along the bottom of the screen i cant trust that time thats why i need the watch banks leaned forward and began fiddling with the dials on the console that controlled the focus and image amplification this is not the original he said the tape no why im not getting much amplification can you get the original i dont think so mccaleb looked at the screen banks had made the image clearer and larger the screen was filled with kangs upper body and outstretched arm but the face of the watch was still a blurred gray well then what i can do if you want to leave it with me is work with it a little bit take it to one of the guys in the lab maybe bring it up a little clarify it a bit more with some pixel redefinition but this is the best i can do with it on this equipment you think its worth doing even without the original will we get anything i dont know but its worth a try they can do some wild stuff back there youre after him right this man on the video he gestured toward the screen though at the moment the shooter wasnt on it yeah im after him then well see what we can do can you leave this yeah i mean uh can you dub off a copy for me so i can have it with me i might need to show it to somebody else sure let me go get a tape banks got up and left the booth mccaleb sat there staring at the screen he had watched how banks had used the equipment he backed the tape up and amplified a frame showing the masked shooter it didnt help much he hit the fast forward for a bit and stopped it on a closeup of glorias face it felt intrusive to be so close at such a moment to be staring at a woman who had just had her life taken her face was in left profile and the one eye that he could see was still open mccaleb noticed the three earrings on her left ear one was a stud a small silver crescent moon next going down the curve of the ear was a small hoop that he guessed was silver and last dangling below the lobe was a cross he knew it was the style among young women to have multiple earrings on at least one ear while he continued to wait for banks he played with the dials once more and backed the tape up until there was a view of glorias right side just as she entered the frame he could see only one earring on her right ear another crescent moon banks came back in with a tape and quickly inserted it into the second cassette cradle while he finished rewinding the first tape it took him about thirty seconds to make a highspeed dub copy he ejected it slid it into a box and handed it to mccaleb thanks mccaleb said how long you think before somebody gets a chance to work on it were kind of busy but ill go look at the job board and see if we cant get someone on it as soon as possible maybe by tomorrow or saturday is that okay its okay thanks tony i appreciate it no problem i dont know if i still have your card you want me to call you in that moment mccaleb decided to continue the deception he didnt tell banks that he was no longer an fbi agent he thought banks might push the project a little harder if he thought that the job was being done for the bureau tell you what let me give you a private number if you call and i dont pick up just leave a message and ill get back to you as soon as i can sounds good i hope we can help me too and tony do me a favor and dont show the tape to anybody who doesnt need to see it i wont banks said his face reddening a bit mccaleb realized either he had needlessly embarrassed banks with a request that did not need to be spoken or he had made the request just as banks was thinking about whom he could show the tape to mccaleb thought it was the latter mccaleb gave him his number they shook hands and mccaleb went back down the hall on his own as he passed the door from which he had heard the feigned sounds of passion he noticed there was only silence now as mccaleb opened the door of the taurus he heard the radio playing and noticed lockridge had a harmonica on his thigh ready to be played if the right tune came along buddy closed a book called death of a tenor man he has marked a spot about halfway through what happened to inspector fujigama what the book you had yesterday inspector imanishi investigates i finished it imanishi then youre a fast reader good books read fast you read crime novels why would i want to read madeup stuff when ive seen the real stuff and cant stand it buddy started the car he had to turn the ignition twice before it kicked over its a much different world everything is ordered good and bad clearly defined the bad guy always gets what he deserves the hero shines no loose ends its a refreshing antidote to the real world sounds boring no its reassuring where to now after eating lunch at musso and franks a place mccaleb loved but hadnt been back to in two years they drove over the hill from hollywood to the valley and got to the building that housed deltona clocks at quarter to two mccaleb had called the business before they set out that morning from the marina and learned that mikail bolotov was still working a twototen shift deltona clocks was a large warehouse structure located behind a small streetfront showroom and retail shop after lockridge parked the taurus in front of the retail store mccaleb reached down to the leather bag on the floor in front of him and removed his gun it was already snugly held in a canvas holster which he then clipped onto his belt hey what are you expecting in there lockridge said after he saw the weapon nothing its more a prop than anything else mccaleb next pulled out an inchthick sheaf of the sheriffs investigative records and made sure the report on the interview with bolotov and his employer a man identified as arnold toliver was on top he was ready he looked over at lockridge okay sit tight he noted as he got out of the taurus that this time buddy hadnt offered to come in with him he thought maybe he should carry the gun more often inside the retail shop there were no customers cheap clocks of almost every size were on display most had an industrial look as though they were more likely to be found in a classroom or an auto supply store than in somebodys home on the wall behind the counter at the rear of the space was a display of eight matching clocks showing the time in eight cities around the world there was a young woman sitting on a folding chair behind the counter mccaleb thought about how slowly time must pass for her with no customers and all of those clocks how do i find mr toliver he asked as he came up to the counter arnold or randy arnold i have to call back who are you with im not here to buy clocks im conducting a followup on a sheriffs department inquiry of february third he dropped the stack of paperwork on the counter so she could see that they were official forms he then raised his hands and put them on his hips carefully allowing his sports coat to open and expose the gun he watched her eyes as she noticed it she picked up a telephone that was on the counter and dialed three numbers arnie its wendy theres a man from the sheriffs department here about an investigation or something mccaleb didnt correct her he hadnt lied to her and he wouldnt lie to her about who he was and whom he was with but if she wanted to make incorrect assumptions then he wasnt going to correct her after listening to the phone for a few moments wendy looked up at mccaleb what investigation mccaleb nodded toward the phone and held his hand out the young woman hesitated but then handed the phone receiver to him mr toliver he said into the phone terry mccaleb a couple months ago you talked to a couple of sheriffs detectives named ritenbaugh and aguilar about an employee named mikail bolotov you remember after a long hesitation toliver agreed that he had well im investigating that case now ritenbaugh and aguilar are onto other things i need to ask you some additional questions about that can i come back again a hesitation well we are awfully busy back here i i wont take long sir remember its a murder investigation and im hoping youll continue to help us out well i suppose you suppose what uh just come on back the girl will tell you where im at three minutes later mccaleb had walked the length of the building past several rows of assembly and packaging benches to an office at the rear next to a loading dock there was a short flight of stairs up into the office next to the door was a window that allowed toliver to look out across the workbenches as well as the shipping and receiving dock as he had walked past the benches toward the office mccaleb had overheard the conversations of the employees three different times he heard a language he believed was russian as mccaleb opened the office door the man he assumed was toliver hung up the phone and waved him in he was a skinny man in his sixties with brown leathery skin and white hair fringed around the sides of his head he had a plastic pocket guard in his shirt pocket jammed with an assortment of pens ive gotta make this quick he said i have to check the lading on a truck going out fine mccaleb looked down at the report on top of the stack he carried two months ago you told detectives ritenbaugh and aguilar that mikail bolotov was working the night of january twentysecond thats right i remember hasnt changed are you sure mr toliver what do you mean am i sure yeah im sure i looked it up for those two guys it was in the books i pulled the time card are you saying you based it on what you saw in the pay records or did you actually see bolotov working that night he was here i remembered that mikail never missed a day and you remember him working all the way until ten his time card showed he im not talking about the time card im talking about you remembering he stayed until ten toliver didnt answer mccaleb glanced out the window at the rows of workbenches youve got a lot of people working for you mr toliver how many work the twototen shift eightyeight at the moment and then about the same whats the point the point is you gave the man an alibi based on a time card do you think it could have been possible that bolotov left early without being noticed then had a friend punch him out on the clock toliver didnt respond forgetting about bolotov for a moment have you ever had that problem before you know somebody punching out for somebody else scamming the company that way weve been in business here sixteen years its happened okay mccaleb nodded now could it have happened with bolotov or do you stand at the time clock every night and make sure nobody punches two cards anythings possible we dont stand at the clock most nights my son closes up im already home he keeps an eye on things mccaleb held his breath for a beat and felt the excitement he had been containing build tolivers answer if it were given in court would be enough to shred bolotovs alibi your son is that randy yeah randy can i talk to him hes in mexico weve got another plant in mexicali he spends one week a month down there hell be back next week maybe we can call him i can try but hes probably out on the floor thats why he goes down there to make sure the line is running besides how is he going to remember one night three months ago we make clocks here detective every night we make the same clocks every day we ship them out one night is no different from the other mccaleb turned away from him and looked out the window again he noticed that several of the workers were leaving their posts as new workers were taking their places he watched the shift change until he picked out the man he believed was bolotov there had been no photo in the records and only a spare description but the man mccaleb was now watching wore a black tshirt with sleeves stretched tightly around his powerful and tattoolaced arms the tattoos were all of one inkjailhouse blue it had to be bolotov thats him right he nodded in the direction of the man who had taken a seat at a workbench it appeared to mccaleb that it was bolotovs job to place the plastic casings around completed clock mechanisms and then stack them in a fourwheeled cart which toliver had come up next to mccaleb at the window with the tattoos yeah mccaleb nodded and thought for a moment did you tell ritenbaugh and aguilar that the alibi you were giving that man was based on what you saw in the pay records and time cards and not what you or your son actually saw on that night yeah i told them they said fine they left and that was that now here you are with these new questions why dont you guys get your shit together it would have been a lot easier for my boy to remember after two or three weeks instead of three months mccaleb was silent as he thought about ritenbaugh and aguilar they had probably had a list of twentyfive names they had to cover in the week they were assigned to the case it was sloppy work but he understood how it could happen listen ive got to go out to the dock toliver said you want to wait until i come back or what tell you what why dont you send bolotov in here on your way out i need to talk to him in here if you dont mind mr toliver i am sure you want to help us out and continue to cooperate dont you he stared at toliver as a final means of ending his unspoken objection whatever toliver said as he threw his hands up in a gesture of annoyance and headed toward the door just dont take all day oh mr toliver toliver stopped at the door and looked back at him i heard a lot of russian being spoken out there where do you get the russians theyre good workers and they dont complain they dont mind being paid shit either when we advertise for help we do it in the local russian paper he went through the door then leaving it open behind him mccaleb pulled the two chairs in front of the desk away and turned them so they faced each other from about five feet apart he sat down on the one closest to the door and waited he quickly thought about how he would handle the interview and decided to come at bolotov strong he wanted to engender a response get some kind of reaction to which he could register his own feel for the man he felt a presence in the room and looked at the door the man he had guessed was bolotov stood there he was about five ten with black hair and pale white skin but the bulging arm muscles and tattoosa snake wrapped around one arm a spiders web covering the othermade his arms the focal point of his image mccaleb pointed to the empty chair have a seat bolotov moved to the chair and sat down without hesitation mccaleb saw that the spider web apparently continued under the shirt and then came up both sides of the russians neck a black spider sat in the web just below his right ear what is this same as before bolotov my names mccaleb the night of january twentysecond tell me about it i told them before i work here that night it was not me you look for so you said but things are different now we know things we didnt know then what things mccaleb got up and locked the door and then retook his seat it was just a little show an underlining of his control something for bolotov to think about what things he asked again like the burglary of the house over on mason just a few blocks from here you remember the one with the christmas tree and all the presents thats where you got the gun wasnt it bolotov no i am clean on these things bullshit you did the breakin and you got that nice new gun then you decided to use it you used it up in lancaster and then again around the corner from here at the market youre a killer bolotov a killer the russian sat still but mccaleb could see his biceps drawing tight better defining the artwork on his arms he pressed on what about february seventh you have an alibi for that night too i dont know that night i have to you walked into the sherman market and you killed two people that night you should know it bolotov suddenly stood up who are you youre not cop mccaleb just looked up at him keeping his seat hoping not to show the surprise he was feeling cops are in twos who are you im the one whos going to take you down you did it bolotov and im going to prove it wha there was an angry knock on the door and mccaleb instinctively turned to look it was a small mistake but it was all bolotov needed mccaleb saw the black blur coming at him in his peripheral vision instinctively he began bringing his arms up to protect his chest he wasnt quick enough suddenly he was hit with the impact of the other mans weight and his chair went over with him still in it bolotov had him down on the floor while toliver or whoever was out there continued to knock angrily on the door the bigger stronger man held mccaleb down while he went through his pockets his hand hit the gun and he tore it off the belt and threw it across the room finally he found mccalebs wallet in the inside pocket of his sports coat he pulled it out ripping the pocket and opened it no badge see no cop he read the name off the drivers license which was held behind a plastic window in the wallet terrellmackcowleeb bolotov then read off the address mccaleb felt relieved that it was actually the address of the harbormasters office where he had a postal box maybe i pay you a visit one day yes mccaleb didnt answer or move he knew there was no chance of overpowering the man as he was considering his predicament bolotov dropped the wallet on his chest and jumped up he jerked the chair out from beneath mccalebs hips and raised it over his head mccaleb raised his arms up to protect his face and head realizing in the same instant that he was leaving his chest unprotected he heard the shatter of glass and looked between his arms to see the chair crashing through the office window he then watched as bolotov followed it leaping with ease through the opening and down to the manufacturing floor then he was gone mccaleb rolled to his side folding his arms across his chest and bringing his knees up he spread a hand flat on his chest trying to feel the beat he took two deep breaths and slowly got to his knees and raised himself the pounding on the door continued now accompanied by tolivers panicked demands that mccaleb open up mccaleb reached over to unlock the door he felt a wave of vertigo hit him then it was like sliding down a twelvefoot trough into the valley of a wave toliver burst into the office and started screaming at him but mccaleb didnt understand his words he put his hands flat on the floor and closed his eyes trying to steady himself shit was all he managed to whisper buddy lockridge jumped out of the taurus when he saw mccaleb approaching he ran around the front of the car and came to mccalebs side jesus what happened nothing i made a mistake thats all you look like shit im okay now lets go lockridge opened the door for him and then went around to the drivers side and got in you sure youre okay come on lets go where find a phone theres one right there he pointed to the jack in the box restaurant next door there was a pay phone on the wall near one of the doors mccaleb got out and slowly walked to the phone he was careful to keep his eyes on the pavement in front of him not wanting to set off another slide into vertigo he called jaye winstons direct line expecting to leave a message but she picked up immediately its terry i thought you had court i do but its the lunch break i have to be back at two i was just about to call you why because were going to do it do what hypnotize mr noone the captain signed off on it and i called mr noone he said sure he just wants us to do it tonight because hes going out of townback to vegas i guess hes going to be here at six you can do it then right ill be there then were set why were you calling mccaleb hesitated what he had to tell her might change the evenings plans but he knew he couldnt delay can you get a photo of bolotov by tonight i already have one you want to show noone yeah i just paid bolotov a little visit and he didnt react too well to it what happened before i could ask him three questions he jumped me and ran are you shitting me i wish what about his alibi its about as solid as a loaf of bread mccaleb briefly recounted his interview with toliver and then bolotov he told winston she should put out a wanted notice for bolotov for what did you or toliver make a police report i didnt but toliver said he was going to make a report on the window all right ill put out a pickup are you all right you sound punchy im okay is this going to change things or are we still on for tonight far as im concerned were still on okay see you then look terry dont put too much stock in bolotov okay i think he looks good for this i dont know lancaster s a long way from where bolotov lives youve got to remember the guys a convict he could have and would have done what he did with you whether hes involved with this or not because if he didnt do this then he did something else maybe but i still like the guy well maybe noone will make our day and point him out in a sixpack now youre talking after hanging up mccaleb made it back to the taurus without a problem once inside he dug the travel kit he always carried with him out of the leather satchel on the floor it contained a days worth of medication and a dozen or so throwaway thermometers called tempstrips he peeled the paper off one and put it in his mouth while he waited he signaled lockridge to start the car once the engine had fired mccaleb reached over to the airconditioner controls and turned it on you want air lockridge asked mccaleb nodded and lockridge turned the fan up higher after three minutes mccaleb took the strip out and checked it he felt a deep shard of fear cut into him as he looked at the thin red vein stretched past the onehundreddegree mark lets go home you sure yes the marina as lockridge pointed the car south toward the freeway mccaleb turned the air vents on his side so that the cool air was flowing right into his face he opened up another tempstrip and put it under his tongue he tried to calm himself by turning on kfwb on the radio and looking out at the passing street scene two minutes later the second temperature reading was better than the first but he was still running a lowgrade fever his fear eased back some and his throat relaxed he banged his palms against the dashboard and shook his head convincing himself in the process that the fever was an aberration he had been perfect so far there was no reason for this other than that he had gotten overheated while tangling with bolotov he decided to go back to the boat and take an aspirin and a long nap before preparing for the evenings session with james noone the alternative was to call bonnie fox and he knew that such a call would result in his finding himself in a hospital bed for several days of testing and observation fox was as thorough at what she did as mccaleb liked to think he was at what he did she wouldnt hesitate to bring him in he would lose at least a week lying in bed in cedars he would certainly miss his chance at noone and he would lose the momentum that was the only other thing he had going for him in this investigation to the uninformed and this included many cops and agents mccaleb had worked with over the yearshypnosis was often seen as a form of voodoo policework a secondtolast resort just shy of consulting the local psychic it was considered emblematic of a stalled or failed investigation mccaleb firmly believed it was not he believed it was a credible means of plumbing the depths of the mind in the instances where he had seen or heard of it going wrong it was usually at the fault of the hypnotist and not the science mccaleb had been surprised when winston said she was in favor of reinterviewing noone under hypnotic conditions she had told him that hypnotism had been suggested a couple of times during the weekly homicide bureau meetings when the stalled cordell investigation came up but the suggestion had never been acted on for two reasons the first was the important one hypnosis was a tool used often by police until the early eighties when california s supreme court ruled that witnesses who had memories refreshed through hypnosis could not testify in criminal proceedings this meant that every time investigators decided whether to use hypnotism on a witness they had to weigh whether the possible gain from it was worth losing that person as a witness in court the debate had stalled the use of hypnotism in the cordell case since winston and her captain were reluctant to lose their only witness the second reason was that after the supreme court ruling the sheriffs department stopped training detectives in the use of hypnosis consequently the more than fifteen years since the ruling had seen the natural attrition of the detectives who had the skill there was no one left in the department who could hypnotize noone meaning that they would have to go to an outside hypnotherapist that would further complicate things and cost money when mccaleb had told winston that he had used hypnotism on bureau cases for more than ten years and would be willing to do it she had brightened on the suggestion even more a few hours later shed had the session approved and set up mccaleb arrived at the homicide bureau at the sheriffs star center a half hour early he told lockridge that he would be a while and encouraged him to go get dinner his fever had been trimmed to less than a half a point during an afternoon nap he felt rested and ready he was excited by the prospect of digging a solid lead out of the mind of james noone and accomplishing something that would drive the case forward jaye winston met him at the front counter and escorted him to the captains office talking quickly all the way i posted a wanted on bolotov had a car go by his apartment but he was already gone hes split you obviously hit a nerve yeah maybe when i called him a murderer im still not convinced but its the best thing weve got going at the moment typically arrango is not happy about what you did i have to admit i didnt say we talked about this beforehand he thinks you were cowboying dont worry about it i dont care what he thinks are you worried about bolotov you said he has your address no he has the marina but not the boat its a big place she opened the door and allowed mccaleb to enter first there were three men and a woman waiting in the cramped office mccaleb recognized arrango and walters from the lapd winston introduced him to captain al hitchens and the woman an artist named donna de groot she would be available if needed to work up a composite drawing of the suspect provided that noone didnt identify bolotov outright im glad youre early hitchens said mr noone is already here maybe we can get this going mccaleb nodded and looked at the others in the room arrango had the smirk of a nonbeliever on his face a toothpick protruded a half inch from his tight lips this is too many people mccaleb said too much distraction i need to get this guy relaxed that wont happen with an audience like this were not all going in hitchens said id like you and jaye to be in the room you bring donna in at the appropriate time were going to videotape it and we have a monitor set up right here the rest of us will watch from here that okay with you he pointed to a monitor on a cart in the corner mccaleb looked at the screen and saw a man sitting at a table with his arms folded in front of him it was noone even though he was wearing a baseball hat mccaleb recognized the man from the crime scene and atm tapes thats fine mccaleb looked at winston did you make up a sixpack with bolotov yes its on my desk well show it to him first in case we get lucky if he makes the id there will be no hypnosis so we can save him for court mccaleb nodded woulda been real nice arrango began if we had shown noone the pictures before the bird was flushed he looked at mccaleb mccaleb thought of a response but decided to keep it to himself anything in particular you want me to ask him he asked instead arrango looked at his partner and winked yeah get us the license plate off that getaway vehicle thatd be nice he smiled brilliantly the toothpick jutting upward from his lower lip mccaleb smiled back its been done before the victim of a rapist once gave me a complete description of a tattoo on her attackers arm before hypnosis she hadnt even remembered the tattoo good then do it again get us a plate get us a tattoo your pal bolotov has enough of em there had been a clear challenge in his voice arrango seemed to insist on putting everything on a personal level as if mccalebs desire to bring a multiple killer in was in some way a show of disrespect to him it was ludicrous but mccaleb had challenged him simply by entering the case okay guys hitchens said cutting it off and trying to diffuse tensions were just taking a shot at this thats all its worth the shot maybe we get something maybe we dont meantime we lose the guy in court arrango said what court mccaleb said youre not going anywhere near court with what you guys have got this is your last chance arrango im your last chance arrango swiftly stood up not to challenge mccaleb physically but to underline his next words lookit asshole i dont need some washedout fed to tell me how to okay okay thats it hitchens said standing up also were gonna do this thing and do it right now jaye why dont you take terry into the interview room and get started the rest of us will wait here winston guided mccaleb out the door he looked back over his shoulder at arrango whose face had turned dark with anger past him mccaleb noticed a quizzical smile on donna de groots face she had apparently enjoyed the testosterone show as they walked through the squad room and past rows of empty desks mccaleb shook his head with embarrassment sorry he said i cant believe i let him draw me into that its okay guys an asshole it was going to happen sooner or later after stopping by winstons desk to pick up the file containing the photo lineup they went down a hallway and winston stopped outside a closed door she put her hand on the knob but looked back at mccaleb before turning it okay any particular way you want to do this the main thing is that it works best if only i do the talking once the session begins and i communicate verbally only with him that way he wont get confused about who i am talking to so if you and i need to communicate we can either write notes or point to the door and we can come out here fine are you all right you look like shit im fine she opened the door and james noone looked up from table mr noone this is terry mccaleb the hypnotism expert i told you about winston said he used to work for the fbi hes going to see if he cant work with you on this mccaleb smiled and reached a hand across the table they shook good to meet you mr noone this shouldnt take long and it should be a relaxing experience do you mind if i call you james no james is fine mccaleb looked around the room and at the table and chairs the chairs were standard government issue with a half inch of foam padding on the seats he looked at winston jaye you think we can get a more comfortable chair for james something with arms maybe like the one captain hitchens was sitting in sure hang on a minute oh also im going to need a pair of scissors winston looked at him quizzically but left without a word mccaleb took an appraising look around the room there was an overhead bank of fluorescent lights in the ceiling no other lighting the glare from the overheads was magnified by the mirrored window on the left wall he knew the video camera was set up on the other side of the glass so he needed to keep noone in a position facing it lets see he said to noone i need to get up on the table to get at those lights no problem using a chair as a stepladder mccaleb climbed onto the table and reached up to the light panel he moved slowly trying to avoid another bout of vertigo he opened the panel and began removing the long light tubes handing them down to noone and engaging him in small talk hoping to make the witness feel comfortable with him i hear youre going to vegas from here is that work or play uh work mostly what do you do computer software im designing a new accounting and security system for the el rio still working out the bugs well be running tests for the next week or so a week in las vegas boy i could lose a lot of money there in a week i dont gamble thats a good thing he had taken out three of the four bulbs dropping the room into a dim ambiance he hoped that left enough light for the video as he got off the table winston returned with a chair that actually looked like the one hitchens had been sitting in you took that from the captain best chair in the place good he looked at the mirror and winked at the camera behind it as he did this he noticed the dark circles beginning to form under his eyes and quickly looked away winston reached into the pocket of the blazer she wore and carefully eased out a pair of scissors mccaleb took them and put them on the table and then pushed it against the wall below the mirror he then took the captains chair and positioned it against the opposite wall he put two chairs from the table facing the captains chair but split them apart far enough so as not to block the cameras view of noone he directed noone to the captains chair and then winston and he took the remaining seats mccaleb looked at his watch and noted that it was ten minutes before six okay he said well try to do this quick and have you on your way james first off any questions you have for us about what were trying to do here noone thought a moment before speaking well i guess i dont know much about it what will happen to me nothing will happen to you all hypnosis really is is an altered state of consciousness what we want you to do is go through some progressive stages of relaxation until you reach a point where you can easily move through the recesses of your mind to pull out some of the stored information kind of like turning through a rolodex and pulling out the card you need mccaleb waited but noone asked nothing else why dont we start with an exercise i want you to tilt your head back slightly and look up try to roll your eyes upward as far as they can go maybe you should take off your glasses noone took off the glasses folded them and put them in his pocket he tilted his head back and rolled his eyes up mccaleb studied him he was able to roll them upward enough so that a quarter inch of white cornea was visible below each iris this was a good indicator of receptivity to hypnosis okay thats good now i want you to just relax if you can take long deep breaths and tell us what you can recall about the incident on the night of january twentysecond just recount what you now remember about what you saw for the next ten minutes noone told the story about coming upon the tail end of the shooting and robbery at the atm in lancaster his story was no different than the versions he had recounted during various interviews since the night it had all happened he added no new details that mccaleb picked up on and seemed to leave nothing out from his prior tellings this was unusual and encouraging to mccaleb the memories of most witnesses begin fading after two months they forgot details the fact that noone seemed to remember every detail led mccaleb to hope the computer programmers recessed memory might be just as sharp when noone had finished recounting the event mccaleb nodded to winston who then leaned toward noone and handed him the sixpack file james i want you to open the file and look at the photos tell us if any of the men were the man you saw in the speeding car noone put his glasses back on and took the file but said i dont know i really didnt get a i know winston said but take a look noone opened the file there was a piece of cardboard inside with squares cut out in two rows of three in the squares were photos of men bolotovs photo was the third on the top row noone stared at the sixpack his eyes moving from photo to photo and then shook his head im sorry i just didnt see him thats fine mccaleb said quickly before winston could say something that noone might interpret as a negative i think were ready to go on then he took the file from noone and tossed it onto the table so why dont you start by just telling us what you do to relax james mccaleb asked noone looked back at him blankly you know when are you happiest when are you the most relaxed and at peace me i like to work on my boat and go fishing i dont even care if i catch anything i just like having a line in the water how about you james you like shooting baskets hitting golf balls what um i dont know i guess i like being on the computer but thats not relaxing mentally james is it im not talking about something where you have to do a lot of thinking i mean what do you do when you want to let it all go when youre tired of thinking and you just want to go blank for a while well i dont know i like to go to the beach theres a place i know i go there whats it look like the sand down there is so white and its wide you can rent horses and ride along the edge of the water below the cliffs the water cuts under the cliffs and its like a hanging edge people sit under there in the shade okay thats good thats real good james now i want you to close your eyes rest your arms in your lap and in your mind i want you to think about that spot picture in your mind that you are walking on that beach just relax and walk along the beach mccaleb was silent for a half minute and simply watched noones face the skin around the corners of his closed eyes began to relax and mccaleb then led him through a set of sensory exercises in which he told him to concentrate on the feel of his socks on his feet his hands on the fabric of his pants the glasses on the bridge of his nose even the hairwhat was left of iton his head after five minutes of this mccaleb went on to muscle exercises telling noone to crunch his toes together as hard as possible hold them that way and then release slowly the focus of the exercises was moved up his body eventually going to every muscle group mccaleb then started again at the toes and moved back up it was a method of exhausting the muscles and making the mind more susceptible to the suggestion of relaxation and rest mccaleb noticed noones breathing going deep and long things were going well he looked at his watch and saw it was now sixthirty okay james now without opening your eyes i want you to hold your left hand out and up in front of your face hold it about a foot from your face noone responded and mccaleb let him hold his arm up for a good minute all the while counseling him to relax and keep his thoughts on the beach he was walking on okay i now want you to very slowly bring your hand toward your face very slowly noones hand started to move toward his nose okay slower now mccaleb said his words slower and softer than before thats it james slowly and when your hand touches your face you will be totally relaxed and at that point you will drop into a deep hypnotic state he was silent then as he watched noones hand move slowly forward until his palm stopped at his nose at the moment of contact his head dipped forward and his shoulders slumped his hand dropped into his lap mccaleb looked over at winston she raised her eyebrows and nodded at him mccaleb knew they were only halfway there but things were looking good he decided to run a little test james you are totally relaxed now totally at rest you are so relaxed that your arms are as light as feathers they weigh nothing at all he watched him but he didnt move which was good okay now im going to take a balloon thats full of helium and tie the string to your left hand im tying it on now there the balloon is tied to your wrist james and im letting go of it immediately noones left arm began to rise until it was stretched upward his hand up higher than his head mccaleb just watched and after half a minute noones arm showed no indication of tiring okay james i have a pair of scissors and im going to cut the string mccaleb reached back to the table and lifted the scissors he opened them and closed them sharply on the imaginary string noones arm dropped back into his lap mccaleb looked over at winston and nodded okay james you are very relaxed and nothing is bothering you i want you to picture in your mind that youre walking on that beach and you come to a garden the garden is green and lush and beautiful and there are flowers and birds singing it is so beautiful and peaceful youve never been in any spot as peaceful as this now you walk through the garden and come to a small building with a set of doors theyre elevator doors james theyre made of wood with gold trim around the edges and theyre beautiful everything here is beautiful the doors open james and you step on the elevator because you know it takes you down to your special room a room where nobody else can go only you can go down there and you are in total peace when you go there mccaleb got up and stood in front of noone just a few feet away noone showed no outward sign of acknowledging the close presence of another person the elevator buttons show you are on number ten and you have to go down to your room on number one you push the button james and the elevator starts to go down you are feeling more relaxed as each floor goes by mccaleb raised his arm and held it parallel to the ground and a foot in front of noones face he then began raising it bringing it back around and then up again he knew the disturbance the motion would make in the light hitting noones eyelids would add to his sense of descent youre going down james deeper and deeper thats the ninth floor now the eighth and seven you are getting deeper and deeper more and more relaxed the sixth floor just went by now the fifth four three two and one the doors open now and you step into your special room youre there james and in perfect peace mccaleb went back to his chair he then told noone to enter his room and that the most comfortable chair in the world was waiting for him there he told him to sit down and just melt into the chair he told him to imagine a pat of butter melting in a frying pan on very low heat no sizzle just a slow slow melting thats you james just melting into your chair he waited a few moments and then told noone about the television that was sitting right in front of him youve got the remote control in your hand and this is a special television with a special remote you can watch whatever you want to on this tv you can back the picture up go forward zoom in or pull back out whatever you want to do with it you can do now turn it on james and what were going to watch on that special tv right now is what you saw on the night of january twentysecond when you were going to the bank in lancaster to get some money he waited a beat turn the tv on james is it on now yes noone said his first words in a half hour okay good now were going to go back to that night james now tell us what you saw james noone told his story as if mccaleb and winston were there riding with him in his car if not his head i have the blinker on and im turning in here he comes brakes hes going tohe almost hit me the asshole i couldve noone raised his left arm made a fist and shot his middle finger up an impotent gesture at the driver of the car that had blasted by him as he did this mccaleb looked closely at his face noting the rapid eye movement behind his closed lids it was one of the indicators he always looked for a sign that the subject was deeply into the trance hes gone and im pulling in now i see i see the man there is a man on the ground under the light by the atm hes downim getting out and check to see theres blood hes shotsomebody shot him uh uh ive got to get somebodyim going back to my car for the phone i can call and get him help hes shot theres blood on the its everywhere okay james okay mccaleb said interrupting him for the first time thats good now what i want you to do is take your special remote and back up the picture on the tv until the point that you first see the car coming out of the banks parking lot can you do that yes okay are you there yes okay now start it again only this time run it in slow motion very slow so you can see everything are you running it yes okay i want you to freeze it when you get the best view of the car coming at you mccaleb waited okay i got it okay good can you tell us what kind of car it is yes black cherokee its pretty dusty can you tell what year no its the newer kind the grand cherokee can you see the side of the cherokee yes how many doors it was a small test to make sure noone was reporting what he had seen not what he had been told mccaleb remembered from the crime scene tape that the deputy who had first interviewed noone had told him the newer styling on the cherokee indicated it was the grand cherokee model mccaleb had to confirm the identification of the vehicle and he knew the grand cherokee came only in a fourdoor model um two on the side noone said its a fourdoor good now come around to the front do you see any damage to the car any dents or noticeable scratches no is there any striping on the car mmm no how about the bumper can you see the front bumper yes okay i want you to take your remote and zoom in on that bumper can you see the license plate no why not james its covered whats covering it uh theres a tshirt on it its wrapped around the bumper so it covers the plate looks like a tshirt mccaleb glanced over at winston and could see the disappointment on her face he pressed on okay james take your remote and zoom up into the car can you do that okay how many people are in that cherokee one the driver all right zoom in on him tell me what you see cant really why not whats wrong the lights hes got the brights on the glare is too much i cant okay james what i want you to do is take the remote and move the picture go back and forth until you have the best view of the driver tell me when you have that mccaleb looked back at winston and she looked back with raised eyebrows they both knew that they would soon find out if this had been worth it or not okay james said okay youre seeing the driver yes tell us what he looks like what color is his skin hes white but he has a hat and the brim is down hes looking downward and the brim covers his face all of his face no i see his mouth does he have a beard or mustache no can you see his teeth no his mouth is closed can you see his eyes no that hat is in the way mccaleb sat back and released his breath in frustration he couldnt believe this noone was a perfect subject he was in a deep trance and yet they couldnt get from him what they needed a direct look at the shooter okay are you sure this is the best view of him im sure can you see any of his hair yes what color is it dark like a dark brown or maybe black what length can you tell it looks short what about the hat describe the hat its a baseball hat and its gray washedout gray okay is there any writing on the hat or a team logo theres a design like a symbol can you describe it its like letters overlapping each other what letters it looks like a c with a line cut through a one or a capital i or a small l and then theres a circlei mean an ovalaround the whole thing mccaleb was silent for a moment thinking about this james he then said if i give you something to draw on do you think you could open your eyes and draw this design for us yes okay i want you to open your eyes mccaleb stood up winston had already turned the pad she had on a clipboard to a fresh page mccaleb took it and her pen and handed both to noone noones eyes were open and staring blankly at the pad as he drew he then handed it back the drawing was as he had described it a vertical line slashing down through a large c this design was then captured in an oval mccaleb handed the pad back to winston who briefly held it up to the mirrored window so those watching on video could see okay james that was good now close your eyes and look at the picture of the driver again you got it yes can you see either of his ears one his right is there anything unusual no no earring no what about below the ear his neck can you see his neck yes anything unusual there what do you see uh nothing uh his neck just his neck this is his right side yes right no tattoo on his neck no no tattoo mccaleb blew out his breath again he had just effectively eliminated bolotov as a suspect after spending the day building him as one okay he said in a resigned voice what about his hands can you see his hands on the steering wheel theyre holding the wheel see anything unusual anything on his fingers no no rings no is he wearing a watch a watch yes what kind i cant see i see the band what kind of band what color its black which wrist is it on his left or right his right his right okay can you see and describe any of his clothing just his shirt its dark a dark blue sweatshirt mccaleb tried to think of what else to ask his disappointment in not being able to come up with a substantial lead so far was crowding his focus finally he thought of something he had passed over the windshield james are there any stickers or anything like that on the glass mmm no i dont see them okay and take a look at the rearview mirror anything on that like hanging down or hooked to it not that i can see mccaleb now slumped in his chair this was a disaster they had lost this man as a potential court witness eliminated a potential suspect and all they got from it was a detailed description of a baseball cap and a dentless cherokee he knew the last step was to take noone forward to his last view of the cherokee speeding away but it was likely that if the front license plate had been covered so too would be the rear plate okay james lets hit fast forward to the point that the cherokee is past you and you are shooting the guy the bird okay zoom in on the license plate can you see it its covered with what a towel or a tshirt i cant tell like the front zoom back do you see anything unusual about the rear of the car mmm no bumper stickers or maybe the car dealerships name on the rear no nothing like that anything on the window any stickers mccaleb registered the desperation in his own voice no nothing mccaleb looked at winston and shook his head anything else winston shook her head do you want to bring the artist in she shook her head again you sure she shook her head one more time mccaleb turned his attention back to noone though he couldnt help but think about how this had been a gamble that had not paid off james over the next few days i want you to think about what you saw on the night of january twentysecond and if anything new comes to mind if you remember any other details i want you to call detective winston okay okay good now im going to count backward from five and as i do this you are going to feel your body rejuvenating and you will become more and more alert until i say one and you become fully alert you are going to have a high level of energy and feel like youve just had eight hours of sleep youll stay awake all the way to las vegas but when you go to bed tonight you wont have any trouble sleeping okay on all of that okay mccaleb brought him out of the trance and noone looked at winston with expectant eyes welcome back mccaleb said how do you feel great i guess howd i do you did fine you remember what we talked about yes i think so good you should remember if anything else comes to the surface you call detective winston right well we dont want to hold you up any further youve got a long drive ahead of you no problem i didnt think id get out of here until after seven youre giving me a head start mccaleb looked at his watch and then back at noone its almost seventhirty right now what he looked at his watch surprise showing on his face people in the hypnotic state often lose time mccaleb said i thought it was only like ten minutes thats normal its called disturbed time mccaleb stood up and they shook hands and winston walked him out mccaleb sat back down and clasped his hands together on top of his head he was bone tired and wished that he could feel like he had just had eight hours sleep the door to the interview room opened and captain hitchens stepped in he had a dour expression on his face that was easy to interpret well what do you think he asked as he sat down on the table next to the scissors same as you it was a bust we got a better description of the car but it still only narrows it down to ten thousand or so and we got the hat which there may even be more of cleveland indians what oh the ci maybe but i think they have a little indian guy on their hats right right well what about molotov bolotov whatever i guess weve painted him out now looks it hitchens clapped his hands together and after a few uncomfortable moments of silence winston came back in and stood there with her hands in the pockets of her blazer wheres arrango and walters mccaleb asked they left she said they werent impressed mccaleb stood back up and told hitchens that if he got off the table hed put it back in place and then put the light bulbs back into the ceiling hitchens said not to bother he told mccaleb that he had done enoughwhich mccaleb took to mean in more ways than one then i guess ill be going he said pointing at the mirror he added you think at some point i could get a copy of the tape or the transcript id like to look at it at some point might get a few ideas for a followup well jaye can make you a copy weve got a transfer machine but as far as any followups go i dont see much of a need to pursue this the guy clearly didnt see our shooters face and the plates were covered what else is there to say mccaleb didnt answer they all left after that hitchens pushing his chair back toward his office and winston leading mccaleb into the video room she grabbed a fresh tape off a shelf and put it in a tape machine already attached to the one that had recorded the hypnotism session look i still think it was worth the shot mccaleb said as she pushed the buttons that began dubbing one tape onto the other dont worry it was im disappointed only in the lack of results and because we lost the russian not in the fact that we did it i dont know what the captain thinks and i dont care about those lapd guys thats how i look at it mccaleb nodded it was nice of her to put it that way and let him off the hook after all he had pushed for the use of hypnotism and it hadnt paid off she could have dumped all the blame on him well if hitchens gives you grief just put it all on me tell him it was all me winston didnt reply she popped the dubbed tape out of the machine slid it into its cardboard sleeve and handed it to mccaleb ill walk you out she said nah thats okay i know the way okay terry stay in touch sure they were out in the hallway before terry remembered something hey did you talk to the captain about the drugfire thing oh yeah were going to do it a package goes out fedex tomorrow i called your guy in dc and told him it was coming great you tell arrango winston frowned and shook her head basically i get the idea that any idea that comes from you arrango isnt interested in i didnt tell him mccaleb nodded threw a salute her way and headed for the exit he walked through the parking lot his eyes scanning for buddy lockridges taurus before he spotted it another car pulled up alongside him mccaleb glanced over and saw arrango looking up at him from the passenger seat mccaleb braced himself for the detectives gloating about the lack of success from the session what he said he kept walking and the car stayed alongside him nothing arrango said i just wanted to tell you that was a hell of a show in there four stars well put a teletype out on the watchband first thing in the morning thats funny arrango just making the point that your little session in there cost us a witness a suspect who probably should have never been a suspect and didnt get us squat we got more than we had before i never said the guy was going to give us the shooters goddamn address yeah well we already figured out what the ci on the hat means complete idiotsthats what the shooter probably thinks of us if he does he was already thinking that before tonight arrango didnt have an answer for that you know mccaleb said you ought to think about your witness ellen taaffe to hypnotize like that thats right arrango barked a command at walters to stop the car he popped his door open and jumped out he came up close to mccaleb their faces inches apart close enough for mccaleb to smell his breath he guessed that the detective kept a flask of bourbon in the glove compartment listen to me bureau man you stay the fuck away from my witnesses you just stay the fuck away from my case he didnt back away when he was done he just stayed there his whisky breath burning mccalebs nose mccaleb smiled and nodded slowly as if he had just come into possession of a great secret youre really worried arent you he said youre worried im going to break this you dont care about the actual case about the people killed or hurt by this you just dont want me doing what you cant mccaleb waited for a response but arrango said nothing then be worried arrango yeah because youre going to break this one he laughed in a fake way that had far more venom in it than humor because ill let you in on a little secret mccaleb said you know gloria torres the victim you dont give a shit about ive got her heart mccaleb tapped his chest and looked back at him i got her heart im alive because shes dead and that cuts me into this in a big way so i dont care much about your feelings arrango i couldnt give a fuck about stepping on your toes youre an asshole and thats fine be an asshole ill put up with that but im not backing out of this till we get this guy i dont care if its you me or somebody else but im in this one for the whole ride they just stared at each other for a long moment and then mccaleb raised his right hand and calmly pushed arrango away from him i gotta go arrango see you around he dreamed of darkness a moving darkness like blood in water with darting images in the periphery that he couldnt grab onto with his eyes until they were gone three times in the night he was awakened by some interior alarm sitting up so fast he grew dizzy he would wait and listen and there would be nothing but the sound of the wind through dozens of masts in the marina he would get up and check the boat look out across the marina for bolotov even though he thought it unlikely the russian would ever show up hed then use the bathroom and check the vitals status quo each time and he would return to the dark waters of the same indecipherable dream at nine oclock friday morning the phone woke him it was jaye winston you awake yeah just getting a slow start today whats going on whats going on is that i just heard from arrango and he told me something that really bothers me oh yeah whats that he told me who you got that new heart from mccaleb rubbed a hand across his face he had forgotten that he had told arrango why does that bother you jaye because i wish you had told me everything i dont like secrets terry that asshole calls up and makes me feel like an asshole because im the last one to know this whats the difference whether you knew or not its kind of a conflict of interest isnt it no its not a conflict you ask me its an enhancement it makes me want to get this guy even more than you people is there something else thats bothering you is this about noone no its not about that i told you last night i stand behind doing it the captain gave me some grief already today but i still think we had to do it good so do i there was a tentative silence after that mccaleb still thought there was something else she wanted to say and he waited her out look just dont go off cowboying on this okay winston said what do you mean im not sure i just dont know what youve got planned and i dont want to have to worry about what youre up to because of your enhancement as you call it i understand its not even a point of contention jaye as ive said all along if i get something it goes to you guys thats still the plan okay then all right he was putting the phone down when he heard her voice by the way the bullet went to your man today hell get it tomorrow if he works saturdays if not monday good youll let me know if he gets something right hes going to tell you first you sent the package dont bullshit a bullshitter terry hes your man hes going to call you hopefully hell call me real quick after ill make sure he does again he was putting the phone down when he heard her so what are you going to do today he hadnt really thought about it well i dont know im not sure where to go id like to reinterview the witnesses on the gloria torres thing but arrango pretty much threatened me if i went near them so whats that leave i dont know i was thinking about just hanging around the boat today maybe take another run through the books and the tapes see if anything comes up i was quick on the first readthrough but not thorough well that sounds like a boring day almost as bad as mines going to be court again i wish trials in recess fridays that means i get to spend the day doing paper catching up and i better get started ill see you terry remember what you said youll call me first with the news you get the news he agreed she finally hung up and he flopped back on the bed the phone clutched to his stomach after a few minutes of trying to recall the dreams of the night before he lifted the phone and called information to get the number of the emergency room at holy cross after calling and asking for graciela rivers he waited nearly a minute before she picked up her voice was clipped and urgent he had obviously called at a bad time he almost hung up but guessed that she might figure out it was him hello im sorry i mustve caught you in the middle of something who is this its terry oh terry hi no its not a bad time i just thought it might be something about raymond i usually dont get calls here then im sorry i alarmed you its okay are you sick you dont sound like you i didnt even recognize your voice she forced a laugh into the phone he thought she felt embarrassed that she didnt know his voice im lying on my back he said you ever do that when youre calling in sick you know it makes you sound like you really are sick this time her laugh was legitimate no i never tried that ill have to remember sure its a good tip you can use it so whats up how are things going well on the case not so good i thought we had something yesterday but then we hit a bit of a stall im going to rethink things today okay i was calling because i was wondering about tomorrow you know whether you were thinking of bringing raymond down so i could take him out to the rocks the rocks the jetty theres good fishing off there i walk out most mornings and theres always people there lines out well raymond hasnt stopped talking about it since we left the other night so i was planning on it as long as its still all right with you mccaleb hesitated thinking about bolotov and wondering if he could possibly be a threat but he wanted to see graciela and the boy he felt a need to see them it sounds like maybe we should do it another time she said then no he said the specter of bolotov disappearing from his mind i was just thinking i want you to come down it will be fun and i could make up for that dinner i was supposed to cook the other night then good and you two should stay over ive got plenty of room two staterooms and the salon table collapses and becomes a third bed well well see i like to keep some constants in raymonds life like his bed i understand they talked about the arrangements a little further and she agreed to come down to the marina the following morning after hanging up he continued to lie in bed with the phone sitting on his stomach his thoughts were on graciela he liked being with her and the thought of spending all of saturday with her made him smile then the thought of bolotov intruded again mccaleb carefully considered the situation and decided that bolotov was not a threat most spoken threats were never carried out even if bolotov wanted to it would be difficult for him to find the following sea lastly the russian was no longer a suspect in the murders those thoughts led to the next question if he was not a suspect then why had he run mccaleb thought of winstons explanation the night before bolotov had not been the shooter but he was probably guilty of something he ran mccaleb put it aside rolled out of bed and finally got up after he had gotten one cup of coffee down mccaleb went down to the office and gathered up all of the reports and the tapes and brought them back up to the salon he then opened the slider to air out the boat and sat back down and began methodically going through all of the videotapes associated with the case twenty minutes later he was watching the shooting of gloria torres for the third time in a row when he heard buddy lockridges voice from behind him what the hell is that mccaleb turned around and saw lockridge standing in the open door of the salon he hadnt felt him come aboard he grabbed the remote and flicked off the television its a tape what are you doing here reporting for duty mccaleb stared blankly at him you told me yesterday youd need me this morning oh right well i dont think imim just going to work around here today i think you going to be around later if something comes up probly okay thanks mccaleb waited for him to leave but lockridge just stood there what is that what youre working on lockridge asked pointing at the tube yes buddy thats it but i cant talk to you about it its a private matter thats cool then what else um well whens payday payday what are you talkoh you mean for you oh anytime you need some money sort of i could use some today mccaleb went to the galley counter where he had left his wallet and keys as he was opening the wallet he computed that he had used buddy for no more than eight hours he took out six twenties and handed the bills to lockridge fanning the money in his hands buddy said it was too much some of its for gas mccaleb explained and the extra is for the hanging around and being on call that okay fine with me thanks terror mccaleb smiled lockridge had been calling him that ever since the night they met and mccaleb had been so mad about the harmonica noise lockridge finally left then and mccaleb got back to work nothing struck him as significant during his viewing of the videotapes and he went on to the paperwork on this readthrough time was not a factor and he tried to absorb every detail on every page he started backward beginning with the kangtorres case but as he went through the crime reports and investigative summaries he found nothing aside from the conflict in the timeline he had constructed earlier that tugged at him as being out of order or needing further investigation despite his dislike of arrangos personality and walterss complacency he couldnt find anything wrong or anything that had slipped through finally he came to the autopsy report and the grainy photocopies of the photos of gloria torress body he hadnt looked at these before with good reason death photos had always been the way he remembered victims he saw them in death not in life he saw what had been done to them during the first readthrough of the murder book he had decided that he didnt need to see the photos of gloria it wasnt what he wanted or needed to know about her but now grasping for anything he studied the photos the poor duplication of them by the photocopier made the details murky and softened the impact he leafed through them quickly and then came back to the first one it was glorias naked body on the steel table the photo taken before the autopsy a long incision made by the surgeon who took her organs ran between the breasts and down the sternum mccaleb held the photo in both hands and looked at her violated body for a long moment feeling a mixture of sadness and the heat of guilt the phone rang startling him he grabbed the phone before it could ring again yes terry its dr fox mccaleb inexplicably turned the photo over on the table are you there yes hi how are you im fine how are you im fine too doc what are you doing doing im just sort of sitting here terry you know what i mean what did you decide about that womans request the sister i uh he turned the photo back over and looked at it i decided i needed to look into it she didnt say anything but he pictured her at her desk closing her eyes and shaking her head im sorry he said im sorry too she said terry i really dont think you understand the risks of what you are doing i think i do doctor i dont think i have a choice anyway i dont think i have one either what do you mean i mean i dont think i can continue to be your doctor if this is what you are going to do you obviously dont value my advice or feel you should follow my instructions you are choosing this pursuit of yours over your health i cant be around while you do this are you firing me doc he laughed uneasily its not a joke maybe thats your problem you think its some sort of joke that youre invincible no i dont feel invincible well your words and actions dont match up on monday ill have one of my assistants gather your files and put together two or three cardiologists i can refer you to mccaleb closed his eyes look doc i i dont know what to say weve been together a long time dont you feel an obligation to see it through it goes two ways if i dont hear from you by monday ill have to assume you are going on with this ill have your records here at the office ready for you she hung up mccaleb sat still the phone still to his ear until it started blaring its hangup tone mccaleb got up and took a walk outside from the cockpit he surveyed the marina and the parking lot he saw no sign of buddy lockridge or anyone else the air was still he leaned over the stern and looked down into the water it was too dark to see bottom he spit into the water and with it went the misgivings he felt over foxs edict he decided he would not be swayed the photo was there on the table waiting for him when he got back he picked it up again and studied it once more this time his eyes traveling up the body to the face there was some kind of dark salve on the eyes and then he remembered that the eyes had probably been taken along with the internal organs he noticed the three small perforations running along the ridge of the left ear and down to the lobe on the right lobe there was only one he was about to put the photo aside when he realized that earlier he had read through a property report listing the items removed from the victim at the hospital and then turned over to police curious to make sure all details checked out he went back to the stack of paperwork and dug out the property report his finger ran down the list of clothing until he got to the subheading of jewelry jewelry timex watch three earrings crescent moon one silver hoop two rings birthstone silver he thought about this for a long moment remembering that on the video of the shooting it was clear that gloria torres was wearing a total of four earrings the hoop the crescent moon and the dangling cross on her left ear on her right ear there had been only a crescent moon this accounting did not fit with the property report which listed only three earrings nor did it jibe with the perforation marks clearly visible on glorias ears in the evidence photo he turned to the television thinking that he would look at the tape again but then stopped he was sure he did not imagine something like a cross somehow it was not accounted for a loose end he tapped his fingers on the property report trying to think about whether this was a notable detail or not what had happened to the cross earring why wasnt it on the list he checked his watch and saw it was ten minutes after twelve graciela would be at lunch he called the hospital and asked to be transferred to the main cafeteria when a woman answered he asked if it would be possible for her to go to the nurse seated at the table next to one of the windows and give her a message when the woman hesitated mccaleb described graciela and gave her name the woman on the phone reluctantly asked what the message was just tell her to call dr mccaleb as soon as she can about five minutes later he got the callback dr mccaleb sorry i had to do that so she would be sure to give you the message whats up well im going through the case files again and ive got a loose end here the property report says that they took two crescent moon earrings and a hoop earring off your sisters ears at the hospital after she was brought in right they would have needed to remove those for the cat scan they wanted to look at the wound track okay what about the cross earring she wore in her left ear theres nothing on the property report about she wasnt wearing it that night i always thought that was weird like it was bad luck because that was her favorite earring she usually wore it every day like a personal signature mccaleb said what do you mean she wasnt wearing it that night because when the police gave me her thingsyou know her watch and rings and earringsit wasnt there she wasnt wearing it are you sure in the video shes wearing it what video from the store she was silent a moment no that cant be i found it in her jewelry box i gave it to them at the funeral home so they could you know put it on for when she was buried now mccaleb was silent and then he put it together but wouldnt she have had two of them i dont know anything about crosses but dont you buy earrings in pairs oh youre right i didnt think about that so the one you found was the extra one he felt a stirring inside that he immediately recognized but hadnt felt in a long time i guess graciela said so if she did have one on in the store what happened to it thats what i want to find out but what does it matter anyway he was silent for a few moments thinking about how he should answer he decided that what he was thinking was too speculative at the moment to share with her its just a loose end that should be tied up let me ask you something was it the kind of earring that just hooked on or was there a hasp to make sure it didnt fall off easily you know what i mean i couldnt tell that from the video yes um i think there was like a hook that you sort of clipped after it was on your ear i dont think it would have fallen off while she was speaking mccaleb was looking through the stack for the paramedics report he ran his finger down the lines of the information box until he found the squad number and names of the two paramedics who had treated and transported gloria okay im gonna go he said are we still on for tomorrow sure um terry what you saw the video from the store i mean all of it you saw glory yes he said quietly i had to was she was she scared no graciela it was very quick she never saw it coming i guess thats good i think so listen are you going to be all right im fine okay then ill see you tomorrow the paramedics who had transported gloria worked out of fire station mccaleb called but the crew that had worked the night of january nd was off until sunday however the station captain told him that under department policy governing what are called crime transports any property left behind on a stretcher or found anywhere in an ambulance would have been turned over to police custody this meant that if this had occurred following the transport of gloria torres there would be a propertyreceived report in the murder book there wasnt the cross earring remained unaccounted for the irony that mccaleb carried inside of him alongside a strangers heart was the secret belief that he had been the wrong one saved it should have been someone else in the days and weeks before he received glorys heart he had been prepared for the end he had accepted it as the way it was to be he was long past believing in a godthe horrors he had seen and documented had little by little sapped his stores of faith until the only absolute he believed in was that there were no bounds to the evil acts of men and in those seemingly final days as his own heart withered and tapped out its final cadences he did not grasp desperately for his lost faith as a shield or a means of easing the fear of the unknown instead he was accepting of the end of his own nothingness he was ready it was easy to do when he had been with the bureau he was driven and consumed by a mission a calling and when he carried it out and was successful he knew he was making a difference better than any heart surgeon he was saving lives from horrible ends he was facing off against the worst kinds of evil the most malignant cancers and the battle though always wearing and painful gave his life its meaning that was gone the moment his heart deserted him and he fell to the floor of the field office thinking he had surely been stabbed in the chest it was still gone two years later when the pager sounded and he was told they had a heart for him he had a new heart but it didnt feel like a new life he was a man on a boat that never left port it didnt matter what stock quotes about second chances he had used with a newspaper reporter that existence was not enough for mccaleb that was the struggle he was facing when graciela rivers had stepped down off the dock and into his life the quest she had given him had been a way of avoiding his own inner struggle but now things were suddenly different the missing cross earring stirred something deep and dormant in him his long experience had given him true knowledge and instincts about evil he knew its signs this was one of them mccaleb had been to the sheriffs homicide bureau so often during the week that the receptionist just waved him back without a phone call or escort jaye winston was at her desk using a threehole punch on a thin stack of documents which she then slipped over the prongs of an open binder she snapped it closed and looked up at her visitor you moving in feels like it you get caught up on the paper instead of four months behind im only two whats going on i didnt think i was going to see you today you still upset about me holding that thing back water under the bridge she leaned back in her chair looked him over and waited for an explanation of why he was there ive sort of come up with something i think bears looking into he said is this about bolotov again no its something new dont become the boy who cried wolf on me mccaleb she smiled i wont then tell me he put his palms down on the desk and leaned over it so he could speak to her in a confidential tone there were still plenty of winstons colleagues around the bureau working at their desks and trying to get things done before the weekend arrango and walters missed something mccaleb said so did i on my first gothrough but i picked up on it this morning when i took a second look at the videos and the paperwork its something that has to be considered pretty seriously i think it changes things winston furrowed her eyebrows and looked at him seriously quit talking in circles what did they miss id rather show you than tell you he reached down to the floor and opened his leather satchel he pulled out the copy of the surveillance tape and held it up to her can we go look at this i guess so winston got up and led the way to the video room she turned the machines on and popped in the tape after looking at it and noting it was not one of the tapes she had given mccaleb on wednesday what is this its the surveillance from the market not the one i gave you its a copy im having somebody look at the other one what do you mean who a tech i knew when i was with the bureau im just trying to get some of the images enhanced not a big deal so what are you showing me she had the surveillance tape playing wheres the freeze winston pointed to a button on the console and mccaleb held his finger over it waiting for the right moment on the tape gloria torres approached the counter and smiled at kang then came the gunman and the shot that threw her body forward over the counter mccaleb froze the image and used a pen from his pocket to point at glorias left ear its pretty murky but on a blowup you can see she has three earrings on this ear he said then tapping the pen at each point on the ear he added a crescent moon on a stud a hoop and then dangling from the lobe a cross okay i cant really see it too well but ill take your word for it mccaleb hit the freeze button again and the video started playing he stopped it at the moment glorias body rebounded backward her head turning to the left right ear he said using the pen again to point just the matching crescent moon okay whats it mean he ignored the question and hit the button again the gun was fired gloria was hurled into the counter and then rebounded backward into the shooter holding her in front of him he fired at mr kang while stepping backward out of the cameras field of vision and lowering gloria to the ground the victim is then lowered down out of view of the camera what youre saying that was intentional exactly why he opened the satchel again and drew out the property report and handed it to winston thats the police property report on the victims possessions it was filled out at the hospital remember she was still alive they took her things there gave them to a patrol officer that is his report what dont you see winston scanned the page i dont know its just a list ofthe cross earring right its not there he took it the patrolman no the shooter the shooter took her earring a puzzled look came across winstons face she wasnt following the logic she hadnt had the same experiences or seen the same things that mccaleb had she didnt see it for what it was wait a minute she said how do you know he took it it could have just fallen off and gotten lost no ive talked to the victims sister and ive talked to the hospital and the paramedics he knew this was exaggerating his investigation into this aspect but he needed to pin winston down he couldnt give her a way out or a way to any other conclusion than his own conclusion the sister says the earring had a safety hasp it is unlikely that it fell off even if it did the paramedics didnt find it on the stretcher or in the ambulance and they didnt find it at the hospital he took it jaye the shooter besides if it was going to fall off despite the safety hasp it probably would have been when he fired the round you saw the impact on the head if the earring was going to come loose it would have been then only it didnt it was taken off okay okay what if he did take it im not saying i believe it yet but what are you saying it means it means everything changes it means this wasnt about a robbery she wasnt just an innocent nobody who walked into the wrong place at the wrong time it means she was a target she was prey oh come on she what are you trying to do turn this into a serial killer or something im not trying to turn it into anything it is what it is and its been that way all along only you peoplewe i meandidnt see it for what it was winston turned away from him and walked toward the corner of the room shaking her head she then turned back to him okay you tell me what youre seeing here because im just not seeing it id love to go to the lapd and tell those two jerks that they fucked up but im just not seeing what youre seeing okay lets start with the earring itself like i said i talked to the sister she said glory torres wore this particular earring every day she played around with the others switched them used different combinations but never the cross it was always there every day it had the obvious religious implications but for lack of a better description it was also her good luck charm okay you with me so far so far okay now lets just assume that the shooter took it like i said i talked to the hospital and the fire department and it hasnt showed up anywhere so lets assume he took it he opened his hands and held them up waiting winston reluctantly nodded her agreement so then lets look at that from two angles how and why the first one is easy remember the video he shot her and let her rebound off the counter and then fall back into him and then down to the floor outside the view of the camera he could take the earring then without being seen youre forgetting one thing whats that the good samaritan he wrapped her head up maybe he took it i thought about that its not beyond possibility but its less likely than it being the shooter the good samaritan is the random player in this why would he take it i dont know why would the shooter well like i said thats a question but look at the item that was taken a religious icon good luck charm she wore it every day it was a personality signature its personal significance more important than its monetary value he waited a beat he had just given her the setup now came the closing pitch winston was fighting on this but mccaleb hadnt lost sight of her skills as an investigator she would see what he was saying he was confident he would convince her someone who knew gloria would know the significance of the earring similarly someone who was close to her who had studied her over a period of days or longer could pick up on it as well youre talking about a stalker mccaleb nodded in the acquisition period he watches her learns her habits sets his plan hed also be looking for something a token something to take and to remember her by the earring he nodded again winston started pacing around the small room not looking at mccaleb ive got to think about this ive got lets go someplace where we can sit down she didnt wait for a reply she opened the door and left the room mccaleb quickly ejected the tape grabbed his bag and followed winston led him to the meeting room in which they had talked the first day mccaleb had come to see her about the case the room was empty but smelled like a mcdonalds restaurant winston hunted around found the offending trash can under the table and escorted it out into the hallway people arent supposed to eat in this room she said as she closed the door and sat down mccaleb took the seat across from her all right what about my guy how does james cordell fit in first of all hes a guy the others a girl plus there was no sex this woman wasnt touched none of that matters mccaleb said quickly he had been anticipating the question he had done nothing but think about the questions and their possible answers during the drive out with buddy lockridge from the marina if im right this would fall into what we called the power kill model basically its a guy who is doing it because he can get away with it he gets off on that its his way of thumbing his nose at authority and shocking society he transfers his problems with a particular situationwhether its a job selfworth women in general or his mother in particular or whateveronto the police the investigators from tweaking them he gets the jolt in selfworth that he needs he derives a form of power from it and it can be sexual power even if there are no obvious or physical sexual manifestations in the actual crime you remember the code killer out here a while back or berkowitz the son of sam killer in new york of course same thing with both of them there was no sex in each crime itself but it was all about sex look at berkowitz he shot people upmen and womenand ran away but he came back days later and masturbated at the scene we assumed the code killer did the same thing but if he did our surveillances missed him what im saying is that it doesnt have to be obvious jaye thats all its not always the obvious wackos who carve their names in peoples skin mccaleb watched winston closely leery of talking above her but she seemed to understand his theory but its not only that mccaleb went on theres another part to this he gets off on the camera too he likes us seeing him do it mccaleb nodded thats the new twist i think he wants the camera he wants his work and his accomplishments documented seen and admired it increases the danger to him and therefore increases the power reflection on him the payoff so to get that situation what does he do i think he picks up on a targethe chooses his preyand then watches them until he has their routine and he knows when it takes them into places of business where the cameras are the atm the market he wants the camera he talks to it he winks at it the camera is youthe investigator hes talking to you and getting off on it then maybe he doesnt choose the victim winston said maybe he doesnt care about that just the camera like berkowitz he didnt care who he shot he just went out shooting but berkowitz didnt take souvenirs the earring mccaleb nodded you see that makes it personal i think these victims were chosen not the other way around youve thought this all out havent you not everything i dont know how he chose them or why but ive been thinking about it yeah the whole hour and a half it took us to get out here traffic was bad us i have a driver i cant drive yet she didnt say anything mccaleb wished he hadnt mentioned the driver it was revealing a weakness we have to start over mccaleb said because we thought these people were chosen at random we thought the locations were chosen not the victims but i think its the other way around the victims were chosen they were prey specific targets that were acquired followed stalked weve got to background them theres got to be an intersection some commonality a person a place a moment in timesomething that hooks them either to each other or our unknown subject we find wait a minute wait a minute mccaleb stopped realizing his voice had been rising in fervor what souvenir was taken from james cordell are you saying the money he took from the atm is a token i dont know what was taken but it wasnt the money that was just part of the robbery show the money wasnt a symbolic possession besides he took it from the machine not cordell so then arent you jumping the gun no im sure something was taken we would have seen it we have the whole thing on video nobody picked up on it with gloria torres and that was on video too winston turned in her chair i dont know this still seems like alet me ask you something and try not to take it too personal but isnt it possible that youre just looking for what you always looked for before when you were with the bureau you mean like am i exaggerating like i want to get back to what i was doing before and this is my way of doing it winston hiked her shoulders she didnt want to say it i didnt go looking for this jaye its just there it is what it is sure the earring might mean something else and it might not mean anything at all but if there is anything i know about in this world it is this kind of thing these people i know them i know how they think and i know how they act i feel it here jaye the evil its here winston looked at him strangely and mccaleb guessed that maybe he shouldnt have been so fervent in his response to her doubts cordells truck the chevy suburban wasnt in the video did you process his truck i didnt see anything in the stack you gave me about no it wasnt touched he left his wallet open on the seat and just took his atm card to the machine if the shooter had gone into his truck he would have taken his wallet when we saw it still there we didnt bother mccaleb shook his head and said you are still looking at it from the point of view of a robbery the decision not to process the truck would have been okayif it had been a real robbery but what if it wasnt he wouldnt have gone into the truck and taken something as obvious as the wallet then what i dont know something else cordell used his truck a lot driving all day along the aqueduct it would be like a second home to him there could have been lots of things of a personal nature in there that the shooter couldve taken photos things hanging from the rearview maybe a travel diary you name it where is the truck make my day and tell me its still impounded no chance we released it to his wife a couple days after the shooting its probably been cleaned out and sold by now actually no the last time i talked to cordells wifewhich was only a couple weeks agoshe said something about not knowing what to do with the suburban it was too big for her and she said it gave her bad vibes now anyway she didnt use those words but you know what i mean a charge of excitement went through mccaleb then we go up there and look at the suburban and we talk to her and we figure out what was taken if something was taken winston frowned mccaleb knew what she was facing she already was dealing with a captain who after the hypnosis and bolotov fiascos probably thought she was being controlled too easily by an outsider she didnt want to have to go back to the man with mccalebs new theory unless she was sure it was deadsolid perfect and mccaleb knew it could never be that it never was what are you going to do he asked its like im in the car and ready to go are you getting in with me or staying on the sidewalk it had occurred to him that he was not constrained by such worries or by a job a role inertia or anything else either winston could get in the car or mccaleb could drive on without her she apparently realized the same thing no she said the question is what are you going to do youre the one who doesnt have to deal with the bullshit around here like i do after the hypnosis thing hitchens has been tell you what jaye i dont care about all of that i only care about one thingfinding this guy so look you sit tight and give me a few days ill come in with something ill go up to the desert and talk to cordells wife and take a look at the truck ill find something you can go to the captain with if i dont then ill eat my theory you can cut me loose and i wont bother you again look its not that youre both you know what i mean youve got court other cases the last thing you need is to have to overhaul on an old one i know how it is maybe coming in here today was premature i shouldve just gone up there and seen the widow but since its your case and youve treated me like a human i wanted to check with you first now you give me your blessing and a little time and ill go up on my own ill let you know what i get winston was silent for a long moment then finally she nodded okay you got it lockridge and mccaleb took a succession of freeways from whittier until they reached the antelope valley freeway which would finally take them to the northeast corner of the county lockridge drove onehanded most of the way holding a harmonica to his mouth with the other hand it didnt give mccaleb much of a feeling of safety but it cut out the meaningless banter as they passed vasquez rocks mccaleb studied the formation and pinpointed the spot where the body had been found that eventually led to his knowing jaye winston the slanted and jagged formation caused by tectonic upheaval was beautiful in the afternoon light the sun was hitting the front rock faces at a low angle and throwing the crevices into deep darkness it looked beautiful and dangerous at the same time he wondered if that was what had drawn luther hatch to it ever been there vasquez rocks buddy asked after tucking the harmonica between his legs yeah neat place its named after a mexican desperado who holed up in the crevices about a hundred years ago after robbing a bank or something so many places to hide in there they could never find him and he became a legend mccaleb nodded he liked the story he thought about how his histories of places were so different they always involved bodies and blood work no legends no heroes they made good time on the front of the wave of rush hour and weekend traffic out of the city and it was just past five when they got to lancaster they cruised through a subdivision called desert flower estates looking for the home where james cordell had lived mccaleb saw a lot of desert but not many flowers or homes that met his definition of estate the subdivision was built on land as flat and most days as hot as a frying pan the homes were spanish style with redbarrel roofs and arched windows and doors in the front there were dozens of matching developments scattered through the antelope valley the homes were large and reasonably attractive they were bought mostly by families escaping the expense and crime and crowding of los angeles desert flower estates had apparently offered three different design plans to its buyers consequently mccaleb noticed as they drove through about every third house was the same and sometimes there were even sidebyside duplicates it reminded him of some of the postworld war ii neighborhoods in the san fernando valley the thought of living in one of the homes he was passing depressed him and it wasnt because of anything he saw it was the distance this place was from the ocean and the feeling of renewal the sea gave him he knew hed never last in a neighborhood like this he would dry up and blow away like one of the tumbleweeds they periodically passed on the street this is it buddy said he pointed to a number on a mailbox and mccaleb nodded they pulled in mccaleb noticed that the white chevy suburban he had seen in the crime scene video was parked in the driveway below a basketball rim there was an open garage with a minivan parked on one side and the other side cluttered with bikes and boxes a tool bench and other clutter standing up in the back of the garage was a surf board it was an old long board and it made mccaleb think that maybe at one time james cordell had known something about the ocean i dont know how long ill be he said its going to get hot out here maybe i could just go in with you i wont say anything its cooling down buddy but if you get hot run the air drive around a little bit theres probably kids selling lemonade around here someplace he got out before any debate could begin he wasnt going to bring lockridge into the investigation and turn it into amateur hour on the way up the driveway he stopped and looked into the suburban the back was full of tools and there was clutter in the front seats hs felt a charge he might be in luck it looked as though the truck had been sitting untouched james cordells widow was named amelia mccaleb knew that from the reports a woman he assumed to be her opened the arched front door before he reached it jaye winston had said she would call ahead to smooth his way in mrs cordell yes my names terry mccaleb did detective winston call about me yes she did is this a bad time as opposed to a good time poor choice of words im sorry do you have some time that we can talk she was a short woman with brown hair and small features her nose was red and mccaleb guessed she either had a cold or had been crying mccaleb wondered if the call from jaye winston had set her off she nodded and invited him in leading the way to a neatly kept living room where she sat on the sofa and he took the chair opposite her there was a box of tissues on the coffee table between them the sound of television was coming from another room it sounded like cartoons were on is that your partner waiting in the car she asked uh my driver does he want to come in it might get hot out there no hes fine youre a private investigator technically no im a friend of the family of the woman who was killed in canoga park i dont know what detective winston told you but i used to work for the fbi and so i have some experience in these kinds of things the sheriffs department as you probably know and the lapd have not been able to uh advance the investigation very far in recent weeks im trying to do what i can to help she nodded first off im sorry about what happened to your husband and your family she frowned and nodded i know it doesnt matter what a stranger thinks but you do have my sympathy from what ive read in the sheriffs files james was a good man she smiled and said thank you its just so funny to hear him called james everyone called him jim or jimmy and you are right he was a good man mccaleb nodded what questions can i answer mr mccaleb i really dont know anything about what happened thats what was confusing about jayes call well first he reached down to his satchel opened it and took out the polaroid that graciela had given him the day she came to his boat he handed it across the table to amelia cordell could you look at that and tell me if you recognize the woman or if you think she might be someone your husband could have known she took the photo and stared at it her face serious and her eyes making small movements as she seemed to study everything about the photo she shook her head finally no i dont think so is she the one who yes she was the victim in the second robbery is that her son yes i dont understand how could my husband have known this womanare you suggesting that they might have no no im not suggesting anything mrs cordell im just trying to cover look to be very honest mrs cordell some things have come up in the investigation to possibly indicateand i have to stress possibly that there was more here than meets the eye meaning what meaning that possibly robbery was not a motive here or not the only motive she stared blankly at him for a moment and mccaleb knew she was still taking things the wrong way mrs cordell i am not in any way trying to suggest that your husband and that woman had any kind of a relationship what im saying is that somewhere sometime your husband and that woman crossed the shooters path so you see there is a relationship but it is a relationship between the victims and the shooter it is likely that your husband and the other victims crossed the shooters line at separate points but i need to cover everything and that is why i show you the photograph you are sure you dont recognize her im sure would your husband have any reason in the weeks before the shooting to have spent any time in canoga park not that i know of would he have had any dealings with the los angeles times more specifically any reason he would have gone to the newspapers plant in chatsworth again her answer was no was there any problem at work anything that he might have wanted to talk to a reporter about like what i dont know was she a reporter no but she worked where there were reporters maybe their paths crossed with the shooter there well i dont think so if something was bothering jimmy he would have told me he always did okay i understand mccaleb spent the next fifteen minutes asking mrs cordell questions about her husbands daily routine and his activities in the weeks before the shooting he took three pages of notes but even as he wrote them they didnt seem helpful jimmy cordell seemed like a man who worked hard and spent most of his off time with his family in the weeks before his death he had been working exclusively on sections of the aqueduct in the central part of the state and his wife did not believe he had spent any time at all to the south she did not think he had been down into the valley or other parts of the city since before christmas mccaleb folded his notebook closed i appreciate your time mrs cordell the last thing i wanted to ask about is whether or not any of your husbands possessions were missing his possessions what do you mean amelia cordell led mccaleb out to the chevy suburban they had already discussed her husbands clothing and jewelry nothing had been taken she assured him just as the atm video had seemed to attest that left the suburban no ones been in it he asked as she was unlocking it i drove it home from the sheriffs office that was actually the only time i ever drove it jimmy bought it for work only he said if we started using it for nonwork driving he couldnt write everything off i dont drive it because its too high up for me to be climbing in and out of all the time mccaleb nodded and leaned into the truck through the open drivers door the rear seat was folded down and the cargo area was full of surveying equipment a folding drafting table and other tools mccaleb quickly dismissed it all it was equipment not something of a personal nature he concentrated on the front section of the vehicle a patina of road dust covered everything cordell must have been driving in the desert with the windows down using one finger he opened a pocket on the door and saw it was crammed with service station receipts and a small spiral notebook on which cordell had noted mileage dates and destinations mccaleb took the notebook out and flipped through the pages to see if there had been any trips to the west valley particularly chatsworth or canoga park there were none recorded it appeared amelia cordell had been correct about her husband he flipped down the driverside visor and found two folded maps mccaleb walked them around to the front and opened them on the hood one was a gas station map of central california and another was a survey map that showed the aqueduct and its many access roads mccaleb was looking for any unusual notations cordell might have made on the maps but there were none he refolded them and put them back he now sat in the drivers seat and looked around he noticed the rearview mirror and asked amelia cordell if her husband had ever hung anything off it knickknacks or otherwise she said she didnt remember anything he checked the glove compartment and the center console there was more paperwork and several tapes for use in the stereo an assortment of pens and mechanical pencils and a pack of opened mail cordell liked country music nothing seemed amiss nothing came to mind do you know if he had any particular kind of pen or pencil he liked like a special pen he might have gotten as a gift or something i dont think so nothing i remember mccaleb took the rubber band off the mail and looked through the envelopes it appeared to be departmental mail notices of meetings reports on problems on the aqueduct that cordell was to check out mccaleb put the band back around the stack and placed it back in the glove box amelia cordell watched him silently in an open bin between the seats there was a pager and a pair of sunglasses cordell had been coming home at night when he stopped at the atm that explained why the glasses were not on but not the beeper mrs cordell do you know why his pager is here how come he wasnt wearing it she thought a moment and then said he usually didnt keep it on his belt for long rides because he said it was uncomfortable he said it dug into his kidneys he forgot it a few times you know left it in the car and missed his pages thats how i know why mccaleb nodded as he sat there thinking about what to check next the passenger door was suddenly opened and buddy lockridge looked in whats up mccaleb had to squint to look at him because of the sun coming into the car over buddys shoulder im almost done buddy why dont you wait in the car my ass was getting sore he looked past mccaleb and nodded at amelia cordell sorry maam mccaleb was annoyed by the intrusion but introduced lockridge as his associate to amelia cordell so what are we looking for buddy asked we im just looking for something thats not here why dont you wait in the car like something that mightve been taken i see he flipped down the passengerside visor mccaleb had already checked it and there was nothing there i got it buddy why dont you what went there a picture he pointed toward the dashboard mccaleb followed the line of his finger but didnt see anything what are you talking about there see the dust looks like a picture or something maybe he kept a parking pass there until he needed it mccaleb looked again but still didnt see what lockridge was pointing at and talking about he shifted to his right and leaned toward buddy and then turned his head back to look at the dashboard now he saw it a coat of driving dust had settled on the clear plastic guard over the display of speedometer and other gauges on one side of the plastic there was a clearly defined square where there was no dust something had been propped on the plastic guard until recently mccaleb realized how lucky he was he probably would never have noticed it it only became apparent when viewed from the passenger side and with the sun coming in at a low angle mrs cordell mccaleb said can you walk around and look at this through the other door he waited lockridge stepped out of the way so she could look in mccaleb pointed to the outline on the plastic guard it was about five inches wide by three inches deep did your husband keep a picture of you or the kids here she shook her head slowly boy i dont really know he had pictures but i just dont know where he put them he could have but i dont know i never drive this we always take the caravaneven when just jim and i would go out like i said i didnt like climbing up there mccaleb nodded is there anyone he worked with who might know who might have ridden with him to jobs or to lunch that sort of thing driving on the antelope valley freeway back toward the city they passed a seemingly neverending line of cars stacked in the lanes going the other way commuters heading home or travelers getting out of the city for the weekend mccaleb barely noticed he was deep in his own thoughts he barely even heard lockridge until he repeated himself twice im sorry what i said i guess i helped you out back there noticing that you did buddy i might not have noticed it but i still wish you had stayed in the car this is all im paying you for to drive with a double hand gesture mccaleb indicated the car yeah well you might still be back there looking if i had stayed in the car well never know now so arent you going to tell me what you found out nothing buddy i didnt find out anything he had lied amelia cordell had taken him back inside and allowed him to use her phone to call her husbands office buddy had been sent back to the car to wait inside mccaleb talked to james cordells supervisor who gave him the names and numbers of some of the aqueduct maintenance supervisors cordell would have been working with in early january mccaleb then called the lone pine aqueduct station and talked to maggie mason who was one of those supervisors she reported that she had joined cordell for lunch twice in the week before the shooting both times cordell had driven avoiding the leading question mccaleb had asked her if she had noticed anything of a personal nature on the dashboard of the suburban without hesitation mason said there had been a photograph of cordells family on the dashboard she said she had even leaned over to get a look at it she remembered that it was cordells wife holding their two little daughters on her lap as they were heading home mccaleb felt a mix of dread and excitement growing inside someone somewhere had gloria torress earring and james cordells family photo he now knew that the evil of these two killings came together in the form of a person who killed not for money not out of fear and not for revenge against his victims this evil went far beyond that this person killed for pleasure and to fulfill a fantasy that burned like a virus inside his brain evil was everywhere mccaleb knew that better than most but he also knew that it could not be confronted in the abstract it needed to be embodied in flesh and blood and breath to be a person who could be hunted down and destroyed mccaleb had that now he felt his heart rise up in rage and a horrible joy the saturday morning mist came in thick and felt like a gentle hand on the back of his neck mccaleb had gotten up by seven so that he could get into the laundry in the marinas commons building and use several of the machines at once to get all of the bed clothes cleaned then he set about getting the boat cleaned up and ready for overnight guests but as he worked he found it hard to concentrate on the chores in front of him he had talked to jaye winston when he got in from the desert the evening before when he told her about the photo that was missing from cordells suburban she grudgingly agreed that mccaleb might be onto a viable new lead an hour later she called back and said a meeting was set for am monday at the star center she and her captain and a few other sheriffs detectives would be there so would arrango and walters so would maggie griffin from the fbi griffin was the agent who had taken mccalebs place in the vicap slot in the la field office mccaleb only knew her by her reputation which was good and that was the problem first thing monday morning mccaleb would be on the hot seat the focus of intense scrutiny most if not all of those in the meeting at the star center would be nonbelievers but rather than prepare for the meeting or do what additional investigation he could mccaleb was going fishing on the jetty with a woman and a little boy it didnt sit right with him and he kept thinking he should cancel the visit from graciela and raymond in the end he didnt it was true that he needed to talk with graciela but more than that he found that he just wanted to be with her and that was what brought the twin paths of his uneasy thoughts to an intersection guilt over putting the investigation aside and guilt over his desire for a woman who had come to him for his help when he was done with the laundry and the general cleanup he walked over to the marina center at the store he bought the makings of the evenings dinner at the bait shop he bought a bucket of live bait choosing shrimp and squid and a small rodandreel outfit that he planned to present to raymond as his own back at the boat he put the rod in one of the gunwale holders and dumped the bait bucket into the live well he then put away the store items in the galley he was finished and the boat was ready by ten seeing no sign of gracielas convertible in the parking lot he decided to walk over and check with buddy lockridge about his availability on monday morning he first went up to the gate and made sure it was propped open so graciela and the boy could enter the marina then he went to lockridges boat adhering to marina custom mccaleb did not step onto the doubledown instead he called lockridges name and waited on the dock the boats main hatch was open so he knew lockridge was awake and around somewhere after half a minute buddys disheveled hair followed by his crumpled face poked up through the hatch mccaleb guessed he had spent a good part of the night drinking yo terry yo you okay fine as always whats up we going somewhere no not today but i need you monday morning early can you drive me out to the star center i mean like weve got to leave by seven buddy thought a moment to see if it fit with his busy schedule and nodded its a go youre going to be all right to drive you bet whats going on at the star center just a meeting but ive got to be there on time dont worry about a thing we leave at seven ill set the alarm okay and one other thing keep an eye out around here you mean the guy from the clock plant yeah i doubt hell show but you never know hes got tattoos running up both arms and theyre big arms youll know him if you see him ill be on the lookout looks like youve got a couple visitors right now mccaleb saw that lockridge was looking past him he turned and looked back at the following sea graciela was standing in the stern she was lifting raymond down into the boat i gotta go bud ill see you monday graciela was wearing faded blue jeans and a dodgers sweatshirt with her hair up under a matching baseball cap she had a duffel bag slung over her shoulder and was carrying a grocery bag raymond was wearing blue jeans and a kings hockey sweater he also had on a baseball cap and carried with him a toy fire truck and an old stuffed animal that looked to mccaleb like a lamb mccaleb gave graciela a tentative hug and shook raymonds hand after the boy stuck his stuffed animal under his other arm good to see you guys he said ready to catch some fish today raymond the boy seemed too shy to answer graciela nudged the boy on the shoulder and he nodded in agreement mccaleb took the bags led them into the boat and gave them the complete tour he had not shown them on their earlier visit along the way he left the grocery bag in the galley and put the duffel bag down on the bed in the main stateroom he told graciela it was her room and the sheets were freshly washed he then showed raymond the upper bunk in the forward stateroom mccaleb had moved most of the boxes of files under the desk and the room seemed neat enough for the boy there was a guard bar on the bunk so that he wouldnt roll out of bed when mccaleb told him it was called a berth his face scrunched up in confusion thats what they call beds on boats raymond he said and they call the bathroom the head how come you know i never asked he led them to the head and showed them how to use the foot pedal for flushing he noticed graciela looking at the temperature chart on the hook and he told her what it was for she put her finger on the line from thursday you had a fever a slight fever it went away what did your doctor say i didnt tell her yet it went away and im fine she looked at him with a mixture of concern and he thought annoyance he then realized how important it probably was to her that he survive she didnt want her sisters last gift to be for nothing dont worry he said im fine i was just doing a little too much running around that day i took a long nap and the fever was gone ive been okay since he pointed to the slashes on the chart following the one fever reading raymond pulled on his pants leg and said where do you sleep mccaleb glanced briefly at graciela and turned toward the stairs before she could see his face start to color come on up ill show you when they got back up to the salon mccaleb explained to raymond how he could turn the galley table into a single berth the boy seemed satisfied so lets see what you got mccaleb said he started going through gracielas grocery bag and putting things away their agreement was that she would make lunch he would do the same with dinner she had gone to a deli and it looked like they were going to have submarine sandwiches howd you know that subs were my favorite he asked i didnt graciela said but theyre raymonds too mccaleb reached over and caught raymond in the ribs again with a finger and the boy recoiled with a giggle well while graciela makes sandwiches to take with us why dont you come out and help me with the equipment we have fish out there waitin for us okay as he ushered the boy out to the stern he looked back at graciela and winked out on the deck he presented raymond with the rod and reel he had bought him when the boy realized the outfit was his to keep he grabbed onto the pole as if it were a rope being dropped to him by a rescue squad it made mccaleb feel sad instead of good he wondered whether the young boy had ever had a man in his life mccaleb looked up and saw graciela standing in the open door to the salon she also had a sad look on her face even though she was smiling at them mccaleb decided they had to break away from such emotions okay he said bait weve got to fill a bucket cause ive got a feeling theyre going to be biting out there today he got the floating bucket and dipping net out of the compartment next to the live well and then showed raymond how to dip the net into the well and bring up the bait he put a couple netfuls of shrimp and squid into the bucket and then turned the chore over to raymond he then went inside to get the tackle box and a couple more rods for himself and graciela to use when he was inside and out of earshot of the boy graciela came up to him and hugged him that was very nice of you she said he held her eyes for a few moments before saying anything i think maybe it does more for me than him hes so excited she said i can tell he cant wait to catch something i hope he does they walked out along the marinas main dock past the stores and restaurant and then crossed a parking lot until they came to the main channel into the citys marinas there was a crushedgravel path here and it led them out to the mouth of the channel and the breakwater a rock jetty that curved out into the pacific for a hundred yards they carefully stepped from one huge granite slab to another until they were about halfway out raymond this is my secret spot i think we should try it right here there was no objection mccaleb put down his equipment and set to work getting ready to fish the rocks were still wet from the nightly assault of high seas mccaleb had brought towels and walked about the spot looking for flat rocks that would make good seats he spread the towels out and told graciela and raymond to sit down he opened the tackle box took out the tube of sun block and handed it to graciela he then started baiting lines he decided to put the squid on raymonds rig because he thought it would be the best bait and he wanted the boy to catch the first fish fifteen minutes later they had three lines in the water mccaleb had taught the boy how to cast his line out leave the reel open and let the squid swim with it in the current what will i catch he inquired his eyes on his line i dont know raymond a lot of fish out there mccaleb took a rock directly next to gracielas the boy was too nervous to sit and wait he danced with his pole from rock to rock anxiously waiting and hoping i shouldve brought a camera graciela whispered next time mccaleb said you see that he was pointing across the water to the horizon the bluish outline of an island could be seen rising in the far mist catalina yeah thats it its weird i cant get used to the idea of you having lived on an island well i did how did your family end up here they were from chicago my father was a ballplayer baseball one springit was nineteen fiftyhe got a tryout with the cubs they used to come out to catalina for spring training the wrigleys owned the cubs and most of the island so they came out here my father and my mother were high school sweethearts they had gotten married and he got this chance to go for the cubs he was a shortstop and second baseman anyway he came out here but didnt make the team but he loved the place he got a job working for the wrigleys and he sent for her his plan was to end the story there but she prompted more out of him then you came a little while later but your parents didnt stay my mother didnt she couldnt take the island she stayed ten years and that was enough it can be claustrophobic for some people anyway they split up my father stayed and he wanted me with him i stayed my mother went back to chicago she nodded what did your father do for the wrigleys a lot of things he worked on their ranch then he worked up at the house they kept a sixtythreefoot chriscraft in the harbor he got a job as a deckhand and eventually he skippered that for them finally he got his own boat and put it out for charter he was also a volunteer fireman he smiled and she smiled back and the following sea was his boat his boat his house his business everything the wrigleys financed him he lived on the boat for about twelve years until he got so sick theyi mean me i was the onei took him over town to the hospital he died over here in long beach im sorry it was a long time ago not for you he looked at her its just that at the end there comes a time when everybody knows he knew there was no chance and he just wanted to go back over there to his boat and the island i wouldnt do it i wanted to try everything every goddamn marvel of science and medicine and besides if he was over there it would be a hassle for me to get out to see him id have to take the ferry i made him stay in that hospital he died alone in his room i was down in san diego on a case mccaleb looked out across the water he could see a ferry heading toward the island i just wish i had listened to him she reached her hand over and put it on his forearm there is no sense in being haunted by good intentions he glanced over at raymond the boy had settled down and was standing still looking down at his reel while a steady torrent of line was being pulled out mccaleb knew that a squid didnt have that kind of pulling power hey wait a minute raymond i think youve got something there he put his rod down and went to the boy he flipped the reels bail over and the line caught almost immediately the pole was pulled down and almost out of the boys hands mccaleb grabbed it and held it up you got one hey i got one i got one remember what i told you raymond pull back reel down pull back reel down ill help you with the pole until we tire that boy out it feels like a big one you okay yeah with mccaleb doing most of the pulling up on the pole they began to fight the fish meantime mccaleb directed graciela to reel in the other lines to avoid a tangle with the live line mccaleb and the boy fought the fish for about ten minutes all the while mccaleb could feel through the pole the fight slipping out of it as it tired finally he was able to turn the pole over to raymond so he could finish the job himself mccaleb slipped on a pair of gloves from the tackle box and climbed down the rocks to the waters edge just a few inches below the surface he saw the silvery fish weakly struggling against the line mccaleb kneeled on the rock getting his shoes and pants wet and leaned out until he could grab hold of raymonds line he tugged the fish forward and brought its mouth up reached into the water and locked a gloved hand around the tail just forward of the back fins he then yanked the fish out of the water and climbed back up the rocks to raymond the fish was shining in the sun like polished metal barracuda raymond he said holding it up look at those teeth the day had gone well raymond caught two barracudas and a white bass the first fish had been the biggest and most exciting though the second was hooked while they were eating lunch and almost pulled the unattended pole into the water after they got back in the late afternoon graciela insisted that raymond rest before dinner and took him down to the forward stateroom mccaleb used the time to spray off the fishing equipment with the stern hose when graciela came back up and they were alone sitting on chairs on the deck he felt a physical craving for a cold beer that he could just sit back and enjoy that was wonderful graciela said of the outing to the jetty im glad think youre going to stay for dinner of course he wants to stay over too he loves boats and i think he wants to fish again tomorrow youve created a monster mccaleb nodded thinking about the night ahead a few minutes of easy silence went by while they watched the other activities in the marina saturdays were always busy days mccaleb kept his eyes moving having guests made him more alert for the russian even though hed decided the chances of bolotov showing up were slim hed had the upper hand in tolivers office if he had wanted to harm mccaleb he could have done it then but thoughts of bolotov brought the case intruding he remembered a question hed thought of for graciela let me ask you something he said you first came to me last saturday but the story about me ran a week before that why did you wait a week i didnt really i didnt see the article a friend of glorys from the paper called up and said he saw it and wondered if you know you couldve been the one who got her heart then i went to the library and read the story i came here the next day he nodded she decided it was her turn to ask a question those boxes down there what boxes stacked under the desk are they your cases theyre old files i recognize some of the names written on them the article mentioned some of them luther hatch i remember him and the code killer why did they call him that because heif it was a heleft messages for us or sent messages to us that always had the same number at the bottom what did it mean we never found out the best people at the bureau and even the encryption people at the national security agency couldnt crack it personally i didnt think it meant anything at all it wasnt a code it was just another way for the unsub to tweak us keep us chasing our tails nineohthree fourseventwo fivesixeight thats the code thats the number like i said i dont think there was any code is that what they decided in washington too no they never gave up on it they were sure it meant something they thought it might be the guys social security number you know scrambled around with their computer they printed out every combination and then got all the names from social security hundreds of thousands they ran them all through the computers looking for what criminal records profile matches it was one big wildgoose chase the unsub wasnt on the list what is unsub unknown subject thats what we called each one until we caught him we never caught the code killer mccaleb heard the faint sound of a harmonica and looked over at the doubledown lockridge was down below practicing spoonful was he the only one of your cases where that happened you mean where the guy was never caught no unfortunately a lot of them get away but the code case was personal i guess he sent letters to me he resented me for some reason what did he do to the people he the code killer was unusual he killed in many different ways and with no discernible pattern men women even one small child he shot he stabbed he strangled there was no handle then how did you know it was him each time he told us the letters the code left at the crime scenes you see the victims and who they were didnt matter they were only objects by which he could exercise power and stick it in the face of authority he was an authoritycomplex killer there was another killer the poet he was a traveler was active across the country a few years ago i remember he got away here in la right right he was an authority killer too see you strip away their fantasies and their methods and a lot of these people are very much alike the poet got off on watching us flailing around the code killer was the same way he liked to tweak the cops every chance he got then he just stopped he either died or went to jail for something else or he moved somewhere else and started a new routine but its not something these guys can just turn off and what did you do in the luther hatch case just my job look we should talk about something else dont you think im sorry its okay i just i dont know i dont like all of those old stories he had wanted to talk to her about her sister and the latest developments but now it didnt seem like the right time he let the opportunity pass for dinner mccaleb grilled hamburgers and barracuda steaks raymond seemed enthusiastic about eating the fish he had caught but then didnt like the strong taste of the barracuda neither did graciela though mccaleb didnt think it was bad the meal was followed with another walk to the icecream store and then a walk along the shops on cabrillo way it was dark by the time they got back to the boat the marina was quiet again raymond got the bad news from graciela raymond its been a long day and i want you to go to sleep she said gently if youre good you can fish some more tomorrow before we leave the boy looked at mccaleb seeking either confirmation or an appeal shes right raymond he said in the morning ill take you back out there well catch some more fish okay in a cranky tone the boy agreed and graciela took him down to his room his parting request was that he be allowed to take his fishing pole to his room with him there was no objection to that mccaleb had secured the hook on one of the poles eyelets mccaleb had two space heaters on the boat and he set them up in each of their rooms he knew that at night it could get cold on the boat no matter how many blankets you had on what are you going to use graciela asked him ill be fine im going to use my sleeping bag ill probably be warmer than both of you you sure im sure he left them down there and went topside to wait for graciela he poured the last of the sanford pinot noir he had opened on her first visit into her glass he took that and a can of coke out to the stern she joined him after ten minutes it gets cold out here she said yeah do you think hell be all right with that heater yes hes fine he fell asleep almost as soon as he hit the pillow he handed her the glass of wine and she tapped it against his coke thank you she said he had a wonderful time today im glad he tapped his coke against her glass he knew that at some point he needed to finally talk about the investigation with her but he didnt want to spoil the moment once again he put it off who is that girl in the picture down on your desk what girl it looks like a photo from a yearbook or something its taped to the wall over the desk in raymonds room oh its just its just somebody i always want to remember somebody who died you mean like a case or someone you knew a case the code killer no long before that what was her name aubreylynn what happened something that shouldnt happen to anybody lets not talk about it right now okay im sorry its all right i should have taken that thing down before raymond came anyway mccaleb didnt get into the sleeping bag he just draped it over his body and lay on his back with his hands laced behind his head he knew he should be tired but he wasnt many thoughts raced through his mind from the mundane to the gutwrenching he was thinking about the heater in the boys berth he knew it was safe but he worried about it anyway the talk earlier in the day also resurfaced in a strand of thoughts about his father in the hospital bed once more he wished he had brought the old man home to die he remembered taking the boat out after the ceremony at descanso beach and circling catalina parceling out the ashes a little at a time so that they lasted until he had come all the way around the island but those memories and concerns were only distractions from his thoughts of graciela the evening had ended on a wrong note after she had brought up aubreylynn showitz the memory had knocked mccaleb off stride and he stopped talking he was infatuated with graciela he wanted her and had hoped the evening would end with them together but he had let the grim memories intrude and it spoiled the moment he felt the boat gently rise and fall as the tide rolled in he exhaled loudly hoping to expel the demons he readjusted himself on the thin cushion there was a seam down the middle of the makeshift bed and he couldnt get comfortable he thought about getting up for some orange juice but worried that if he had a glass there might not be enough left for raymond and graciela in the morning finally he decided to go down and check the vitals the old standby for killing time it would give him something to do maybe make him tired and finally able to sleep he had plugged a nightlight into the circuit over the sink in case raymond had to get up and find the toilet he decided not to turn on the overhead fixture and stood there in the dim light with the thermometer under his tongue he looked at his shadowy reflection and saw that the circles beneath his eyes were becoming more pronounced he had to lean over the sink and hold the thermometer close to the nightlight in order to read it it looked like he had a slight fever he took the clipboard off the hook and wrote the date and time and instead of a slash as he replaced the clipboard he heard the door of the master stateroom open across the passageway he had never closed the door to the head he looked across the dark hallway and saw gracielas face peering around the edge of her door the rest of her body she hid behind the door they spoke in whispers are you okay yes you im fine what are you doing i couldnt sleep i was just checking my temperature do you have a fever no im fine he nodded as he said it he became aware he was wearing only his boxer shorts he folded his arms and raised one hand to rub his chin but he was really just trying to hide the ugly scar on his chest they looked at each other in silence for a moment mccaleb realized he had been holding his hand to his chin too long he dropped his arms to his sides and watched her as her eyes fell to his chest graciela he didnt finish she had slowly opened the door and he could see she wore a pink silk sleep shirt cut high on her hips she was beautiful in it for a moment they just stood there and looked at each other graciela still held the door as if to steady herself against the boats slight movements after another moment she took a step into the hallway and he took a step to meet her he reached forward and traced his hand gently up her side and then around to her back with his other hand he caressed her throat and moved to the back of her neck he pulled her into him can you do this she whispered her face pressed into his neck nothings going to stop me he whispered back they moved into the stateroom and shut the door he left his shorts on the floor and crawled onto the bed with her as she unbuttoned the nightshirt the sheets and blanket already had her smell the vanilla he had noticed once before he moved on top of her and she pulled him down into a long kiss he worked his face down to her chest and kissed her breasts his nose found the spot just below her neck where she had touched the perfume to her skin the deep musky vanilla filled him and he moved his lips back up to hers graciela moved her hand in between their bodies and held her warm palm against his chest he felt her body tense and he opened his eyes in a whisper she said wait terry wait he froze and lifted himself up with one arm what is it he whispered i dont think it doesnt feel right to me im sorry whats not right im not sure she turned her body underneath him and he had no choice but to get off her graciela its not you terry its me im i just dont want to rush i want to think about things she was on her side looking away from him is it because of your sister because i have her no its not that well maybe a little i just think we should think about it more she reached back and caressed his cheek im sorry i know it was wrong to invite you in and then do this its okay i dont want you to do something you might be unhappy about later ill go back up he made a move to slide toward the foot of the bed but she grabbed his arm no dont leave not yet lie here with me i dont want you to leave yet he moved back up the bed and put his head on the pillow next to hers it was an odd feeling though obviously rejected he felt no anxiety about it he felt that the time would come for them and he could wait mccaleb began wondering how long he could stay with her before having to return to his sleeping bag tell me about the girl she said what he replied confused the girl in the yearbook picture on your desk its not a nice story graciela why do you want to know that story because i want to know you that was all she said but mccaleb understood he knew that if they were to become lovers they had to share their secrets it was part of the ritual he remembered years before how on the night he first made love to the woman who would become his wife she had told him that she had been sexually abused as a child her sharing of such a carefully held and guarded secret had touched him more deeply than the actual physical act of their making love he always remembered that moment cherished it even after the marriage was over all of this was put together from witnesses and physical evidence and the video he began what video ill get to that it was a florida case this was before i was sent out here a whole family abducted mother father two daughters the showitz family aubreylynn the girl in the photo she was the youngest how old she had just turned fifteen on the vacation they were from the midwest a little town in ohio and it was their first family vacation they didnt have a lot of money the father owned a little auto garagethere was still grease under his nails when they found him mccaleb blew his air out in a short laughthe kind a person makes when something isnt funny but he wished it were so they were on a cutrate vacation and they did disney world and all of that and they eventually got down to fort lauderdale where they stayed in one room in this little shitty motel by the i freeway they had made the reservation from ohio and thought because the place was called the sea breeze it was near the ocean his voice caught because he had never spoken the story out loud every detail about it was pitiful and made him hurt inside anyway when they got there they decided to stay they were only going to be in town a couple days and theyd lose their deposit if they left for a beach hotel so they stayed and on their first night there one of the girls spots this pickup in the lot that was attached to a trailer with an airboat on it you know what an airboat is like with an airplane propeller and it goes in the swamp out there right the everglades i saw them on cnn when that plane crashed into the swamp and disappeared yeah same thing but this girl and her family had never seen one other than on tv or in a magazine and so they were looking it over and a manthe ownerjust happens to walk up to them hes a friendly guy and he tells the family that hell take em on out for a real florida airboat ride if they want graciela turned her face into the crook of his neck and pressed a hand against his chest she knew where the story was going so they said okay i mean they were from some town in ohio with only one high school they didnt know anything about the real world so they went ahead and accepted this mansthis strangersinvitation and he killed them all of them mccaleb said nodding in the dark they went out with him and they never came back the father was found first a couple nights later his body was found by a frogger working the grass it wasnt too far from a ramp where they launch those boats hed been shot once in the back of the head and dumped off the boat what about the girls it took the local sheriffs a couple days to id the father and trace him to the sea breeze when there was no sign there of the wife and kids and they werent back in ohio the sheriffs went back out into the glades with helicopters and more airboats they found the three other bodies about six miles out the middle of nowhere a spot the airboaters call the devils keep the bodies were there he had done things to all three of them then he tied them to concrete blocks and threw them over while they were alive they drowned oh god god wasnt anywhere around that day decomposition gases eventually made the bodies float to the top even with the concrete blocks attached after a long moment of silence he continued about that time the bureau was called in and i went down there with another agent named walling there wasnt a whole lot to go on we worked up a profilewe knew it was somebody very familiar with the glades most of its three feet deep anywhere you stop out there but the women were dropped in a deep spot he didnt want them found he had to have known about that spot the devils keep it was like a sinkhole or a meteorite crater he had to have been out there before to have known about it mccaleb was staring through the darkness at the ceiling but what he was seeing was his own private and horrible version of the events that took place at the devils keep it was a vision that was never far from memory always in the dark reaches of his mind he had stripped them taken their jewelry anything that would id them but in aubreylynns hand when they pried it open there was a silver necklace with a crucifix she had somehow hidden it from him and held on to it probably praying to her god until the end mccaleb thought about the story and the hold it had on him its resonance still moved through his life all these years later like the incoming tide that gently lifted the boat in an almost rhythmic pattern the story was always there he knew he didnt need to display the photo above his desk like a holy card he would never be able to forget the face of that girl he knew that his heart had started to die with that girls face did they catch that man graciela asked she had just heard the story for the first time and already needed to know someone had paid for the horrible crime she needed the closure she didnt understand as mccaleb did that it didnt matter that there was never closure on a story like this no they never caught him they went through the registry at the sea breeze and ran everybody down there was one person they never found he had registered as earl hanford but it was a phony the trail ended there until he sent the video a beat of silence passed it was sent to the sheriffs lead detective the family had a video camera they took it with them on the airboat trip the tape starts with lots of happy scenes and smiles disney world the beach then some of the glades then the killer started taping everything he wore a black hood over his face so we couldnt id him he never showed enough of the boat to help us either he knew what he was doing you watched it mccaleb nodded he disengaged from graciela and sat on the side of the bed his back to her he had a rifle they did what he wanted all sorts of things the two sisters together other things and he killed them anyway heah shit he shook his head and rubbed his hands harshly over his face he felt her warm hand on his back the blocks he tied them to werent enough to take them right down they struggled you know on the surface he watched and taped it it got him aroused he was masturbating while he watched them drown he heard graciela crying quietly he lay back down and put an arm around her the tape was the last we ever heard from him he said hes out there somewhere another one he looked at her in the darkness not sure if she could see him thats the story im sorry you have that to carry around and now you have it im sorry too she rubbed the tears away from her eyes thats when you stopped believing in angels isnt it he nodded an hour or so before dawn mccaleb got up and went back to his uncomfortable bed in the salon they had spent the night until that point talking in whispers holding and kissing but never making love once back in his sleeping bag sleep still did not come to him mccalebs mind kept running over the details of the hours he had just spent with graciela the touch of her warm hands on his skin the softness of her breasts against his lips the taste of her lips and during moments when his mind wandered from these sensual memories he also thought about the story he had told her and the way she had reacted in the morning they did not talk about what had happened in the stateroom or what had been said even when raymond had gone out to the stern to look into the live well and was out of earshot graciela seemed to act as if there had been no rendezvous consummated or not and mccaleb acted in kind the first thing he spoke of while he scrambled eggs for the three of them was the case i want you to do something for me when you get home today he said checking over his shoulder to make sure raymond was still outside i want you to think about your sister and write down as much as you can about her routines i mean like places she would go friends she would see anything you can think of she did between the first of the year and the night she went into that store also i want to talk to her friends and boss at the times it might be better if you set that up all right how come because things are changing about the case remember i asked you about the earring mccaleb told her his belief that it had been the shooter who had taken the earring he also told her how he had found out late friday that something of a personal nature had been taken from the victim in the first shooting as well what was it a photo of his wife and kids what do you think it means that maybe these werent robberies that maybe this man at the atm and then your sister were picked for some other reason theres a chance they might have had some prior interaction with the man who shot them you know crossed paths with him somewhere thats why i want you to do this the wife of the first victim is doing it for me with her husband ill look at the two of them together and see if there are any commonalities graciela folded her arms and leaned against the galley counter you mean like they did something to this man to cause this no i mean that they crossed paths and something about them attracted him to them theres no valid reason i think were looking for a psychopath there is no telling what caught his eye why he chose these two people out of the nine million others who live in this county she slowly shook her head in disbelief what do the police say about all of this i dont think the lapd even knows yet and the sheriffs investigator is not sure whether or not she sees it the way i do were all going to talk about it tomorrow morning what about the man what man the store owner maybe he was the one who crossed the path maybe glory had nothing to do with it mccaleb shook his head and said no if he was the target the shooter would have just gone in and shot him when nobody else was in the store it was your sister your sister and the first man up in lancaster there is some connection we have to find it mccaleb reached into the back pocket of his jeans and pulled out a photo amelia cordell had given him it showed james cordell in closeup a bright smile on his face he showed the photo to graciela do you recognize this man is he someone that your sister might have known she took the photo from him and studied it but then shook her head not that i know of is he the man from lancaster mccaleb nodded and took the photo back he put it in his pocket then told graciela to go get raymond to come inside for his breakfast as she got to the sliding door he stopped her graciela do you trust me she looked back at him of course then trust me about this i dont care if the lapd and the sheriffs dont believe me but i know what i know with or without them im going to keep pushing on this she nodded and turned back to the door and the boy out in the stern the detective bureau at the sheriffs departments star center was crowded with detectives when mccaleb entered at eight oclock on monday morning however the receptionist who had let him walk back to homicide on his own just three days earlier told him he had to wait for the captain this puzzled mccaleb but before he could ask about it the receptionist was on the phone making a call as soon as she hung up mccaleb saw captain hitchens emerge from the meeting room he had sat in with jaye winston on friday he closed the door behind him and headed toward mccaleb terry noticed that the blinds over the meeting rooms glass window were drawn and closed hitchens beckoned him to follow terry come on back with me mccaleb followed him to his office and hitchens told him to have a seat mccaleb was getting a bad feeling about the overly cordial treatment hitchens sat behind his desk folded his arms and leaned forward on the calendar blotter with a smile on his face so where have you been mccaleb looked at his watch what do you mean jaye winston set the meeting for eight its two minutes after i mean sunday saturday jayes been calling mccaleb immediately knew what had happened on saturday when he had been cleaning up the boat he had taken the phone and the answer machine and placed them in a cabinet next to the chart table he had then forgotten about it calls to the boat and messages left while they had been out on the jetty fishing both days would have been missed the phone and machine were still in the cabinet damn he now said to hitchens i havent checked my machine well we were calling couldve saved you a trip out the meetings been canceled i thought jaye wanted the meeting isnt canceled terry its just that some things have come up and we feel its better if we conduct the investigation without outside complications mccaleb studied him for a long moment complications is this because of the heart transplant jaye told you she didnt have to tell me but its because of a number of things look you came in here and shook things up gave us a number of thingsgood hard leadsto follow were going to do that and were going to be very diligent in our investigation but at this point i have to draw the line on your involvement im sorry there was something not said mccaleb thought as the captain spoke something was going on he didnt understand or at least know about it good hard leads hitchens had said suddenly mccaleb understood if winston couldnt get through to him during the weekend then neither could vernon carruthers in washington dc my fat guy found something fat guy firearms and toolmarks what did he get captain hitchens raised his hands palm out were not going to talk about that i told you we thank you very much for the jump start but let us handle it from here we will let you know what happens and if good things happen you will be properly credited in our records and with the media i dont need to be credited i just need to be part of this im sorry but well take it from here and jaye agrees with this it doesnt matter if she agrees or doesnt agree last i checked i was running the detective bureau here not jaye winston there was enough annoyance in his tone for mccaleb to conclude that winston had not been in agreement with hitchens that was good to know he might need her staring at hitchens mccaleb knew he wasnt going to go quietly back to his boat and drop it no way the captain had to be smart enough to realize it as well i know what youre thinking and all im saying is dont get yourself in a jam if we come across you in the field theres going to be a problem mccaleb nodded fair enough youve been warned mccaleb told lockridge to cruise around the visitors lot he wanted to get to a phone quickly but first he wanted to see if he could get an idea who had been in the meeting room hitchens had come out of he knew jaye winston was obviously in there and probably arrango and walters but following his hunch that vernon carruthers had come up with a ballistics match with the drugfire laser program he also suspected that someone from the bureau besides maggie griffin was in the meeting room as they moved slowly through the parking lot mccaleb checked the rear driversside window of each parked car they passed finally in the third lane he saw what he was looking for hold it here bud he said they stopped behind a metallic blue ford ltd on the rear driversside window was the telltale barcode sticker it was a bureau car a laser reader at the garage entrance of the federal building in westwood scanned the bar code and raised the steel gate to permit entrance after hours mccaleb got out and walked up to the car there were no other exterior markings to help him identify the agent who had driven it but whoever had been driving the car made it easy for him driving east to the meeting against a rising sun the driver had turned down the windshield visor and left it down all the fbi agents mccaleb had ever known kept the government gas card assigned to their car clipped to the visor for easy access this driver was no exception mccaleb looked at the gas card and got the serial number off it he went back to lockridges car whats with the car buddy asked nothing lets go where find a phone shoulda guessed five minutes later they were at a service station with a bank of phones on the side wall lockridge pulled up to the phones lowered his window so he would be able to eavesdrop and shut off the car before getting out mccaleb opened his wallet and gave him a twentydollar bill go fill it up were going back up to the desert i think shit you said you were free all day i am but who wants to go to the desert dont any clues point to the beach for cryin out loud mccaleb just laughed at him and got out of the car with his phone book at the phone mccaleb called the field office in westwood and asked to be transferred to the garage the call was picked up after twelve rings gage yeah whos this roofs oh okay mccaleb said remembering the man rufus this is convey up on fifteen ive got a question you might be able to answer for me shoot man the familiarity mccaleb had put in his voice had apparently worked he remembered rufus and had never been much impressed with his intelligence this was reflected in the poor upkeep of the federal fleet i found a gas card on the floor up here and its supposed to be in somebodys car down there whos got card eightyone can you look it up uh ettyone yes roof eightone there was a spell of silence while the garage man apparently looked through a log well thats misser spence he got that one mccaleb didnt respond gilbert spencer was the secondhighestranking agent in los angeles rank notwithstanding mccaleb had never thought much of him as an investigative team leader but the fact that he was meeting with jaye winston and her captain and who knew who else at the star center came as a shock he began to get a better idea why he had been kicked off the case lo uh yeah rufus thanks a lot that was eightyone right yuh thas agent spence cah okay ill get him the card i dont know i see his car ain here right now okay dont worry about it thanks roof mccaleb hung up the phone and immediately picked it up again using his calling card number he called vernon carruthers in washington it was just about lunchtime there and he hoped he had not missed him this is vernon mccaleb blew out a sigh its terry man where the hell you been i tried to give you a damn headsup on saturday and you wait two days to call me back i know i know i fucked up but i hear you got something damn tootin what vernon what i gotta be careful i get the feeling theres a needtoknow list on this and your names not on it yeah i know i already found that out but this is my car vernon and nobodys going to drive away without me so youre going to tell me what did you find that would bring the assistant special agent in charge of the los angeles field office out of his little room and into the field probably for the first time this year course im going to tell you i got my twentyfive in what are they going to do to me kick me out and then have to pay me doubletime witness fees to testify in all the cases i got lined up so give it to me then well you really stuck your dick in it this time i lasered the slug this winston gal sent me and got an eightythree percent match on a goodsized frag they dug out of the head of one donald kenyon back in november thats why you got the asacs nuts in an uproar out there mccaleb whistled damn not in my ear man carruthers protested sorry was it a federal fmjthe one from kenyon no actually it was a frangible a devastator you know what that is thats what reagan got nailed with at the hilton right right little charge in the tip bullet is supposed to fragment but it didnt with ronnie he got lucky kenyon wasnt lucky mccaleb tried to think about what this might mean the same gun the hk p had been used in the three murders kenyon cordell and torres but between kenyon and cordell the ammunition had changed from a frangible to a hardball why now remember carruthers was saying you didnt hear this stuff from me i know but tell me something after you got the match what did you do go to lewin or do some checking first joel lewin was carrutherss bythebook boss what youre asking is if i got anything to send you am i right youre right i need what you can send me already on the way put it in priority mail on saturday before the shit hit the fan around here i printed out what was on the computer you got all the internals coming should be there tday or tmorrow you are going to take me on one hell of a fishing trip for this man absolutely and you didnt get any of that stuff from me youre cool vernon you dont even have to say it i know but it makes me feel better what else can you tell me thats about it it was taken out of my hands lewin took over everything and it went highlevel from there i did have to tell them why i put the push on it so they know you were looking into it i didnt tell them why mccaleb silently chastised himself for losing his temper and control with arrango after the hypnotism session if he hadnt revealed the real motivation behind his investigation he might still be a part of it carruthers had not revealed the secret but arrango certainly had you there terry yeah listen if you pick up anything else about this give me the headsup you got it man but answer your fuckin phone and watch yourself on this all the time after mccaleb hung up he turned around and almost walked into buddy lockridge buddy come on you gotta give me room lets get going they started walking to the car which was still parked at one of the pumps the desert yeah we go back up and i see mrs cordell again see if shes still talking to me why wouldntnever mind dont answer that im just the driver now you got it on the way up to the desert buddy warbled on a b flat harmonica while mccaleb used some selfhypnosis techniques to relax his mind so that he would better recall what he knew of the donald kenyon case it had been the latest in what had seemingly been a long line of embarrassments to the bureau in recent years kenyon had been president of washington guaranty a federally insured savings and loan bank with branches in los angeles orange and san diego counties kenyon was a goldenhaired and silvertongued climber who curried favor with deeppocketed investors through insider stock tips until he ascended to the presidents office by the shockingly young age of twentynine he was profiled in every business magazine he was a man who instilled confidence and trust in his investors and employees and the media so much so that over the period of three years that he was president he was able to siphon a staggering million from the institution through bogus loans to bogus companies without so much as raising an eyebrow it wasnt until washington guaranty collapsed after being thoroughly hollowed out and kenyon disappeared that anyone including federal auditors and watchdogs realized what had happened the story played in the media for months if not years mccaleb remembered stories on retirees left with nothing stories on the ripple effect of businesses failing stories on alleged sightings of kenyon in paris zurich tahiti and other places after five years on the run kenyon was found by the bureaus fugitive unit in costa rica where he had been living in an opulent compound that included two pools two tennis courts a livein personal trainer and horsebreeding facilities the thief now thirtysix was extradited to los angeles to face charges in federal court while kenyon sat in the federal holding facility awaiting trial an asset and forfeiture squad descended on his trail and worked for six months looking for the money but less than million was found this was the puzzle kenyons defense was that he did not have the money because he didnt take it he only passed it on under threat of deathhis and his entire familys through his attorneys he averred that he was blackmailed into setting up corporations loaning them millions from his s ampl and then turning the money over to the blackmailer but even though he faced the potential of years in a federal penitentiary kenyon refused to name the extortionist who had taken the money federal investigators and prosecutors chose not to believe him citing his highflying lifestyle both while running the s ampl and on the run and the fact that he clearly had some of the moneyalbeit a fraction of the wholewith him in costa rica they settled for prosecuting only kenyon after a fourmonth trial in a federal courtroom packed each day with a gallery of victims who had lost their life savings in the s ampl collapse kenyon was convicted of the massive fraud and us district judge dorothy windsor sentenced him to fortyeight years in prison what happened next would result in one more bludgeoning of the reputation of the fbi after passing sentence windsor agreed to a defense request to allow kenyon time at home with his family to prepare for prison while his attorneys prepared appeal motions over the prosecutors strenuous objection windsor gave kenyon sixty days to get his house in order he then had to report to prison forthwith whether an appeal was filed or not windsor further ordered that kenyon wear a monitor bracelet around his ankle to ensure he did not attempt another flight from justice such an order following conviction is not unusual however it is unusual when the convict has already shown his willingness to flee authorities and the country but whether kenyon had somehow been able to influence a federal judge to get such a ruling and planned to flee once more would never be known on the tuesday after thanksgiving while kenyon was enjoying the twentyfirst day of his twomonth reprieve someone entered the beverly hills home he was renting on maple drive kenyon was alone his wife having left to take their two children to school the intruder confronted kenyon in the kitchen and marched him at gunpoint into the marbletiled entry of the house he then shot kenyon to death just as his wifes car was pulling into the circular drive out front the intruder escaped out a back door and through the alley running behind the row of mansions on maple drive except for the investigation and pursuit of the killer the story might have ended there or at least taken on the mundane boredom of a cold trail but the fbi had lojacked kenyonbureauspeak for having placed him under an illegal surveillance that included listening devices planted in his home cars and attorneys office at the moment he was shot a tech van with four agents in it was parked two blocks away the murder had been recorded the agents aware of their illegal standing nevertheless raced to the home and gave pursuit to the intruder but the gunman escaped while kenyon was being rushed to cedarssinai medical center only to be declared dead on arrival the missing millions kenyon was convicted of looting from washington guaranty were never recovered but that detail was eclipsed when the actions of the fbi were revealed not only was the bureau vilified for undertaking such an illegal operation it was also publicly castigated for allowing a murder to happen right under its nose for bumbling the chance to intervene and stop the assassination of kenyon not to mention capture the gunman mccaleb had viewed all of this from afar he was already out of the bureau and at the time of kenyons murder was preparing himself for his own death but he remembered reading the times which was at the forefront of the story he recalled that the newspaper reported that there were demotions all around for the agents involved and calls from politicians in washington dc for congressional hearings on illegal activities by the bureau to add insult to injury he also remembered kenyons widow filed an invasionofprivacy lawsuit against the bureau seeking millions in damages the question mccaleb now had to answer was whether the intruder who killed kenyon in november was the man who killed cordell and torres two and three months later and if it was the same man what could possibly be the connection linking a failed savings and loan president with an aqueduct engineer and a newspaper pressroom worker he finally looked around and noticed his surroundings they were well past vasquez rocks now in a few more minutes they would be at amelia cordells house as promised amelia cordell had spent a good part of the weekend going through her memory and filling four pages of a legal tablet with what she recalled of her husbands travels in the two months before his death on the twentysecond of january she had it ready and sitting on the coffee table when mccaleb arrived i appreciate the time you put into this he told her well maybe it will help i hope it helps me too he nodded and sat in silence for a moment um by the way have you heard from jaye winston or anybody else from the sheriffs department lately no not since jaye called me on friday to say it was okay to talk to you mccaleb nodded he was heartened by the fact that jaye hadnt called back to rescind the permission again it made him think that she wasnt going along with her captains decision to drop mccaleb from the case and nobody else no like who i dont know im just curious about whether you know theyre following up on the information ive given them mccaleb decided he had better change the subject mrs cordell did your husband have a home office yes he had a small den he used why do you mind if i look around there well no but im not sure what youll find he just kept files from work there and he did our bills there well for example if you have credit card statements for the period of january and december it might help me isolate where he was at different points im not too sure i want you taking our credit card records well all i can do is assure you that im only interested in the billing locations and possibly the items purchased not your credit card numbers i know im sorry that was silly of me youre the only one who seems to care anymore about jim why am i suspicious of you it made mccaleb feel uneasy not being totally truthful with the woman and telling her he had lost his official sanction he stood up so that they could move on and he didnt have to think about it the office was small and largely used as storage of skiing equipment and cardboard boxes but one end of the room was largely taken up by a desk with two drawers and two builtin file cabinets sorry its a mess and im still getting used to doing all the bills jim always handled that dont worry about that do you mind if i just sort of sit and look through things a bit no not at all um would it be possible for me to have a glass of water in here of course ill go get you one she headed to the door but then stopped you dont really want the water do you you just want to be left alone and not have me hovering around mccaleb smiled slightly and looked down at the worn green carpet ill get you the water anyway but then ill leave you alone thanks mrs cordell call me amelia amelia mccaleb spent the next half hour going through the drawers and the paperwork on top of the desk he worked quickly knowing that the package from carruthers was probably waiting for him in his postal box in the harbormasters office at the desk mccaleb took some notes on the legal pad amelia cordell had already worked on and he piled documents and credit card records he wanted to take with him to study later he made an inventory list of the things he wanted to take so that amelia cordell would have a record the last drawer he went through was in one of the file cabinets it was almost empty and had been used by cordell as the place to file work insurance and estate planning records there was a thick file on medical insurance with billing records dating back to the birth of his daughters and his own treatment for a broken leg the billing address of one of his treating physicians was in vail colorado leading mccaleb to guess the bone had been broken in a skiing misadventure there was a black binder with a handsome leather slipcover mccaleb opened it and found that it contained documents relating to the wills of both husband and wife mccaleb saw nothing unordinary each spouse had been the others beneficiary with the children following in line in the event of both parents dying mccaleb didnt spend a lot of time with it the last file he looked at was simply labeled work and it contained various records including performance evaluations and various office communications mccaleb scanned the employment reviews and found that cordell had apparently been held in high regard by his employers mccaleb wrote down some of the names of supervisors who signed the reports so he could interview them later last he scanned the other correspondence but nothing interested him there were copies of interoffice memos as well as letters of commendation for cordells chairing of the engineering firms annual blood drive and his volunteer work in a program that provided thanksgiving meals to the needy there was also a twoyearold letter from a supervisor praising cordell for stopping and helping the injured victims of a headon collision in lone pine details of what cordell did were not in the letter mccaleb put the letters and evaluations back in the file and returned it to the file drawer mccaleb stood up and looked around the room there was nothing else that raised any interest he then noticed a framed photo on the desk it was of the cordell family he picked it up and studied it for a moment thinking about how much the bullet had shattered it made him think of raymond and graciela he envisioned a photo that had the two of them and mccaleb in it smiling he took his empty water glass into the kitchen and left it on the counter he then stepped into the living room and found amelia cordell sitting in the chair she had taken earlier she was just sitting there the television was not on she had no book or newspaper in her hands she appeared to be just staring at the glass top of the coffee table mccaleb hesitated in the hallway from the kitchen mrs cordell she shifted her eyes to him without moving her head yes im finished for now he stepped in and placed the receipt on the table these are the things i am taking ill get it all back to you in a few days ill either mail it or bring it up myself her eyes were on the list now trying to read it from three feet away did you find what you need i dont know yet these sorts of things you never know what is important until it becomes important if you know what i mean not really well i guess i mean details im looking for the telling detail there used to be a game when i was a kid i dont remember what it was called but they still might have it around for kids today youve got a clear plastic tube that stands vertical there are a bunch of plastic straws running through holes all around the center of it you load a bunch of marbles into the tube so that they are held up by the straws the object of the game is to pull a straw out without any marbles dropping and there always seemed to be one straw that when you pulled it out everything came down like a landslide thats what im looking for ive got lots of details im looking for the one that brings the landslide when its pulled out trouble is you cant tell which one it is until you start pulling she looked at him blankly the way she had been staring at the coffee table well look ive taken too much of your time i think ill be on my way and like i said ill get these things back to you and ill call you if anything else comes up my number is on the inventory list there in case you think of anything else or there is anything i can do for you he nodded and she said goodbye he turned to head to the door when he thought of something and turned back oh i almost forgot there was a letter in one of the files commending your husband for stopping at an accident up near lone pine do you remember that sure that was two years ago november do you remember what happened just that jimmy was driving home from up there and he came across the accident it had just happened and there were people and debris thrown every which way and that he called for ambulances on his cell phone and stopped to comfort the people a little boy died right in his arms that night he had a hard time with that mccaleb nodded that was the kind of man he was mr mccaleb all mccaleb could do was nod his head again mccaleb had to wait out on the front driveway for ten minutes before buddy lockridge finally drove up he had a howlin wolf tape playing loud an the stereo mccaleb turned it down after climbing in where you been drivin where to well i was waiting back to the marina buddy made a uturn and headed back to the freeway well you told me i didnt have to just sit in the car you told me to take a drive i took a drive how am i supposed to know how long youre going to be if you dont tell me he was right but mccaleb was still annoyed he didnt apologize if this thing lasts much longer i ought to get a cell phone for you to carry if this lasts much longer i want a raise mccaleb didnt respond lockridge turned the tape back up and pulled a harmonica out of the door pocket he started playing along to wang dang doodle mccaleb looked out the window and thought about amelia cordell and how one bullet had taken two lives the package from carruthers was waiting for mccaleb in his mailbox it was as thick as a phone book he took it back to the boat opened it and spread the documents across the salon table he found the most recent summary on the kenyon investigation and began reading deciding to learn the latest developments and then go back to read from the start the investigation of the donald kenyon murder was a joint fbibeverly hills police operation but the case was cold the lead agents for the bureau a pair from the special investigation unit in los angeles named nevins and uhlig had concluded in the most recent report filed in december that kenyon had likely been executed by a contract killer there were two theories as to who had employed the assassin theory one was that one of the two thousand victims of the savings and loan collapse had been unsatisfied with kenyons sentence or possibly feared he would flee justice once again and therefore had engaged the services of a killer theory two was that the killer had been in the employ of the silent partner who kenyon had claimed during the trial had forced him to loot the savings and loan that partner whom kenyon had refused to identify remained unidentified as well by the bureau according to this last report mccaleb found the outlining of theory two in the report interesting because it indicated that the federal government might now give credence to kenyons claim that he had been forced to siphon funds from his savings and loan by a second party this claim had been derided during kenyons trial by the prosecution which took to referring to this alleged second party as kenyons phantom now here was an fbi document which suggested that the phantom might actually exist nevins and uhlig concluded the summary report with a brief profile of the unknown subject who had contracted the murder the profile fit both theories one and two the employer was wealthy had the ability to hide his or her trail and remain anonymous and had connections to or was even part of traditional organized crime aside from the report breathing life into kenyons phantom the second thing that interested mccaleb was the suggestion that the employer and therefore the actual killer were connected to traditional organized crime traditional organized crime in fbi parlance meant the mafia the tendrils of the mafia were almost everywhere but even so the mob was not a strong influence in southern california there was a tremendous amount of organized crime in the area it just wasnt being perpetrated by the traditional mobsters out of the movies at any given time there were probably more asian or russian mobsters operating in southern california than their counterparts of italian descent mccaleb organized the documents in chronological order and went back to the start most were routine summaries and updates on aspects of the investigation that were forwarded to supervisors in washington quickly scanning through the documents he found a report on the surveillance teams activities the morning of the shooting that he read with fascination there had been four agents in the surveillance van at the time of the killing it was changeofshift time eight oclock on a tuesday morning two agents coming on two going home the agent monitoring the bugs took off the headset and passed it to his replacement however the replacement was a type a personality who claimed he had once gotten an infestation of head lice from another agent during an earphone exchange so he took the time to put his own pair of foam cushions on the headset and to then spray the equipment with a disinfectant all the while fending off insulting barbs from the three other agents after he finally placed the earphones on his head he heard silence for nearly a minute then a muffled exchange of conversation and then finally a shot from kenyons house the sound was muffled because no listening devices had been placed in the entryway of the house the thinking being that any escape planning kenyon might do would not be done at the front door the bugs had been placed in the actual living areas of the house the overnight team had not yet left and were continuing the banter in the van after hearing the shot the agent on the phones shouted for silence he listened closely for several seconds while another agent put on a second set of phones what they both heard was someone in the kenyon house clearly speak one line near one of the microphones dont forget the cannoli the two agents on the phones looked at each other and agreed that it had not been kenyon who had spoken the line declaring an emergency the agents blew their cover and sped to the house arriving moments after donna kenyon had arrived home opened the front door and found her husband lying on the marble floor his head bathed in blood after calling for bureau backup local police and paramedics the agents searched the house and the surrounding neighborhood the gunman was gone mccaleb moved on to a transcript of the last hour of tape from kenyons home the tape had been enhanced in the fbi lab but still not every word was captured there were the sounds of the daughters having breakfast and the normal morning talk between kenyon and his wife and the girls then at the girls and their mother left the transcript noted nine minutes of silence before kenyon made a phone call to the home of his attorney stanley lagrossa lagrossa yes kenyon its donald lagrossa donald kenyon are we still on lagrossa yes if you are still serious about it kenyon i am ill see you at the office then lagrossa you know the risks ill see you there another eight minutes went by and then a new unknown voice was picked up in the house some of the terse conversation was lost as kenyon and the unknown man moved through the house in and out of the reach of the listening devices the conversation had apparently taken place while the delayed earphone exchange was taking place in the bureau tech van kenyon what is unknown shut up do what i say and your family lives understand kenyon you cant just walk in here and unknown i said shut up lets go this way kenyon dont hurt my family please i unknown unintelligible kenyon do that i wouldnt and he knows that i dont understand this he unknown shut up i dont care kenyon unintelligible unknown unintelligible the report noted that two minutes of silence went by and then the final exchange unknown okay look and see who kenyon dont shes got nothing to do with this she then one shot was fired and moments later microphone which was hidden in a rear den with a door to the rear yard picked up the unknown mans final words unknown dont forget the cannoli the door to the den was found open it had been used as part of the killers escape route mccaleb read the transcript again captivated by knowing it was a mans last moments and words he wished he had an audiotape so that he would have a better feel for what had happened the next document he read explained why the investigators suspected mob involvement it was a cryptology report the tape from the kenyon house had been sent to the crime lab for enhancement the transcript was then sent to cryptology the analyst given the assignment focused on the killers last line spoken after kenyon was down and seemingly a non sequitur the line dont forget the cannoliwas fed into the cryptology computer to see if it matched any known code prior usage in bureau reports or literary or entertainment reference it scored a direct match in the movie the godfather the film that inspired a legion of truelife mafia hoodlums a top capo for the corleone family peter clemenza is given the assignment of taking a traitorous family soldier out into the new jersey meadowlands and killing him on the morning he leaves his home for the hit his wife tells clemenza to stop by a bakery for pastry as the hugely overweight clemenza lumbers out to a waiting car containing the man he is tasked with killing his wife calls after him dont forget the cannoli mccaleb loved the movie and now remembered the line it so clearly captured the essence of movie mob lifethe ruthless and guiltless brutality alongside family values and loyalty he understood now why the bureau had concluded that the kenyon killing was in some way mob related the line had the audacity and bravura of the mob life he could see a stonecold killer adopting it as the imprimatur of his work dont forget the cannoli mccaleb said out loud he suddenly thought of something and a little jolt of electricity went through him dont forget the cannoli he said again he quickly went to his leather bag and dug through it until he found the video from the james cordell shooting he went to the television and jammed the tape in and started playing it after getting his bearings on where in the tape he was he fastforwarded to the moment of the shooting and hit play again his eyes stayed on the masked mans mouth and as the man began to speak on the silent tape mccaleb spoke with him out loud dont forget the cannoli he backed the tape up and did it again saying it again his words matched the shooters lips he was sure it fit he could feel excitement and adrenaline surging inside of him now it was a feeling that only came when you had momentum when you were making your own breaks when you were getting close to the hidden truth he pulled the tape of the gloria torres murder out put it in the player and repeated the process again the words fit the lips of the shooter once again there was no doubt dont forget the cannoli mccaleb said aloud again he went to the cabinet next to the chart table and got the phone out he still had not played the messages that had accumulated over the weekend but he was too hyped to do it now he punched in the number for jaye winston where have you been and dont you ever check your machine she asked ive been trying to call you all weekend and all day to explain it wasnt my i know it wasnt you it was hitchens im not calling about that anyway i know what the bureau told you i know what youve gotthe connection to donald kenyon youve got to bring me back in thats impossible hitchens already said i shouldnt even talk to you how am i going to bring i can help you how with what just answer me this see if i have this right this morning gilbert spencer and a couple of field agentsim guessing they were named nevins and uhligcome out and give you the news that the bullet you sent to washington matched up with kenyon right so far but thats no great im not done next he tells you the bureau would like to look into your case and the lapd case but that initially there seems to be no likely connection other than the weapon he says after all kenyon is a professional hit and you guys are working two street robberies not only that his shooter used a devastator on kenyon and your guy used something else federals that backs the bureau theory that the professional shooter in the kenyon case discarded his weapon somewhere and the shooter from your two cases then came along and picked it up end of connection how am i doing so far dead on okay so you asked spencer for information on the kenyon killing just so you could do your own crosschecking but that didnt go over so well he said the kenyon case was at aquotesensitive point and that he would rather us peons be on a needtoknow basis and hitchens agreed to that he went along for the ride and did anybody serve the cannoli what mccaleb spent the next five minutes explaining the cannoli connection reading her the transcript from the bugs in kenyons house and the conclusions of the cryptology report winston said these were all facts that gilbert spencer had not mentioned during the morning meeting mccaleb knew that he would not have mccaleb had been in the bureau he knew how it worked given the opportunity you brush the locals aside and say that the bureau will handle it from here so the cannoli connection makes it clear this wasnt a throwaway gun that our guy happened to pick up mccaleb said its the same shooter on all three kenyon then cordell then torres whether the bureau people knew that going in to your meeting i dont know but if you copied them the case file and the tapes they know it now the question is how do these three killings fit together winston was silent for a moment before finally expressing her confusion man i have nowell maybe they dont connect look if its a contract killer like the bureau says maybe they were three separate contracts you know maybe there is no connection other than the same killer did all three on three separate jobs mccaleb shook his head and said its possible i guess but nothing makes sense i mean what did gloria torres have that would make her a pro hitters target she worked in the print shop at the newspaper it could have been something she saw remember what you said friday about there being some connection between the two torres and cordell well maybe its still the same only the connection is something they saw or something they knew mccaleb nodded what about the icons the things taken from cordell and torres he asked more to himself than to winston i dont know she said maybe its a hitter who likes to take souvenirs maybe he had to prove to his employer that he had hit the right people is there anything in the reports about anything being taken from kenyon not that i have seen yet his mind was a jumble of possibilities winstons question made him realize that in his excitement he had called her too soon he still had a stack of unread kenyon files the connection he was looking for might be there terry yeah sorry i was just thinking look let me call you back ive got some more stuff to go through and i might be able what stuff do you have i think ive got everything or almost everything that spencer wasnt telling you i would say that that is going to buy you back into the captains good graces well dont say anything to him yet let me figure out a little more about this and ill call you you promise yeah then say it i dont want you pulling any bureau bullshit on me hey im retired remember i promise an hour and a half later mccaleb finished going through the bureau documents the adrenaline that had jazzed him before had dissipated he had learned a lot of new information as he read the reports but nothing that hinted at a connection between kenyon and cordell and torres the rest of the bureau documents contained a lengthy printout of the names addresses and investment histories of the two thousand victims of the savings and loan collapse and neither cordell nor torres had been investors the bureau had had to consider every victim of the s ampl collapse a suspect in the kenyon shooting each name on the investors list was backgrounded and screened for criminal connections and other flags that might elevate it to viable suspect status a dozen or so investors were raised to that level but then eventually cleared through full field investigations the investigation had then shifted its focus toward theory two that kenyons phantom was real and had ordered the hit on the man who had stolen millions for him this theory gathered momentum after it was learned that kenyon had been about to reveal whom he had turned over the stolen s ampl funds to according to a statement from kenyons attorney stanley lagrossa kenyon had decided to cooperate with authorities in hopes of getting the us attorneys office to petition the judge who sentenced him to reduce his penalty lagrossa said that on the morning kenyon was murdered they had planned to meet to discuss how lagrossa would go about negotiating his cooperation mccaleb flipped back through the reports and reread the short transcript of the phone call kenyon made to lagrossa just minutes before the murder the brief exchange between the lawyer and his client appeared to back up lagrossas claim that kenyon was ready to cooperate the bureau theory outlined in a supplemental report to lagrossas statement was that kenyons silent partner either was taking no chances and eliminated kenyon or he eliminated kenyon after specifically learning that his partner was planning to cooperate with government investigators the supplemental report noted that federal agents and prosecutors had not yet been approached by the kenyon camp with the overture of cooperation that meant that if there was a leak to the silent partner it came from kenyons people possibly even lagrossa himself mccaleb got up and poured a glass of orange juice emptying one of the halfgallon cartons he had bought on saturday morning as he drank he thought about what all of the kenyon information meant to the investigation it clouded things for sure despite the early jolt of adrenaline he now realized he was basically back to ground zero no closer to knowing who killed gloria torres and why than he was when he opened the package mailed from carruthers as he rinsed out the glass he noticed two men coming down the main gangway to the docks they were dressed in almost matching blue suits anybody in a suit stood out on the docksusually it was a bank loan officer come to chain down a boat for repossession but mccaleb knew better this time he recognized the demeanor they were coming for him vernon carruthers must have been found out quickly mccaleb went to the table and gathered up the bureau documents he then split off the sheaf of pages that listed the names addresses and other information about the savings and loan collapse he put that thick packet in one of the overhead cabinets in the kitchen the rest of the documents he shoved into his leather bag which he then put into the cabinet under the chart table he slid the salon door open and stepped out into the cockpit to greet the two agents he closed and locked the door behind him mr mccaleb the younger one said he had a mustache daring by bureau standards let me guess nevins and uhlig they didnt look happy about being identified can we come aboard sure the younger one was introduced as nevins uhlig the senior agent did most of the talking if you know who we are then you know why we are here we dont want this to get any messier than it has to be especially taking into account your service to the bureau so if you give us the stolen files it can all end right here whoa mccaleb said holding his hands up stolen files mr mccaleb uhlig said it has come to our attention that you are in the possession of confidential fbi files you are no longer an agent you should not be in possession of these files as i just said if you want to make this a problem for you we can make it a problem for you but all we really want is the files back mccaleb stepped over and sat on the gunwale he was trying to think about how they knew and it came back to carruthers it was the only way vernon must have gotten jammed up in washington and had to give mccaleb up but it was unlike his old friend to do that no matter what pressure they put on him he decided to trust his instincts and call the bluff nevins and uhlig knew carruthers had run the ballistics laser comparison at mccalebs request that was no secret they must have then assumed that carruthers would have forwarded him copies oaf the computer files forget it guys he finally said i dont have any files stolen or otherwise you got bad info then howd you know who we were nevins asked easy i found out today when you guys went to the sheriffs office and told them to keep me out of the case mccaleb folded his arms and looked past the two agents to buddy lockridges boat buddy was sitting in the cockpit sipping from a can of beer and watching the scene with the two suits on the following sea well were going to have to take a look around then to make sure uhlig said not without a warrant and i doubt youve got a warrant we didnt need one after you gave us permission to enter and search nevins stepped over to the salon door and tried to slide it open he found it was locked mccaleb smiled only way youre getting in there is to break it nevins and that wont look much like permission granted you ask me besides you dont want to do that with an uninvolved witness watching both agents started looking around the marina finally they spotted lockridge who held his beer can up as a greeting mccaleb watched as anger turned uhligs jaw rigid okay mccaleb the senior agent said keep the files but im telling you right now smart guy dont get in the way the bureaus in the process of taking over the case and the last thing we need is some tin man amateur without a badge or his own heart fucking things up for us mccaleb could feel his own jaw drawing tight get the fuck off my boat sure were going they both climbed back up onto the dock as they headed to the gangway nevins turned around and said see you around tin man mccaleb watched them all the way through the gate what was that all about lockridge called over mccaleb waved him off while still watching the agents just some old friends come to pay a visit it was nearly pm in the east mccaleb called carruthers at his home his friend said he had already been through the wringer i told them i said hey i turned over my information to lewin yes i put a push on the package at the request of former agent mccaleb but i did not furnish a copy of the report or any other reports to him hey they dont believe me then they can shove it im fully vested they want me out im out then they can pay me every time i have to come in to testify on one of my cases and i got voluminous cases if you know what i mean he was speaking as if for a third party listening in and with the bureau you never knew if there wasnt mccaleb followed suit same thing out here they came around tried to act like i had reports i dont have and i told them to get off my damn boat yeah youre cool so are you vernon im gonna go watch the following sea man whats that watch your back oh right you too winston picked up the call on a half ring where have you been busy nevins and uhlig just paid me a little visit did you copy them everything you copied to me last week the files tapes hitchens gave them everything yeah well they mustve made the cannoli connection theyre coming after the case jaye youre going to have to hang on what are you talking about the bureau cant just take over a murder investigation theyll find a way they wont take it away but theyll take charge i think they know theres more than the gun connecting the cases theyre assholes but theyre smart assholes i think they figured out the same thing i did once they looked at the tapes you gave them they know its the same shooter and that there is something hooking all three of these hits together they came by to intimidate me to get me off it next it will be you if they think im just going to turn this whole thing over to them and its not you theyll go to hitchens and if he doesnt agree to back off then they go farther up the ladder i was one of them remember i know how it works the higher you go the more pressure points damn welcome to the club what are you going to do me tomorrow im going back to work i dont have to answer to the bureau or hitchens or anybody else just myself on this one well you might be the only one with a shot at this good luck thanks i could use it mccaleb didnt get to the notes and financial records he had taken from amelia cordell until the end of the day tired from all the desk work he quickly scanned the notes and came across nothing in the widows recollections that sparked any interest in him from the bank statements he quickly determined that cordell was paid every wednesday by direct deposit during the three months for which mccaleb had statements cordell had made an atm withdrawal on every payday at the same bank branch at which he was eventually killed the significance of this was that it confirmed that like gloria torress nightly stop at the sherman market cordell had been following a definable pattern when he had been murdered it gave more credence to the belief that the shooter had watched his victimsin cordells case for a minimum of a week but probably longer mccaleb was glancing through the credit card statements when he felt the boat dip and looked out to see graciela stepping down into the stern it was a pleasant surprise graciela he said as he stepped out to the stern what are you doing here you didnt get my message no ioh i havent checked messages well i called and said i was coming down i wrote up some things about glory like you asked mccaleb almost groaned more paperwork instead he told her he appreciated her doing the work so quickly after his request he noticed that she carried a duffel bag slung over her arm he took it from her whats in the bag you didnt write that much did you she looked at him and smiled my stuff im thinking about staying over again mccaleb felt a little thrill inside even though he knew that her staying over didnt necessarily mean they would be sleeping together wheres raymond with mrs otero shell also get him to school tomorrow im taking the day off how come so i can be your driver i already have somebody to drive me you dont have to take i know but i want to besides i made an appointment for you at the times with glorys boss and i want to go with you when you talk to him okay you got the job she smiled and he led her into the salon after mccaleb took her bag down to the stateroom and poured her a glass of wine from a new bottle of red he sat with her in the stern and began going over the cases new developments as he told her about kenyon her eyes widened as she struggled to accept the idea that there was a connection somewhere between her sister and the murdered criminal nothing obvious comes to mind right he asked no i have no idea how they could be she didnt finish mccaleb shook his head and slouched in his deck chair she opened her purse and took out the notebook in which she had written down her sisters activities they went over it nothing she had written jumped out at mccaleb as being significant but he told her the information could still be useful as the case continued to evolve its amazing how much everything has changed he said a week ago this was a basic holdup now we have possibilities of the motivation being pathological or even being some kind of contract hit the random possibility is now third graciela sipped her wine before speaking it makes it harder doesnt it she asked in a soft voice no he said it just means were getting close you have to open up and let all of the possibilities in then sift it out all of this just means were getting close after they watched the sunset graciela drove them to a small italian restaurant in the belmont shores section of long beach mccaleb liked the food and they had the privacy of one of the restaurants three round booths during dinner mccaleb had tried to change the subject sensing that graciela was still depressed by the turns of the investigation he told her some lame jokes he remembered from his bureau days but they barely brought a smile it must have been hard when this was your fulltime job she said as she pushed her halffinished plate of gnocchi aside i mean just dealing with these kinds of people all the time it must have been she didnt finish he just nodded he didnt think they needed to go there again do you ever think youll get past it what the job no what it did to you like that story you told me the devils keep the whole thing of what happened to you can you get past that he thought for a moment he sensed that a lot was riding on his answer she was asking about faith and she was deciding something about him he knew it was important that his answer be honest yet the correct one for himself he needed to be correct graciela all i can tell you is that i hope i can get past it i want to be restored to what im not sure but ive been empty for a long time and i want to be filled in my mind it feels too weird to talk about but its there i want you to know that i dont know if it answers what you need to know about me but im hoping and waiting to have what i think you have he wasnt sure if he was making sense he slid around in the booth until he was right next to her he leaned over and kissed her high on the cheek shielded by the redchecked tablecloth he put his hand on her knee and ran it softly across the top of her thigh it was the kind of caress a lover would undertake but he was desperate to hold on to her not to lose her and he lacked confidence in his words he had to touch her in some way can we go she asked he looked at her a moment where to the boat he nodded back at the boat graciela led him to the stateroom and made love to him without hesitation as they moved in a slow rhythm mccaleb felt his heart pounding so strong and hard in his chest that the beat seemed to echo in his temples a throbbing sensation that urged him on he was sure she also felt it pulsing against her own chest the cadence of life at the end a shudder rolled through his body and he pressed his face hard into the crook of her neck a short clipped laugh like a gasp involuntarily came from his throat and he hoped she would think it was a cough or a grab for breath he gently lowered more of his weight onto her and buried his face in the soft nest of hair behind her ear she ran a hand down his back then all the way up again leaving it soft and warm on his neck whats so funny she whispered nothing im just happy thats all he pressed his face tighter against her and whispered into her ear his nose full of her smell his heart and mind full of hope you are the one bringing me back he said youre my chance she brought her arms up around his neck and pulled him tightly down on her she didnt say a word in the dead of night mccaleb awoke he had been dreaming of swimming underwater with no need to break the surface for air he was on his back his arm against gracielas naked back he felt the warmth of the contact he thought about raising himself to look over her at the clock but he didnt want to break the seam of their touch as he closed his eyes to return to the dream the unmistakable sound of the slider upstairs being slowly rolled open brought him awake he realized that somethinga soundhad woken him from the dream he felt an icicle go through his chest and he became fully alert somebody was on the boat the russian he thought bolotov had found him and had come to make good on his threat but then he quickly dismissed the possibility returning to his instinctive belief that the russian would not be that stupid he rolled to the edge of the bed and reached down to the remote phone set on the floor he hit the speed dial combination for buddy lockridges boat and waited for him to answer he wanted lockridge to look at the following sea and tell him if he could see anyone or anything amiss the thought of donald kenyon being marched to his front door and shot with a fragmenting bullet flashed through his mind and he realized that whoever was up there probably wasnt counting on gracielas being on the boat he suddenly knew that no matter what happened in the next few minutes the intruder must not and would not get to her after four rings lockridge didnt answer and mccaleb knew he couldnt waste any more time he quickly got out of bed and headed toward the staterooms closed door checking the red glowing numerals of the clock and seeing it was ten minutes past three as he quietly opened the door he thought about his gun it was in the bottom drawer of the chart table the intruder was closer to it than mccaleb was and possibly had already found it he mentally canvassed the lower deck looking for a weapon and coming up with nothing he had the door all the way open now what is it graciela whispered from behind him he quickly and quietly turned around and came to the bed he put his hand over her mouth and whispered somebodys on the boat he felt her body go rigid beneath his they dont know about you i want you to quietly move over the side and lie down on the floor until i come get you she didnt move do it graciela she started to move but then he held her do you have mace or any kind of weapon in your purse she shook her head no he nodded and then pushed her to the side of the bed nearest the wall he went back to the door as mccaleb came quietly up the steps he could see the slider was half open there was more light in the salon than below and his vision improved suddenly the figure of a man was silhouetted against the exterior light beyond the door the light seemed to reflect off the figure mccaleb could not tell if the intruder was staring at him or was turned around looking out at the marina mccaleb knew that the corkscrew he had used to open gracielas wine earlier was on the galley counter just to the right at the top of the steps he could easily get to it he just had to decide if he would be using it against someone with something better he decided there was no choice as he came to the top stair he stretched out to reach the corkscrew the stair creaked and mccaleb saw the silhouette tense the element of surprise was gone freeze asshole he yelled as he grabbed the corkscrew and moved toward the dark figure the intruder quickly moved to the door going sideways out through it and using one hand to fling it down its track behind him grappling to get the door open mccaleb lost a few seconds and the intruder was up on the dock and running before he was even out of the boat instinctively he knew he would not be able to catch the intruder but he leaped up onto the dock and gave fullspeed chase anyway the cool night air hardening his skin the rough wood of the dock planks biting into his bare feet as he ran up the slanted gangway he heard a car engine turn over he jerked open the gate and ran out into the lot just as a car sped through the exit its tires squealing as they lost grip on the cold asphalt mccaleb watched it go it had been too far away for him to get the plate shit he closed his eyes and brought his hand up and pinched the bridge of his nose it was a selfhypnosis technique he tried to commit as many details of what he had just seen to active memory red car small foreign wornout suspension it occurred to him that the car was familiar but he couldnt place it yet mccaleb bent over and put his hands on his knees as a feeling of nausea hit him and his heart seemed to bounce up into a higher gear he concentrated on long deep breaths and eventually he felt the beat slow down he felt light hit his closed eyelids he opened his eyes and looked into the beam of an approaching flashlight it was the marinas security guard pulling up in his golf cart mr mccaleb the voice behind the light asked that you it was only then that mccaleb finally realized he was naked nothing was missing nothing was disturbed at least as far as mccaleb could tell nothing appeared out of order the contents of his leather bag which he had left on the galley table seemed to be as he remembered them he found the thick sheaf of documents he had shoved into the galley cabinet earlier in the day to be where he had left it mccaleb inspected the sliding door and found scratches from a screwdriver he knew how easy it was to pop a sliding door with a screwdriver he also knew that the pop was always louder outside the structure than inside he had been lucky somehow the pop or something else had woken him with the security guard shel newbie watching mccaleb finished checking every drawer and cabinet in the salon and found nothing amiss what about below newbie asked not enough time mccaleb said i heard him as soon as he opened the door i guess i scared him off before he did whatever he was coming to do mccaleb was silent as he thought about the possibility that the intruder had not come to steal anything he thought about bolotov again but quickly dismissed it the figure he had seen move sideways through the sliding door was too small to have been the russian can i come up i could make some coffee mccaleb turned to the stairs graciela was there when he had returned to the stateroom to get dressed he had told her it would be better if she stayed below but here she was wearing her pink nightshirt over a pair of baggy gray sweatpants she had taken from his closet her hair was a bit disheveled and she couldnt have looked sexier he stared at her silently for a moment before finally answering well were about to wrap it up i think should i call pacific division newbie asked mccaleb shook his head it was probably just some dock punk looking to rip off my loran or the compass he said though he didnt believe it i dont want to drag the police in well be up all night you sure yeah thanks for helping shel i appreciate it glad to i guess ill go back out then im going to have to write up an incident report in the morning they might want to make an lapd report anyway yeah thats fine i just dont feel like waiting up for them to get over here that run took it out of me tomorrow will be fine okay then newbie saluted and left mccaleb waited a few moments and then looked at graciela who was still in the stairwell you okay yes scared is all why dont you go back down ill be right down she went back to the stateroom mccaleb closed the slider and worked the lock to see if it was still operable it was he reached up to the overhead rod racks and took down the wooden gaff handle he placed it in the doors track and used it as a wedge to hold the door closed it would do for the night but he knew he would have to rethink the boats security when he was finished with the door and reasonably assured of security mccaleb looked down at his bare feet on the salons berber carpet for the first time he realized that the rug was wet he then remembered how the marina lights had shone off the body of the intruder as he had stood near the door on the drive up to the times plant in the valley mccaleb sat in the passenger seat of gracielas volkswagen and was mostly silent his mind moved over the activities of the night like an anchor dragging across a sandy bottom seeking but finding no purchase nothing to grip after he had noticed the wet spot on the carpet he had retraced the chase to the parking lot and found the dock also was wet it was a cool crisp night and too early for the morning moisture to have formed the intruder had clearly been wet when he had broken into the boat the shine of light on his body indicated he had probably been wearing a wetsuit the question mccaleb could not answer now was why before they had left mccaleb had gone over to buddy lockridges boat to see if his neighbor was there he found buddy looking disheveled as usual sitting in the cockpit reading a book called hocus mccaleb asked him if he had spent the night on the boat and he said he had when asked why he hadnt answered the phone buddy insisted that it was because it hadnt rung mccaleb let it go thinking either lockridge had simply been passed out and hadnt heard his call or mccaleb had pushed the wrong speeddial button he told lockridge that he didnt need him as a driver for the day but that he wanted to hire him as a diver you want me to scrape your hull no i want you to search the hull and the bottom and all the piers around the boat search search for what i dont know youll know it when you see it whatever you say but i ripped my wetsuit again doing that bertram as soon as i sew it up ill go over and check it out thanks put it on my tab you got it hey is your lady friend going to be driving you now he was looking past mccaleb at graciela standing in the stern of the following sea mccaleb looked at her and then back at lockridge no buddy just today shes got to introduce me to some people that okay sure its okay in the car mccaleb sipped from the mug of coffee he had brought with him and looked out the window still bothered by lockridge not having answered his call for help they were in the sepulveda pass going over the santa monica mountains most of the traffic on the was going the other way what are you thinking about graciela asked last night i guess he said trying to figure it out buddy is going to take a dive under the boat today maybe find out what the guy was doing well are you sure you want to see this times guy now we could reschedule it no were already on our way it cant hurt to talk to as many people as we can we still dont know what any of this stuff from yesterday means until we do we should keep plugging away sounds good he said we could talk to some of her friends who worked there too mccaleb nodded and reached down to the leather bag on the floor it had grown fat with all the documents and tapes he had accumulated he had decided to leave nothing from the case behind on the boat in case of another breakin and adding to the bags weight was his gun a sigsauer p other than at his interview with bolotov he hadnt carried the weapon since he had retired from the bureau but when graciela went into the shower he had removed it from its drawer again and slid the clip into it he did not chamber a roundfollowing the same safety precaution he had always practiced while with the bureau he then made room for the pistol in his bag by jettisoning his medical kit his plan was to be back at the boat before it was time for him to take more pills he dug through the stacks of paperwork in the bag until he found his legal pad and he opened it to the timeline he had constructed from the reports in the lapd murder book he read the top and found what he wanted annette stapleton he said what about her you know her i want to talk to her she was glorys friend she came over once to meet raymond and then she was at the funeral how do you know about her her name is in the lapd stuff she and your sister talked in the parking lot that night i want to talk to her about other nights you know see if your sister was worried about anything the lapd never spent much time with stapleton remember they were running the randomholdup angle from the start bozos i dont know its hard to blame them they carry a lot of cases and this one looked the way it was set up to look still no excuse mccaleb let it go and turned silent he didnt particularly feel the need to defend arrango and walters anyway he returned to his thoughts on the events of the night and came to one positive conclusion he was apparently making enough waves to engage a response from someone though he didnt know what exactly that response had been they got to the la times plant ten minutes before their appointment with glorys supervisor a man named clint neff the times plant was a huge property at the corner of winnetka and prairie in chatsworth in the northwest corner of los angeles it was a neighborhood of slick office buildings warehouses and uppermiddleclass neighborhoods the times building looked as though it were made of smoked glass and white plastic they stopped at a guard station and had to wait while a man in uniform called in to confirm their appointment before lifting the gate after they parked mccaleb took the legal pad from his bag to take in with him the bag itself had become too cumbersome to lug around he made sure graciela locked the car before they left it through automatic sliding doors they stepped into a twostory lobby of black marble and terracotta tile their steps echoed on the floor it was cold and austere and not unlike the papers coverage of the community some critics would say a whitehaired man in a uniform of matching blue pants and shirt came down a hallway and greeted them the oval patch above the pocket of his shirt said his name was clint before he got a chance to say it a set of professional ear protectors like those worn by ground crews at airports was around his neck graciela introduced herself and then mccaleb miss rivers all i can say is that were all real sorry here neff said your sister was a good gal a fine worker and a good friend to us thank you she was if you want to come back we can sit down for a minute and i can help you as best i can he led the way back down the hall walking in front of them and throwing conversation over his shoulder your sister probably told you but this is where we print all the papers for the valley edition and then most of the specials we insert in all the editions you know the tv magazine and whatnot yes i know graciela said you know i dont know what good ill be to you i told some of the crew you might want to talk to them too they said it would be fine they came to a set of stairs and went up is annette stapleton still on the night shift mccaleb asked uh actually no neff said he was winded from the climb nettie got sorta spooked after what happened with glory and i dont blame her a thing like that so shes on days now neff headed down another hallway toward a set of double doors shes here today sure is you can talk to her if youthe only thing i ask is that you talk to these folks on their breaks like nettie for example she goes to the break room at tenthirty and maybe well be done by then so you can talk with her then no problem mccaleb said after a few steps in silence neff turned around to look at mccaleb so you were an fbi man is that right right that mustve been pretty interesting sometimes how come you quit you look like a young man to me i guess it got a little too interesting mccaleb looked at graciela and winked she smiled mccaleb was saved from further personal inquiry by the noise of the press room they came to the thick double doors which barely contained the roar of the presses on the other side from a dispenser attached to the wall next to the doors neff pulled two plastic packages containing disposable foam earplugs and handed them to mccaleb and graciela better put these in while we walk through were running the whole line right now printing the book review a milliontwo copies those plugsll knock about thirty decibels off the sound you still cant hear yourself think though as they opened the packages and put in the plugs neff pulled his ear protectors up and into place he opened one of the doors and they walked along the line of presses the sensory impact was tactile as much as it was auditory the floor vibrated as if they had just stepped into a minor earthquake the earplugs did little to soften the highpitched keening of the presses a heavy thumping sound provided an underlying bass line neff led them to a door and into what was obviously the break room there were long lunch tables and a variety of vending machines the free spaces on the walls were taken up with corkboards cluttered with company and union announcements and safetyrelated warnings the noise was greatly decreased when the door swung shut they crossed the room and through another door entered neffs small office as neff pulled his ear set down around his neck again mccaleb and graciela pulled their plugs better hang on to those neff said you go out the way you came in depending on when that is we might be rolling out there mccaleb took the plastic bag out of his pocket and put the plugs in it neff took the seat behind his desk and signaled them to two in front of it the vinyl padding of the seat mccaleb was assigned was smeared with ink he hesitated before sitting dont worry neff said its dry for the next fifteen minutes they talked to neff about gloria torres and got very little usable or salient information it was clear that neff liked glory but it was also clear that his relationship was typical of most supervisoremployee interaction it was primarily job focused and there was little personal information passed back and forth when asked if he knew of anything that could have been troubling glory neff shook his head and said he wished he knew something that would help any disputes with fellow employees same shake of the head out of the blue mccaleb asked him if he knew james cordell whos that neff said what about donald kenyon what that savings and loan guy neff smiled yeah we were pals at the country club milken and that guy boesky hung out with us too mccaleb returned the smile and nodded it was clear neff was not going to be of much help his mind drifted and graciela asked neff questions about who glorys friends were mccaleb thought about the inkstained chair upon which he sat he knew where the ink came from probably everyone who sat in the chair before him was someone called in off the press line it was why they all wore the navy blue uniforms to hide the ink a thought occurred to him glory had been on her way home from work when she was killed but she wasnt in any uniform she had changed here but there had been nothing in the lapd report about detectives finding work clothes in her car or checking the contents of a locker excuse me mccaleb said interrupting neff as he told graciela about how skilled her sister was at driving a forklift that loaded huge rolls of newsprint into the presses is there a locker room did glory have a locker sure we got a locker room who wants to get into their automobile covered with ink weve got complete fa would glorys locker have been cleaned out yet neff sat back and thought a moment you know we got another hiring freeze here we havent been able to get permission to replace glory since we havent done that i doubt weve cleaned out her locker mccaleb felt a little jump maybe it was a break then is there a key can we look at it uh sure i suppose so i have to go get the master from the maintenance supervisor neff left them in his office while he went to get the master key and to find nettie stapleton since glorys locker was obviously in the womens locker room neff had said before leaving that nettie would escort graciela in to search its contents mccaleb would have to wait in the hallway with neff this did not sit well with mccaleb it was not that he didnt think graciela capable of searching a locker it was just that he would look at and treat the locker in its entirety taking in the subtleties of what he saw the way he studied crime scenes and crime scene tapes soon neff was back with stapleton and introductions were made she remembered graciela and offered seemingly heartfelt condolences neff then led the entourage downstairs to the hallway leading to the locker rooms mccaleb was going to make one last offer that if the locker room was empty he be allowed in but as they approached the door to the womens locker room he could hear the sound of the showers running he knew he was going to be left out mccaleb had run out of things to ask neff and was short of small talk while they waited he slowly sauntered away from the man so that he could avoid idle conversation and personal questions there were more bulletin boards affixed to the wall between the locker room doors and he acted as though he was reading some of the posted notices four minutes of silence went by in the hallway mccaleb had moved from one end of the sidebyside bulletin boards to the other when graciela and nettie finally came out he was staring at a handdrawn rendering of a liquid drop on a poster attached to the board the drop was half shaded in with red indicating that the employees were halfway toward their goal in an ongoing blood drive graciela walked up to him nothing she said just some clothes a bottle of perfume and her earphones there were four pictures of raymond and one of me taped to the door earphones i mean ear protectors but nothing else what kind of clothes mccaleb was still staring at the poster as he spoke a couple of fresh uniforms and a top from home and a pair of jeans you check all the pockets yes nothing it hit him then with the impact of an armorpiercing bullet he leaned forward and put his hand up against the bulletin board for support terry what is it graciela said are you okay he didnt respond his thoughts were racing graciela put her hand to his forehead to feel for fever he brushed it aside no its not that he said is there a problem neff chimed in no mccaleb said a little too loudly we just have to go i need to get to the car is everything all right yes mccaleb said again too loudly im sorry but everythings fine we just have to go mccaleb nodded his thanks to annette stapleton and headed down the hallway toward what he believed was the entrance lobby graciela followed and neff called after them telling them to take their first left what was that about whats going on mccaleb was walking quickly toward the car he felt that maintaining velocity would somehow help keep the growing dread he was feeling from entirely overtaking his thoughts graciela had to trot to keep up the blood the blood they both gave blood your sister and cordell it was right there in front of me all thei saw that poster and i remembered i saw a letter at cordells house and i just knew do you have your keys listen slow down terry slow down he reluctantly slowed his pace and she came up next to him digging the car keys out of her purse now tell me what you are talking about open the car and ill show you they reached the car she unlocked his door first and started around to her side he slipped in and reached across to open her door he then leaned forward and started going through the bag on the floor it was so jammed with paperwork he had to pull the gun out and place it on the floor mat just so there was room to look through the documents graciela got in the car and started watching you can start it he said without turning his attention from his task what are you doing he pulled out the cordell autopsy im looking forshit this is just the preliminary report he flipped through the protocol to make sure it was incomplete no toxicology and blood he shoved the autopsy report back into the bag and then the gun he straightened up weve got to find a phone ill call his wife graciela started the car fine she said we willwell go to my house but you have to tell me what it is youre thinking terry okay just give me a minute to think first he slowed the jumble of thoughts streaming through his mind and tried to analyze the jump he had just made im talking about the match he said the link what link what have we been missing what have we been looking for the link between these cases at first the connection was simply the randomness of crime thats what the cops thought thats what i thought when i first started looking at it we had two holdup victimsno connection other than the killer and the chance crossing of his path with the paths of these individuals this is la this sort of thing happens all the time the capital of random violence right graciela turned onto sherman way they were just a couple of minutes from her home right wrong because then we read more into it we discover a killer who takes personal icons and this suggests something more involved than random collisions of shooter and victim this suggests a deeper relationshipthe targeting stalking and acquisition of each victim mccaleb stopped they were passing the sherman market and they both wordlessly looked at the store as they went by mccaleb waited a moment longer before continuing then all of a sudden we get another wrinkle another layer of the onion is peeled back we get the ballistics and its a whole new ball game now we have another murder and what looks like a professional running through this a hitter why what could possibly be the connection between your sister james cordell and donald kenyon graciela didnt answer she was coming up on alabama now and moved the car into the leftturn lane blood he said blood has got to be the link she pulled into the driveway of her home she turned the engine off blood she said mccaleb stared straight ahead at the closed garage door he spoke slowly the dread finally catching up with him all this time ive been thinking what did she see what did she know whose path could she have crossed that would have gotten her killed you see i looked at her life and made a judgment i decided that she didnt have anything that anyone would want to take so the reason had to be elsewhere but i missed it missed it completely your sister was a good mother a good sister good employee and friend but the one thing she had that made her almost unique was her blood that made what she had inside her so very valuable to someone he waited a beat he still didnt look at her someone like me he heard her breath leaving her body and he felt as though it was the hope going out of him his hope of redemption youre saying she was taken for her organs you look at a poster back there and can say that he finally looked over at her i just knew it thats all he opened his door we call mrs cordell shell tell us her husbands blood type it will be ab with cmv negative perfect match then we get kenyons blood it too will match id bet on it he turned his body to get out it doesnt make sense she said because you told me mr cordell died right there at the bank his heart wasnt taken his organs its not the same and kenyon kenyon died at his house he got out and then leaned down and looked in at her she was looking out through the windshield now cordell and kenyon didnt work out he said the shooter learned from them he finally got it right with your sister mccaleb shut the door and walked toward the house it was a while before graciela caught up to him inside mccaleb sat down on a sectional couch in the living room and graciela brought him the phone from the kitchen he realized he had left amelia cordells number in his bag in the car he also realized that the car was unlocked and his gun was in the bag as well as he stepped back outside and approached the car his eyes casually swept the street he was looking for the car from the night before at the marina he saw nothing that remotely matched and no other cars parked along the curb with occupants inside back in the house again he sat on the couch and punched amelia cordells number into the phone while graciela sat down in the far corner of the couch and watched him with a distant look on her face the phone rang five times before a machine picked up mccaleb left his name number and the message that he needed james cordells blood type as soon as she could get it to him he clicked off the phone and looked at graciela do you know if she works she asked no she doesnt she could be anywhere he clicked the phone back on and called his own machine to check for messages there were nine the machine having accumulated them unplayed since saturday he listened to four messages from jaye winston and two from vernon carruthers that were outdated by events there was also gracielas message that she would be coming to the boat monday of the two remaining messages the first was from tony banks the video tech he told mccaleb that he had completed the job on the video he had dropped off the other message was from jaye winston again she had called that morning to tell mccaleb that his prediction had come true the bureau was increasing its involvement in the investigations of the murders hitchens had not only promised full cooperation but was abdicating lead status to agents nevins and uhlig she was frustrated mccaleb could easily read it in her voice but so was he he clicked off and blew out his breath now what graciela asked i dont know i need to confirm this this idea before i take the next step what about the sheriffs detective she should have the complete autopsy shed know the blood type no he didnt say anything else by way of explanation he looked around what he could see of the house from the couch it was small neatly furnished and kept there was a large framed photo of gloria torres on the top shelf of a china cabinet in the adjoining dining room why dont you want to call her graciela asked im not sure i just i want to figure things out a little bit before i talk to her i think i should wait a little while and see if i hear from mrs cordell what about calling the coroners office directly no i dont think that would work either what he was leaving unsaid was the fact that if he confirmed his theory it would mean that anyone who benefited from glorys death would rightly have to be considered a suspect that included him therefore he did not want to make any inquiry to authorities that might set that into motion not until he was ready with a few more answers with which to defend himself i know graciela suddenly said the computer in the blood labi can probably confirm it there unless his names been deleted but i doubt that i remember coming across the name of a donor who had been dead four years and he was still on there what she was saying made little sense to mccaleb what are you talking about he asked she looked at her watch and jumped up from her chair let me change and then we have to hurry ill explain everything on the way she then disappeared down a hallway and mccaleb heard a bedroom door close they got to holy cross shortly before noon graciela parked in the front lot and they went into the hospital through the general admissions entrance she did not want to go through the emergency room since that was where she worked she explained on the way over that she had been taking a lot of personal days off with little notice to be with raymond since glorias death but the patience of her supervisors was wearing thin she didnt think it would be wise to take the day off on one days notice and flaunt it by walking through the emergency room besides what they were about to do could get her fired the fewer people who saw her the better once inside the hospital graciela her nurses uniform and her familiar face got them where they needed to go she was like an ambassador for whom all barriers were lifted no one stopped them no one questioned them they took a staff elevator to the fourth floor arriving a few minutes past twelve graciela had told mccaleb her plan on the way over she figured they could count on having fifteen minutes to do what they had to do that was the maximumjust the time it would take for the blood supplies coordinator to go down to the hospital cafeteria get her lunch and then bring it back up to the pathology lab the bsc actually had an hour lunch break but it was routine in that job to eat lunch at your desk because there was no replacement while you were gone the bsc was a nursing position but because the job did not involve direct patient care no one filled in the spot when the bsc went on break as graciela expected they got to the path lab at and found the bsc desk empty mccaleb felt his pulse quicken a little bit as he looked at the flying toasters floating across the screen of the computer sitting on the desk however the desk sat in a large open lab station about ten feet from the computer desk was another desk where a woman in a nurses uniform sat graciela showed nothing but ease with the situation hey patrice whats the haps she said cheerfully the woman turned from the files she was dealing with in front of her and smiled she glanced at mccaleb but then looked back at graciela graciela she said drawing each syllable out and overdoing the latin inflection like a television news anchor nothings happening girl how bout you nada whos the bsc and wheres the bsc its patty kirk for a few days she went down to get a sandwich a couple minutes ago hmmmm graciela said as if it had just dawned on her well im going to make a quick connect she came around the counter and headed toward the computer weve got an scw down in emergency with rare blood i have a feeling this guys going to run through everything we got and i want to see whats out there you couldve just called up i wouldve run it for you i know but im showing my friend terry how we do things around here terry this is patrice patrice terry hes premed ucla im seeing if i cant talk him out of it patrice looked at mccaleb and smiled again then her eyes studied him in an appraising way he knew what she was thinking i know its kind of late he said its a midlife crisis sort of thing i should say so good luck during residency ive seen twentyfiveyearolds come out of that looking like they were fifty i know ill be ready they smiled at each other and the conversation was finally over patrice went back to her files and mccaleb looked at graciela who was seated in front of the computer the toasters were gone and the screen was awake there was some sort of template with white boxes on it you can come around she said patrice wont bite you patrice laughed but didnt say anything mccaleb came around and stood behind her chair she looked up at him and winked knowing that he was blocking any view patrice had of her he winked back and smiled her coolness was impressive he looked at his watch and then held his arm down so she could see it was now seven after twelve she turned her attention to the computer now were looking for type ab blood okay so what we do is log on here and connect with bopra thats short for blood and organ procurement and request agency thats the big regional blood bank we deal with most hospitals around here do right she reached up and ran her finger beneath a small piece of paper taped to the monitor above the screen there was a sixdigit number written on it mccaleb knew this was the access code on the drive over graciela had explained how little security was attached to the bopra system the code to access the computer was changed monthly but the bsc position at holy cross was not a fulltime position meaning that nurses assigned to it were put through on rotation this rotation was also routinely disrupted because nurses who had colds viruses and any other maladies that did not require them to miss work but required that they be kept away from patients were often assigned to the bsc desk because of the high number of people working in the slot the bopra code was simply taped to the monitor each month when it was changed in eight years as a nurse graciela had worked at two other hospitals in los angeles she had said that this practice was the same at each of those hospitals as well bopra had a security system in place that was circumvented in probably every hospital it served graciela typed in the code number followed by the modem command and mccaleb heard the computer dial and then connect to the bopra computer connecting to the mother station graciela said mccaleb looked at his watch they had eight minutes at the most left the screen went through some welcome templates before settling on an identification and request checklist graciela quickly typed in the needed information and continued to describe what she was doing now we go to the blood request page we type in what we are looking for and then hocus pocus we wait she held her hands in front of the screen and wiggled her fingers graciela hows raymond doing patrice asked from behind them mccaleb turned and looked back but patrice was still working with her back to them hes good graciela answered it still breaks my heart but hes doing good ah thats good you gotta bring him in again i will but he has school maybe spring break the screen started printing out an inventory of the availability of type ab blood and the hospital or blood bank location of each pint while bopra was a blood bank itself it also served as a coordinating agency for smaller banks and hospitals throughout the west okay graciela said so now we see that there is a pretty good supply of this around the doctor wants to have at least six units on standby in case our patient with the sucking chest wound needs more surgery so we click on the order window and put the hold on six a hold only lasts twentyfour hours if its not updated by this time tomorrow that blood is up for grabs okay mccaleb said acting like the student he was supposed to be ill have to remember to tell patty to update this tomorrow what if you called this up and there was no blood on the drive over she had told him to ask the question if there was anyone else in the nurses station when they connected to bopra good question she said as she began moving the computer mouse this is what we do we go to this icon with the blood droplet on it we click and that gets us to the donors file we wait again a few seconds went by and then the screen began filling with names addresses phone numbers and other information these are all blood donors with type ab it shows where they are how they can be contacted and this other information shows when they gave blood last you dont want to keep going to the same person all the time you try to spread it out and you try to find someone either near to us so they can just come in here or near to a blood bank you want it to be convenient for them as she spoke she ran her finger down the list of names there were about twentyfive of them from all over the west she stopped at her sisters name and tapped the screen with her fingernail then she kept going her finger reached the bottom without coming across the names james cordell or donald kenyon mccaleb loudly let out his breath in disappointment but graciela raised her finger in a onemoment gesture she then hit the screen up key and a new screen of names appeared there were maybe fifteen more the name james cordell sat on top of the new list she ran her finger down the screen and found donald kenyons name second from the last this time mccalebs breath caught and he just nodded graciela looked up at him the somber look of confirmation in her eyes mccaleb leaned close to the screen and read the information that followed the names cordell hadnt given blood for nine months and it had been more than six years since kenyon had spared a drop mccaleb noticed that the final notation after each name was the letter d followed by an asterisk other names had one or the other but only a few had the combination of both mccaleb reached down and tapped the screen below the letter whats that deceased no graciela said in a quiet voice the d means donor organ donor they signed papers put it on their drivers licenses all of that so that if the time comes that they come into a hospital and die they can take the organs she looked at him the whole time she said this and mccaleb found it hard to look back at her he knew what the confirmation meant and the asterisk im not sure she scrolled the screen until she got back to the legend at the top she ran her finger along the symbols until she got to the asterisk it means cmv negative she said most people carry a nonthreatening blood virus called cmv its short for some big word about a quarter of the population doesnt have it its something that has to be known to make a complete blood work match between donors and recipients he nodded it was information he already knew so thats todays lesson graciela said quietly she moved the mouse and mccaleb saw the arrow move to the disconnect icon at the top of the screen he reached down and grabbed her hand before she could click the mouse button and sign off the bopra system graciela looked back up at him the question on her face mccaleb looked back at patrice he couldnt talk he looked around and saw a clipboard on the counter with some forms on it and a pencil connected to it with a string he signaled with his hand to graciela pointing to patrice and then back to her and making a talking sign with his fingers he then grabbed the clipboard and started to write hey uh patrice hows charlie doing graciela asked oh hes fine still an asshole boy you guys get along so gooood yeah were real lovebirds mccaleb held the clipboard in front of graciela he had written three questions can you print out that list can you call up your sisters file who got her organs graciela hiked her shoulders and mouthed the words i dont know to him she then turned to the computer and went to work first she printed out the list of type ab donors thankfully the computer was attached to a laser printer which did the job almost silently and patrice paid no notice mccaleb quickly folded the list lengthwise and put it in his inside coat pocket next graciela went back to the original welcome screen and pulled down a window of commands she clicked the mouse on an icon that showed a red heart a screen that saidorgan pro curement services appeared and there was another template seeking an access code graciela hiked her shoulders looked up at the code taped above the screen and typed it in again nothing the arrow switched to an hourglass and nothing happened mccaleb looked at his watch it was the end of the window of opportunity they had agreed upon patty kirk would be back any moment and they would be discovered when she had planned all of this out graciela hadnt said anything about how they would explain what they were doing if they were caught i think the computers freezing graciela said out of frustration she whacked the side of the monitor with an open hand mccaleb always considered it amazing how many people thought this might help a computer he was about to tell her not to bother when he heard the wheels of patrices chair move he turned to see her getting up maybe she was going to take a shot at the computer also there it goes graciela said mccaleb kept his body between patrices view and the computer damned thing patrice said its always doing that im going to go upstairs to the porch for a coke and a smoke see you later graciela she smiled at mccaleb and nice to meet you she added mccaleb smiled nice to meet you he said see you later patrice graciela added patrice walked around the counter and out into the hallway she never looked at the computer screen as she passed when she was gone mccaleb looked down at the screen there was a flashing message across it level access only try again whats that mean it means i dont have the code to get into that file what time is it time to go sign off she clicked on the disconnect button and mccaleb heard the chickchick sound of the telephone connection being broken what were you doing graciela asked what did you want ill tell you later lets get out of here she got up moved the chair back the way she had found it and they hurried around the counter out in the hallway they took the first right and headed back toward the elevators they walked quickly as if they were thieves there was a woman coming toward them carrying a can of coke and a styrofoam sandwich box she was about eighty feet away and she was smiling at graciela oh shit mccaleb whispered is that yes were cool no stall her why were fine he raised his hand to rub his nose and block his words from traveling to the approaching woman the screen saver they dont usually come on for at least a minute shell know it doesnt matter were not stealing government secrets as it turned out graciela didnt have to stall patty kirk stalled herself graciela what are you doing here she said as they approached i just saw jane tompkins in the cafeteria and she was bitchin about you not coming in again they stopped and patty kirk stopped dont tell her i was here graciela urged well what are you doing she raised her hand to signal gracielas uniform this is my friend terry hes premed ucla i told him i would show him around today cause he might transfer his residency here i thought with the pinks on it would be a lot easier to get around terry this is patty kirk they shook hands and smiled mccaleb asked how she was doing and she said fine he had visions of those flying toasters finally returning to her computer screen patty kirk looked back at graciela and shook her head janies going to kill you if she finds out she thought it was something with raymond again you owe me big time for this girl i know i know just dont tell her okay everybody is mad at me down there shes the only friend ive got left they said their goodbyes and mccaleb and graciela moved on to the elevator when patty kirk was out of earshot graciela asked if the stall was long enough depends on what the screensaver is set on but its probably okay lets get out of here back in the rabbit graciela drove out of the hospital lot and headed to the freeway to go south where to now she asked im not sure we have to get into bopra somehow we need the list of recipients but i doubt we could just drive up and theyd give them to us where is bopra anyway west la near the airport but you are right youre not going to just go in there and be given a list the whole system is built on confidentiality i only found you because somebody told me about that newspaper story right he said he was already past that his mind was racing and it finally snagged on an idea they were coming up to the freeway entrance lets go over the hill to cedars i think i know somebody who will help us they first went to bonnie foxs office in the cedars west tower the waiting room was empty and foxs receptionist a woman named gladys who never smiled confirmed that the doctor was not in shes up in north and i dont expect her back here today gladys said maintaining her frown are you here for your records no not quite yet mccaleb thanked her and they left he knew the translation of what gladys had told them was that fox was making her rounds on the sixth floor of the north tower the hospital they took the third floor bridge across to north and then the elevator up to the sixth floor cardiology and transplant ward mccaleb was growing tired of lugging the heavy leather bag with him mccaleb had been on six often enough not to seem out of place graciela still in her nursing uniform fit in even better mccaleb led the way down the hall to the left of the elevators to where the transplant waiting and recovery rooms were located as well as the transplant nursing station there was a good chance he would find fox somewhere in the area as they made their way down the long hallway mccaleb looked through the doors that were open he didnt see fox but he saw the frail forms of mostly older men on beds these were the rooms for those who waited hooked to machines their time getting close and their chances dimming like the quieting of their hearts as they passed one room mccaleb saw the young boy he had seen before the boy was sitting up on a bed watching television he appeared to be alone in the room the wires and tubes snaked out of the sleeve of his hospital gown and ran to the machines and monitors after he discerned that fox was not in the room mccaleb quickly looked away the young ones were the hardest to take to even acknowledge their organs so new yet inexplicably failing them a terrible and sometimes fatal life lesson learned for nothing that they had done for a moment mccalebs mind flashed on the everglades the gathering of investigators on airboats at devils keep the black hole into which disappeared his belief that there is a good and valid reason for everything they were in luck as they made the turn to the nurses station mccaleb saw bonnie fox leaning over the counter and sliding a patient file out of a vertical rack as she straightened up she turned and saw them terry hey doc whats wrong are you no no everythings fine he held his hands up in a calming gesture then what are you doing up here your records are at my office she seemed to notice graciela then and clearly didnt recognize her this added to the confusion already growing on her face im not here about the records mccaleb said is there a rooman empty roomthat we can use for a few minutes we need to talk to you terry im in the middle of checking on my patients here its not right for you to come in here and expect me to its important doctor very important give me five minutes and im sure youll agree if you dont were out of here ill go pick up my records and be gone she shook her head in annoyance and turned to look at one of the nurses behind the counter anne what do we have open one of the nurses leaned to her left and ran her finger down a clipboard ten eighteen thirtysix take your pick ill be in eighteen since its close to mr koslow if he rings tell him i will be in there in five minutes she looked sternly at mccaleb as she said the last two words walking quickly fox led them back down the hallway and into room mccaleb entered last and closed the door behind them he put the heavy bag down on the floor fox leaned her hips against the empty bed put the patient file down next to her and folded her arms mccaleb could feel the anger coming from her and directed squarely at him you have five minutes who is this this is graciela rivers mccaleb said i told you about her fox studied graciela with unsparing eyes youre the one who started him on this she said you know he wont listen to me but youre a nurse you should know better look at him his color the lines under his eyes a week ago he was fine he was perfect goddammit id already taken his file off my desk and put it away thats how sure i was about him now she gestured toward mccalebs appearance as proof of her point i only did what i felt i had to do graciela said i had to ask its been my choice mccaleb interrupted everything my choice fox dismissed their explanations with an annoyed shake of her head she stepped away from the bed and signaled to mccaleb to sit down take off your shirt and sit down start talking youre down to about four minutes now im not taking off my shirt doctor i want you to listen to what i have to say not how many times my heart is beating fine talk you want to take me away from patients i need to see fine talk she rapped her knuckles on the patient file on the bed mr koslow here hes in the same boat you were in a couple months ago im trying to keep him alive until maybe a heart comes along then ive got a thirteenyearold boy who are you going to let me tell you why were here or not i cant help it i am so angry at you well listen to this and maybe it will change how you feel i think thats impossible can i tell it or not fox held her hands up in surrender pursed her lips and bowed to him finally mccaleb began the story he took ten minutes to summarize the story of his investigation but that was all right by the fiveminute mark fox was so transfixed that she wasnt noticing the time she let him tell it without a single interruption thats it he said when he was done thats why we are here foxs eyes moved back and forth between them for a few moments while she tried to comprehend what mccaleb had just told her she then began to move about the small space of the room as she recounted her understanding of the story she wasnt pacing it was more as though she needed to make room for the story in her mind and was manifesting that need in small movements back and forth that expanded the personal space around her you are saying that you start off with a person who needs an organheart lung liver kidney whatever but like you they are of the rare blood group that is type ab with cmv negative what that translates to is a long long possibly unsuccessful wait because only maybe one in two hundred people are in that group meaning that likewise only one in two hundred lets say livers that come along would match this person so have i got this right you are saying this person decided to improve his odds by going out and shooting people who are in his group because then their organs would become available for transplant she said it with too much sarcasm and that annoyed mccaleb but rather than object he just nodded and that he got the names of these people in his group from a list of blood donors in the bopra computer right but you dont know how he got it we dont know for sure but we do know that bopras security system is highly vulnerable to compromise from his pocket mccaleb took out the list that graciela had printed at holy cross he unfolded it and handed it to fox i was able to get that today and i dont know the first thing about hacking into computers fox took the page and waved it at graciela but you had her to help we dont know who this person is or who they had to help them we have to assume that if this person has the connections and ability to hire a contract killer then he or she could get into the bopra computer the point is it could be done mccaleb pointed to the list right there is all thats needed everybody on that list is in the group he would pick one of the donors he would pick somebody young do some research kenyon was young and fit a tennis player equestrian cordell was young and strong anybody who watched him over some time would know he was fit a surfer skier mountain biker they both were perfect then why kill themas some sort of practice fox asked no not practice it was the real thing but each time things went wrong with kenyon the shooter used a fragmenting bullet that pulped his brain and he was dead before they could even get him to the hospital the killer refined his method he switched to a full metal jacket load that was fired across the front of the brain a fatal injury yes but not instantaneous a man who drove up called it in on a cellular phone cordell was alive but the address got screwed up and the paramedics went to the wrong place meantime time goes by the victim dies at the scene and again the organs were never harvested fox said understanding now i hate that word graciela said her first words in a long time what fox asked harvested i hate that these organs arent harvested theyre given by people who cared about other people they arent crops on a farm fox nodded and looked silently at graciela seemingly taking her measure all over again it didnt work with cordell but it was not because of the method mccaleb continued so the shooter just went back to his list of potential donors he the list from the bopra computer right he goes back to the list and picks gloria torres the process starts again he watches knows her routine also knows she is healthy and will do mccaleb looked at graciela as he said this afraid the harshness of it would bring another response she remained quiet fox spoke and so now you want to follow this trail of harvested organs and you think the killeror the person who hired the killerwill have one of them do you realize what this sounds like i know how it sounds mccaleb said quickly before she could build on her doubts but there is no other explanation we need your help with bopra i dont know think about it what are the odds that it could be just a coincidence that the same mana contract killer most likelyjust happens to gun down three different people from the exact same oneintwohundred blood group you couldnt figure those odds with a computer because it cant be coincidence its the blood work the blood work is the connection the blood work is the motive fox walked away from them and to the window mccaleb followed and stood next to her the room looked down on beverly boulevard he saw the string of businesses across the street the mystery bookshop and the deli with the get well soon sign on the roof he looked at fox and it looked as though she was staring at her own reflection in the window i have patients waiting she said we need your help what exactly can i do im not sure but i think you stand a better chance of getting information out of bopra than us why dont you just go to the police they have the best chance why are you involving me i cant go to them not yet i go to them and im out of it off the case think about what i just told you im a suspect thats crazy i know that but they wont besides that doesnt matter this is personal i owe it to glory torres and i owe it to graciela im not going to sit on the sidelines on this one a small bit of silence slipped by doctor graciela had come up behind them they turned to her you have to help if you dont then all of thiseverything you do heremeans nothing if you cant protect the integrity of the system you work in then you have no system the two women stared at each other for a long moment and then fox smiled sadly and nodded go to my office and wait for me she said i have to see mr koslow and one other patient it will take me a half hour at the most after that ill come to the office and make the call the coordinators office glenn leopold please this is bonnie fox calling they were in foxs office with the door closed fox had the phone speaker on so mccaleb and graciela could listen they had waited for her a half hour before she had come in her demeanor was different she was still going to help but mccaleb noticed that she was more agitated than she had appeared when they had gathered in the empty patient room in the north tower they had gone over a plan mccaleb came up with while waiting fox had taken a couple of notes to refer to and then placed the call bonnie hi glenn how are you im fine what can i do you for ive got about ten minutes before a meeting this shouldnt take long ive got a slight problem here glenn and i think you might be able to help me tell me i performed a transplant here february ninthit was bopra file number ninetyeight thirtysixand a complication has come up what id like to do is speak with the surgeons who performed transplants with the donors other organs there was a brief silence before leopolds voice came up on the speaker again uh lets see i mean this is kind of unusual what sort of complication are we talking about bonnie well i know you have your meeting to make it as brief as possible the recipients blood group was type ab with cmv negative the organ we received through bopra matched thataccording to the protocol but nowwhat are we nine weeks or so postopour recipient has developed cmv virus and we are showing rejection in the blood work from the latest biopsy i am trying to isolate how this has happened more silence well i think it would have come up before now if it came in with the heart thats true but we werent looking for it before we assumed based on the protocol that there was no cmv dont get me wrong glenn i am not saying it came in with the heart but i have to find out where it came from and i want to cover everything best place to start is with the heart are you trying to isolate this as you say at the request of attorneys because if thats what you are doing then i think i need to get my no no glenn this is just me i need to know if the virus came in with the organ or there wasisa problem right here well what blood did you use thats just it we only used the patients own blood i have the file right here he stored eight units long before surgery we only used six and you are sure you used his six leopolds voice was now showing some agitation fox was looking at mccaleb as she answered and he saw how uncomfortable it was for her to be deceitful with the bopra organ coordinator all i can say is that we followed procedures and i personally doublechecked the bag labels before surgery they were his labels i have to assume it was his blood what do you want from us bonnie a list what organ went to what patient and the attending surgeon i can call i dont know i think maybe i should glenn listen it is nothing personal but my patient is having this problem and i need to check this out for myself i have to be satisfied myself i will keep it contained if thats what you are worried about no one is talking about lawyers or malpractice we just need to find out how this happened for all we know you are right its a blood mixup but i am sure you would agree that the place to start with something like this is with the new tissue thats been introduced to the patient mccaleb held his breath they were at the pivotal point fox needed to get the names herself she couldnt let leopold say he would check it out himself and get back to her i suppose leopold trailed off and fox leaned forward folded her arms on the desk and put her head down in the silence mccaleb heard a sound from the phone that he identified as computer keys being tapped he felt a slight charge as he realized that leopold was probably calling up the file on his computer mccaleb stood up and leaned over the desk and gently tapped fox on the elbow she looked up at him and he made a circular motion with his hand signaling her to keep going glenn she said what do you think im looking at it right now harvest occurred at holy cross there is nothing here on the donor profile indicating cmv nothing this person was a longtime blood donor i think it would have come up before if she thats probably true but i need to doublecheck even if just for my own peace of mind i understand more sounds of the computer keyboard being played lets see transportation was by medicair the liver was transplanted right there with the heart at cedars do you know dr spivak daniel spivak no mccaleb grabbed a legal pad from his bag and started writing well he did that one lets see the lungs ill call spivak fox interrupted whats the patients name um im really going to have to ask you to keep all of this in the strictest confidence bonnie absolutely it was a male j b dickey mccaleb wrote it down okay fox said you were on to the lungs uh yes lungs no takers without the heart your patient got the heart right what about bone marrow transfer you want everything i guess the marrow uh the marrow we did not do well with we missed the window the tissue was flown to san francisco but by the time medicair got up there they had a weather delay they were redirected to san jose but with the delay and the ground traffic and everything it took too long getting up to st joseph s we missed the chance from what i understand the patient later expired as you know this blood group is tough that was probably our one chance on that one that brought another measure of silence mccaleb looked at graciela her eyes were downcast and he couldnt read her for the first time he considered what she was going through they were talking about her sister and the people she had helped save but it was all said in such a clinical manner graciela was a nurse and was used to such discussions about patients but not her sister mccaleb wrote bone marrow on the page and then drew a line through the words he then made the keepitrolling hand motion to fox again what about kidneys she asked the kidneys the kidneys were split lets see what weve got on the kidneys over the next four minutes leopold went down the list of items mined from the body of gloria torres and redistributed to living patients mccaleb wrote it all down now keeping his eyes on the legal pad and not wanting to look at graciela again to see how she was handling having to listen to such a grim inventory thats it leopold finally said mccaleb energized by getting the names but exhausted by the cliff walk it took in getting them blew his breath out loudly too loudly bonnie leopold said quietly are you alone you didnt tell me you were with no its just me glenn im alone silence fox threw an angry look at mccaleb then closed her eyes tightly and waited well okay leopold finally said i thought i heard someone else there thats all and i have to reiterate that this information is highly confidential in i know that glenn nature ive broken my own rules by giving it to you i understand fox opened her eyes i will make my inquiries discreetly glenn and ill let you know what i find perfect after a few more exchanges of small talk the call was ended fox pushed the phones disconnect button and brought her head back down on her folded arms god i cant believe what i just did i lied to this man lied to a colleague when he finds out hes she didnt finish she just shook her head on the cradle of her arms doctor mccaleb tried you did the right thing there is no harm to him and hell probably never know what was done with the information tomorrow you can call him and say you isolated the cmv problem and it wasnt from the donor tell him you destroyed the notes on the other recipients fox brought her head up and looked at him it doesnt matter i was deceitful i hate having to be deceitful if he finds out hell never trust me again mccaleb just looked at her he had no answer to that you have to promise me one thing fox said that if your theory proves out that if you are right then you get whoever did this that will be the only way ill be able to accept this it will be my only defense mccaleb nodded he came around the desk and leaned down and hugged fox thank you graciela said softly you did good fox smiled weakly at her and nodded one last thing mccaleb said do you have a copying machine the elevator down was packed and silent except for the music piped in which mccaleb identified as an old louis jordan recording of knock me a kiss as they stepped out mccaleb pointed graciela in the direction of the doors leading to the tramway that would take her to the parking garage you go that way why where are you going im just going to take a cab back to the boat well what are you going to do i want to go with you he pulled her to the side of the busy elevator lobby youve got to go back home to raymond and your job in fact raymond hes your job this is my job this is what you asked me to do i know but i want to help you did help you are helping but youve got to go to raymond im going out through the emergency room there are always cabs down there she frowned he could tell by her expression that she knew he was right but it didnt sit well he reached into his pocket and pulled out the photocopy of the list he had made in foxs office here take this if something happens to me you have a copy give it to jaye winston at the sheriffs office what do you mean if something happens her voice was almost shrill and mccaleb immediately regretted his choice of words he moved her into a little alcove where there were pay phones no one was using the phones and they had a small measure of privacy he put the bag on the floor between his feet and leaned forward so his eyes were close to hers dont worry nothing is going to happen he said its just that all this work ive done ever since you came to the boat that day it all has led to this the names on this paper i just think its better if we both have a copy of it thats all do you really think the killers name is on there i dont know thats what im going to think about and work on when i get to the boat i can help you i know you can graciela you already have but right now you have to pull back a little bit and be with raymond you dont have to worry i am going to be on the phone telling you everything that happens remember im working for you she tried a half smile no youre not all i had to do was tell you about glory and after that you were doing what your heart told you maybe how about if i take you and just drop you off at the boat no way that will take you into rush hour and youll be driving for two hours go now while you can go be with raymond she finally nodded still leaning down into her face mccaleb brought his hands up to her shoulders and gently pulled her into a kiss graciela what theres something else too what is it i want you to think about this think about if im right i have to think about this what do you mean if im right if somebody killed glory for something she had inside then in a way they killed her for me as well i got a part of her too if thats true then can we he didnt finish the question and she didnt say anything for a long moment her eyes dropped their focus to his chest i know that she finally said but you didnt do anything you didnt cause this well i want you to think about it and just be sure she nodded its gods way of making something good out of something so bad mccaleb leaned his forehead against hers he didnt say anything i know what you told me and i know that story about aubreylynn its all the more reason to believe i wish you would try he pulled her into an embrace and whispered into her ear okay ill try a man with a thick briefcase stepped into the alcove and went to one of the phones he glanced at them and did a double take when he saw gracielas nursing uniform he obviously believed it was a cedars nurse engaging in some form of unprofessional conduct it ended the moment for mccaleb he broke the embrace and looked into gracielas face you be careful and say hello to raymond for me tell him i want to go fishing again she smiled and nodded you be careful too and call me i will she leaned forward and kissed him quickly and then headed off in the direction of the parking garage mccaleb glanced at the man on the phone and then walked away in the opposite direction there were no taxi cabs waiting at the curb outside the emergency room mccaleb decided to change his plan he hadnt eaten anything since breakfast and was growing weak with hunger he felt a lowgrade migraine beginning to throb at the base of his skull and knew if he didnt refuel it would soon crawl over the top of him and encase his whole head he decided to call buddy lockridge to come get him then have a turkey and coleslaw sandwich from across the street at jerrys deli while he waited the more he thought about the good sandwiches they made over there the hungrier he got once buddy arrived they could drive over to video grafx consultants in hollywood to pick up the tape and the hard copy of the frame tony banks had enhanced for him he quickly stepped back into the er lobby and over to the pay phone alcove there was a young woman on one of the phones tearfully telling someone about somebody else who was apparently being treated in the er mccaleb noticed that one nostril and her lower lip were pierced with silver hoops connected by a chain of safety pins he didnt know me he didnt know danny she wailed hes totally fucked up and theyre also calling the cops momentarily distracted by the safety pins and wondering what would happen if the woman yawned mccaleb picked up the phone furthest from her and tried to tune her out he was about to give up on lockridge after six ringson a boat like the doubledown you cant be more than four rings awaywhen buddy finally picked up yo buddy ready to go to work terry before mccaleb could answer lockridges voice dropped to a whisper man where are you at cedars i need you to pick me up whats the matter well ill pick you up but im not sure you want to come back here buddy listen to me skip the bullshit and tell me exactly what is going on im not sure man but youve got people all over your boat what people well two of them are those two guys in the suits who were here yesterday nevins and uhlig they are inside my boat yeah inside also they pulled the cover off your cherokee and have a tow truck out there i think theyre going to take it i went over there to see what was going on and they almost put me down on the boards showed me their badges and a search warrant and told me to get lost they werent nice about it theyre searching the boat shit mccaleb looked over and saw that his outburst had drawn the attention of the crying woman he turned his back toward her buddy where are you up top or below below can you see my boat right now sure im looking out the galley window how many people you see well some are inside but altogether i think there are four or five of them over there and theres a couple more with the cherokee is there a woman yeah mccaleb described jaye winston as best as he could and lockridge confirmed that a woman matching the description was on the boat shes in the salon right now it looked like before when i was looking at her that she was just sort of watching mccaleb nodded his mind was running over the possibilities of what was happening each way he looked at it things added up the same way the fact that nevins and uhlig knew he had fbi documents would not have engendered such a responsea warrant search with a full team there was only one other possibility he had become an official suspect accepting this he thought about how nevins and uhlig would conduct an evidentiary search buddy he said have you seen them taking anything off the boat im talking about in plastic bags or brown paper bags like from luckys yeah theres been some bags they put them up on the dock but you dont have to worry terror what do you mean i dont think theyre going to find what theyre really looking for what are you not on the phone man you want me to come get you now mccaleb stopped what was he saying what was going on hang tight he finally said ill call you right back mccaleb hung up and immediately dropped in another quarter he called his own phone number no one answered the machine answered and he heard his own taperecorded voice telling him to leave a message after the beep he said jaye winston if youre there pick up he waited for a beat of silence and was about to say it again when the phone was picked up he felt a slight sense of relief when he recognized winstons voice this is winston this is mccaleb that was all he figured he would see how she wanted to play it he would be better able to judge where he stood by the way she handled the call uh terry she said how did youwhere are you whatever relief he was feeling now started to slip away its replacement was dread he had given her the opportunity to talk to him obliquely perhaps in code acting as though she was talking to a fellow deputy or even captain hitchens but she had used his name doesnt matter where i am he said what are you doing on my boat why dont you come here and well talk about it no i want to talk about it now im a suspect thats what this is about look terry dont make this more complicated than it has to be why dont you is there an arrest warrant just answer me that no terry there isnt but i am a suspect terry why didnt you tell me you have a black cherokee mccaleb was stunned as he suddenly realized how things fit together with him in the middle you never asked listen to what you are saying what you are thinking would i get involved in all of this the investigation bring the bureau in all of it if i was the shooter are you serious you got to our only witness what you got to noone you got inside the investigation and got to the only witness you hypnotized him terry now hes no good to us the one person who might have been able to make the id and we lost him he she stopped as there was a click as another phone was picked up mccaleb this is nevins whats your location nevins im not talking to you youve got your head up your ass im only listen to me im trying to be civil we can do this easy and quiet or we can go big time you decide my friend you have to come in and well talk about it and let the chips fall mccalebs mind quickly went over the facts nevins and the others had come to the same conclusion that he had come to they had made the blood work connection the fact that mccaleb was a direct beneficiary of the torres killing made him a suspect he imagined them running his name on the computer and coming up with the registration of the cherokee it was probably the piece that sent them over the top they got a search warrant and went to the boat mccaleb felt the cold hand of fear clasp his neck the intruder from the night before it began to dawn on him that it wasnt a question of what he had wanted it was what had he planted he thought about what buddy had said moments before about the agents not finding what they were looking for and the picture was taking form nevins ill come in but you tell me first what have you got there what have you found no terry we dont play it like that you come in and then we talk about all of this im hanging up nevins last chance dont go in any post offices mccaleb your pictures going to be on the wall as soon as we get the package together mccaleb hung up held his hand on the phone and leaned his forehead against it he wasnt sure what was going on or what to do what had they found what had the intruder hidden in the boat you okay he jerked around and it was the girl with the pierced nose and lip fine you i am now i just had to talk to somebody i know the feeling she left the phone alcove then and mccaleb picked up the receiver again and dropped another quarter buddy picked up on half a ring all right listen mccaleb said i want you to come get me but youre not going to be able to just walk out of there how come its a free because i just talked to them and they know someone tipped me that they were there so this is what i want you to do take off your shoes and put your keys and wallet inside them then get your laundry basket and stick your shoes in it and cover them up with clothes then carry the basket out of there and make i dont have any laundry in the basket terry i did laundry this morning before any of these people showed up fine buddy take some clothesclean clothesand put them in the basket so it looks like youve got dirty clothes hide your shoes make it look like you are only going over to the laundry dont close the hatch on your boat and make sure you are carrying four quarters in your hand theyll stop you but if you play it right theyll believe you and let you go then get in your car and come get me they might follow me no they probably wont even watch you once they let you go to the laundry maybe you should go to the laundry first then to your car okay so where do i find you mccaleb didnt hesitate he had grown to trust lockridge besides he knew he could take precautions on his end after hanging up mccaleb called tony banks and told him that he would be coming by banks said he would be there mccaleb walked into jerrys famous deli and ordered a turkey sandwich with coleslaw and russian dressing to go he also ordered a sliced pickle and a can of coke after he paid for the sandwich he took it out and crossed beverly boulevard back to cedars he had spent so many days and nights in the medical center he knew its layout by rote he took the elevator to the third floor maternity ward where he knew of a waiting room that looked out across the helipad to beverly boulevard and jerrys it was not unusual to see an expectant father wolfing down a deli sandwich in the waiting room mccaleb knew he could sit up there and eat and wait and watch for buddy lockridge the sandwich lasted less than five minutes but the wait for buddy lockridge went on for an hour with no sighting of lockridge mccaleb watched two helicopters come in with deliveries of transplant organs packed in red coolers he was about to call the doubledown to see if the agents had held lockridge up when he finally saw buddys familiar taurus pull up to the front of the deli mccaleb walked to the window and looked long and far up and down beverly boulevard then checked the sky for anything that looked like a law enforcement helicopter he left the window and headed to the elevator a plastic laundry basket full of clothes was on the backseat of the taurus mccaleb got in looked at it and then over at lockridge who was playing some unrecognizable tune on his harp thanks for coming buddy any problems lockridge dropped the harmonica into the door pocket nah they stopped me like you said they would and asked their questions but i played dumb they let me go i think it was cause i only had the four quarters on me that they let me go that was a smart move terry well see who was it who stopped you the two suits no it was two other guys and they were cops not agents at least they said so but they didnt give me their names was one a big wide guy latino with maybe a toothpick in his mouth you got it thats him arrango mccaleb found a little bit of satisfaction in putting one past the pompous jerk so where to buddy asked mccaleb had thought about this while he waited and he knew he had to get to work on the list of transplant recipients he had to get on it quickly but before he did that he wanted to make sure he had all his ducks in a row he had come to look at investigations as being similar to the extension ladders on fire trucks you kept extending the reach further and the further out you went the more wobbly it was out on the end you could not neglect the base the start of the investigation every loose detail that could be nailed down had to be put in its exact place and so he felt now he had to finish the timeline he had to answer the questions that he himself had raised before going on to the end of the ladder it was his philosophy as well as instinct that told him to do this he was playing out a hunch that within the contradictions he would find a truth hollywood he told lockridge that video place we went before you got it we go to hollywood first then up to the valley lockridge headed a few short blocks up to melrose boulevard before turning east toward hollywood all right lets hear it mccaleb said what were you talking about on the phone about them not finding what they were looking for check out the laundry basket man why just take a look he turned his head toward mccaleb and jerked it in the direction of the backseat mccaleb unsnapped his seat belt and turned around to reach over the seat as he did so he checked the cars behind them there was lots of traffic but no cars that raised any suspicion he dropped his eyes to the basket it was full of underwear and socks that had been a nice touch by buddy it made it less likely nevins or anybody else would look through the basket when they stopped him this stuff is clean right course its on the bottom mccaleb brought his knees up onto the seat and leaned all the way over he dumped the contents of the laundry basket on the backseat he heard the dull thud of something heavier than clothes hitting the seat he moved a pair of loud boxer shorts out of the way and saw a plastic ziploc bag that contained a pistol silently mccaleb slid back into his seat holding the bag containing the gun he smoothed the plastic which had been yellowed from within by a film of gun oil so that he could get a better look at the weapon he felt a sweat break across the back of his neck the gun in the bag was an hk p and he didnt need any ballistics report to know it was the hk p the weapon that had killed kenyon then cordell then torres he bent down to look closely at the weapon and saw that the serial number had been burned away with acid the gun was untraceable a tremor rolled through mccalebs hands as he held the murder weapon his body slumped against the door and his feelings jumped between the anguish of knowing the history of the object he now held in his hands and despair at the thought of his predicament someone was setting mccaleb up and the frame would probably have been all but unbreakable if buddy lockridge had not found the gun when he went into the dark waters beneath the following sea jesus mccaleb said in a whisper looks pretty mean dont it where exactly was it it was in a diving bag hanging about six feet below your stern it was tied off on one of the underside eyelets if you knew it was there you could reach under with a gaff and hook the line and bring it up but you had to know it was there otherwise you wouldnt see it from up above did the people doing the search go into the water today yeah one diver he went down but by then id already checked around like you asked i beat him to it mccaleb nodded and put the gun down on the floor between his feet staring down at it he folded his arms across his chest as if protecting himself against a chill it had been that close and though he was sitting next to the man who had saved him for the time being an overwhelming sense of isolation came over him he felt completely alone and he felt the flickering onset of something he had only read about beforethe fightorflight syndrome he felt an almost violent urge to forget about everything and run just cut and run and get as far away from all of this as he could im in big trouble buddy he said i kind of figured that his driver replied mccaleb had composed himself and was resolved by the time they reached video grafx consultants on the way he had examined the possibility of flight and then quickly discarded it fight was the only choice he knew that he was tethered in place by his heartto flee was to die for he needed the carefully set postop drug therapy to prevent his body from rejecting his new heart to flee would also mean to leave graciela and raymond and it felt already as if doing that would wither his heart just as quickly lockridge dropped him off out front and waited in a red zone the door was locked but tony banks had told him to ring the delivery buzzer if he arrived after closing mccaleb pushed the button twice before banks answered the door himself he had a manila envelope with him and he handed it through the open door to mccaleb this everything the tape and the hard copies everything is pretty clear mccaleb took the package what do i owe you tony not a thing glad to help mccaleb nodded and was about to head back to the car but stopped and looked back at banks ive got to tell you something im not with the bureau anymore tony i apologize if i misled you but i know youre not with the bureau anymore you do i called your old office yesterday when you didnt return my call from saturday the number was on that letter you sent the letter on the wall i called and they said you hadnt worked there in something like two years mccaleb studied banks really taking the young mans measure for the first time and then held up the package then why are you giving me this because you are after him the man on that tape mccaleb nodded then good luck i hope you get him banks closed and locked the door then mccaleb said thanks but by then the door was already closed the sherman market was empty save for a couple of young girls mulling choices at the candy rack and a young man behind the counter mccaleb had been hoping to see the same older woman who had been there on his first visit the widow of chan ho kang he spoke slowly and clearly to the young man hoping he understood english better than the woman had i am looking for the woman who works here during the daytime the manhe was really no more than a teenagerlooked sullenly at mccaleb you dont have to talk like im some kind of retard he said i speak english i was born here oh mccaleb said taken aback by his clumsiness sorry about that its just that the woman that was here before she had a hard time understanding me my mother she lived her first thirty years in korea speaking korean you try it sometime why dont you move over there and try to be understood in twenty years look im sorry mccaleb held his hands up wide and palms out this wasnt going well he tried again you are chan ho kangs son the boy nodded who are you my name is terry mccaleb im sorry about the loss of your father what do you want i am doing some work for the family of the woman that was killed in here that what work i am trying to find the killer my mother doesnt know anything leave her alone shes had enough actually all i want to do is to look at her watch i was in here the other day and i noticed shes wearing the watch your father was wearing that night the young man stared blankly at him then glanced away from him to check on the girls at the candy racks okay girls lets go make your choices mccaleb looked back at the girls they didnt look happy about being hurried about such an important decision what about the watch mccaleb looked back at him well its kind of complicated there are things that dont add up on the police reports i am trying to figure out why to do that i need to know the exact time the man with the gun came in here he pointed at the video camera on the wall behind and above the counterman the police gave me a copy of the tape on the tape your fathers watch is seen i have had it enhanced if your mother has not reset the watch since she started wearing it then there is a way i can get the time i need you dont need the watch the time is on the tape you said you had the tape the police say the time on the tape is wrong thats what im trying to find out will you call your mother for me the girls came over to the counter then the man didnt answer mccaleb as he silently took their money and gave them change he watched them walk out before looking back at mccaleb i dont understand this it makes no sense to me what you want mccaleb blew out his breath i am trying to help you do you want the man who killed your father to be caught of course but this watch business what does it have to do with anything i could explain it all to you if you had about a half hour but im not going anywhere mccaleb looked at him a moment and decided that it was going to be the only way to go he nodded and told him to wait while he got a photo out of the car the young mans name was steve kang riding in the front passenger seat he directed buddy lockridge into a neighborhood just a few blocks from where graciela rivers and raymond torres lived mccaleb had convinced him with his long version the young man had then thought enough of mccalebs theory to put a be back soon sign on the door and lock up he normally walked to and from the store but lockridges car would save them time when they got to his home steve kang led mccaleb inside while lockridge waited in the car the house was virtually identical in design to gracielas and had probably been built in the early fifties by the same developer kang told mccaleb to sit in the living room and he then disappeared down a hallway leading to the bedrooms mccaleb heard muffled talking from the hallway after a few seconds he realized the conversation was in korean while he waited he thought about the similarities in the houses and envisioned the two different families grieving on the night of the shooting and the days after steve kang came back then he handed mccaleb a remote phone and the watch his father had worn she did not change anything he said its just the way it was that night mccaleb nodded from the corner of his eye he noticed movement he looked to his left and saw steve kangs mother standing in the hallway just watching him he nodded to her but she didnt respond in any way mccaleb had brought the hard copy of the enhanced video frame in with him along with his notebook and phone book he had told sieve kang what he planned to do but was still uncomfortable carrying it out in front of him he was about to impersonate a police officer which was a crime even if that officer was eddie arrango from his phone book he got the number for the central communications center in downtown la hed had the number since his days with the la field office when he would at times need to coordinate intraagency activities the ccc was the dark cavernous dispatch center four floors below city hall from which all police and fire department radio communications were transmitted it was also where the clock was from which the official time of the murders of gloria torres and chan ho kang had been set on the drive from hollywood to the market mccaleb had pulled out the torres file and gotten arrangos badge number from the homicide report he now placed the watch steve kang had given him on the arm of the couch and dialed the nonemergency number of the ccc an operator answered in four rings this is arrango west valley homicide mccaleb said thats serial one four one one im not on the radio i just need a tentwenty for a surveillance commencement and could you give me the seconds with that too seconds why youre a precise man detective arrango precisely hold one mccaleb looked down at the watch as the operator spoke he noted the watch time was pm thats seventeen fourteen thirtyeight gotcha he said thanks he hung up and looked at steve kang your fathers watch is running four seconds ahead of the ccc clock kang narrowed his eyes and he came around the side of the couch to look over mccaleb as he wrote numbers down in his notebook referred back to specific times listed on the timeline he had put together earlier and then did the math they both arrived at the same conclusion at the same time that means steve kang didnt finish mccaleb noticed that he glanced over at his mother in the hallway and then back at the time mccaleb had underlined in the notebook that bastard he said in a hateful whisper hes more than that mccaleb said outside buddy lockridge started the taurus as soon as he saw mccaleb leave the house mccaleb jumped in lets go we giving the kid a ride back no hes got to talk to his mother lets go okay okay where to back to the boat the boat you cant go there terry those people might still be there or they might be watching it it doesnt matter i have no choice lockridge dropped mccaleb off at the curb on cabrillo way about half a mile from the marina he walked in the rest of the way keeping to the shadows cast by the small shops that lined the boulevard the plan was for buddy to leave his keys in the taurus and then go to his boat as if everything about his life was routine and normal if he saw anything unusual anyone hanging around the marina who wasnt recognizable he was to flick on the mast light on the doubledown mccaleb would be able to see the light from a good distance away and he would keep clear when the marina came into sight mccalebs eyes scanned the points of the dozens of masts it was dark now and he saw no lights things looked good he glanced around and spotted a pay phone outside a minimarket and went to it to call lockridge anyway it also gave him a chance to put the heavy leather bag down for a spell buddy picked up the phone right away is it safe mccaleb asked remembering the line from a movie he had enjoyed some years before think so buddy said i dont see anyone and nobody grabbed me on the way in i didnt see anything that looked like an unmarked cop car out in the lot either whats my boat look like there was a silence while buddy took a look its still there looks like they got yellow tape strung between the piers like youre not supposed to go on it or something okay bud im coming in im going to go into the laundry first and stick my bag in one of the dryers if i go to the boat and get jumped by them you come get the bag and sit on it until i get out you okay with that sure okay listen if everything goes okay on the boat i wont be staying long so im going to say this now thanks for everything buddy youve been a big help no sweat man i dont care about what these bastards are trying to do to you i know youre cool mccaleb thanked him again and hung up then picked up his bag and started carrying it under his arm as he headed toward the marina he first ducked into the laundry and found an empty dryer in which to stow the bag he then made it all the way to the boat without problem before unlocking the slider he took one last look around the marina and saw nothing amiss nothing that raised an alarm he noticed the dark form of buddy lockridge sitting in the cockpit of the doubledown he heard a wahwah tremolo from a harmonica and he nodded toward the shadow figure he then slid open the door the boat smelled stuffy and stale but there was still a lingering scent of perfume he guessed jaye winston had left it behind he didnt turn on a light but rather reached for the flashlight clamped on the underside of the chart table he flicked it on and held the light down at his side and pointing at the floor he headed below knowing he had to move quickly he just wanted to grab enough clothes drugs and medical supplies to last him a few days he figured one way or the other it would be all the time he would get he opened one of the hallway hatches and got out the large duffel bag he then went into the master stateroom and gathered the clothes he would need doing it surreptitiously by flashlight slowed the process down but finally he had what he needed when he was done he carried the bag across the hallway to the head to gather drugs medical supplies and his clipboard he put the open bag on the sink and was about to begin laying in the pharmaceutical boxes and vials when he realized something when he had crossed the hallway there had been a light on topside the galley light or maybe one of the overheads in the salon he momentarily froze and tried to listen for any sound from above while he reviewed his own movements he was sure he had not put on a light when he had come in he listened nearly half a minute but there was nothing he quietly stepped back into the hallway and looked up the stairway he stood stock still and listened again while trying to weigh his options the only way out besides going back up the stairs was the deck hatch in the roof of the forward stateroom but it would be foolish to think that whoever was topside didnt have that escape route covered buddy he called is that you the answer came after a long beat of silence no terry its not buddy a female voice mccaleb recognized it jaye why dont you come on up he looked back into the head the flashlight was inside the duffel bag illuminating little else but its contents otherwise he was in the dark im coming up she was sitting on the cushioned swivel chair near the teak coffee table he had apparently gone right past her in the dark he slid into the matching chair on the other side of the salon hello jaye hows it going ive had better days same here i was going to call you in the morning well im here now and where are your friends theyre not my friends and they definitely arent your friends terry didnt sound like it so whats going on how come youre here and theyre not because every now and then one of us dopey locals turns out to be smarter than the bureau boys mccaleb smiled without humor you knew id have to come back for my medicine she returned the smile and nodded they figure youre already halfway to mexico if youre not there already but i saw that cabinet full of drugs and knew you had to come back it was like a leash so now you get to take me in and get the bust and get the glory not necessarily he did not respond at first he thought about her words wondering how she was playing this what are you saying jaye im saying my gut is telling me one thing the evidence something else i usually trust my gut me too what evidence are you talking about what did you people find in here today nothing much just a baseball hat with the ci logo on it we figured out it means catalina island and it matches the description james noone gave of the cap the driver of the cherokee was wearing then nothing elseuntil we opened up the top drawer of that chart table mccaleb looked over at the chart table he remembered opening the top drawer and checking it after the intruder had been scared off the night before there was nothing in there amiss or that could hurt him what was in it in it nothing it was underneath taped underneath mccaleb got up and went to the chart drawers he pulled the top drawer out and turned it over he ran his finger over the adhesive residue left by pieces of heavy tape he smiled and shook his head he thought about how quickly the intruder could have come in taken a pretaped package and slapped it up under the open drawer let me guess he said it was a plastic no dont say anything you say anything and it could come back to hurt you i dont want to hurt you terry im not worried about that not anymore so let me guess under the drawer was a baga ziploc type of bag inside it was the cross earring taken from gloria torres and a photograph of james cordells family the one taken from his car winston nodded mccaleb returned to his seat you left out donald kenyons cuff link she said sterling silver in the shape of a dollar sign i didnt know about that i bet nevins and uhlig and that asshole arrango put on six inches apiece when they found that bag they were strutting all right she said nodding it made them very happy but not you no it was too easy they sat in silence for a few moments you know terry you dont seem very concerned that evidence linking you to three murders was found in your boat not to mention the obvious motive you have for those murders she nodded toward mccalebs chest no you look like at best you are maybe moderately annoyed you want to tell me why mccaleb leaned forward elbows on his knees this brought his face more fully into the light it was all planted jaye the hat earring everything last night somebody broke in here he didnt take anything so he mustve left things ive got witnesses im being set up i dont know why but its a setup well if youre thinking bolotov forget it hes been in van nuys jail since his parole officer picked him up sunday afternoon no im not thinking bolotov hes in the clear that sure sounds like a different tune events have overtaken the possibility of him being a suspect remember i figured him for that burglary near his work in which the hk p was taken that would have given him the right gun to make him a suspect in cordell and torres but that burglary occurred in december near christmas now add kenyon he was killed with a p in november so it cant be the same gun even if bolotov did the burglary so hes clear i still dont know why he went ape shit on me and ran though well like you said he probably is good for that christmas burglary you went in there and spooked him made it sound like you were going to put a couple of murders on him he ran thats all mccaleb nodded whats going to happen to him his boss is going to drop his complaint in lieu of restitution for the window that was broken thats it theyll release him after a hearing today mccaleb nodded again and looked down at the carpet so forget about him terry what else have you got he brought his eyes back up and looked intently back at her im close im just one or two steps away from putting this all together i know who the shooter is now and im just a few days away from knowing who hired him ive got names a list of suspects i know the person we want is on that list trust your gut on this one jaye you can hook me up now and bring me in and get the bust but its wrong and it wont fit eventually ill be able to prove it but in the meantime well miss the chance weve got right now who is the shooter mccaleb stood up i have to get my bag ill show you wheres your bag in a dryer in the marina laundry i stashed it there i didnt know what to expect when i came in here she thought a moment let me go get it he said youve still got the pharmacy here im not going anywhere if you dont trust me come with me she waved him off all right go get your bag ill wait on the way to the laundry mccaleb met buddy lockridge who was holding the leather satchel taken from the laundry everything okay you told me to go get this if i saw anybody put the moves on you everythings fine buddy i think i dont know what shes telling you but she was one of them that was here today i know but i think shes on my side mccaleb took the bag from him and headed back to his boat inside he turned on the television put the sherman market tape in the vcr and started playing it he fastforwarded the image and watched the jerking motions of the shooter coming in shooting gloria torres and the market owner then disappearing then the good samaritan came in and mccaleb put the tape on normal speed at the moment the good samaritan looked up from his work on glorias stricken figure mccaleb hit the pause button and the image froze he pointed at the man on the television screen and looked back at jaye winston there theres your shooter she stared at the tube for a long moment her face betraying none of her thoughts okay tell me how is that my shooter the timeline arrango and walters never saw this as anything more than a common robbery and shooting thats how it lookedwho can blame them but they were sloppy they never bothered completing or verifying a timeline they took what they saw at face value but there was a problem between the time on the store video when the shooting went down and the time on the big clock downtown when the good samaritan called it in right you told me what was the discrepancy a half minute or so thirtyfour seconds according to the stores video the good samaritan called in the shooting thirtyfour seconds before it happened but you said walters or arrango said they couldnt verify the accuracy of the video clock they just assumed it was off because the old manmr kangprobably set it himself right they assumed i didnt mccaleb backed the tape up to the point that chan ho kangs watch was visible as his arm stretched across the counter he played with it in slow motion going back and forth until he had the time strip across the bottom at the right moment he paused the image again he then went to the bag and took out the hard copy of the video enhancement okay what i did was triangulate the time to get an accurate fix on when exactly this went down you see the watch she nodded he handed her the hard copy i had a friend who used to do work for the bureau enhance this image thats the hard copy as you can see the time on the watch and the video match to the second old man kang must have set the camera clock right off his watch you with me im with you the video and the watch match what does it mean mccaleb held his hand up in a holdon gesture and then got out his notebook and referred to his timeline notes now we know according to the central communications center clock downtown that the good samaritan called in the shooting at which was thirtyfour seconds before the shooting took place according to the videotape okay okay he explained that evenings trip to the store and then to the kang home where he had been allowed access to the watch he told her that the watchs setting had not been disturbed since the murders i then called the ccc and got a time check and compared it to the watch the watch is running only four seconds ahead of the ccc clock therefore that means the video clock was running only four seconds ahead of ccc at the time of the murders winston narrowed her eyebrows and leaned forward trying to follow his explanation that would mean she didnt finish it means that there is almost no differencejust four secondsbetween the video clock and the ccc clock so when the good samaritan called in the store shooting at ten fortyone oh three on the ccc clock it was exactly ten fortyone oh seven on the store clock there was only four seconds difference but thats impossible winston said shaking her head there was no shooting at the time thats thirty seconds too early gloria wasnt even in the store yet she was probably just pulling in mccaleb was silent he decided to let her make the conclusions without having to be told or prompted he knew it would have a stronger impact if she came to the same spot he was at on her own so she said this guy this good samaritan had to have called in the shooting before the shooting took place mccaleb nodded he noted the deepening intensity in her eyes why would he do that unless he knew unless he knew the shooting was going down hesdamnhes got to be the shooter mccaleb nodded once more but this time he had a satisfied smile on his face he knew he had her in his car now and they were about to hit the gas pedal have you hashed this around figured out how it all plays a little bit so then tell me mccaleb was standing in the galley now pouring himself a glass of orange juice winston had passed on a drink but was standing in the galley also her adrenaline would not allow her to sit mccaleb knew that feeling wait a second he said he gulped down the orange juice in one tilt sorry i messed with my blood sugar today i think ate too late are you all right fine he put the glass in the sink turned and leaned against the counter okay this is how i see it you start with mr x somebody someplace that well assume to be a man for now this person needs something a new part kidney liver maybe bone marrow possibly corneas but that might be stretching it it has to be something worth killing for something that he might die without or in the case of the cornea possibly go blind and become nonfunctioning without what about a heart that would be on the list but see i got the heart so scratch the heart unless you are nevins and uhlig and arrango and the rest of them who think im mr x okay okay go on this guy x hes got money and access enough to be able to contact and hire a shooter with oc connections maybe but not necessarily what about dont forget the cannoli i dont know ive been thinking about that its kind of showy for real organized crime dont you think makes me think its a deflection but for now thats just a guess all right never mind for now go on with mr x well besides being able to get to a shooter to do the job he next has to have access to the computer at bopra hes got to know who has the part that he needs you know what bopra is i learned today and i said the same thing about you to nevins how could terry mccaleb get access to bopra and he told me how bullshit their computer security is their theory is that you hacked in one day when you were at cedars you got a list of blood donors of type ab with cmv negative and went from there okay now follow the same theory but instead of me its mr x and he gets the list and then puts the good samaritan on the case mccaleb pointed out into the salon where the image of the good samaritan remained frozen on the television screen they both looked at it for a few moments before he continued the shooter goes down the list and lo and behold he sees a familiar name donald kenyon kenyon is a famous man mostly for all the enemies he has he becomes the perfect choice because of that all those enemiesinvestors and maybe even some mobster lurking behind the scenes it makes for good camouflage so the good samaritan picks kenyon right he picks him and then he watches him until he has his routine and the routine is pretty simple because kenyons got a federal dog collar on and usually doesnt go anywhere outside of his house because of it but the good sam is not discouraged he gets the household routine down and he knows that for twenty minutes each morning kenyon is in that house alone when the wife drives the kids to school his throat dry from all the talking mccaleb rescued the glass from the sink and poured himself another glass of orange juice so he hits during that twentyminute window he continued after gulping down another half glass and going in he knows he has to do the job in such a way that kenyon makes it to the hospital but no further see hes got to preserve the organs for transplant but if he goes too far kenyons dead on arrival and no good to him so he comes into the house grabs kenyon and marches him to the front door he then holds him there and waits for the wife to come back home from dropping the kids he makes kenyon look through the peephole and make sure it is her then he pops him and lays him out on the floor fresh and ready when the wife opens the door but he doesnt make it to the hospital no the plan was good but he fucked up he used a devastator in the p the wrong bullet for this kind of work its a frangible it explodes and basically pulps kenyons brain destroys all life support system controls death is almost instantaneous he stopped there and watched winston as she evaluated the story then he held up a finger signaling her to wait before commenting he went to his bag in the salon and pulled out a sheaf of documents careful to keep his body between the bag and winston he didnt want her catching a glimpse of the p which was still in there at the galley counter he looked through the documents until he found what he needed im not supposed to even have this but take a look this is a transcript of the tape the bureau got from the illegal bugs in the kenyon house this is the part where he was hit they didnt get everything that was said but what is there fits with what i just said winston stood next to him and read the section he had circled with a pen while riding with buddy lockridge on the way to the marina unknown okay look and see who kenyon dont shes got nothing to do with this she winston nodded her head he could have told him to look through the peephole she said it obviously was the wife because kenyon then tried to protect her right and notice that the transcript says that there were two minutes of silence before that last exchange and the gunshot what else could he have been doing but waiting until she showed up so she would get to the body almost as soon as it happened she nodded again it fits she said but what about the bureau people listening you think the shooter didnt know about them im not sure it doesnt seem like it i think he just got lucky but maybe he thought there was a slim chance the place was bugged maybe thats where the cannoli line came from just a little misdirection just in case mccaleb finished his orange juice and put the glass back into the sink okay so he blew it winston said and it was back to the drawing board or actually back to the bopra list and the next name he picked was my guy james cordell mccaleb nodded and let her run with it he knew that the more of the puzzle she fit together herself the more apt she would be to believe in the whole thing he changes the load goes from frangible to hardball so that he would have a throughandthrough wound with less immediate brain damage he watches cordell until he has the routine down and then he sets up the shoot in a way similar to kenyonthe hit occurring almost instantaneous to the arrival of a second party who could get help in kenyons case it was his wife in cordells it was james noone the shooter probably stood behind cordell until he saw noones car enter the turn lane to come into the bank that was when he fired i think noone was an accident mccaleb said there is no way the shooter could have planned on a witness showing up he was probably going to shoot cordell and then call nine one one himself at the pay phone out at the curbon the crime scene tape you can see the pay phone right there but noone came along and that forced him to just get the hell out of there he probably thought the witness would make the call on the pay phonea legitimate call for help the bad break for him was that noone made the call on a cell phone and the address was messed up resulting in a terminal delay for cordell winston nodded her agreement cordell was doa she said another one goes to shit he goes back to the list and its gloria torres this time only this time hes not taking a single chance he calls the shooting in before it even happens right to get the paramedics rolling he knew her routine he was probably standing at that pay phone waiting when he saw her car pulling in he made the nine one one call he then goes in does the job and splits outside he pulls off the mask and the jumpsuit and he becomes our good samaritan he goes in wraps her up and gets the hell out of there this time it works it is perfect it was a learning process he learned from the mistakes of the first two perfected it on the third mccaleb folded his arms and waited for winston to make the next jump so we have to follow the harvest now she said one of the people who received one of the organs will be mr x we have to go to bopra and get thewait you said you had a list of names he nodded from bopra from bopra he went back to his bag and found the list bonnie fox had given him he turned around and almost bumped into winston who had moved out of the galley he handed her the sheet theres the list she studied it intently as if she was expecting to see that one of the names on it would actually be mr x or in some other way be readily identifiable as him how did you get this cant say she looked up at him for the time being i have to protect a source but its legit those people got organs from gloria torres are you giving me this if you are going to do something with it i will ill start tomorrow mccaleb was fully aware of what he was giving her of course it might be the key to his exoneration and the capture of the worst kind of killer but he was also handing her an eticket ride if she was successful in breaking the case while the bureau and the lapd were heading down the wrong road her professional future would have no bounds how are you going to run them down he asked anyway i can ill look for money criminal records anything that stands out you know the usual things the full background what are you going to be doing mccaleb glanced over at his bag it was bulging with documents tapes and the guns i dont know yet will you tell me something how did this all turn on me what pointed all you people at me winston folded the list into a neat square and slid it into the pocket of her blazer the bureau nevins told me they got a tip he wouldnt say from where the tip was suspectspecific though he did tell me that the source said you killed glory torres for her heart they took it from there they checked the autopsies of all three victims and found the blood matches from there it was easy everything fell into place i have to admit they had me going at the time it all seemed to fit how mccaleb asked angrily his voice rising none of this would have even happened if i hadnt started looking into it the ballistics match to kenyon was made because of me that brought the bureau in you think that is what a guilty man would do thats crazy he was angrily pointing at his own chest all of that was considered we sat around and hashed it out this morning the theory that emerged was that you had this womanthe sisterwho had come to you and you figured she wasnt going to let this go so you decided you better take the case before somebody else did you took it and proceeded to sabotage it you came up with this bolotov goose chase you hypnotized the only real witness and now hes lost to us as far as court goes yes the ballistics match was made because of you but maybe that was a surprise maybe you were expecting it to come up empty since a devastator had been used the first time mccaleb shook his head he wouldnt allow himself to see their side of it he still couldnt believe they had turned the focus on him look we werent sold on it one hundred percent winston said we felt there was enough to get and justify a warrant for the searchand there was we felt the search was make or break we would find evidence and go further with it or we would drop it but then we find out you drive a black cherokee and then sitting under that drawer are three very damning pieces of evidence the only thing that could have been worse for you would have been to find the gun mccaleb thought of the gun sitting in his bag five feet away from them again he knew how lucky he had been but like you said it was too easy for me it was the others didnt see it that way like i said before they started strutting they saw the headlines mccaleb shook his head the discussion had sapped his strength he stepped over to the galley table and slid into the booth i am being set up he said winston came over i believe you she said and whoever he is hes done a good job of it have you thought at all about why it is you thats been set up mccaleb nodded as he drew a design in a spray of sugar that had been spilled on the table when i look at it from the shooters view i see why he brushed the sugar off the table with his palm after kenyon didnt work out and the shooter knew he had to go back to the list he also knew he was doubling the risk he knew there was an off chance that the cases might be connected through the blood he knew he had to lay the groundwork for a deflection he picked me if he was in the bopra computer then he knew i was next on the list for a heart he probably backgrounded me like the others he knew about the cherokee i drove and used one himself he took souvenirs from the victims so that he could plant them if needed here then it was probably him who made the tip call to nevins when everything was set mccaleb sat silently for a long moment brooding about his situation then he slowly slid back out of the booth i have to finish packing where are you going to go im not sure ill need to talk to you tomorrow ill be in touch he started down the stairs his hands gripping the overhead rails terry he stopped and turned to look back at her im taking a big chance my necks a mile out there i know that jaye thanks with that he disappeared into the darkness below mccalebs cherokee had been impounded during the search earlier in the day he borrowed lockridges taurus and drove it north on the when he reached the interchange he went west to the pacific and then continued north again on the coast highway he was in no hurry and he was tired of freeways hed decided to drive along the ocean and then cut up to the valley through topanga canyon he knew topanga was desolate enough for him to be able to tell if he was being followed by winston or anybody else it was half past nine by the time he reached the shore and was skirting along the black water intermittently broken by the froth of crashing waves the night fog was coming in heavy and pushing across the highway butting into the sheer bluffs that guarded the palisades it carried with the strong scent and feel of the sea and it reminded mccaleb of night fishing with his father when he was a boy it always scared him when his father throttled down and killed the engines so they could drift in the dark his breath held tight at the end of the night when the old man turned the key to restart he had nightmares as a boy about drifting alone in the dark in a dead boat he never told his father about those dreams he never told him he didnt want to go night fishing he always held his fears to himself mccaleb looked out to his left to try to find the line where ocean met sky but he couldnt see it two shades of darkness blending somewhere out there the moon hidden in cloud cover it seemed to fit his mood he turned on the radio and fished around for some blues but gave up and turned it off he remembered buddys collection of harmonicas and reached into the door pocket for one he flipped on the overhead light and checked the etching on the top plate it was a tombo in the key of c he wiped it off on his shirt and as he drove he played with the instrument mostly producing a cacophony that at times made him laugh out loud at how ugly it was but every now and then he put together a couple of notes buddy had tried to teach him once and hed gotten to the point where he could play the opening riffs of midnight rambler he tried for that now but couldnt find the chord and what he produced sounded more like a wheezing old man when he turned into topanga canyon he put the harmonica down the road through the canyon was a snake and hed need both hands on the wheel fresh out of distractions he finally began considering his situation he first brooded about winston and how much he could count on her he knew she was capable and ambitious what he didnt know was how well she would stand up to the pressure she would certainly encounter by going against the bureau and the lapd he concluded that he was lucky to have her on his side but that he couldnt sit back and wait for her to show up with the case wrapped up in a box he could only count on himself he figured that if winston did not convince the others then at best he had two days before they had an indictment from a grand jury and would go to the media with their prize after that his chances of working the case would diminish rapidly hed be the lead on the six and eleven oclock news hed have no choice but to give up the investigation get a lawyer and surrender the priority would then be clearing his game in the courtroom never mind catching the real shooter and whoever it was who had hired him there was a gravel turnout on the road and mccaleb pulled over put the ear in park and looked out at the blackness of the dropoff to his right far off he saw the square lights of a house deep in the canyon and he wondered what it would be like to be there he reached over to the seat next to him for the harmonica but it was gone slipped over the side during one of the turns of the snaking road three minutes went by and no car passed him he dropped the car back into drive and continued on his way once he crested the mountain the road straightened out some and dropped down into woodland hills he stayed on topanga canyon boulevard until he reached sherman way and then he cut east into canoga park five minutes later he stopped in front of gracielas home and watched the windows for a few minutes he thought about what he would say to her he wasnt sure what he had started with her but it felt strong and right to him before he even opened the door to the car he was mourning the possibility that it might already be over she opened the front door before he reached it and he wondered if she had been watching him sitting in the car terry is everything all right why are you driving i had to come in come in she stepped back and allowed him in they went to the living room and took the same seats on the sectional sofa that they had taken before a small color television on a wooden stand played softly in the corner the ten oclock news on channel was just starting graciela used a remote to turn it off mccaleb put his heavy bag down between his feet he had left the duffel in the car unwilling to presume that he would be asked to stay tell me she said what is happening they think it was me the fbi lapd all of them but one sheriffs detective they think i killed your sister for her heart mccaleb looked at her face and then glanced away like a guilty man he winced at the thought of what this must show to her but he knew down deep that he was guilty he was the beneficiary even if he had nothing to do with the actual crime he was alive now because glory was dead a question echoed through his mind like the slamming of a dozen doors down a dark hallway how can i live with this thats ridiculous graciela said angrily how can they think that you wait he said cutting her off i have to tell you some things graciela then you decide what and who to believe i dont have to hear he held his hand up cutting her off again just listen to me okay wheres raymond hes asleep its a school night he nodded and leaned forward elbows on his knees hands clasped together they searched my boat while i was with you they were searching my boat they had made the same connection we made the blood work but theyre looking at me for it they found things on my boat i wanted to tell you before you heard it from them or saw it on tv or the paper what things terry hidden under a drawer they found your sisters earring the cross the shooter took he watched her a moment before continuing her eyes dropped from his to the glasstopped coffee table as she thought about his words they also found the photo from cordells car and they found a cuff link that was taken from donald kenyon they found all the icons the killer took graciela my source the sheriffs detective she tells me they are going to go to a grand jury and indict me i cant go back to my boat now she glanced at him and then away she stood up and walked to the window even though the curtain was closed she shook her head you want me to leave he said to her back no i dont want you to leave this makes no sense how can theydid you tell the detective about the intruder hes the one who must have done this who put those things in the drawer hes the killer oh my god we were that close to my sisters she didnt finish mccaleb got up and went to her relief coursing through him she didnt believe it none of it he put his arms around her from behind and pushed his face into her hair im so glad you believe me he whispered she turned around in his arms and they kissed for a long moment what can i do to help she whispered just keep believing and ill do the rest can i stay here nobody knows that were together they might come here but i dont think it will be to look for me it might be just to tell you they think its me i want you to stay as long as you need or want to i just need a place where i can work where i can go through everything again i get this feeling i missed something like the blood work theres got to be some answers in all of that paper you can work here ill stay home tomorrow and help look through no you cant you cant do anything unusual i just want you to get up in the morning and take raymond to school and then go to work i can do this this part is my job he held her face in his hands the weight of his guilt was lessened by her just being there with him and he felt the subtle opening inside of some passage that had long been closed he wasnt sure where it would lead but knew in his heart he wanted to go there that he must go there i was just about to go to bed she said he nodded are you coming with me what about raymond shouldnt we raymonds asleep dont worry about him for right now lets worry about us in the morning after graciela and raymond were gone and the house was quiet mccaleb opened his leather bag and spread all of the accumulated paperwork in six stacks across the coffee table while contemplating it all he drank a glass of orange juice and ate two untoasted blueberry pop tarts that he guessed were meant for raymond when he was done he set to work hoping his involvement in the paper would keep his mind off things beyond his control mainly jaye winstons investigation of the names on the list despite that distraction mccaleb could feel the flow of adrenaline start to kick in he was looking for the tell the piece of the puzzle that didnt fit before but would make sense now that would tell him the story he had survived in the bureau largely by following gut instincts he was following one now he knew that the larger the case file wasthe larger the accumulation of factsthe easier it was for the tell to be hidden he would go hunting for it now in a sense looking for the perfect red apple in the stack at the grocery storethe one that when pulled brings the whole pile down and bouncing across the floor but as jazzed as mccaleb had been at eightthirty in the morning his spirits had immolated by late afternoon in eight hours interrupted only by bologna sandwiches and unanswered calls to winston he had reviewed every page of every document he had accumulated in the ten days he had worked the case and the tellif it had ever been thereremained hidden the feelings of paranoia and isolation were creeping back up on him at one point he realized he was daydreaming about what would be the best place to flee to the mountains of canada or the beaches of mexico at four oclock he called the star center once more and was told for the fifth time that winston was not in this time however the secretary added that she was presumed gone for the day in earlier calls the secretary had dutifully refused to reveal where winston was or give him her pager number for that he would have to speak to the captain and mccaleb declined knowing the jeopardy he would place winston in if it was revealed she was not only sympathetic to a suspect but was actually aiding him after hanging up he called his phone on the boat and played back two messages that had come in during the last hour the first was buddy lockridge checking in and the second was a wrong number a woman saying she wasnt sure if she had the right number but was looking for some one named luther hatch she left a callback number mccaleb recognized the name luther hatchthe suspect in the case in which he had first met jaye winston once he made that connection he recognized her voice on the message she was telling him to call her as he punched in the numbers winston had left he recognized the exchangeit was the same for the bureau offices in westwood where he used to work the phone was answered immediately this is winston this is mccaleb silence hey she finally said i was wondering if you would get that message whats up can you talk not really okay ill talk then do they know you are helping me no obviously but youre there because they moved the investigation to the bureau right uhhuh okay have you had a chance to run those names down yet ive been out on it all day do you have anything do any of them look good no theres nothing there mccaleb closed his eyes and cursed silently where had he gone wrong how could this be a dead end he was confused and his mind was running over the possibilities he wondered if winston had had enough time to thoroughly run out the list is there any place or time i can talk to you about this i need to ask you some questions in a little while i probably can why dont you give me a number and ill get back to you mccaleb was silent while he thought about this but he didnt take long as winston had said the night before her neck was way out there for him he believed he could trust her he gave her gracielas number call me back as soon as you can i will one last thing did they go to the grand jury yet no not yet how long before they do ill see you tomorrow morning then bye she hung up before she heard him curse out loud the following morning they were going to seek an indictment against him for murder and he was sure that obtaining it would be only a formality grand juries were always rigged in the prosecutions favor in mccalebs case he knew that all they needed to do was show the sherman market tape and then introduce the earring found during the search of his boat they would be staging press conferences by the afternoonperfect timing for the six oclock news while he was standing there contemplating his grim future the phone rang in his hand its jaye where are you the federal cafeteria a pay phone mccaleb immediately envisioned her location in an a cove with vending machines off to the side of the cafeteria dining room it was private enough whats going on jaye its not good theyre putting the finishing touches on the package theyre going to take to the das office tonight theyll take it to the grand jury tomorrow morning theyre going to seek one murder charge for gloria torres after thats in the pipeline theyll take their time before adding on cordell and kenyon okay mccaleb said not sure how to respond he decided there was no sense in continuing to curse out loud my advice is that you come in terry you tell them what you told me and convince them ill be on your side but right now im handcuffed i have information about the good samaritan i shouldnt have if i reveal it ill go into the shitter with you what about the list nothing at all look that much i did talk about with them so i would have the time to work the list i came in this morning and told them in order to be ready to counter your defense we needed to investigate the other recipients of the organs from gloria torres i said i had a source who would slip us the list of names without us having to get a search warrant etcetera etcetera and they said great they gave me the day but nothing terry im sorry but i checked out every name i got nothing tell me well i dont have the list with me but hold on mccaleb walked into gracielas bedroom where he had seen the copy of the list he had given her on the bureau he grabbed it and read the first name to winston j b dickeyhe got the liver right okay he didnt make it he got the transplant but there were complications and he died three weeks after surgery but that doesnt mean it wasnt him i know that but i talked to the surgeon at st joseph s it was a charity case the guy was on medical and the hospital picked up the rest this wasnt a guy with money or connections to a hit man terry come on okay next tammy domike one of the kidneys right shes a schoolteacher shes twentyeight married to a carpenter and has two kids she doesnt fit either it just wasnt william farley the other kidney retired chippie from bakersfield hes been in a wheelchair for twelve yearssince he took a bullet in the spine during a routine traffic pullover on the grapevine they never caught the guy either california highway patrol mccaleb mused out loud he could have friends who could have pulled this off for him winston was silent for a long moment before responding it seems unlikely terry i mean listen to what youre i know i know never mind what about the eyes christine foye got the corneas right she sells books for a living and just got out of college its not her either look terry we were hoping that one of these people would be some millionaire or a politician or anybody with the juice to do this somebody obvious but its just not there im sorry so im still the best and only suspect unfortunately thanks jaye youve been a big help ive got to go wait and dont get mad at me ive been the only one who has listened to you remember i know im sorry well there was one other thing i was thinking i wasnt going to tell you until i had some time to check it out im going to start on it tomorrow im working on a warrant for information right now what tell me i need something now well you were only thinking in terms of who got the organs that became available after the death of gloria torres right right cordells and kenyons were not harvested i know im not talking about that but there is always a waiting list right yeah always i waited almost two years because of the blood type well maybe someone just wanted to move up the list move up you know they were like you waiting and they knew it would be a long wait maybe even a fatal wait werent you told that with your blood type there was no telling when a heart would become available yeah they told me not to get my hopes up okay so maybe our guy is still waiting but by taking out gloria torres he has in effect moved up one notch on the list improved his chances mccaleb thought about this he saw the possibility he suddenly remembered bonnie fox telling him that there was another patient on the ward who was in the same situation mccaleb had been in he wondered now if she meant literally the same situation waiting for a heart that was type ab with cmv negative he thought of the boy he had seen in the hospital bed could he be the patient fox meant mccaleb thought about what a parent would be willing to do to save a child could it be possible it could work he said his adrenaline returning and the monotonal quality of his voice gone now what youre saying is that it could be somebody still waiting right and i am going to go to bopra with a warrant to get all their waiting lists and their blood donor records it should be interesting to see how they respond mccaleb nodded but his mind was skipping ahead wait a minute wait a minute he said its too complicated what is the whole thing if somebody wanted to move up on the list why take out donors why not just knock people off the list because that might be too obvious if two or three people needing heart or liver transplants in a row get hit its bound to raise a question somewhere but by hitting the donors its more obscure no one noticed it until you came along i guess mccaleb said still not sure he was convinced then if youre right it could even mean the shooters going to hit again youve got to go down the list of ab donors youve got to warn them protect them that possibility brought the excitement back it was jangling in his veins i know winston said when i get the warrant im going to have to tell nevins and uhlig all of them what i am doing thats why you have to come in terry its the only way you have to come in with a lawyer and lay this all out then take your chances nevins uhlig these are smart people theyll see where they went wrong mccaleb didnt respond he saw the logic in what she was saying but was hesitant to agree because it would be putting his fate in the hands of others he would rather rely on himself do you have a lawyer terry no i dont have a lawyer why would i have a lawyer i havent done anything wrong he cringed he had heard countless guilty individuals make the same statement before winston probably had too i meant do you know a lawyer who could help you she said if you dont then i can suggest a few michael haller jr would be a good choice i know lawyers in case i need one i have to think about this well call me i can bring you in make sure everything is handled right mccalebs mind wandered and he was inside a holding cell at the county jail he had been in the lockup on interviews as a bureau agent he knew how loud jails were and how dangerous he knew that innocent or not he would never surrender himself to that terry you there yeah sorry i was just thinking about something how can i reach you to arrange this ill give you my pager and my home ill be here until probably six but after that im heading home call me anywhere any time she gave him the numbers and mccaleb wrote them down in his notebook he then put it away and shook his head i cant believe this im sitting here talking about turning myself in for something i didnt do i know that but the truth is a powerful thing it will work out just make sure you call me terry when you decide ill call you he hung up bonnie foxs receptionist the frowner told mccaleb that the doctor had been in transplant surgery all afternoon and would probably not be available for another two to three hours mccaleb almost cursed out loud but instead left gracielas number and told the frowner to write down that he needed fox to call back as soon as possible no matter what the hour he was about to hang up when he thought of something hey who is getting the heart what you said she was in surgery which patient was it the boy im sorry im not at liberty to discuss other patients with you said the frowner fine he said then just make sure you tell her to call me mccaleb spent the next fifteen minutes pacing between the living room and kitchen hoping unrealistically that the phone would ring and fox would be on the line he finally managed to shoehorn the anxiety into a side compartment of his brain and started thinking about the larger problems at hand mccaleb knew he had to start making decisions chief of which was to decide whether to get a lawyer he knew winston was right it was the smart move to get legal protection but mccaleb couldnt bring himself to make the call to michael haller jr or anybody else to give up on his own skills and rely on anothers in the living room there were no documents left on the coffee table as he had gone through the pages he had returned them to the leather bag until all that was on the table was the stack of videotapes desperate for a diversion from his thoughts about what exactly fox had said to him about the other patient he picked up the videocassette on top of the stack and walked it over to the television he popped it into the vcr without looking to see which tape it was it didnt matter he just wanted something else to think about for a while but as he dropped back onto the couch he immediately ignored the tape that was playing michael haller jr he thought yes he would be a good attorney not as good as his old man the legendary mickey haller but the legend was long dead and junior had taken his place as one of the most visible and successful defense attorneys in los angeles junior would get him out of this mccaleb knew but of course that would be after the reputationdestroying media blitz the looting of his savings and the selling of the following sea and even when it was over and he was clear he would still carry the stigma of suspicion and guilt with him forever mccaleb squinted his eyes and wondered what it was he was staring at on the tv the camera was focused on the legs and feet of someone standing on a table then he recognized his own walking boots and placed what he was seeing the hypnosis session the camera had been running when mccaleb climbed onto the table to remove some of the overhead lighting tubes james noone appeared in the frame and reached up as one of the long fluorescent light tubes was handed down to him mccaleb grabbed the tv remote off the arm of the couch and hit the fast forward button interested because he had forgotten to review the hypnosis session as he had promised captain hitchens he would mccaleb decided to skip through the preliminaries he moved the tape past the initial interview and relaxation exercises to the actual questioning of noone under hypnosis he wanted to hear james noones recounting of the details of the shooting and the killers getaway mccaleb watched with total concentration and quickly found himself suffering the same physical effects of frustration he had felt during the actual session noone had been a perfect subject it was rare that he had hypnotized a witness who could recall such detail the cutting frustration was that he simply hadnt gotten a good look at the driver and the cherokees license plates had been covered damn mccaleb cursed out loud as the taped session drew to a close he reached for the remote deciding to rewind and run the interview again when he suddenly froze his finger poised over the remote button mccaleb had just seen something that did not fit something he had missed during the actual session because he was distracted by winston who had been sitting in he rewound the tape but only briefly then replayed the last few questions that were asked on the tape mccaleb was wrapping it up asking a scatter of leftover and wishfulthinking questions they were long shots thrown at noone out of frustration he had asked about any stickers on the cherokees windshield noone said no and then mccaleb was out of questions he turned to winston and asked her anything else even though mccaleb had broken his own rules by asking a question of a nonparticipant winston followed the rules and did not answer verbally instead she shook her head in the negative you sure mccaleb asked again she shook her head no mccaleb then began bringing noone out of the trance but that was wrong and mccaleb had missed it at the time now he came around the coffee table remote in hand and leaned closer to the screen he rewound the tape one more time to watch the sequence again son of a bitch he whispered after the playthrough you shouldve answered me noone you should have answered he punched the eject button and turned to grab another tape he knocked the short stack across the coffee table and then quickly scrabbled through the plastic cassettes until he found the tape with the label marked sherman market he put the tape into the machine started playing it on fast forward and then paused the image when the good samaritan was on the screen the vcr could not hold the image still and mccaleb guessed the machine was an inexpensive model with only two tape heads he ejected the tape and looked at his watch it was fourforty he slapped the remote down on top of the television and went to the kitchen for the phone tony banks agreed to stay once again after closing at video grafx consultants until mccaleb could get there crossing the floor of the valley on the he initially made good time most of the rushhour traffic was going the other way the workforce of the city returning to the bedroom communities of the valley but when he dipped south on the freeway to go through the cahuenga pass into hollywood the brake lights were flared for as far as he could see and he got bogged down he finally pulled buddy lockridges taurus into the small employee lot at vgc at five after six once again tony banks answered the door after mccaleb had pushed the night bell tony thanks mccaleb said to the mans back as he was led down the hallway once again to one of the tech rooms you are really helping me out here no problem but mccaleb noted that there wasnt as much enthusiasm in the no problem this time they entered the same room they had sat in the week before mccaleb handed banks the two tapes he had brought with him on each of these tapes there is a man he said i want to see if they are the same man you mean like you cant tell not for sure they look different but i think its a disguise i think theyre the same man but i want to be sure banks put the first tape into the player on the left side of the console turned it on and the sherman market robbery and shooting began playing on the corresponding overhead video display tube this guy banks said right freeze it when theres a good look banks froze the image at the moment the socalled good samaritan was looking off camera in right profile how is that i need the profile its hard to do a comparison fronton youre the boss he handed banks the second tape which was placed in the righthand player and soon the hypnosis session was playing on the right vdt screen back it up mccaleb said i think theres a profile before he sits down banks reversed the tape what are you doing to him on this hypnosis really i thought so at the time but now i think he was playing me the wholethere banks paused the tape james noone was looking to his right most likely at the door to the interview room banks played with the dials and the computer mouse and expanded the picture then sharpened it he did the same with the image on the left screen he then leaned back and looked at the sidebyside profiles after a few moments he spoke as he unclipped an infrared pointer from his pocket and turned it on well the complexions dont match one guy looks mexican that would be easy a couple hours in a tanning salon could give him that look banks played the pointers red dot along the bridge the good samaritans nose look at the slope of the nose he said see the double bump right the red dot jumped to the left screen and found the same double bump in the slope of james noones nose its an unscientific guess but it looks pretty close me banks said me too youve got differentcolor eyes but that can be done contacts right and here the expanded jawline on this guy on the right a dental applianceyou know like a rubber sleep guardor even wads of tissue paper like brando used in the godfather could be used to make that appearance mccaleb nodded silently noting another possible connection to the gangster movie cannolis and now possibly wads of tissue paper as cheek implants and hair is always changeable banks was saying in fact this guy looks like hes got on a wig banks ran the red dot along the good samaritans hairline mccaleb silently chastised himself for seeing this only now the hairline was a perfect line the telltale indication of a hairpiece lets see what else weve got banks went back to the dials and pulled back on the image he then used the mouse to delineate a new enhancement area the good samaritans hands its like chicks banks said they can put on makeup wigs even get their tits done but they cant do nothing about their hands their handsand sometimes their feetalways give em away once he had the good samaritans hands blown up and in focus he went to work on the other console until he had an enlargement of noones right hand on the opposite screen banks stood up so that he was at direct eye level with the screens and leaned to within a few inches of each tube as he studied and compared the hands okay here look mccaleb stood up and looked closely at the screens what the first one has got a bit of a scar here on the knuckle you see it the discoloration mccaleb leaned in close to the image of the good samaritans right hand wait a sec banks said he opened a drawer in the console and pulled out a photographers eyepiece the kind used to study and magnify negatives on a light table try this mccaleb held the eyepiece over the knuckle in question and looked through it he could see a swirl of white scar tissue on the knuckle though the whole image was distorted and blurry he identified the scar as almost being in the shape of a question mark okay he said lets see the other he took a step to his left and used the eyepiece to locate the same knuckle on james noones right hand the hand was not held in the same posture or at the same angle but the thick white swirl of scar tissue was there mccaleb held steady and studied the image until he was sure he then closed his eyes for a moment it was a lock the man on each of the vdt screens was the same man is it there banks asked mccaleb handed him the eyepiece its there any chance i can get hard copies of those two screens banks was looking through the eyepiece at the second screen its there all right he said and yes i can make hard copies let me put the images on a disk and take it back to the printer in the lab itll take a few minutes thanks man i hope it helps more than you know whats the guy doing anyway dressing up like a mexican and doing good deeds not really someday ill tell you the whole thing banks let it go and went to work on the console transferring the video images on the screens to a computer disk he backed up the videos and transferred the headshots as well be back in a few minutes he said getting up unless i have to warm up the machine hey is there a phone i can use while youre gone in the left drawer there hit nine first mccaleb called winstons home number and got her machine as he listened to her voice he hesitated about leaving a message aware of the consequences to winston if it was ever proved that she had worked with the subject of a murder investigation a tape of his voice could do that but he decided that the discoveries he had made in the last hour made it worth the risk he didnt want to page winston because he didnt want to wait around for her to call he had to move he hatched a quick plan and left a message after the beep jaye its me ill explain all of this when i see you but for now just trust me i know who the shooter is its noone jaye james noone im heading to his address nowthe address on the witness report meet me there if you can ill run it all down for you then he hung up and called her pager number he then punched in her home phone number and hung up with any luck he thought winston would get the message and soon be heading toward noones address to back him up mccaleb pulled his leather bag onto his lap and opened the zippered center pouch the two guns were there his own sigsauer p and the hk p he now knew james noone had planted under his boat mccaleb reached into the bag and took his own weapon out he checked the action and tucked the pistol into the waistband of his jeans at the small of his back he pulled his jacket down over it when questioned on the night of james cordells murder james noone had provided deputies with a single address for both his home and workplace until mccaleb got there the address on atoll avenue in north hollywood defied identification as an apartment or an office that area of the valley was a hodgepodge mixture of residential commercial and even industrial zoning he slowly crawled north on the back through the cahuenga pass and finally picked up some speed as he switched to the north he exited on victory and drove west until he found atoll avenue the neighborhood he turned into was decidedly industrial he could smell a bakery and he passed a fenced yard where slabs of jagged granite were stacked and pointing at the sky there were warehouses without names on them there was a pool chemical supply wholesaler and an industrial waste recycling center just where atoll deadended at an old railroad spur with tall weeds poking up between the rails mccaleb turned the taurus down a driveway bordered on both sides by a long row of small singlegaragebay warehouses each unit was a separate small business or storage lockup some had the names of businesses painted over the aluminum rollup doors some had no identifying marks at all and were either unrented or used anonymously for storage mccaleb stopped the car in front of the rusting door marked with the address james noone had given deputies three months before there were no other markings on the door but the address he killed the cars engine and got out it was a black night no moon no stars the row of warehouses was dark save for a single floodlight down at the entrance mccaleb looked around he heard the tinny sound of musicjimi hendrix singing let me stand next to your fire from somewhere seemingly far away and further down the drive six warehouses away the door to one of the garages had been pulled down unevenly until it jammed offering a threefoot slice of the warehouses interior that looked like a crooked smile blacker than the sky he checked noones unit dropping to a crouch to study the line where the garage door met the concrete pavement he wasnt sure but there appeared to be a dim light emanating from within the warehouse he stepped closer and could make out the padlock that attached a steel ring on the door to a matching ring embedded in the concrete he stood up and banged the door with an open palm the noise was loud and he heard it reverberate inside he stepped back and looked around again other than the sound of the music there was only silence the air was still the night wind had not found its way down to the space between the rows of garages mccaleb got back in the car started it and backed it up at an angle so that the headlights were at least partially focused on noones garage he then killed the engine but left the lights on got out and went to the trunk after lifting up the trunk mat he found the jack assembly intact he removed the jack handle and came around the car to the garage door he looked up and down the drive once more and then bent down to the padlock as a bureau agent mccaleb had never once been involved in an illegal breakin he knew that they were a matter of routine but he had somehow avoided the ethical dilemma himself but he felt no dilemma now as he worked the iron bar into the hasp of the lock he wasnt carrying the badge anymore and above that this was personal noone was a killer and worse yet he had sought to pin his work on mccaleb mccaleb didnt give a second thought to noones rights to protection from unlawful search and seizure holding the jack handle on the far end for leverage he slowly began pulling the steel bar in a clockwise motion the padlock hasp remained strong but the steel ring attached to the door groaned under the pressure and then snapped off its solder points giving way mccaleb straightened up and looked around and listened nothing just hendrix covering bob dylans all along the watchtower he quickly moved back to the taurus and returned the jack handle to the sparetire kit pulled the trunk mat back over it and closed the trunk lid as he came around the car he bent over next to the front tire and ran two fingers along the wheel rim picking up a good amount of black carbon dust that had built up from the brake pads he stepped over to the garage door and squatting down by the lock he smeared the carbon over the break points of the solder so that it would appear as though the ring had been broken off the door some time ago and the break points had been exposed to the elements he then rubbed the rest of the dirt off his fingers onto one of his black socks when he was ready he gripped the doors pull handle with his right hand with his left he reached behind him and under his coat he brought it back gripping his pistol which he held at shoulder height pointing skyward with one move he stood and jerked the door up with him using its momentum to keep it moving up until it was above his head his eyes quickly scanned the dim confines of the garage his gun now pointed in the direction his eyes moved the cars headlights illuminated about a third of the room he could see an unmade cot and a stack of cardboard boxes against the left wall scanning right he saw the outline of a desk and file cabinets there was a computer on the desk the monitors screen apparently on and facing the rear wall throwing a violet glow against it mccaleb noticed the sixfootlong light hanging from the ceiling in the shadowy light his eyes traced the aluminum conduit from the junction box along the ceiling and down the wall to a switch near the cot he stepped sideways and reached for the switch without looking at it a fluorescent bulb blinked once buzzed and then lit the garage with its severe light mccaleb could now see that there was no one in the room and there were no closets to be checked just the approximately twentybytwelvefoot space cluttered with a mishmash of office furniture and equipment and the basic necessities of homea bed a chest of drawers an electric space heater a doublecoil hot plate and a halfsize refrigerator no sink and no bathroom mccaleb stepped backward and then around the car he reached in through the open window and shut off the lights he then slipped the pistol back into his waistband this time in the front for easier access finally he stepped into the garage if the air had been still outside then on the inside it seemed stagnant mccaleb moved slowly around the old steel government desk and looked at the computer the monitor was lit and a screen saver glowed on the screen random numbers of different sizes and colors floated on a sea of purple velvet mccaleb stared at the screen for a few moments and he felt a tugging inside almost a coiling of some deep muscle in his mind the picture of a single red apple bouncing on a dirty linoleum floor appeared and then was gone a tremble climbed the ladder of his spine shit he whispered he looked away from the computer screen noticing that also on the desk was a collection of books clasped between brass bookends most were reference books on accessing and using the internet there were two volumes containing internet addresses and two biographies of wellknown computer hackers there were also three books on crime scene investigation a manual on homicide investigation a book on an fbi investigation of a serial killer known as the poet and finally two books on hypnosis the last about a man named horace gomble mccaleb knew about gomble he had been the subject of more than one investigation by the bureaus serial crimes unit gomble was a former las vegas entertainer who had used his skills as a hypnotist along with drug enhancers to molest a series of young girls at county fairs throughout florida as far as mccaleb knew he was still in prison mccaleb moved slowly all the way behind the desk now and sat down in the worn command chair facing the computer using a pen from his pocket he pulled the desks center drawer open there was not much in it but a few pens and a plastic cdrom case he used his pen to flip the case over and saw that it was called brain scan he read the packaging and saw that the cd offered its user a guided tour of the human brain with detailed graphics and analysis of its workings he closed the drawer and used the pen again to open one of the two side drawers the first one was empty except for an unopened box of crackerjack he closed it and below it was a file drawer in this there were several manila files hanging in green folders hooked on two rails bending down to see better mccaleb read the name on the tab of the first file gloria torres he dropped the pen to the floor and in the same moment decided not to pick it up and that he didnt care anymore about leaving fingerprints or possibly infecting a crime scene he pulled the file out and opened it on the desk it contained photos of gloria torres in various clothing at various times of the day in two of the photos raymond was with her in one she was with graciela there were typewritten logs in the file surveillance logs detailed descriptions of glorias movements on a daytoday basis he quickly scanned these and saw repeated notations of her nightly stop at sherman market on her way home from work he closed the file left it on the desk and reached for the next one in the drawer he could have guessed the name written on the tab before he saw it james cordell he didnt bother opening it he knew it would contain photos and surveillance notes just like the first one instead he reached down and looked at the next file in line it was as expected donald kenyon he didnt pull that file either he used his finger to bend back the tabs on the remaining files so he could read them as he did this his heart lurched inside his chest as if it had somehow come loose inside he knew the names on the file tabs every single one of them its you he whispered and in his mind he saw the apples cascading onto the floor and going every which way he shoved the file drawer closed and the loud bang echoed off the concrete floor and steel walls startling him like a shot he looked out into the night through the open door and listened he heard nothing not even the music anymore only silence his eyes moved to the computer monitor and he studied the numbers moving lazily around on the screen he knew the computer had been left on for a reason not because noone was coming back mccaleb knew he was long gone no it had been left on for him mccaleb had been expected here he knew this now knew in his heart that noone had choreographed every move mccaleb tapped the space bar and the screen saver disappeared in its place was a prompt for a password mccaleb didnt hesitate he had the sense he was being played like a piano he typed in numbers in an order he knew by heart he hit the enter key and the computer went to work in a few moments the password was accepted and the screen flashed to the program manager template a white screen with various icons spread across the field mccaleb studied these quickly most were for accessing games there also were icons for accessing america online and word for windows the last symbol he looked at was a tiny file cabinet and he guessed that was the computers file manager icon he found the electronic mouse on the side of the computer and used it to move the computer arrow to the file cabinet he doubleclicked and the screen flashed to the file manager it was basic computer navigating in the file manager the listing of files ran down the left side of the screen in a neat column choosing one of the files and clicking the arrow on it would bring up the titles of the documents contained in that file in a column on the right side of the screen using the mouse mccaleb ran the arrow down the files column studying each one most were software files for the operation of various icon programs such as america online the las vegas casino game and others but eventually he came to a file titledcode he clicked the mouse and several document titles appeared on the right side of the screen he read through these quickly and realized they corresponded with the names on the file tabs in the desk drawer all except for one document mccaleb stared at it for a long moment his finger raised and poised over the mouse button mccalebdoc he clicked the mouse and the document quickly filled the screen mccaleb began to read it like a man reading his own obituary the words filled him with dread for he knew that they unalterably changed his life they stripped his soul from him took any meaning from his accomplishments and made a horrible mockery of them hello agent mccaleb it is you out there i would hope i will assume so i will assume that you have lived up to that wonderful reputation you carried so nobly i wonder are you alone are you running from them now as a wanted man but of course now you have what you need to save yourself from them but i am asking about before now how did it feel to be the hunted one i wanted you to know that feeling my feelings a terrible thing to live with fear no fear never sleeps most of all what i wanted was a place in your heart agent mccaleb i wanted always to be with you cain and abel kennedy and oswald darkness and light two worthy opponents chained together through time i could have killed you i had that power and opportunity but it would have been too easy dont you think the man on the dock asking directions your morning walk the man on the rock jetty with the fishing pole do you remember me now you do i was there but it would have been too easy dont you agree too easy you see i needed something more than vengeance or the vanquishing of a foe those are the goals of fools i wantedno i needed and cravedsomething different to test you first by turning you into me the villain the hunted one then when you emerged from that fire your skin scorched but your body whole to reveal myself as your most ardent benefactor yes it was me i followed her i studied her i chose her for you she was my valentine to you you are mine forever agent mccaleb every breath you take belongs to me every beat of that stolen heart is the echo of my voice in your head always every day remember every breath mccaleb folded his arms across his chest and held himself as though he had been flayed open with a blade a deep shudder rolled through him and a moan escaped his throat he pushed the chair back from the desk away from the horrible message still on the screen and bent his body forward into the crash position his plane was going down his thoughts were blood red and black he felt as though he were in some permanent void surrounded by a velvet curtain of black space his hands forever searching for the seam through which to escape but never finding it he saw the faces of graciela rivers and raymond as distant images receding into the darkness suddenly he felt a cold hand on his neck and he jumped a shriek escaping from his throat like a prisoner going over the wall he sat up it was winston his reaction had scared her as much as she had scared him terry are you okay yes i mean no its him noone is the code killer he killed all of them the last three for me he did it until he got it right he killed gloria torres for her heart for me so that i would live and be the testament to his glory the coincidence of the name and noones purpose suddenly struck mccaleb wait a minute winston said slow down what are you talking about its him its all here check the files the computer he killed those others he then decided to save me to kill for me he pointed to the computer screen where the message to mccaleb was still displayed he waited while she read it but finally couldnt contain himself all the pieces they were right there all the time what pieces the code it was so simple he used every digit but the number one no one get it i am no one thats all he was saying terry lets talk about this later tell me how you got here how did you know it was noone the tape the session we did with him the hypnosis what about it remember how i told you not to speak so the subject would not be confused right you said only you should ask questions to noone anything between us should be signals or written down but at the end when i knew it was all going to shit i got frustrated i said to you anything else and you shook your head no i asked are you sure and you shook your head again i broke my own rule by speaking to you the thing is i asked those questions to you out loud so noone should have answered me if he was in a true hypnotic trance he should have answered because he would not have known those questions were directed at you but he didnt answer it shows cognizance of the situation he knew either by the direction of my voice or its inflection that i was talking to you instead of him he shouldnt have known that not in a true trance he should have answered every question spoken in that room unless it was specifically addressed to someone else i never used your name he was faking right and if he was faking it then his answers were bogus it meant he was part of the setup i had the videos compared before i came here there are hard copies in my car james noone and the good samaritan are the same guy the shooter winston shook her head as if to signal brain overload her eyes scanned the room for a place to sit down there was only the cot you want to sit here mccaleb said standing up i want to sit down but not in here we have to back out of here terry i need to call captain hitchens and then the others lapd and the bureau i better put out a pickup on noone too mccaleb was amazed that she still didnt have all the pieces together arent you listening there is no noone he doesnt exist what do you mean the name it goes with everything else noone break it down and you get no one i am no one the pieces were there all the time he shook his head and dropped back into the chair he put his face in his hands how am i i cant live with this again winston put her hand on his neck but this time he didnt startle come on terry lets not think about that lets go out to the car and wait i have to get a crime scene crew in here maybe get some prints so we can id this guy mccaleb stood up and walked around the desk and out toward the door he spoke without looking back at her he never left a print anywhere else before i doubt he started now two hours later mccaleb was sitting in the taurus parked out on atoll behind the yellow police lines that had been strung between the rows of garage warehouses a hundred yards down the drive he could see the cluster of activity in and around noones brightly lit garage there were several detectivessome mccaleb recognized from the code killer task force technicians videographers from at least two of the agencies involved and a half dozen uniformed officers standing by moths to the flame he thought he watched it all with a strange detachment his thoughts were on other things graciela and raymond and noone he couldnt stop thinking about the man who called himself noone he had been in the same room with him he had been that close he needed a drink wanted the burning taste of whiskey in his throat but he knew to take that taste would be the same as putting a gun to his head he knew that despite the pain cutting through him he would not give noone or whoever he was that satisfaction he decided in the darkness of the car that he would live despite it all he would live he didnt notice the men walking down the drive toward him until they were almost to the taurus he flicked on the lights and identified them as nevins and uhlig and arrango he turned the lights off and waited they opened the doors of the car and got in nevins in the front the other two in the back with arrango directly behind mccaleb got any heat in this thing nevins asked its getting cold out here mccaleb started the car but waited to turn the heater on until the engine got warm he looked in the rearview mirror at arrango it was too dark to see if he had a toothpick in his mouth wheres walters busy okay nevins said uh we came down to tell you it looks like we were wrong about you mccaleb im sorry were sorry looks like noone is the guy you did good work mccaleb only nodded it was a halfassed apology but he didnt care about that what he had found out in order to clear his name would be harder to live with than if he had been publicly accused of the murders apologies meant nothing to him we know its been a long night for you and we want to get you on your way i was thinking we could just kind of get your rundown on how all of this shakes out and then maybe tomorrow you come in and give a formal statement what do you think fine as far as the formal statement goes ill give it to winston not you guys fair enough i can understand that but for now why dont you tell us how in your view how this whole thing works can you do that mccaleb leaned forward and switched on the heater he composed his thoughts for a few moments before beginning ill call him noone because thats all we have and maybe all well ever have it begins with the code killer that was noone at that time i was the bureaus point man on the task force by agreement with the lapd i became the media spokesman on the case i led the briefings requests for interviews went to me for ten months my face became synonymous on tv with the code killer and so noone fixated on me as we got closer to him he fixated on me he sent letters to me in his mind i was the nemesis i was the embodiment of the task force that was hunting him arent you taking a lot of the credit for yourself arrango asked i mean you werent the only shut up and listen arrango you might learn something mccaleb stared at him in the rearview and arrango stared back mccaleb saw nevins hold a hand up in a calming motion directed at arrango he gave me the credit mccaleb said i didnt take it eventually when he knew the risks were too great he dropped out the killings stopped the code killer disappeared about that same time i went down with with my problems i needed the transplant and it became news because i had been a face in the news noone saw this he could have easily been aware of this and he hatched what he would consider his grandest scheme he decided that rather than kill you he would save you uhlig said mccaleb nodded it would give him the ultimate victory because it would last and last to simply eliminate me kill me would bring only a fleeting sense of fulfillment but by saving me now there was something unique something that would get him into the hall of fame and hed always have me around as a reminder of how smart and powerful he is do you understand i understand nevins said but thats the psychological side what i want to know is how he did it howd he get the names how did he know about kenyon and cordell and then torres his computer your techs are going to have to take that thing apart weve got bob clearmountain coming in nevins said you remember him mccaleb nodded clearmountain was the la field offices resident computer expert a hacker extraordinary in his own right good then hell be able to answer that question better than me eventually my guess is that youll find a hacking program in that computer noone got into bopra and from there got the names he chose his targets based on age physical fitness and proximity and he went to work with kenyon and cordell things went wrong they went right with torres that is according to noones view and he planned all along to lay it on you all i think is that he wanted me to follow the trail and find out for myself what he had done he knew that would happen if i became a suspect because then i would have to look into it myself but then that didnt happen at first because the case investigators missed the clues he looked at arrango in the mirror as he said this he could see the detectives eyes turn dark with anger he was about to explode arrango the fact is you treated it as an everyday stopandrob with the addition of shots fired nothing more and nothing less you missed it so noone jumpstarted the whole thing how uhlig and nevins asked in unison my involvement came about because of an article in the times that article was prompted by a letter from a reader whatever name was on that letter i bet it was noone he stopped there waiting for disagreement none came the letter prompts the article the article prompts graciela rivers graciela rivers prompts me like dominoes a thought suddenly occurred to him he remembered the man in the old foreign car watching from across the street the first time he visited the sherman market he realized the car matched the one he had seen speeding from the marina lot the night he chased the intruder i think noone was watching me all along he said watching his plan unfold he knew when it was time to get into my boat and plant the evidence he knew when to call you he looked at nevins whose eyes shifted away and out the windshield you got an anonymous call what was said actually it was an anonymous message taken down by the overnight person it just said check the blood mccaleb has their blood that was it it fits that was him just another move in the game they were silent for a while the windows were beginning to fog with the heat and their breath well i dont know how much of this well ever confirm nevins said certainly a lot of maybes mccaleb nodded he doubted any of it would ever be confirmed because he doubted noone would ever be identified or found okay then nevins continued i guess well be in touch he opened his door and the others followed before he got out uhlig reached over the seat and tapped mccalebs shoulder with a harmonica it was on the floor back here he said as arrango stepped out onto the asphalt mccaleb lowered his window and looked up at him you know you couldve busted it it was all there in the book it was waiting for you fuck you mccaleb he walked away following the two agents back toward noones garage mccaleb smiled slightly he had to admit that in spite of everything he still wasnt above the guilty pleasure of tweaking arrango mccaleb sat in the car for a few more minutes before leaving it was late past ten oclock and he was wondering where to go he had not talked to graciela yet and he looked forward to the task with a mixture of dread and relief the latter coming from knowing that one way or another their relationship would be clearly defined soon the problem he had was that he wasnt sure that he wanted to deliver his tidings at night his news seemed better delivered during the unflinching light of day he put his hand on the ignition and took one last look up the drive toward the lighted garage where his life had been so brutally changed he saw that the light cast from the garage and across the driveway was moving he guessed that the overhead light had been disturbed somehow and was swinging something occurred to him then and he took his hand off the ignition mccaleb stepped out of the taurus and without hesitation ducked under the yellow tape the uniform officer in charge of entry to the crime scene said nothing he had probably inferredwronglythat mccaleb was a detective having watched three of the lead investigators walk down and sit in the car with him he walked to the periphery of the light and waited until he could catch jaye winstons eye she was standing with a clipboard and writing down descriptions of the warehouses contents every item in the place was being tagged and taken when winston stepped out of the way of one of the technicians she glanced out into the darkness and mccaleb caught her attention with a wave she walked out of the garage and over to him she had a cautious smile on her face i thought you were clear why arent you gone im going just wanted to say thanks for everything you gettin anything in there she frowned and shook her head you were right place is clean latents guys havent even found a smudge there are prints on the computer but my guess is that they are yours i dont know how were going to track this guy its like he was never here he signaled her closer when he noticed arrango step out of the garage and put a cigarette in his mouth i think he made a mistake he said quietly get your best latents man and go to the star center have him laser the light tubes in the ceiling of the interview room when i was setting up the hypnosis session i took down some lights and handed them to noone he had to take them from me or he might give himself away there might be prints her face brightened and she smiled its on the tape of the session he said you can tell them it was your find thanks terry she clapped him gently on the shoulder he nodded and started walking back to the car she called after him and he looked back are you all right he nodded i dont know where you are going but good luck he waved and turned back toward his destination it seemed that every light was on in gracielas home and this time mccaleb didnt linger in the car he knew there was no longer any time to brood over choices he had to face her and tell her the truthtell her everything and accept the consequences once again she opened the door before he got there this woman who cares so much as to watch and wait for me he thought as he stepped to the door now i must crush her heart terry where have you been ive been so worried she rushed from the door and embraced him he felt his will weaken but not break he pulled her around to his side and led her back in with his arm around her shoulder holding her close for what might be the last time lets go in he said i have things to tell you are you all right for now they went to the living room and he sat next to her on the sectional he held both her hands in his raymond in bed yes what is it terry whats wrong its over they havent caught him yet but they know who it is hopefully theyll get him soon im in the clear tell me he squeezed her hands he realized that his were sweating and let hers go it felt as if he were letting loose a fallen bird that he had nursed back to health he felt that he would never hold her hands again remember that night we talked about faith and how hard it is for me to have it she nodded before i tell you everything i want you to know that in the last few daysactually in all the time that ive known youi have felt something inside of me coming back its a faith of some sort maybe a belief in something i dont know but i do know it was a start a beginning of something good was he looked away from her for a moment to try to put the words together it was hard he knew he only had this one chance he looked back at her but its so new and so fragile this change and i dont know if it can last with what i have to tell you but i want you to decide i havent prayed for anything in a long time but ill say a prayer that i see youand raymondon my dock again or ill pick up the phone and ill hear your voice im going to leave it up to you to decide he leaned into her and kissed her gently on the cheek she didnt resist tell me she said quietly graciela your sister is dead because of me because of something i did a long time ago because i crossed a line somewhere and allowed my ego to challenge a madmans gloria is dead his eyes dropped away from hers the pain he had just put into them was too much for him to witness tell me she said again even quieter this time and he did he told her about the man known for the time being only as james noone he told her of the trail he had followed to the garage warehouse he told her what he found there and what was waiting for him on the computer she began to cry as he told it quiet tears that rolled down her cheeks and fell to the denim blouse she wore he wanted to reach out to her grab her and hold her close and kiss the tears on her cheeks but he couldnt he knew he was out of her world at that moment he could not enter of his own choice she would have to invite him back in when he was done they sat quietly for a few moments graciela finally reached up and with open palms smeared the tears on her cheeks i must look awful no you dont she looked down at the rug through the glass coffee table and a long period of silence passed by what will you do now she finally asked im not sure but i have a few ideas im going to find him graciela cant you leave it let the police find him mccaleb shook his head i dont think i can not now if i dont find him and face him ill never know if i can get past this i dont know if that makes sense or not she nodded still looking at the floor and more silence went by finally she looked up at him i want you to go now terry i need to be alone mccaleb nodded and slowly stood up okay again he fought an almost overwhelming urge to just touch her nothing more he just wanted to feel her warmth once more like on the first day when she had touched him goodbye graciela goodbye terry he crossed the room and headed toward the door on his way he glanced at the china cabinet in the living room and saw the framed photo of gloria torres she was smiling at the camera on that happy day so long ago it was a smile he knew would always haunt him after a night of fitful sleep with dreams of being dragged down through deep dark water mccaleb rose at dawn he showered and then made himself a heavy breakfastan onion and green pepper omelet microwaved sausage and a half quart of orange juice when he was done he still felt hungry and didnt know why afterward he went down to the head and took another reading of his vital signs everything was fine at five after seven he called jaye winstons office number she was there and he could tell by her voice that she had worked straight through night two things mccaleb said when do you want to do this formal statement and when do i get my car back well the cherokee you can have any time i just have to call over to release it where is it right here our impound lot i suppose i have to come get it well youve got to come out here anyway to give me a statement why dont you do both at the same time okay when i want to get this over with i want to get out of here take a vacation where are you going i dont know i just have to get away try to work all of this poison out maybe vegas now thats a great place for mental rehabilitation mccaleb ignored her sarcasm i know so when can we meet ive got to put the case together asap and i need your statement so anytime this morning would be good for me ill just make room for you then im on my way buddy lockridge was sleeping on the cockpit bench mccaleb rousted him and he woke with a start what ishey terror youre back man yeah im back hows my car man its still running listen get up ive got one more trip to make and i need you to drop me off lockridge slowly pulled himself up into a sitting position he had been lying under a sleeping bag he gathered it around him and rubbed his eyes what time is it its seventhirty fuck man i know but this will be the last time everything okay yeah everythings fine i just need you to drop me the sheriffs office so i can get my car i need to go by a bank on the way theyre not open this early theyll be open by the time we get out to whittier so if im driving you out to pick your car up who is going to drive it back here me lets go but you said you arent supposed to be driving man especially a car with an air bag dont worry about it buddy they were on the way a half hour later mccaleb brought a duffel bag with a change of clothes and everything else he would need for his trip he also brought a thermos of coffee and two cups he poured coffee and filled buddy in on the case and all that had happened while they drove buddy asked questions for most of the drive i guess ill have to buy a paper tomorrow he said it will probably be on tv too hey is it going to be a book will i be in it i dont know the story will probably hit the news today i guess it depends on how big a story it is before anybody decides on a book do they pay you to use your name like that in a book i mean or like in a movie i dont know i guess you could ask for something you were an important part you came up with that missing picture in cordells car thats right i did lockridge seemed proud of his part and the prospect of possibly making some money from it and the gun i found the gun that prick hid under the boat mccaleb frowned you know what buddy if theres ever a book or if any reporters or cops come around i would like it a lot better if you never mentioned that gun that would help me a lot lockridge glanced over at him and then back at the road no problem then i wont say a word good unless i tell you otherwise and if anybody comes to me about a book ill be sure to tell em to talk to you thanks man it was after nine by the time they fought through all the traffic to whittier mccaleb had lockridge stop by a bank of america branch while he went in and wrote a check for taking the cash in twenties and tens a few minutes later the taurus pulled into the star center parking lot mccaleb counted out and handed it to lockridge whats this for thats for letting me use the car and for the ride today also im going to be away for a few days will you keep an eye on the boat for me will do man where you going not sure yet and i dont know when ill be back thats okay twofifty goes a long way remember that woman who visited me the pretty one sure im hoping shell come by the boat looking for me watch for her okay what do i do if she shows up mccaleb thought a moment just tell her im still gone but that i was hoping shed come by mccaleb opened the car door before getting out he shook lockridges hand and told him again that he had been a lot of help okay im out of here sure thing man have a good one oh hey know what ill probably be doing a lot of driving you mind if i borrow one of those harps you got take your pick he fished around in the door storage pocket and came out with three harmonicas mccaleb picked the one he had been playing during the drive the other night along the coast highway thats a good one you start with the key of c thanks buddy you sure took your sweetass time winston said as mccaleb walked up to her desk ive been wondering where the hell youve been ive been dicking around at the impound yard for an hour mccaleb responded i cant believe you people you take my car on a bullshit warrant and i have to pay towing and impound fees a hundred and eighty bucks there is no justice in this world jaye look just be lucky they didnt lose it and you got it back in one piece have a seat im not quite ready then whatre you complaining about me being late for she didnt answer mccaleb took the chair at the side of her desk and watched as she went through a typed report apparently proofreading and then initialing the bottom of each page okay she said i was going to use one of the interview rooms the tapes already set up shall we wait a sec whats happened since last night oh thats right you havent been around you get any prints off the light tubes she broke into a smile and nodded why didnt you tell me mccaleb protested what did you get everything two palms both thumbs four fingers we put it on the box and got a hit our boy is local name is daniel crimmins thirtytwo years old and you remember that profile you did for the code killer task force well you were deadon mccaleb a slam dunk mccaleb was beside himself with energy though he outwardly tried to remain calm the last pieces of the puzzle were dropping into place he tried to recall the suspects name from the case files but drew a blank tell me he was an lapd academy washout that was five years ago as near as we can tell since then hes had a number of private security jobs i dont mean tin badge stuff computer stuff he advertised on the internet had a web page sent mailers to businesses he basically sold computer security were hearing that he sometimes got work by hacking into a companys computer and then sending the ceo email telling him how easy it was and why they should hire him to make their system hackproof bopra you got it weve got a team over there now but they called in a little while ago theres an executive who remembers getting email from crimmins last year but he blew it off as a prank he killed the message and never got another one but it shows that crimmins was inside bopra mccaleb nodded anybody get his lapd file yet yeah arrango hes being a prick with it dealing it out on a needtoknow basis but basically the guy lasted five months reason for his termination wasquotefailure to thrive in the collegial atmosphere of the academy translation the guy was an introvert who would never last in a squad car no partner would take him so they washed him out the problem for him was he was second generation his old man retired up to blue heaven ten years ago uhlig had someone in the idaho field office look dad up he said as far as he knew his son was currently on the lapd he didnt know danny boy had been a washout because danny boy didnt tell him he says he hasnt seen his son in something like five or six years but when they talk on the phone the boy always has good war stories yeah theyre just made up mccaleb saw that it all fit the authority complex crimmins had transferred it from the father to the lapd after he was washed out the expulsion from the academy could have provided the psychic break that turned a harmless fantasy life into a deadly pastime the murders were all on lapd turf he was showing the institution that deemed him unworthy just how smart clever and worthy he was it occurred to mccaleb that when he had profiled the code killer three years before he had suggested that dismissed officers and academy washouts be questioned as a priority as far as he knew that had been done wait this guy should have been questioned back then failed law enforcement career was in the profile he was questioned thats why arrango is dicking around with the file somehow crimmins passed the test he was interviewed by a team from the task force but he didnt raise an eyebrow or warrant a second look still it mustve scared him he was interviewed four weeks after the last code killing maybe its the reason he stopped probably still its not going to look very good when it comes out this guy was interviewed and skated too fucking bad i say let the chips fall weve got the press conference scheduled for three oclock mccaleb considered what she had said about the killing stopping after crimmins had been interviewed he felt a thrill of satisfaction that it might have been his directive to interview academy washouts that had halted the killings while he was savoring the thought winston opened a file and took a color photo off a stack of them she handed it to him it showed crimmins in his academy uniform clean cut clean shaven a thin face and hopeful eyes that seemed to betray his confidence it was as if he knew when the photo was taken that he would not make it that there would be no graduation photo so it looks like when he was noone there was not much of a disguise used he said the glasses and something inside his cheeks to make his face look fuller right probably because he knew he would have direct contact with cops and a fullon disguise would show can i keep this sure well be giving them out today whats next you got addresses nothing good the warehouse you already found was the only thing current but theres got to be another place his web page was still operational even after we unplugged the warehouse it means hes got another computer somewhere running as we speak cant they just trace the phone line in hes got an anonymous provider whats that anything going to or from the web page goes through this anonymous provider of internet access we cant trace and we cant crack open the provider because of first amendment bullshit besides the expert over at the bureau bob clearmountain told me guys like him now use microwaves instead of hardwire phone lines makes it harder to trace and locate the technology was beyond mccaleb he changed the subject you going to id him at the press conference think so well get the photo out show the hypnotism video see what it brings by the way keisha russell at the times did you tip her off i owed her the call she helped me at the beginning of this thing i left her a voice mail this morning thought id give her a head start on it sorry no thats okay i like her i needed to talk to her anyway nevins told me what you said last night about it probably being our guy who sent the letter that prompted the story about you in the times right did she keep the letter no she only remembered it was signed bob something or other it was probably him he had this thing so wired mccaleb suddenly thought of something graciela had told him that she had not become aware of the times story on him until a man who claimed he had worked with glory called and told her of the story she then went to the library to read it mccaleb realized that the caller could have been crimmins setting his plan into motion what is it winston asked nothing i was just thinking he decided not to tell winston his hunch yet he would check it out himself it would give him a reason to break his promise not to call graciela he could make it an official call so winston said where do you think he is crimmins he hesitated in the wind i guess winston studied his face a moment i thought you might have an idea he looked away from her and down at the desk well the wind doesnt blow forever she said letting it go hes got to come down somewhere hope so they were silent then finished with each other except for the formality of the statement he would have to tape it may be none of my business winston said but how are you going to deal with this im working on it well if you ever need somebody to talk to he nodded his thanks okay then should we go get this over with an hour later mccaleb was alone in the interview room he had told his story to winston and she had left with the tape to get it transcribed she had given him permission to use the phone that was on the table and told him he had the room for as long as he needed it he composed his thoughts for a few moments and then punched in the number for the nursing station in the emergency room at holy cross he asked for graciela but the woman who answered said graciela was not there is she on break no shes not here today okay thank you he hung up he guessed that she had called in sick he couldnt blame her not with the news he had delivered the night before he punched in her home number but after five rings the call was picked up by an answering machine after the beep he fumbled through the message he wanted to leave uh graciela its me terry you there he waited a long moment and then continued um i just wanted they told me you werent at work and i uh i wanted to say hello and theres a couple of questions i need to ask you about things loose ends mostly but it would help toanyway im gonna go and ill probably try to call you later on um ill probably be on the road so you dont have to worry about calling me back he wished he could erase the message and start over he cursed to himself and hung up then wondered if the curse had been recorded he shook his head got up and left the room it took him two days to find the picture that daniel crimmins as james noone had drawn during the hypnosis session mccaleb started at rosarita beach and then worked his way south he found it between la fonda and ensenada on a remote stretch of the coast playa grande was a small village on a twotiered rock flow overlooking the sea the village mostly consisted of a motel with six small detached bungalows a pottery store a small restaurant and market and a pemex station there was also a small stable for renting horses to ride down on the beach the commercial core if it was big enough to be called that was at the edge of a cliff overlooking the beach on the stepped bluff above it was a wide scattering of small houses and trailer homes what made mccaleb stop was the stable he remembered crimmins describing horses on the beach he got out of the cherokee and walked down a steep trail cut through the rock outcroppings to the beach the wide white beach was a private enclave about a mile long and enclosed on each end by huge jagged rock flows into the sea near the south end mccaleb saw the rock overhang that crimmins had described during the hypnosis session mccaleb knew that the best and most convincing way to lie is to tell as much truth as possible so he had taken his subjects description of the place at which he felt most relaxed in the world to be a true description of a place he knew now mccaleb had found it he had arrived at playa grande through simple deduction and legwork the description crimmins had given during the session had obviously been the pacific coast he had said he liked to drive down to this place and since mccaleb knew there was no california beach south of la as remote as he had described or with horses on it that obviously made the destination mexico and since crimmins had said he drove there that pretty much eliminated cabo and the other points far south along the baja peninsula it took two days to cover the coastline that was left mccaleb stopped at every village and every time he saw a cutoff from the highway to the beach crimmins had been right it was a truly beautiful and restful spot the sand was like sugar and a million years of crashing waves had carved a deep bite into the cliff face creating the overhang that resembled nothing so much as a rock wave curled and about to break over the beach mccaleb was the only person on the beach to be seen in either direction it was a weekday and he guessed that this stretch of sand lay largely unpopulated until the weekends that was why crimmins had liked it three horses were on the beach they milled around an empty feed trough while waiting for customers there was no need to tie them the beach was completely enclosed by water and rock the only way off it was the steep trail back up to the stable mccaleb wore a baseball cap and sunglasses as protection against the power of the midday sun he wore long pants and a windbreaker as well but entranced by the beauty of the spot he remained on the beach long after he determined daniel crimmins was nowhere to be seen after a while a teenager wearing shorts and a sweatshirt with no sleeves came down the trail and approached you would like horse ride no gracias from the pocket of his coat mccaleb pulled the folded photos tony banks had made from the videotapes he showed them to the boy you seen this man i want to find the boy stared at the photos and made no indication he understood finally he just shook his head no no find he turned and headed back to the trail mccaleb returned the photos to his jacket and after a few minutes headed back up the steep incline himself he stopped twice on the way up but the climb still left him exhausted mccaleb ate lobster enchiladas at the restaurant for lunch it cost him the equivalent of american he showed the photos a few more times but got no takers he walked to the pemex station after lunch and used the pay phone there to check the machine on his boat for messages there were none he then called gracielas number for the fourth time while he had been on the road and once again got her machine he didnt leave a message this time if she was ignoring his calls it was probably because she simply no longer wanted to talk to him mccaleb checked into the playa grande motel paying cash and using a phony name as an afterthought he showed the photos to the man behind the counter in the small office and got another negative response his bungalow had a partial view of the beach below and a wide view of the pacific he checked what he could see of the beach and it was still empty except for the horses he took off his windbreaker and decided to take a nap it had been a wearying two days of driving bad roads walking on sand and climbing steep trails before lying down he opened his duffel bag on the bed put his toothbrush and toothpaste in the bathroom and then arranged the plastic vials containing his medicines and the box of disposable thermometer strips on the bed table he took the sigsauer out of the bag and put it on the table as well it was always a marginal risk taking weapons across the border but at the crossing as expected mccaleb had been simply waved through by the bored mexican federales as he dropped off to sleep with his head between two musty pillows he decided he would try the beach again at sunset crimmins had described the sunset during the hypnosis session maybe he would be on the beach then if not mccaleb decided he would begin looking for crimmins in the scattered neighborhood above the village mccaleb was confident he would find him he felt no doubt that he had found the place crimmins had described he dreamed in colors for the first time in months his eyes darting under tight eyelids he was on a runaway horse a huge appaloosa the same color as the wet sand galloping down the beach he was being chased but his unsteady mount prevented him from turning to see who it was behind him he only knew that he must run that if he stopped he would perish the animals hooves were throwing great clods of wet sand in the air as it galloped the rhythmic cadence of the horses gallop was replaced by the pounding sound of his own heart mccaleb came awake and tried to calm his body after a few moments he decided he should check his temperature as he sat up and put his feet down on the carpet his eyes checked the bed table by habit he was looking for the clock that was on the table next to his own bed on the boat but there was no clock here he looked away and then his eyes darted back to the table as he realized the gun was gone mccaleb quickly stood up and looked around the room an eerie feeling of dislocation coming over him he knew he had placed the gun on the table before sleeping someone had been in the room while he slept crimmins he had no doubt crimmins had been in the room he hastily checked the windbreaker and duffel bag and found nothing else missing he scanned the room again and his eyes came across a fishing pole standing in the corner of the room next to the door he went to the corner and grabbed it it was the same model rod and reel combination he had bought for raymond as he turned it in his hands and studied it he found the initials rt had been cut into the cork hand grip raymond had marked the pole as his or someone had marked it for him regardless the message was clear crimmins had raymond mccaleb was fully alert now his chest filling with the constricting ache of dread he punched his fists into the arms of the windbreaker as he put it on and then left the bungalow after studying the door and finding no sign that the lock had been tampered with he moved quickly to the motel office the bell ringing loudly overhead as he shoved the door open the man who had taken his money stood up from the chair behind the counter an uneasy smile on his face he was about to say something when mccaleb in one unhesitating motion stepped to the counter reached over it and grabbed the man by the front of his shirt he jerked him forward until his body was prone over the top of the counter the edge of the formica digging into his substantial gut mccaleb bent down until he was in the mans face where is he que the man the one you gave the key to my room where is he no habla mccaleb pulled down on the mans shirt harder and put his forearm on the back of his neck mccaleb could feel his own strength flagging but pushed down harder bullshit you dont where is he the man sputtered and moaned i dont know he finally said please i dont know where he is was he alone when he came here alone yes where does he live i do not know this please he say he your brother and have surprise for you i give him the key so he surprise you mccaleb let go and pushed the man back over the counter so hard that he fell backward right into his chair he held his hands up in a beseeching manner and mccaleb realized he must be truly scaring the man please please what please i dont want to have trouble its too late how did he know i was here i call him he pay me he come here yesterday and say you might come he give me phone number he pay me and how did you know it was me he give me picture all right give it to me the number and the picture without hesitation the man reached to a drawer in front of him mccaleb quickly reached over and grabbed his wrist and roughly jerked it away from the drawer he opened the drawer himself and his eyes held on a photograph sitting on top of a clutter of paperwork it was a photo of mccaleb walking along the rock jetty near the marina with graciela and raymond mccaleb could feel his face turning red as the anger pushed hot blood into the tightened muscles of his jaw he held the photo up and studied the back there was a phone number written on the back please the motel man said you take the money one hundred american dollars i dont want trouble for you he was reaching into his shirt pocket no mccaleb said you keep it you earned it he yanked the door open then hitting the overhead bell so hard that the twine it hung from snapped and the bell bounced into the corner of the office he went through the gravel parking lot and over to the phone at the pemex station he dialed the number on the back of the photograph and listened to a series of clicks on the line as the call went through at least two callforwarding circuits mccaleb cursed to himself he would not be able to trace the number to an address even if he could get someone in local authority to do it for him finally the call reached the last circuit and started ringing mccaleb held his breath and waited but the call was not picked up by human or machine after twelve rings he crashed the receiver down onto its hook but it bounced off and dropped swinging erratically back and forth beneath the phone mccaleb stood frozen by anger and the impotence of his position the light sound of the stillringing phone buzzing from below after a long moment he realized he was staring through the glass pane of the phone booth at the motel parking lot his cherokee was there and one other car a dusty white caprice with a california plate on the back quickly he left the booth crossed the parking lot to the trail and headed down to the beach the trail cut between rock outcroppings and obscured any view below mccaleb didnt see the beach until he got to the bottom and made the final turn to the left the beach was empty he walked straight out to the waters edge looking both ways but the sand in both directions was deserted even the horses had been taken in for the day his eyes were eventually drawn to the pocket of deep shadows beneath the rock overhang he headed that way beneath the overhang the sound of the surf was amplified to a magnitude that sounded like the cheering in a stadium moving from the bright light of the open beach into the deep shadows temporarily blinded mccaleb he stopped closed his eyes tightly and reopened them as his focus returned he saw the outlines of the jagged rock surrounding him then from the deepest pocket of the enclave stepped crimmins he held the sigsauer in his right hand the muzzle of the weapon pointing at mccaleb i dont want to hurt you he said but you know i will if i have to he spoke loudly so that his voice would carry above the din and echo of waves where is he crimmins where is raymond dont you mean where are they mccaleb had assumed as much but the confirmed knowledge of the terror graciela and raymond were feeling at that momentif they were still alivecut into him he took a step toward crimmins but then stopped when crimmins raised the aim of the weapon to his chest easy now lets be calm they are safe and sound agent mccaleb not to worry about that their safety in fact is in your hands not mine mccaleb made a quick study of crimmins he had jet black hair and a mustache now he was growing a beard or needed a shave he wore pointedtoe boots black jeans and a denim cowboy shirt with double pockets and a design seam across the chest his current look put him somewhere between the good samaritan and james noone what do you want mccaleb demanded crimmins ignored the question he spoke in a calm voice he was confident he had the upper hand i knew if anyone would come it would be you i had to take precautions i said what do you want you want me is that it crimmins stared wistfully out past mccaleb and shook his head mccaleb studied the weapon he could see the safety was off but the hammer was not cocked back it was impossible to tell whether crimmins had chambered a round my last sunset here crimmins said i have to leave this place now he looked back at mccaleb smiling as though inviting mccaleb to acknowledge the loss you performed much better than i had anticipated it wasnt me it was you crimmins you fucked up you left your fingerprints for them you told me about this place crimmins frowned and nodded acknowledging the mistakes a long beat of silence went by i know why you came here he finally said mccaleb did not reply you want to take from me the gift that i gave you mccaleb felt the bile of hate rising and burning in his throat he remained silent a vengeful man crimmins said i thought i told you how fleeting the fulfillment of vengeance is is that what you learned killing all of those people i bet when you closed your eyes at night the old man was still there no matter how many you killed he wouldnt go away would he what did he do to you crimmins to fuck you up so bad crimmins tightened his grip on the gun and mccaleb could see his jaw take on a more pronounced line this is not about that he responded angrily its about you i want you to live i want to live none of it will have been worth it unless you live dont you see that dont you feel the bond between us we are tied together now we are brothers youre crazy crimmins whatever i am it is not of my doing i dont have time for your excuses what do you want i want you to thank me for your life i want to be left alone i want time i need time to move my things and find a new place you will have to give it to me now how do i know you even have them you have a fishing pole its nothing because you know me you know i have them he waited and mccaleb said nothing i was there when you called and groveled to her machine when you pleaded for her to pick up like a pathetic schoolboy mccaleb felt his anger become shaded with embarrassment where are they he yelled they are close bullshit howd you get them across the border crimmins smiled and gestured with the gun the same way you took this across no questions asked going south i gave your graciela a choice she and the boy could ride up in the front and be on their best behavior or they could ride in the trunk she acted accordingly you better not have hurt them mccaleb realized how desperate he sounded and wished he hadnt said it whether that happens depends on you how i leave now and you do not follow you do not attempt to track me you get in your car and go back up to your boat you stay by the phone and i will call you from time to time to make sure you are there and not following me when i know i am safe from you i will let the woman and the boy go mccaleb shook his head he knew it was a lie killing graciela and raymond would be the final misery crimmins would joyfully and without guilt bestow on him the ultimate victory he knew that no matter what happened after he couldnt let crimmins off the beach alive he had come to mexico for one reason he now had to act on it crimmins seemed to know his thoughts and smiled no choice agent mccaleb i walk away from here or they die alone in a black hole you kill me and no one will find them not in time starvation darkness it is an awful thing besides you forget something he held the gun up again and waited a beat for mccaleb to reply but there was nothing i hope you think of me often crimmins said as i shall think of you he started walking toward the light crimmins mccaleb said you have nothing crimmins turned and his eyes dropped to the gun now in mccalebs hand mccaleb took two steps toward him and raised the muzzle of the p to his chest you should have checked the duffel bag crimmins countered by raising the sigsauer to mccalebs chest your guns empty crimmins mccaleb saw doubt flick through the other mans eyes it went by fast but he caught it he knew then that crimmins had not checked the gun he didnt know that it contained a full clip but no round had been chambered but this one isnt they stood there each man holding the muzzle of his gun a foot from the others heart crimmins looked down at the p then up to mccalebs eyes he stared intently as if trying to read something in that moment mccaleb thought about the photo in the newspaper article the piercing eyes that showed no mercy he knew then that he had those eyes again crimmins pulled the trigger of the sigsauer the hammer snapped on an empty chamber mccaleb fired the p and watched as crimmins jerked backward and fell flat on his back on the sand his arms outstretched at ninetydegree angles his mouth open in surprise mccaleb moved over him and quickly grabbed away the sigsauer he then used his shirt to wipe off the p and dropped it on the sand just out of the dying mans reach mccaleb got down on his knees and leaned over crimmins careful not to get blood on himself crimmins i dont know if i believe in a god but ill hear your confession tell me where they are help me save them finish it with something good fuck you crimmins said forcefully his mouth wet with blood they die and thats on you he raised a hand and pointed a finger at mccaleb he then dropped it to the sand and seemed drained by the outburst he moved his lips once more but mccaleb couldnt hear him he bent over closer what did you say i saved you i gave you life mccaleb stood up then brushed the sand off his pants and looked down at crimmins his eyes were tearing and his mouth was moving as he labored for his final breaths their eyes connected and held youre wrong mccaleb said i traded you for me i saved myself mccaleb drove along the gravel roads on the bluff over the village of playa grande and studied each house and trailer he passed looking for the telltale sign of a telephone line hookup or a mounted microwave dish he had all the windows of the car open and each time he came upon a property that fit the search profile he pulled the ear in close turned it off and listened not many of the properties were connected to the outside world by telephone or airwaves mccaleb assumed most of the people who lived in so remote a location chose to do so because they didnt want that connection they were expatriates and recluses people who wanted to be cut off from the rest of the world it was another reason crimmins had chosen the place twice people came out of their homes to ask mccaleb what he wanted he showed them the photos but got negative responses he apologized for the intrusion and moved on by the time the sun was close to the horizon he was growing desperate without daylight he knew his search would be untenable he would have to stop at every house or wait until the following morning that would leave graciela and raymond alone somewhere for the night without food and light probably no heat scared bound or held captive in some way he increased his speed and quickly moved through an entire trailer park stopping only once to show the photos to an old woman sitting on the front porch of a decrepit trailer she shook her head no at the photos and he moved on finally after the sun was gone and the sky held the last of the days light he passed a crushedshell drive leading over a small rise and then out of sight a gate was pulled across it and posted with a no trespassing sign printed in spanish and english mccaleb studied the gate for a few moments and saw that it was tied closed with just a short length of wire through the hasp he got out pulled the wire free and pushed the gate open once over the first rise mccaleb could see that the drive led to a trailer home set on the next rise the ticking of anticipation began in his chest when he saw the small dish mounted on the flat roof as he got closer he could see there was no car parked under the aluminum carport he also noticed a small quonsetstyle storage shed at the back of the property near an old fence sitting on top of several of the fence posts were bottles and jars as if set out for shooting practice the sound of the cherokees tires turning on the crushed shells obliterated any possibility of a quiet approach it also robbed mccaleb of the chance to listen until he stopped the car he pulled into the carport and stopped he turned the key off and sat frozen still and listened there was only silence for two seconds and then he heard it the sound was muffled by the trailers aluminum siding but he heard it the ringing of a telephone inside the trailer mccaleb held his breath and listened to it ring over and over until he was sure he blew out his breath and felt a jolt go through his heart he knew he had found them he got out and approached the trailers door the phone kept ringing at least ten times now since he had stopped the car he knew it would keep ringing until he got inside and answered it or somebody ventured into the phone booth at the pemex station and hung up the receiver he tried the door and found it locked using the ring of keys he had taken from crimminss pants he tried several in the knob until he had the door open he stepped into the quiet and warm trailer and looked around what seemed to be a small living room the shades had been drawn and it was dark except for the glow of a computer screen that sat on a table against the wall to the right mccaleb reached to the wall to the left of the door and found a light switch he flicked it and the room was illuminated it was much like the warehouse he had discovered in la crowded with computers and other equipment there was a small sitting area apparently reserved for relaxation none of it meant anything to mccaleb he didnt care anymore he had come for only two reasons he stepped into the trailer and called out graciela raymond he heard nothing in reply he thought about what crimmins had said about them being in a black hole he turned and looked out the door his eyes scanning the desolate landscape he saw the quonset shed and started that way with the heel of his palm he banged on the padlocked door and the noise echoed loudly inside but there was no answer he fumbled as he got the keys out again and quickly jammed the small key with the master lock logo on it into the lock finally he swung the door open and stepped into the darkness the shed was empty and mccaleb felt a great tearing inside he turned and braced himself in the doorway his eyes downcast as his mind filled with a vision of graciela and raymond their arms around each other in complete darkness somewhere that was when he saw it on the crushedshell drive in front of him there was a clear depression pattern crossing the two patterns made by a vehicles tires there was a trail across the drive heading in the direction of the sloping hills crest it looked to mccaleb as if there was nothing out that way yet someone had walked there enough times to leave the trail across the drive his strides increased to a full run as he headed in the direction the trail led he came over the crest and in the dropoff below he saw the flat concrete foundation of a structure that had never been built he slowed to a walk as he approached wondering what he had found rusted iron rebars and plumbing pipes protruded from the concrete an old pick and a shovel had been left lying on it there was a step up onto the slab at the spot where a door obviously was to be placed but never was mccaleb stepped up and looked around there were no doors to a basement nothing he saw that matched what crimmins had said he kicked at one of the brass water pipes and looked down into the fourinch main pipe upon which a toilet was supposed to have been placed in that moment he knew where they were he spun around and his eyes covered the ground around the slab noting that the step would be the front of the structure he concentrated on the ground to the rear looking for the spot where the plumbing would lead a septic tank his eyes immediately picked up an area of dirt and rock that he could tell had recently been turned he grabbed the shovel and ran it took him five minutes to clear the dirt and rock off the top of the tank he knew they had air the pipes up to the slab would provide it but he worked as if they were suffocating below him as he finally opened the manholesized cover of the tank the skys dying light swept in and he saw their faces they were scared but alive mccaleb felt a great lifting of weight off him as he reached down to them he helped them out of the darkness their eyes crinkled against even the weak earlyevening light then he held them so tight he thought that he might hurt them graciela was crying her body shaking against his its all right he said its over now she pulled her head back and looked in his eyes its over now he repeated he wont hurt anybody ever again the bilge was a claustrophobic crawl space full of the dizzying fumes of gasoline mccaleb had an old tshirt wrapped around his face like a bandit but still the fumes filled his lungs there were nine bolts that held the fuel filter he was changing in place he had three in and tightened down he was struggling with the fourth angling his face forward in a vain effort to keep the sweat from running into his eyes when he heard her voice above him hello anybody home mccaleb dropped what he was doing and jerked the shirt from around his face he crawled to the open hatch and came up jaye winston was standing on the dock waiting for him jaye hey whats up come on aboard no im on the run i just wanted to stop by and let you know they found him im on my way down to mexico mccaleb raised his eyebrows hes not alive he killed himself really were dealing with the baja judicial police so nothing is for sure until i get down there but they found him washed up on the beach in a place called playa grande down on the coast shot himself in the heart a boy who takes care of horses on the beach found him that was two days ago we just got the news mccaleb looked around he saw a man in a white shirt and tie loitering near the gate to the gangway her partner he assumed are they sure it was him they say so the description is close plus they tracked him back to a trailer off the beach they found computers photos all kinds of stuff looks like our guy plus he left a goodbye note on the computer screen what did he say well this is all secondhand but essentially he took responsibility for his actions and said he deserved to die for them it was short and sweet they find a weapon not yet but theyre sweeping the beach with metal detectors today if they find it it will probably be our hk p the bullet taken during the autopsy was a federal fmj well see if we can borrow it for comparison to our cases up here mccaleb nodded so how are they playing it out pretty simple the guy knows were on to him gets an attack of remorse writes his note and goes down to the beach where he puts one in his heart the tide took him into the rocks there and the body got hung up thats why it wasnt carried out to sea were going down to have a look at things and to get prints probably wont get gunshot residue because the body was in the water but one things for sure were not going to close it unless were absolutely sure it was crimmins yeah thats a good idea i just want to make sure because it just didnt seem like it was heading toward a suicide know what i mean she was looking at him intently well you never know she nodded and for the first time she looked away from him she checked on her partner who was watching them from a distance that put him well out of earshot how was vegas terry he sat down on the gunwale and put the wrench he had been working with down next to him uh well i didnt really go anywhere i decided that if i didnt get this thing running it might never happen i turned off the phone and just worked on the boat i think its finally ready to go good i hope you catch a lot of fish i will you come over some day ill take you out to catch a marlin i might take you up on that she nodded and took another look around the marina well i guess i better go its a long drive down there and were getting a late start happy hunting thanks she made a move to go but then hesitated and looked back at him i saw your cherokee up there in the lot you ought to get it washed terry theres an awful lot of dust on it their eyes held each others for a long moment then the silent transmission clear ill do that mccaleb finally said thanks the following sea was cutting south at trolling speed across the low swells toward catalina up on the bridge mccaleb stood braced against the wheel he had the forward wind curtain down and the chill air coming up off the surface hit him fully hardening his skin beneath his clothes ahead in the mist the island rose like a huge rock cathedral on the horizon the outbuildings and some of the taller boats of avalon were coming into view he saw the circular terracotta roof of the casino the towns signature structure clearly now he turned to look astern the mainland was out of sight discernible only by the haze of smog that hung over it like a sign warning do not come here he was happy to be free of it he thought about crimmins for a moment he had no regrets about the way he had left things in mexico there would be no questions about his motives and choices now but he was protecting more than himself graciela and raymond had spent thirtysix hours with crimmins though he had not physically harmed them they still needed private time to heal to put the ordeal behind them mccaleb couldnt see how bringing more cops and questions into their lives could help with that graciela had agreed from the bridge he looked down into the cockpit and secretly watched the two of them raymond was in the fighting chair his small hands grasping the trolling set graciela stood next to him holding the chair for support if mccaleb could he would have willed a big black marlin onto the line for the boy but he wasnt worried there would be plenty of time to catch fish graciela seemed to sense his gaze and she looked up at him they shared a smile of intimacy mccaleb could feel his heart seize when she smiled at him that way it made him so happy that it hurt the boat trip was a test not only for the boat but for the two of them that was what she had called it a test to see if they could overcome the thing between them the painful knowledge of what had happened and what he had done of why he was here and others were not especially gloria they would see if they could put that behind them too or at least to the side to be taken out and looked at only when needed it was all mccaleb could hope for it was all he wanted just the chance the fact that it was now in his grasp made his faith in her feel requited fulfilled for the first time in a long time he was feeling as though there was purpose he looked forward again and checked the boats course he could see the bell house up on the hill and next to it the roof of the home where the writer and sportsman zane grey had lived it was a beautiful town and he couldnt wait to be back and to show it to them he stole another glance down into the stern gracielas hair was tied back against the wind and he studied the lovely lines of the nape of her neck he had been feeling something almost like faith lately and was confused by where it would lead him now confused but not concerned he knew it was of no real matter his faith was in graciela rivers he had no doubt as he gazed down at her that he was looking at the rock upon which he would make his stand blood work is a work of
