brian freemantle red star rising you cannot have people assassinated on british soil and then discover that we wish to arrest someone who is in another country and not be in a position to do so british prime minister gordon brown commenting on july upon the refusal of then russian federation president vladimir putin to extradite former kgb agent andrei lugovoy for trial for the murder in london by radioactive polonium poisoning of former kgb colleague alexander litvinenko november they britain are making proposals to change our constitution that are insulting for our nation and our people its their brains not our constitution which needs to be changed they forget that britain is no longer a colonial power and that russia was never their colony then russian federation president vladimir putins rejection of the british extradition request for andrei lugovoy july the cynical murder of my son was a calculated act of intimidation i have no doubt that he was killed by the fsb successor to the kgb and that the orders came from the former kgb spy president vladimir putin he was the only person who could have given that order i havent a shadow of doubt that this was done by putins men walter litvinenko december i will not rest until justice has been done marina litvinenko widow of alexander litvinenko may charlie muffin decided it was a tossup between the british embassys third secretary or the russian foreign ministry official whod be the first to throw up or simply faint or messily do both not necessarily in any order charlie didnt feel that good himself it had been a busy largely sleepless fortyeight hours since his emergency london assigning and hed never liked mortuaries anyway the unease wasnt helped by a mortuary assistant four autopsy tables away munching a meatoverflowing sandwich the grayness of the sandwich filling matched the color of the surrounding corpses including that of the man around whom they were grouped from the size of the entry wound in the base of the skull charlie calculated the bullet was from a russianmanufactured mm makarov its tip cut into a dumdum cross to flatten on initial impact in order to take away on exit the entire face including both jawbones the fingertips on the right hand had individually been burned away either by acid or heat the pathologist a fat doughfaced man who hadnt been introduced by name declared the amputation of the left arm to have been a surgical operation carried out several years earlier but not particularly well he added professionally critical a hurried job its obviously a gangland execution announced the only russian whose name charlie knew so far sergei romanovich pavel had been identified as a senior investigator from moscows organized crime bureau charlie looked around the group waiting for the question when no one asked he said whys it obvious its a trademark killing the way they always do it bullet in the back of the head after the torture punishment for whatever he did wrong lectured pavel you are londonbased embassy security said charlie wondering which of the men facing him across the metal slab was from the federalnaya sluzhba bezopasnosti or fsb which replaced the internal directorate of the former kgb the presence of the internal intelligence agency was inevitable after the finding of a murdered man in the garden of the british embassy charlie guessed it to be the thin balding man holding back from any part in the stilted discussion the bespectacled sparsehaired pavel smiled patronizingly there is regrettably a lot of organized crime in the city weve come to recognize their methodology he was very obviously tortured endorsed the pudgy pathologist pointing toward the murdered mans clothes bundled into a seethrough plastic sack the jacket and shirt are clotted with blood the bullet would have smashed most of the teeth making an identification difficult from dental records but id guess most of the teeth were pulled out while he was still alive to cause that degree of blood loss probably a lot more was done to him as well they usually take the eyes out he went back to the body see the ligature bruising on the wrist as well as his ankles and across the chest thats where he would have thrashed in agony against whatever they restrained him with it was the russian foreign ministry man whose stomach erupted the man managed to reach a deepbasined sink before being violently and repeatedly sick groaning as he retched jeremy dawkins the embassy diplomat looked determinedly away his lips tightly clamped charlie said didnt you tell us at the beginning that all the labels and makers marks have been removed from the clothes thats why theyre bagged up theyre clearly russian and i thought theyd be needed for forensic examination turning back to pavel charlie said is that another gangland trademark removing all manufacturers details from the clothing as well as taking away the face and burning off the finger ends to prevent any identification they dont usually do that conceded the russian detective going back to the medical examiner charlie said how do you think the fingertips were destroyed forced over a flame or a hot plate suggested the man acid possibly are any of the fingers broken persisted charlie the pathologist frowned needing to go back to his notes no they werent so weve got a body bruised by his binding from the thrashing agony of what was being done to him but without the fingers being broken where he tried to keep his hand away from a flame or hot plate said charlie which would by the way have burned the torturers trying to hold the fingers over the heat yes allowed the doctor i dont think his fingers were held over anything hot argued charlie i think the tips were burned off by an acidlike agent thats why the wrist is so marked more deeply than anywhere else are you going to tell us the point of this crossexamination demanded pavel looks to me as if a very determined effort was made to conceal who the man was said charlie which we will do our utmost to discover promised the man whom charlie guessed to be from the fsb the body was found in the grounds of the british embassy reminded charlie technically the embassy and the grounds in which it is built is british not russian territory this is a murder committed on british soil i dont think we need to become distracted by diplomatic technicalities broke in dawkins but if we are being technical i am not entirely satisfied that the murder was committed on british soil challenged the pathologist from my preliminary examination at the murder scene id say the body was dumped in the grounds after the man was shot there wasnt sufficient blood or physical debris around him and if he were killed elsewhere it is a russian investigation surely until it actually becomes an investigation it should be a joint operation pressed charlie the ashenfaced ministry official came back into the group he said im sorry ive never been in a place like this before to charlie he said every cooperation will be extended its a very unpleasant business your countrys need to be involved is most regrettable not regretted by me thought charlie he smiled at the russian detective i look forward to our working together i presume youre based at ulitsa petrovka pavel frowned you know moscow that well charlie felt a spurt of annoyance at his smartassed mention of the location of the organized crime bureau headquarters it gave them a pointer they didnt need to have and which he hadnt intended to give them but if the thinfaced balding man was fsb then a background intelligence check was automatic with no alternative charlie said ive served a posting here before which explains your excellent russian said the man smilingly whom charlie suspected was fsb it didnt necessarily but charlie was anxious not to stray any further and why i was seconded here specifically to inquire into this murder he said he looked between pavel and the medical examiner id welcome a full copy of your pathology report including a skin residue analysis to establish if the fingers were burned by acid and any forensic findings from the examination of the clothes therell be toxicology and stomach contents analyses too wont there of course said pavel tightly the pathologist nodded but didnt speak i dont think you handled that very well back there complained dawkins in the car ride back to the embassy he was a very tall angularly featured man who found it difficult to keep his fair hair from flopping forward over his forehead the public school accent was sharp enough to cut glass hows that charlie sighed how was it he always seemed to get under peoples noses like a bad smell our government doesnt want the bodies of murdered russians strewn around its embassy grounds i didnt leave it there dont be fatuous protested the man whom charlie estimated to be at least twenty years his junior what i mean is that it would have been better to have gone along with what the man pavel suggested that its a russian murder of a russian national and better left to their people to handle distancing ourselves as quickly as possible no it wouldnt rejected charlie curtly ive been specifically seconded here to ensure the british government isnt sucked into an asyetunknown embarrassment or difficulty and im not going to succeed in doing that by sitting on my ass waiting for other people to tell me only what they want me to hear what sort of difficulty could there possibly be apart from his being found where he was demanded the younger man youre assuming hes russian because the clothes are russian what if he turns out to be british what dawkins turned across the car in his alarm swerving it out of the lane easy said charlie calmly im just floating a what if trying to suggest why weve got to be involved from the inside not kept outside you certainly worked hard to ensure that criticized the diplomat how the hell could i talk to people without knowing their names and where hopefully to get hold of them asked charlie impatiently hed ended the mortuary encounter by insisting upon the identity and contact number of every russian in the room even the foreign ministry official you dont ask you dont getone of the truisms of life i need to be kept fully informed of everything you do everyone with whom you get involved demanded dawkins i want to be told everything you have in mind well before you take any action those are the ambassadors orders im your channel to him at all times bollocks thought charlie i know the rules why didnt you tell me youd served here before ive scarcely had time to tell anyone anything it was a long time ago five years wasnt that long charlie mentally corrected himself sasha would be eight now upon reflection he didnt have too much to worry about whatever checks mikhail guzov the correctly guessed fsb officer made about him through their internal intelligence records he knew natalia had sanitized both their files it was even possible that his records wouldnt have been kept by the fsb hers would still exist because natalia had been retained after the kgb changeover and was still a serving officer although he didnt know in what division theyd never talked about their separate intelligence functions apart from their initial professional encounter how long were you here about four years said charlie intentionally vague a difficult time you know i cant give you any indication of my work but i can tell you we certainly didnt find any dead bodies in the grounds sorry i shouldnt have asked you dawkins retreated embarrassed at showing his inexperience the current contingent mi as well as mi want to meet you i think they were surprised you didnt come to the embassy before going to the mortuary my coming here specifically for this investigation was to distance them and the embassy reminded charlie which had been his accustomed and alltoofrequent role in a very varied espionage career sparing others with more delicate hands the distaste of getting them dirtied i dont think they appreciated that any more than i did said the diplomat and the housing officer also wants to see you im sure he does accepted charlie who had anticipated the confrontation dawkins had taken the long way round to reach the british embassy driving now parallel to the moskva river along smolenskaya naberezhnaya charlie gazed nostalgically out at the familiar once happy surroundings before the building of the new embassy he and natalia had pushed sasha along this bordering river embankment after hed managed the moscow posting to return to marry her theyd talkedperhaps fantasized was a better wordduring those walks about their future together need it to have been such a fantasy not really not even in those newly thawed days at the supposed end of the cold war all it would have needed was natalias acceptance that shed have to leave moscow and her beloved russia a compromise shed never been able to make nor could he make the matching compromise himself hed believed his inevitable discovery as a british intelligence officereven a former intelligence officer if hed resigned which he had been prepared to dowould have made his remaining there impossible certainly natalia would not have been allowed to continue in the kgb or its succeeding fsb i dont think hes happy the loudervoiced repetition broke into charlies reverie they were talking about the housing officer he remembered ill talk to him he promised welcoming the appearance of the fourtowered embassy although not the inevitable irritating confrontations bollocks to those too youve got all my numbers including my home and mobile said dawkins as they entered the building with its modernart etchings dominating the reception area dont forget what i told you about wanting to know everything you do before you do it indelibly engraved in my mind assured charlie emptily the receptiondesk security officer closely examined charlies id up to and including camera confirmation of his facial and eye characteristics and insisted upon accompanying charlie to the embassy intelligence section offices despite charlies assurance that he knew the way everythings been tightened up explained the guard bit late now isnt it remarked charlie ive just got back from home leave the man said quickly evading the question i cant believe he climbed over the walls or the railings without setting off the sensors it always paid to pass the time of day with the lowest of the gossiping staff reflected charlie neither can i with or without sensors he only had one arm ah exclaimed the man with the intensity with which charlie imagined st paul greeted the revelation on the road to damascus it has to be the gates then doesnt it makes sense now how does it make sense now encouraged charlie the closed circuit television cameras have been playing up what about gate guards again with the military spontaneity of someone trained always to avoid any responsibility the man said im internal not external dont know anything about that or them and he already knew more than enough charlie accepted as they reached the door to the intelligence rezidentura for him to be passed on to another uniformed guard charlie went again through the id ritual including facial measurement and retina recognition before finally entering the inner sanctum ive been waiting impatiently complained the woman on the other side of the door paulajane venables was a slightbodied though fullbusted woman who wore her auburn hair short and who knew she looked good in designer clothes the dress was blue kneelength and had the logoidentifying matching shoes charlie guessed there would be an ensemblecompleting handbag somewhere in the riverfronting office into which she led him but if there were it was hidden away to maintain the dustfree neatness of the uncluttered office charlie took what he recognized to be the victims chair and sat back for the obviously intended inquisition he crossed one leg over the other to make it easer to lift the pressure on his left heel the hush puppies were new not yet broken in and they pinched she frowned at his doing it it was too early to tell but she looked capable of pulling out fingernails which prompted an immediate question had those on the right hand of the man back in the mortuary been intact hed forgotten to ask and certainly to look and he felt a surge of annoyance at the oversight that might have gone further to confirm the extent of any torture to which the man had been subjected we need to get to know each other paulajane announced i want to get things straight between us from the start thats always best agreed charlie noting the peremptory tone there was an imperceptible tightening to her mouth at his closetomocking response there was clearly a change in your travel plans charlie frowned youve lost me already londons alert was that you were arriving yesterday im guessing that instead you flew in this morning and went straight to the mortuary without having time to make contact with me here no i got here yesterday but didnt bother to call or make personal contact before seeing the body didnt london tell you in their message why i have been sent in asked charlie patiently to minimize as much as possible any direct connection with the embassy acknowledged the woman im the mi resident here its my territory you can front it all but i want to know everything that goes on understood charlie sighed instead of bothering to answer he said why dont you tell me what you know like where and how the body was found by whom and how you think it got there paulajane hesitated clearly undecided whether to dismiss his questions or to demand an answer to her own eventually she said it was found by one of the grounds staff a russian charlie interrupted at once knowing the diplomatic agreementand counterespionage nightmarerequiring local nationals to be employed as domestic support staff yes answered paulajane shortly name personnel will have it so you havent questioned him i was making arrangements to do so when london told me you were being assigned making arrangements the protocol is that in any criminal investigation involving a russian national employed at the embassy a russian foreign ministry official has to be present did you go to the scene yes while the groundsman who found the body was still there yes her face was beginning to redden with anger and you didnt ask him anything i told you about the unbreachable protocol finished charlie angry himself and intentionally mocking i was told to obey the rules what was the benefit of pissing into the wind charlie asked himself resigned you saw the scene yes was he on his back or his front his front the answer was vital to keeping him on the investigation and she wasnt sure charlie guessed if the russians found a half unarguable reason or excuse to shoulder him asideor if he fucked upthe personal repercussions in london would be far more serious than here in moscow charlie knew he was on the weaker side of the power struggle being waged between aubrey smith the ascetic quietvoiced man who had championed him since his unexpected appointment from cambridge university don to directorgeneral and his passedover and resentful deputy jeffrey smale who hated his guts like so many in a department in which for far too longapart from rare respites like that which hed initially enjoyed under smithcharlie had clung by his fingertips which would be destroyed like those of this murder victim if he screwed this assignment up i dont think were getting off to a particularly good start and i know you think the same charlie said so lets as you suggested at the beginning understand each other im going to work this job entirely alone keeping you well away from any involvement and any possible risk to the career youve just begun but here with just the two of us in the room i want everything you can give me which is why this question is very important are you absolutely sure that the murdered man was lying face down on his front i know he didnt have a face not much of a head left at all but fronts very different from back so which was it he was definitely lying on his front said paulajane formally whereabouts precisely in the grounds quite close to the conference hall theres a grassed verge with flower beds beyond the body was mostly on the grass with what was left of the head and his shoulders protruding over onto the flower bed how closely did you look it was disgusting charlie sighed again so you cant tell me how much blood loss or facial debris there was whys it so important to know that she demanded truculently if there was a lot of blood and skin and bone debris it would indicate he was shot where he was found if there wasnt it indicates he was shot elsewhere and dumped if he was dumped the russians have a reason to keep me at arms length or to exclude me altogether my recollection is that there was a lot of blood around the belligerence was receding did you stay for the forensic and medical examinations at the scene most of it charlie avoided another sigh of frustration tell me about it in as much detail as possible paulajane hesitated assembling her recollections external security was there first obviously when i got there summoned as an afterthought i think i was told the moscow authorities had already been called and were on their way which authorities broke in charlie i wasnt told youll have to ask reg stout hes in charge of both internal and external security there were a lot of people around how close to the body stouts people were very close like right next to it stout told the rest of us to stay back when the russians arrived they told stout and his men to move back a man i assumed to be the forensic pathologist spent about twenty minutes examining the body before it was put into a body bag and then into an ambulance the policei assumed they were police although not all of them wore uniformslooked around spoke to dawkins and then left why dawkins asked charlie and why hadnt the bloody man told him about being at the scene on their way back from the mortuary hes responsible for embassy administration what about the ambassador wasnt he in any way involved he came out when the russians first arrived and spoke to dawkins he left as the body was being removed did he talk to any of the russians not that i saw and im sure i was there all the time that the ambassador was did the russians take soil samples from where the head and shoulders lay there was another hesitation im not sure i think so shit thought charlie concerned about the amount of blood residue what about photographs they certainly took photographs a lot it seemed to me i she started but stopped as the phone rang she answered it hes here with me she said offering the receiver to charlie its howard barrett the housing and facilities officer ive been waiting since you came back from the mortuary to arrange your accommodation it was another glasscutting accent im staying at the savoy i am responsible for the housing of embassy personnel which makes me also responsible for the applicable budget the savoy is not on the permitted list of outside accommodation if you insist on living outside we must consult that list and rehouse you howard you will not be required to pay whatever bills i incur at the savoy so your budget is not endangered were not going to consult any list or have any sort of discussion about anything i have not received any authorization from london which is necessary under the regulations just as there was a regulation forbidding the questioning of the man who found the body of a murder victim thought charlie you want londons approval you go ahead and ask for it you go out of your way to upset people asked paulajane when charlie put down the receiver always seems to happen no matter how hard i try to avoid it hed been out of the field for too long and had forgotten the bureaucratic madrigal of embassy existence charlie recognized it wasnt going to help him charlie muffin had taken his time as he always did checking the intruder trap in his hotel roomensuring that the drawers hed left slightly protruding hadnt been pushed closed after a search and that their specially arranged contents were as hed left them and that flaps pushed into pockets hadnt been correctly replaced outsidesatisfied after almost an hour that no one had entered now he sat hunched at the corner stool of the bar his back instinctively protected by its abutting wall wishing that the vodka glass into which he was gazing was a crystal ball to tell him the last time an assignment had begun as badly as this one he certainly couldnt remember which made it a wise move to have concluded the encounter with paulajane with so many initial questions unanswered and leave the embassy needing to clear his head and to calculate just how many mistakes had already been made or had been allowed to be made he really had forgotten the headinthesand mentality of embassy life had too much already been avoided or ignored for him to pick up all the dropped pieces charlie wondered he couldnt allow there to be came the immediate determination the poor faceless onearmed bastard hadnt survived but charlie had to as hed always survived but this time could be difficult hed never known the department so positively divided as it had been by aubrey smiths promotion over jeffrey smale nor for that division to be so marked by smiths consistent operational failures against the litany of successes controlled by his deputy what charlie did know was that on this assignment he was very definitely between two warring men with aubrey smith seeing it as his positive last chance and jeffrey smale regarding it as the potential coup de grace in the fight to the promotional death which was why with bizarre irony both men had for the first time ever been in perfect accord that he got the moscow assignment which even more bizarrely charlie welcomed despite its closetooverwhelming risks now that he didnt have natalia or sasha any longer the job was all he had left and to keep it hed do anything just short of dipping someone elses fingers into any available acid bath how did that crushanyoneinanyway determination square with the placid acceptance that he didnt have natalia and sasha anymore charlie asked himself they werent together anymore as a family anymore because he hadnt sufficiently persuaded natalia and hadnt been in moscow to be able to but now he was in moscow could he contemplate that distraction from a job so professionally vital and try to convince natalia that they could still have a life together of course he could it would be ridiculous his being in the same city as her and their daughter for him not to make contact and for him to try yet again to convince her how perfect everything could be if only shed come to live in london the simple way to do it was to prioritize charlie reasoned the job first then which meant going back to the mortuary and pathologist vladimir ivanov to resolve the uncertainties that had occurred to him since this morning and to the embassy to finish the conversation with paulajane venables and get from jeremy dawkins his comparable account of the murder scene reg stouts too to find out the problem with the embassy gates cctv as well as the identity ofand hopefully to interviewthe sofar unnamed russian groundsman whod discovered the body which charlie supposed would now have to be in the restrictive presence of the diplomatically required russian foreign ministry official and then there was sergei romanovich pavel it wasnt going to be easy to establish a working relationship with the organized crime detective whod worn the resentment of charlies involvement like a lapel badge he had to do his best to build bridges there because pavel represented either the pathway or the barrier between him and any official forensic findings which left mikhail guzov the watchful fsb observer about whom charlie had the greatest uncertainty a lot of people none of whom appeared either friendly or helpful hed left off his priorities list the most important participant of all so far charlie abruptly reminded himself a faceless onearmed man how difficult was it going to be to learn the story he wasnt able to tell id hoped id find you here said a voice in english david halliday was an overweight softbodied man whose grayflecked hair was greased so tightly to his head it appeared to have been painted on rather than combed the tie was vaguely regimental and didnt really go with the sort of singlebreasted blue suit massproduced for doortodoor salesmen the world over he even carried an ordertaking pen in his breast pocket charlie admired the determined anonymity and wondered what else the man might do to establish his professionalism you want a drink invited charlie to illustrate his own professionalism by knowing at once who the man was from the photographs of embassy personnel although it officially listed halliday as a financial officer not the mi resident better stay with what im already on accepted the man nodding unnecessarily behind the bar to the whiskey that charlie had already detected upon the mans breath it isnt really famous grouse but its not a bad fake the head movement turned to one of approval at charlies bar command that got his vodka replenished at the same time as the counterfeit scotch was poured halliday said thought you were a whiskey man too only when its real the mental arm wrestling was beginning islay single malt isnt it youve done your homework its still logged as a special order in the embassys commissary book from the time of your permanent posting here that really was professional charlie acknowledged knowing the man would have trawled london records too i dropped by today but you werent there what do you think of our pj what asked charlie frowning paulajane thats how shes known at the embassy she told me youd tried to make contact feisty little thing isnt she why does she insist on that doublebarreled name said charlie avoiding a personality discussion this early but content for the other man to gossip about whatever or whoever he wanted eager for all the inside help he could get about the embassy father was american met her mother when he worked in the same trade at the us embassy in london an offering of sorts accepted charlie fbi or cia cia whats paulajane doing working for us if shes american she isnt corrected halliday had the choice between american or british nationality when she reached eighteen took her mothers side in the divorce to be british but compensated by taking dads profession ambitious as hell wants to follow the already established precedents and put that cute little ass in the directorgenerals chair at thames house the opening lit up like a beacon didnt get the impression she did so well with my onearmed man halliday gestured hopefully to the bartender grateful at the response that kept him level with charlie difficult one for her if you want to climb the slippery pole you go by the book and dont get involved in anything attracting the publicity that this episode is getting what book do you go by asked charlie selfpreservation replied the other man at once ive got ten years to go and certainly dont intend fucking up an unblemished pensionassured record by getting caught up in the sort of shit youve got to wade through youre welcome old boy with my deepest sympathy did you see the body for as long as it took me to decide i didnt want to know what was happening i suddenly remembered an important meeting with a contact that took precedence seizing the opportunity charlie encapsulated paulajanes recollections which halliday considered before saying thats about it marking halliday as a useful insider to cultivate while not forgetting the man was in turn doing his best to cultivate him charlie said whats the problem with the gate security reg stouts the problem all mouth and trousers and dawkins lets himself be bullied the cctv has been playing up for days weeks even and hasnt been fixed properly his priorities for the following day began to arrange themselves in charlies mind i wont involve you of course but id appreciate a sounding board to bounce things off as they come up i know a few quiet bars accepted halliday its quite a while since i was here further enticed charlie id also appreciate a steer if you think i might be going in the wrong direction guaranteed assured the other man and thats official you heard of our director gerald monsford not a lot wants to rule the world which is fine if youre one of his soldiers hes told me to offer you all the help you might need if your dead man hadnt been found inside the embassy grounds british territory it would be an mi case ill remember that promised charlie politely at the moment itll stay mi unexpectedly halliday said aha heres your first steer and gestured toward the mute television picture in the corner behind the bar the sequence which charlie guessed to be the lead item on the main evening news showed a smiling immaculately dressed man of about fortyfive a stunningly attractive coutureclad woman was at his side both arms aloft in acceptance of an obviously rapturous reception from a rally audience stepan grigorevich lvov with his totem wife marina identified halliday the next president of russia the only subject of conversation at the embassy before your body was found and one theyre anxious to get back to as soon as possible already getting newspaper space back in england recognized charlie with a woman like that beside him im surprised there havent been pictures as well therell be a lot when he gets elected predicted halliday interesting similarities between him and vladimir putin but without the baggage putins accumulated former kgb like putin until he quit once attached to the same divisional headquarters as putin in st petersburg caused you some work i guess anticipated charlie happy for the conversation to drift after gaining as much as he had havent managed much of a file for all the obvious reasons admitted halliday but theres a contrast between the two putins taking russia back into the dark ages with kgbstyle assassinations and using the gas and oil supply as a weapon against europe lvovs promising to free everything up again which makes him flavorofthemonth in the eu as well as in the us of a there was also a lot of speculation that putin got the presidency with dirty money and heavy criminal as well as exkgb personnel support hows that match with lvov halliday shook his head the word is that our new boy is squeaky clean he smiled or as squeaky clean as a politician can be reg stouts office overlooked the river and was about three times the size of the temporary accommodation allocated to charlie stout wasnt wearing the ribbonbedecked uniform that charlie had half expected but the tie was that of the royal engineers the office was virtually wallpapered with military photographs of parades and regimental dinners and reunionsall of which prominently featured stout usually in the front befitting his rank of major he was a loudvoiced floridfaced burly man who frowned in dismay at charlies haystack dishevelment it was obviously difficult for the man whose pinstriped suit was razor creased to address charlie as sir but he did im looking to you for a lot of help opened charlie which so far he very definitely wasnt getting and about which he was thoroughly pissed off the rabbit hutch that had been allocated to him that morning was obviously the housing officers idea of revenge compounded by the waiting message from jeremy dawkins on the cardtable desk to make contact before attempting any meetings with embassy staff sir barked the man id like firstly the full report youll have obviously prepared its with mr dawkins sir you dont have a copy charlie sighed its my understanding it has to come through mr dawkins sir reg set out charlie ive been sent specially all the way from london to investigate a murder that is probably the biggest security situation youre ever going to become involved in i know embassies are governed by rules and that youve got to conform to them but i just told you i need your help and im sure you dont want my having to complain to the third secretary or to london that im being obstructed in what ive come here to sort out so heres what well do ill tell you what i want and you decide whether were going to communicate like adults or whether youve got to communicate all the time through dawkins i want your report i want to see the photographs im confident you took before the russians arrived i want to know why you summoned the russians as quickly as you did i want you to tell me why you let your people trample all over the scene probably destroying forensic evidence and why you let whoever did it fill in the hole that was left after the russians apparently dug out all the earth into which the blood and facial debris soaked from where the body lay i want to talk to you in the minutest possible detail irrespective of whatevers in your report about everything that you did before the arrival of the russian investigators i want to know the name of the russian groundsman who found the body and in the most specific detail hear everythingand i really mean everythingthat he told you before i talk to him myself i want to know what went so consistently wrong with the cctv security camerasand why it continued going wrongup to and including the night the body got where it was found and why and how a man with his intended killers got into embassy grounds that you and your staff are supposed to keep clear of any unauthorized intrusion and when ive got all that ill probably want to do it all over again because the first time i wont get half even a quarter of what i want and in passing its not necessary for you to call me sir charlies fine you keeping up with me so far reg there was no immediate reply and charlie thought he could almost see reflected in the transfixed eyes the slowmoving cogs in the mans brain finally stout managed i thought mr dawkins was handling it all he isnt corrected charlie i am i think i should talk to mr dawkins well both talk to mr dawkins insisted the exasperated charlie and it was still only just after ten thirty charlie didnt believe that rainbows always followed rain or that every cloud that brought the downpour had a silver lining so his satisfaction at londons insistence on unfettered unimpeded assistance within the embassy was muted appealing both to aubrey smith and the foreign office had been the very last resort hed had no alternative but to take against dawkinss obdurate determination to be the handson controller of every move charlie made sure that the housing officer would have already complained as well his demand for a liaison ruling racked up two petty but officially recorded disputes in the space of twentyfour hours and charlie feared smiths irritable reactionwhat about the real problem youre there to sort outwas a reaction to the internal pressure in london and not a belief that he needed a bigger boys hand to hold which was the very last impression charlie either needed or wanted there was something else he didnt need or want either the footaching twinge charlie never ignored as a warning that even at this early stage there was something hed missed or hadnt realized which for once he hoped was not its usual talisman but merely the tightness of new hush puppies having wasted the entire morning are we finally ready to begin charlie asked the head of security sir replied stout the paradeground loudness less belligerent than before from a desk drawer the man extracted a file and said my report sir as he accepted the dossier charlie said for christs sake cut out the sir crap will you what time were you told about the body eight thirtythree exactly as i say in my report he just stopped himself i want to hear your account as well as read it who told you the man in charge of the gardening detail he called me here in the office a russian yes he told me one of his workers had found a body that it didnt have a face whats the name of the man who actually found it maksimov boris maksimov charlie nodded to the telephone on stouts desk can you arrange for me to speak to maksimov as well as the russian in charge im afraid you cant not speak to either of them i mean whats the problem now demanded charlie the exasperation returning neither is here at the embassy one of the russians who came when i raised the alarm told me to put both of them on extended leave to help the organized crime bureau colonel pavel told you to do that i dont know his name charlie had to swallow hard before he could continue youve got their home addresses the russian staffs are supplied by the foreign ministry to which they were supplied by the fsb as they had been before the renaming of the kgb and before that by the mvdmgb and before that by the nkgbnkvd charlie knew nothing had changed except the titles and everyone in the west imagining that espionage had been swept away in the flood of the cold war thaw worried instead about islamic terrorism you spoke to maksimov briefly he spoke hardly any english i speak hardly any russian charlie knewevery intelligence professional knewthat local russian support staff spoke more than adequate english which was why they were there to listen and read everything they could dont leave out a single word tell me everything you saw and talked about and heard it really was very brief hed started work at eight that morning he told me his job was to weed the flower beds around the conference hall he said he saw the body the moment he finished the first bed and came around the corner to continue on the next section he thought it was someone asleep or drunk until he got close enough to see what it really was that it was a dead man he ran to get his supervisor he said he hadnt done it he said what i didnt do it he was like that when i found him that was the last thing maksimov said to me who was there ahead of you at the scene demin the russian team leader and maksimov none of your security people no had the two russians touched anything they told me they hadnt that they were too scared from the hesitation before the reply charlie guessed stout hadnt asked either russian about touching the body tell me in every detail what you found the hesitation now was for recall and the account was punctuated by pauses when the man finally began to speak charlie who was well aware of the psychological peculiarity that few witnesses to dramatic events had the same recollection was caught by the similarity in stouts account to that of paulajane venables did you touch the body picked up charlie no insisted the man at once i didnt go through any of his pockets that wasnt the question persisted charlie did you touch it if the clothes were wet it would give us an indication of how long it had been there before or after dew might have fallen i didnt touch it repeated the man his jacket looked as if it might be damp how much blood was there a lot from what i could see soaked into the ground yes charlie thought that stout was telling him what the man imagined he wanted to hear after the body was removed the russiansa forensic examinerdug up the soil where what remained of the head had been didnt he yes how big wide as well as deep was the hole i dont know stout frowned whys that important the size might have given an indication of how much blood there was which in turn might have told us whether he was shot there or somewhere else how deep it was might have suggested whether the bullet was found there was no sign of a bullet being found it was a deep hole maybe two foot round again what the man thought he wanted to hear decided charlie the forensic people took photographs i think so said stout immediately correcting himself yes yes of course they did didnt you take photographs by then mr dawkins had arrived he told me it was a russian investigation and that we should leave everything to them now it was charlie who hesitated unsure if there was anything to be gained from questioning any further he wouldnt know unless he tried he reminded himself tell me about nighttime security the gatehouse is staffed two men what about ground patrols stout shifted uncomfortably no there used to be charlie remembered there hasnt been not for a long time londons decision or local i was told by mr dawkins as if in sudden recollection stout added there are ground sensors now and cctv which according to what ive heard dont work stouts face clouded at charlies awareness there have been some technical problems recently like what some of the cameras have blanked out could it possibly be wondered charlie it should have been inconceivable these cameras that blanked out would they have covered the area where the body was found there was a pause before stouts reply not all of them reg stop fucking about and answer the question the man swallowed a sheen of perspiration pricking out on his face two of them do the two covering where the body was found and the area between there and the gatehouse easily predicted charlie the man nodded but didnt speak were they out the night the body got to where it was found yes but it was happening for several days before the body was found of course it was thought charlie although with the mentality here it hadnt really been necessary to make it appear accidental why werent they fixed they were electricians were called in and the cameras were okay for a day then they crashed again technical electricians from london theyre due in the next day or two said the man charlies pause this time was one of total incredulous disbelief spacing his words when he did speak he said who was brought in to do the repairs that failed it wasnt considered a difficult job technically answer the question insisted charlie his voice still hollowed in despair a russian contractor recommended by the foreign ministry finally admitted the security manager were there two men on duty in the gatehouse the night the body got into the grounds yes british the answer should have been obvious but charlie had given up on anything being as it should have been yes hoskins and jameson charlie nodded toward the desk telephone again i want to see themhe looked at his watchin half an hours time you got a spare room there wasnt space for more than one other person in his contemptuously allocated office no here then while stout telephoned around the embassy to locate the two men who were that week on day duty charlie sat head bowed anger burning through him this was an outandout alltime fucking nightmare of incompetence and ineptitude on an unimaginable scale demanding an internal investigation quite separate from that to which he had been assigned but not yet came the immediate halt for several reasons the least of which was escalating any handholding impressions in london feeling again the warning twinge in his left foot charlie reminded himself that nothing that had already occurred could be undone or rectified better to leave everything as it was but use it to his benefit theyll be here at a quarter to promised stout replacing the telephone what was the duty period of these two men hoskins and jameson resumed charlie twentytwo hundred to six hundred no break one spells the other for half an hour working it out between them not a lot to do except be there at that time of night what was in their log for that night i dont remember you dont remember the log of the night a murdered man was found in the embassy grounds the security of which youre responsible its because of that i dont remember anything else what about noise noise a gunshot sufficient to blow off a mans face would have made quite a noise wouldnt you think i wasnt told about any unusual noise insisted the man he finally took out a handkerchief to wipe his sweatshined face you still have the log we should have should have theres a loosepaged filing system itll be there while im talking to your two nightduty men id like you to find that particular log reference and all the others in which the faulty cctvs are recorded and individually identified they are individually identified arent they yes uncertainty echoed in the mans voice and charlie decided that when he did blow the whistle hed recommend the sweating reg stout undergo interrogation to determine whether the man might have been suborned and actually be a security risk the contradiction against his being so was that stout was blatantly too stupid the caveat to that dismissal came just as quickly unless that is stout was the eminently qualified buffoon to conceal the person reducing the embassy to a security farce that led inevitably to the question overhanging all others what the fuck was going on both william hoskins and paul jameson wore campaign ribbons both had the backbones of career soldiers and charlie abandoned any resistance to the word sir as verbal punctuation they told him that because of their blank cctv screens theyd taken turns to make short patrol walks although not as far as where the body was found for just two men to maintain any sort of proper security was virtually impossible without closed circuit television particularly when the majority of the embassys outside illumination went off at midnight there were no automatically triggered movement or bodyheat activated burglar lights ground sensors sounded an audible alarm by tread or passing movement with no visual screen display there had been nothing on the night of the body discovery that sounded like a pistol or automatic weapon report which we would certainly have recognized offered hoskins the plumper of the two exsoldiers even below the rest of the noise that there was that night added the mustached jameson below what noise that night quoted back charlie hoskins shrugged dismissively there was a lot of noise around midnight an altercation among a birthday party group something like that farther along the embankment charlie let the despairing frustration pass how much farther along the embankment there was another dismissive shrug a hundred hundred and fifty yards quite close to the pontoon a bunch of guys trying to throw someone in the river how do you know it was something like a birthday party and that someone was being threatened with being thrown into the river asked charlie sure he already knew the answer the two men looked at each other we went along to check it out make sure it wasnt going to be a problem that might involve the embassy said jameson thats our job making sure the embassy doesnt get caught up in any trouble yes charlie sighed as stout reentered the room thats what your job is i dont understand it complained stout intruding into the meeting let me guess offered charlie wearily the log for the night of the murder isnt in the file where it should be stout nodded in agreement there are some other days that are missing too nights and days when the cctv didnt work suggested charlie how did you know its a knack i have said charlie his meeting with the two nighttime guards over charlie insisted on being taken to the electrical control box governing the embassys cctv cameras his stomach lurching at the immediate discovery of at least twenty other control terminals forming part of the same bank the russian electricians had access to this box of course they had to have for how long an hour maybe a little longer who was here monitoring them i was replied stout his voice lifting at being able at last to respond positively here all the time stout gave another of his now familiar hesitations apart from the times i went with the other russian to check the cctv screens to confirm that they were operating normally again leaving the other man working on the terminals here all by himself i couldnt split myself in half to be in two places at the same time could i no i dont suppose you could agreed charlie charlies escape from his scourging frustration at the embassy security debacle was to immerse himself and his every thought on natalia and sasha and the more he did the more his confidence grew that his return to moscow presented him with an opportunity to salvage a relationship hed never imagined possible to save and that there was no reason why he shouldnt make every attempt and effort to do just that their relationship hadnt collapsed at its worse assessment it had been interrupted they certainly werent enemies if anything on his part at least his feelings for natalia had grown from their being apart they corresponded regularly sometimes more than once a month natalia kept up a steady supply of photographs of their daughter and when hed eventually although reluctantly accepted that natalia wouldnt join him in london hed put all the necessary bank arrangements in place to provide monthly maintenance never missing a payment although occasionally leaving himself strapped for money at the beginning of their odd separation there had been telephone calls but they had gradually lessened the last had to be four months earlier and on that occasion charlie had imaginedand hoped it had only been imaginationthat there was a coolness from natalia never in any of the letters or any of the telephone conversations had there been any mention of divorce he had to plan the approach very carefully though warn her he was here in moscow and leave any actual meeting to be on her terms and at her convenience a phone call would be too abrupt and unexpected even though natalia would understand the short notice with which hed been dispatched despite their never discussing their respective intelligence work a brief letter then dismissing the reason for his being here as business giving the hotel as his contact address hed leave it to natalia to decide if sasha should be included in the initial meeting paramount in both their thinking had always been to minimize as much as possible any disruptive effect upon sasha by their living apart charlie hoped the stories he had heard about some russian stores and shops bringing themselves up to european quality and choice were true although he didnt have the remotest idea what a child of eight would appreciate as a fitting present from a suddenly appearing father he should buy a gift for natalia as well something else that wouldnt be easy natalia always protested he was too extravagant in his presentbuying for both of them his decision made charlie missed breakfast to write his note on hotel letterhead paper scrapping two attempts before he was satisfied in no hurry to get to smolenskaya naberezhaya unsure whether to go to the embassy at all until after contact was established with sergei pavel and pathologist vladimir ivanov the decision was made for him when there was no response from pavels petrovka phone halliday was at the embassy when charlie arrived paulajane wasnt nodding to her office charlie said she seems a very busy girl halliday grinned and a very popular one particularly with our american cousins ive got the most recent newspapers including the british the speculation about your murder ranges from the russian preference for the man being the victim of a gangland contract killing through to the elimination by pursuing russian police or intelligence agents of an intended traitor at his moment of defection finally to the man being an islamic suicide bomber shot by british security officers seconds before detonating his explosives three london newspapers appeared to have flown reporters specifically to moscow to cover the story thanks for keeping them ill read them later and the world media have finally discovered the abouttobe new first lady continued halliday the beautiful marina lvov is all over the newspapers ill stick with the murder coverage on the subject of which you going to fill me in now or wait for pj what charlie frowned the press conference halliday frowned back i didnt know there was going to be one until i bumped into dawkins first thing this morning and i still dont know anything about it said charlie youre not involved no said charlie and here comes pj said halliday looking farther down the corridor along which the woman was hurrying toward them raising her hand in greeting as she got close to hallidays open office door when i couldnt reach you by telephone i went to the savoy to find you messages never get through she announced breathlessly you all set i think im close to being set up qualified charlie who asked you to find me bring me here dawkins replied paulajane the embassys being overwhelmed by media approaches the ambassador has decided upon a press conference so youve got to be there its scheduled for eleven it was ten forty charlie saw theres obviously an internal email direct to the ambassador from the communications room paulajane gave an uncertain laugh whats happening here nonsense is whats happening here replied charlie if dawkins gets in touch with you again tell him the press conference is canceled and that i want to see him one hour from now it was the same communications officer in charge as the previous day so there was no identification delay charlie began his email to the ambassador insisting a press conference would further sensationalize an already oversensationalized media situation for it to have been held would unquestionably destroy any possibility of a successful investigation and for that reason he was advising the third secretary that it should be canceled he certainly had no intention of taking part there had already been procedural difficulties upon which london had adjudicated putting him in charge of the murder investigation and he took full responsibility for the cancellation it was inevitable that it would inflame the media which was unfortunate and would not have occurred if there had been proper consultation which there should have been from the third secretary knowing of the previous days london ruling charlie copied the message to dawkins stout and the two resident intelligence officers to coincide with his sending it to the ambassador and chose the commissary office to confirm his islay single malt order in which to lose himself for fifteen minutes beyond the time the press conference had been scheduled to begin paulajane was waiting for him when charlie returned to the rezidentura level she said all hells broken loose id have been disappointed if it hadnt said charlie the moment he entered the ambassadors suite charlie recognized sir thomas sotley as the quintessential career diplomat from the top of his graytinged head past the old etonian tie the savile row suit and the familycrested signet ring to the tip of his handtooled lobb shoes jeremy dawkins a younger clone apart from the tumblingforward blond hair and already furyflushed face was to the right of the ambassadors antique green leather inset desk behind them was almost an aerial view of the moskva river whats the meaning of this immediately demanded the ambassador waving the printout of charlies email like a penalty flag there was no invitation for charlie to sit id hoped it was selfexplanatory said charlie it is selfserving unforgivable impertinence for which i demand an explanation spluttered the outraged man there was no intended impertinence the third secretary is responsible for the general administration of this embassy and got the approval of the deputy directorgeneral for the conference to discount some of the most preposterous media fantasies by refusing to appear causing the conference to be canceled youve assured those fantasies will be exacerbated doubly trapped before hed virtually started charlie recognized he was making an immediate enemy of the ambassador you were aware of my being seconded here the ambassador frowned again of course i am aware of your being seconded here mr dawkins has kept me fully informed seconded for what specific purpose there was a hesitation before the diplomat said do you imagine that you can interrogate me no your excellency said charlie belatedly deciding that he should show the expected respect i am trying to prevent any further misunderstandings are you also aware of yesterdays exchanges between this embassy and london concerning my role here instead of answering sotley looked inquiringly at dawkins the flushfaced man said there were some working arrangements that needed to be clarified i decided excellency broke in charlie talking directly to the ambassador i would respectfully suggest that this meeting is suspended to give you the opportunity to read for yourself the exchanges being referred to here and perhaps discuss them more fully and in private with mr dawkins i will of course be available if you decide there is any reason to discuss the situation further as he made his way back to the rezidentura charlie guessed that dawkins probably wouldnt have shown him the same mercy but there was nothing to be gained impaling dawkinss head on a spike far more importantand worryingwas the revelation that jeffrey smale was involving himself in such a handson way and that embassy officers were unquestioningly accepting the deputy directors authority maybe charlie thought he was going soft in his advancing years then again perhaps he wasntjust impatient with all the interruptions and anxious to get on with the job which looked like being further delayed by another wasted day then he saw reg stout talking animatedly with three men in the corridor along which he was walking directly in front of the opendoored control box containing the faulty cctv terminals all three had cameras around their necks and open work boxes packed with electronic equipment one of the three was a man named harry fish an mi electronics sweeper whod been in the counterespionage business almost as long as charlie the recognition between them was immediate fish raised his eyes to heaven at the same time as shaking his head which charlie knew wasnt in denial at god living up there but at the shambles down here on the ground charlie hadnt expected to be back in the ambassadors presence so quickly although on this occasion he was not in the mans office but in a larger adjoining conference room assembled around the table with charlie and the three sweepers was the ambassador dawkins stout and both the mi and mi officers the object of everyones attention in the very center of the table and laid on a white handkerchief to make them more visible were four black objects the size of pinheads state of the art declared fish the team leader any electronic or verbal communication conducted through the four terminals in which we found them would have been received with crystal clarity by the fsb or the external directorate the sluzhba vneshney razvedki in their lubyanka headquarters i am going to have to bring a much larger team from london to sweep this embassy from top to bottom the balding man looked between stout and the two intelligence officers before continuing on to the two diplomats there will obviously be a complete and extremely full internal inquiry which i would expect london to send independent people to conduct in preparation for that it will be necessary for all of you to go back to every communication that was sent on equipment through these terminalsequipment which my team and i will identifyfrom the date the russian electricians were allowed on to the premises supposedly to repair the faulty cctv cameras their being allowed within the embassy is a breach of every security guidance and instruction with which every british embassy particularly this one is issued the inquiry will need to see all the documentation between whomever was involved and consulted authorizing the russian entry i had authorization for everything i allowed to happen burst in a stuttering reg stout fish raised a hand against the outburst the involvement in any inquiry of my team and me will be strictly technical fully identifying the extent of the penetration he nodded to the pinhead bugs from this moment this embassy has to conduct itself in the belief that not one piece of electronic equipment is safe and that includes private telephones in the apartments within this building as well as all those in every office and extends to all mobile and cell phones the radio masts for whose transmission are on the top of this building it is inevitable that other listening or monitoring devices will be detected for the first time fish included charlie as he looked around the table the embassy is already under the sort of scrutiny the foreign office would do its utmost to have avoided for this penetration to become public on top of a murder in its grounds would be a total catastrophe it is only known about by those of us in this room it must not under any circumstance go beyond its already a disaster said sir thomas sotley more to himself than to others in the room yes sir agreed fish unsympathetically it is a complete and absolute disaster the only totally guaranteed bugfree apparatus was now in the embassys basement communications room and charlie stopped harry fish as he was about to enter the descending elevator im on my way down there too announced charlie unsure if their long association which had never developed into a friendship would be sufficient for what he was going to ask but first i need a favor we do very different jobs said the man cautiously letting the elevator doors close against him the russians are trying to push me aside from the investigation declared charlie ive got to prevent that happening particularly after what youve just discovered how asked fish holding back from any additional questions as he listened to what charlie told him shaking his head at the finish itll never work i can make it work i wont swear any formal statements let my name be used just be there with me urged charlie you wont be identified twenty minutes insisted fish ive already given london a contact schedule twenty minutes agreed charlie nodding to the camera still slung around the other mans neck charlie said can i have the images of what i want i hope to christ im not going to regret this you wont promised charlie wishing he could be sure it took them five minutes of fishs stipulated schedule to collect buckets a spade trowels and plastic sheeting from the gardeners shed reg stout had earlier identified to charlie which ensured they got the necessary attention of the russian grounds staff three stood watching when they got to where the body had been found the newly turned soil filling the russiandug hole visibly different from that which surrounded it charlie demanded from one of them that their overseer be summoned and ordered the man to keep all the russians not just away but out of sight of what he and fish were about to do charlie reluctantly did the digging gouging a mark in the conferencehall wall with the spade edge grateful for the effort fish put into the apparent selection of dirt heaped onto the plastic sheeting you get into any shit over this youre on your own warned the man as they walked back to the embassy their soil samples on the plastic sheet slung between them i owe you thanked charlie accepting the offered digital camera images from fishs camera fish waited while charlie transferred all the soil onto a fresh piece of sheeting locked his cubbyhole office and returned the tools to the gardeners shed in the elevator finally taking them to the communications room charlie said how bad is this for a lot of people here up to and including the ambassador id guess it will be terminal as it deserves to be how were the cctv cameras sabotaged to make them work intermittently as they did with whats called breakers cutting the power on and off to give the impression of a power interruption the bugs work on a time system so that the power goes off completely at whatever specific moment you want the screens to go blank does the power actually go off or is it their operation thats interrupted fish stopped as they emerged into the basement facility whats your point stuff thats wiped off computer screens can be recovered from a hard drive by specialists cant it with cctv youre talking continuous film that revolves for a certain period and then reverses to record again thats why its called a loop computers are electric even if something is saved and then erased its possible to recover the ghost from a hard drive the old loops that were affected whats going to happen to them they get destroyed weve installed new ones can i have the old ones im glad i do what i do not what you do said fish most of the time i dont like it much myself said charlie it took charlie almost as long to pack up for dispatch to london the discarded loops what he considered sufficient soil samples and to list the significance of fishs digital camera images already transmitted to london as it did to send his requests to london after what he considered a usefully spent day he was disappointed that his feet still throbbed in tandem at the continuing feeling that he was missing something the postal system of moscow is as haphazard as its swirling winter blizzards even in the topsyturvy summer in which the city was now embalmed in little more than a twentyfourhour period it would have been impossible for natalia to have given a written response to charlies note despite which in the unlikely event of her having received it and decided instead to telephone the savoy charlie still waited until long after any delivery before at last calling the number sergei pavel had given him for the organized crime bureau at ulitsa petrovka charlie had forgotten the russian system of individually assigned numbers expecting a general switchboard and was momentarily surprised when the militia colonel personally answered id expected contact before now said the man when charlie identified himself the voice was bland practically monotone without any criticism at the delay thereve been some unforeseen developments at the embassy there was the hesitation that charlie hoped to engender and the tone of pavels voice changed what unforeseen developments things we need to talk about generalized charlie thought id give a couple of days too for all the other things we discussed at the mortuary to come together fuller pathology details photographs of the scene further forensic findings stuff like that there are a few things not all begrudged the russian cautiously id hoped we could get together some time today take it all forward were certain that the murder wasnt committed anywhere near where the body was found which makes it a russian investigation declared pavel as if he were reading from a prompt card altogether too soon too quick judged charlie he could afford to bluff more thats intriguing why demanded pavel the curiosity very evident in the no longer neutral voice its not quite either the indication or the impression ive been getting from those whove come across from london to go through everything at the embassy lured charlie knowing the arrival of harry fish and his teamand their digging expedition the previous afternoonwould have been recorded by the diligent fsb gardener informers even if pavel himself was at the moment unaware we really do need to meet exactly how many of the reports have you managed to assemble some photographs the preliminary medical report stumbled the other man confronted with something different from what hed expected charlie doubted that whatever pavel was minimally offering was actually assembled yet to give the russian time to go through the pretense of collationand doubtless speak to others about the unexpected approachhe said why dont i come around this afternoon for us to get started three oclocks good for me there was another hesitation i should have everything together by then although i cant guarantee it if the russian wasnt sure he could get his own bullshit together in five hours nothing at all had yet been assembled not believing that possible charlie said itll be a start which wasnt any way the object of charlies exercise it was to bluff pavel and through him the inevitable monitoring fsb and foreign ministry that there was a lot theyd missed in their comparatively short forensic examination at the scene inside the british embassy grounds the fsb bugging of the embassy electronics worked more to his benefit than theirs in taking advantage of the security stupidity presented to them on a shiny silver platter theyd believe him because he would be telling them what they already knew or imagined they knew he was going to have a dream hand for his poker game the expertise was going to come in his not overplaying it the scurrying activity at the embassy reminded charlie of an anthill there were at least a dozen photographers and journalists grouped outside the firmly closed gates and there was uniformed security forming an admission cordon around the pedestrian entrance adjoining the gatehouse inside the gatehouse the now properly working cctv cameras displayed in sharp panoramic detail the entire front of the building charlie endured the ritual of id checks and descended into the communications room waiting there for him was a warning from the head of the technical and scientific services division that until the arrival of the discarded cctv loops they could not guarantee his detailed overnight request was possibletheir more normal function was to detect counterfeit and deceiving enhancement not create itbut that what charlie wanted was certainly scientifically and technically feasible it might help after theyd received the recording material for charlie to talk directly by telephone as well as in more detailed messages answering their specific questions charlie detected a note of tetchy irritation in the assurance that they had samples of mm makarov ammunition there was also a personal acknowledgement from directorgeneral aubrey smith insisting that charlie continue working not just totally independently from everyone at the embassyespecially those most likely to have been compromisedbut also from the incoming internal inquiry team all communication had to be personal between the two of them which left charlie undecided between the advantages compared to the disadvantages of such close contact with the man who for several months had appeared the loser in the power struggle with his deputy smith was a university professor of middle eastern studies and an acknowledged expert on the revolutionary movements of the region who had been pitchforked from academia into intelligence in a kneejerk reaction to islamic fanaticism smiths way was ingrained from that academic background to consider and judge events from every perspective it had seemed to chime with charlies independent way of working and he enjoyed having smiths confidence which in matching measure had alienated him from jeffrey smale and survival savvy as he was charlie was well aware that his job security depended upon smith emerging the victor in the current department power struggle for once paulajane venables and david halliday were in their offices both doors closed with not to be disturbed signs in their occupancy slots which charlie ignored still with time to fill before his appointment with the embassy lawyer the woman jerked up irritably at his unannounced entry relaxing when she saw who it was this is proving to be an absolute fucking nightmare she announced unasked how bad could it be bottom line asked charlie his being forbidden to share anything upon which he was engaged was no obstacle to his learning as much as he could about everything else in the embassy god only knows im going to have to admit gaps in the telephone log im supposed to have kept but havent dont admit anything advised charlie the survival expert wait until youre asked answer one question at a time and dont volunteer anything at the moment im guessing the bastards could have listened to something in the region of a hundred maybe a hundred and fifty incoming and outgoing calls what about written stuff luckier there i do have a full log of the sensitive email material and its all gone through the communications room which your friend harry fish tells me isnt compromised youre not supposed to rely upon luck reminded charlie youve been seconded to the internal inquiry team as well she challenged no said charlie mildly but if i were that would have been the wrong response you didnt open the doors to let the bad guys in as far as i am aware it was reg stout under dawkinss authority condoned by an ineffectual ambassador you havent got any reason to be defensive all youve got to do is warn the guys who are coming from london of anything the fsb might have learned i just told you my telephone logsthe logs they are going to want to examine and question me aboutarent complete how muchhow manycan you remember of what you havent logged most of it im pretty sure so verbally include from memory whatevers missing from the log when youre questioned in detail about your telephone records considering the way i greeted you when you arrived youre being very kind said paulajane smiling who told you i was anything otherwise you wouldnt believe me if i told you said the woman her initial uptightness easing i want to make amends im not sure youve got any amends to make coaxed charlie curious to know whod been digging the mantraps ahead of him i am she insisted ive been invited to a dinner party tonight by the current cia guy at the american embassy and i dont have a partner would you have a problem filling the vacancy charlie found an immediate response difficult the uncertainty of natalias reaction to his letter in the forefront of his mind if she missed him on her first call shed phone again came the quick reassurance it was unlikely thered be any professional benefit socializing with the americans but there was always the possibility of the unexpected which was all charlie ever asked for a simple possibility that could be fun lets try to make sure it is dont tell me its a nightmare ive been told that already halliday gestured charlie farther into the unexpectedly littered mi rezidentura files dossiers and newspapersenglish language as well as russianoverflowing from benches and side desks onto a floor shadowed by unclosed cabinets and open desk drawers halliday said not as bad as it looks which looks bad enough commiserated charlie needing to move some of the records to take the offered seat the headline in that days unfiled moscow news on top of the heap read mystery deepens in british embassy murder halliday shook his head smiling on open possibly intercepted transmission little more than embarrassment a lot of analyses about stepan lvovs presidential chances which is occupying every western embassy in moscow and shouldnt surprise anyone in the fsb my judgement is that lvovs a shooin so if im right its not even embarrassing that weve been monitoring him if he loses im a bad analyst they dont have to worry about keeping too close an eye on very pragmatic complimented charlie ive never seen so many worried people running around so many corridors or quite so many journalists cameramen and tv crews outside this embassy the inquisitors are due any time thumbscrews and all theres bound to be a lot of other transgressions swept up in the spring cleaning and reg stout whos rightly shitting himself says hes called the militia to clear the media away he told me he hardly speaks russian halliday shrugged hes always talking through the hole in his ass how worried are you about the internal inquiry halliday smiled again i certainly didnt let the fsb bugmasters in you must have recognized how fucked up the security was here before the shit hit the fan halliday patted the closest folder to him on his desk i did long before the shit hit any fan and heres the log with attached copies of every warning message ive sent to london over the last six months londons going to have a lot of selfexplaining to do as well as the idiots here the man patted his special folder again with this already on my record im going to come out of this inquiry smelling like a rose always better than smelling of shit agreed charlie i told monsford my director youd declined my offer of help by the way he said he might take it up with your boss thought you should know in advance i appreciate your telling me that said charlie deciding at that moment that although admiring hallidays apparent professionalism he didnt personally like the man but then charlie asked himself when had liking someone have anything to do with anything charlie had wondered if in five years the official interior design preponderance of desk and countertop bakelite with matching linoleum floor covering would have disappeared but of course it hadntit just became more scratched and scuffed the insolent blankfaced disinterest of the counter clerk at ulitsa petrovka was the same as charlie remembered too charlies guess at four minutes before the man would bother to look up from the curlededged unturned page of what he was reading was short by an additional full minute important to keep up to date with all the regulations sympathized charlie sure the man was looking at the latest officecirculating porn magazine the clerk was two pages short of the photographic offerings there was grunted surprise at charlies mockery being in russian you the englishman to see sergei romanovich pavel thats me agreed charlie equally surprised at the expectation its the top floor second door on the right when you get there dismissed the man nodding toward the linoleumclad stairs as he went back to his magazine charlie took his time and was glad he did the top floor was six flights up and by the time he got there his feet were burning and he was panting even though hed paced himself hed passed seven people on the way up two of them women and been ignored by them all despite being an unauthorized foreign stranger it wasnt casual security charlie decided but stage management to indicate his unimportance charlie waited until hed fully recovered his breath before knocking on the identified door he had to knock twice more before there was an unintelligible shout beyond which he took to be an invitation to enter the outside office was empty but pavel was visible through the open door of the next room behind a cluttered desk the mans jacket was looped around the back of his chair crushed by his leaning back against it pavels tie was loosened and his shirt collar open the shirt and tie as well as the suit were what the man had worn at the mortuary at least charlie thought hed changed his own shirt and socks it reminded him he needed to get some laundry done at the hotel he supposed hed have to change again into the better of his two suits for that evenings dinner with paulajanes american friends at last greeted pavel theres been time for things to develop im looking forward to hearing what they are encouraged pavel as i am from you parried charlie anxious to get the exchange on his terms pavel pushed two folders through an already cleared space on his desk the photographs and the pathology findings of dr ivanov the meeting was obviously being recorded charlie accepted disbelieving the apparent casualness with which he had been allowed to walk unescorted around the building he couldnt isolate a lens but he had to assume the encounter was being filmed too so he had to be careful even with facial reactions there were twelve images in the album which charlie instantly decided were inadequate without needing any closer examination the only two pictures of the flowerbed hole dug to retrieve blood samples and perhaps the bullet gave no indication of its depth from which to assess the amount of soil removed charlie merely flicked through the pathologists report without trying to read anything judging it equally inadequate simply from its thinness allowing the frown for the benefit of the undetected camera he said this is only a preliminary medical report of course and im disappointed there arent more photographs i understood from dr ivanov that it was complete equivocated pavel giving himself an escape from the challenge itll obviously be necessary to talk it all through with the pathologist after ive read it in detail said charlie might have to send it to london to be checked through there you said there had been developments pressed the russian most of which i dont fully understand and others of which are very awkward said charlie im particularly concerned that our working relations and arrangements could be affected i need you to explain precisely what youre telling me protested pavel there was no longer any bland condescension ill set out everything as clearly as i can said charlie without the slightest intention of doing anything of the sort on the phone you said you were certain that the man wasnt murdered in the embassy grounds pavel shifted at the onus being put upon him we recovered a lot of earth where the shattered head lay there was remarkably little blood residue scarcely more than a liter very little bone or skin debris either and most certainly no bullet which there obviously would have been if hed been shot where and how he was found far far too complacent and far too obviously rehearsed recognized charlie if it hadnt been so overwhelmingly to his own benefit he might even have been offended at the contemptuous dismissal if he had been already lying face down agreed charlie not if hed been standing up he let the pause in enjoying his own performance or kneeling to be executed which is what our forensic pathologist believes to have been the position in which he was shot and which there is some evidence to support theres a substantial grooved mark close to the base of the wall of the conference hall and a lot of blood and possibly debris at least half a yard from where the body fell and was found i didnt see anything like that broke in pavel forward in his chair now no longer lounged back creasing his jacket from what ive been told everything was rushed confused said charlie weve obviously collected a lot of the other bloodsoaked earth quite a way away from where you dug he lifted what the russians had bothered to include in the photographic selection very much more than your scientist appears to have done its being sifted as well as electronically searched to find the bullet the forensic scientist calculated the most likely trajectory from the mark on the wall where is it all this other forensic material demanded the russian charlie hesitated as if discomfited by a too difficult question in london its all been shipped back for further and more detailed examination he knew the size of the untouchable diplomatic shipment including everything harry fish had helped him assemble would have been logged by the fsb staff at sheremetyevo airport as a matter of course there are more than adequate forensic facilities here said pavel tightly charlie remained silent for several moments looking down as if either in contemplation or unwillingness even to look directly at sergei pavel eventually he said there is a problem i knowacceptthat it is not of your creation that you dont know anything about it it has nothing whatsoever to do with what you and i have been assigned to do but it has obviously affected the thinking in london the bewilderment was mirrored on pavels face something else i dont understand what i am going to tell you i do as an indication of how much i value our further and continued cooperation said charlie i ask you at the same time to treat it in the strictest confidence i do not yet know what my government intends publicly to do about it but i certainly dont wish either of us to be accused of initiating a diplomatic incident whats going on whats happened charlies assessment of pavels reaction was that the russian had no knowledge of the embassy bugging i have your assurance that what i am going to tell you remains strictly between the two of us upon the honor of my mother pledged the man who must have been a kopeck whore if pavel were to be believed gauged charlie the embassy sought the help of local electriciansrecommended by your foreign ministryto rectify some faults in its security system particularly the cctv cameras some spying apparatus was installed while russian electricians were within the embassy pavel shook his head i did not know i am not accusing you ive given you my confidence for you to understand the attitude of people to whom i am responsible why they ordered whatever their forensic people retrieved to be examined and tested in london instead of here by your people how can we be expected to continue with such a barrier between us pavel asked desperately its been made impossible charlie hadnt anticipated that capitulation and the alarm swept through him its only impossible if we allow it to become so we have to cut ourselves off from it entirely but if we are going to continue with total openness between each other there is something further i must tell you because it affects our investigation what more can there be the cctv cameras kept failing intermittently finally failing altogether but there are some images upon them images of what could be our murder victim and those who killed him the russians complete silence the mans inability momentarily even to speak further convinced charlie of pavels ignorance of the spying intrusion at last pavel haltingly managed the films the recordings whatever they are where are they back in london being enhanced with all the other recovered material is it possible that you will get identifiable pictures that is what our scientists are trying to achieve sergei pavel personally escorted charlie down to the groundfloor reception area animatedly assuring daily contact charlie felt a satisfying warmth at how pavels attitudefrom dismissal to reliancehad changed charlies estimate of how long it would take sergei pavel to contact the fsbs mikhail guzov at the lubyanka coincided with his reaching a pavement newsstand at which he was brought to a halt by the moscow news billboard there was no other story on its front page apart from the bugging of the british embassy with a sidebar speculation of it plunging diplomatic relations between russia and britain back to the frostbitten era of the cold war his revelation to pavel was far too recent for the russian detective to be the source so which of the others at yesterdays confrontation in sir thomas sotleys suite hadnt been able to keep their undertaking of secrecy the media posse had grown by the time charlie returned to pick up paulajane venables from her embassy compound apartment some uniformed russian militia officers had arrived to supplement the british security cordon keeping the pedestrian door clear they werent doing anything though to prevent the television cameramen and photographers from taking pictures and charlie told his taxi driver to continue on to a telephone kiosk farther along the embankment and wait while he made a call ashamed to be seen with me paulajane asked flirtingly when charlie warned of the likely ambush you dont need to be identified with me by the fsb and i dont want to be linked with you by them dont you think they already know who were from youll be on file for christs sake why advertise it theres caution for you she mocked pity there hadnt been a lot more of it in the last few weeks said charlie heavily you had a bad day not at all denied charlie hoping he wasnt showing his disappointment at not finding a telephone message from natalia when hed gone back to the hotel to change ive got a cab ill pick you up at the kalininskaya bridge okay okay she said her lightness gone it took her twenty minutes arriving uncomfortably on elevated high heels the shoes coordinating with the clasp bag the cleavage was so deep the single rope of pearls looked like a suspension bridge between two peaks settling gratefully into the back of the cab she said television didnt really show the extent of the scrum i guess you were right where are we going asked charlie as the cab moved off where else but the american cafe just off the ring road she gave the driver the address in russian you seen the papers asked charlie heard it on television when i was trying to estimate the crowd outside your friend harrys gone apeshit along with the entire inquiry team that came in this afternoon i actually didnt think i was going to be able to get away tonight after all theyve got sotley in with them now with dawkins on standby charlie was intent upon the cab drivers reflection in the rearview mirror relieved from the disinterest on the mans face that he really didnt understand english whod you think couldnt keep their mouth shut if we take you me and halliday out of the frame youve got a fairly short list of suspects my moneys on reg stout stout was certainly the most obvious accepted charlie they were on the multilaned freeway now swept along by the tide of vehicles all around them recognizing the landmark of pushkins house charlie looked to the right where natalias apartment was little more than a hundred yards off the main highway familiar places from when you were here before asked paulajane no denied charlie honestly the apartment hed occupied with natalia and sasha an entire floor of a minor prerevolutionary palace was on the far side of the city wanting to move on from the unwelcomed reminder he said tell me about the people were going to be with tonight tex probert is from the company she said using spookspeak to identify the cia his wife sarah is over on a visit bill bundys his intended replacement overlapping to settle himself in shirley jenkins whos partnering bundy is in their legal department nice guys although it takes a lot for shirley to unbend she smiled the remark prepared although she does quite a lot of unbending in certain circumstances according to the stories ive heard charlie ignored the innuendo instead he said sarahs over on a visit from whats officially described as relocation leave explained paulajane tex is due to go back permanently any time now hes been assigned a cia headquarters posting at langley so shes househunting around washington and finding colleges for the two kids whove been at school there bills the eventual replacement like i said thirdterm assignment the companys acknowledged russian guru i know said charlie you know he was on station here the same time as me how about that exclaimed paulajane how about that indeed thought charlie easing his finger inside his left shoe to massage the discomfort charlie had never understood why nostalgic backhome theme restaurants and bars in foreign cities never properly replicated back home at all the american cafe which hadnt existed when hed lived in moscow was designed to represent a s diner that as far as charlie was aware didnt exist anywhere in the united states this one was complete with blownup photographs of lana turner and rita hayworth and a cigarette advertising poster of a young chesterfieldsmoking ronald reagan there was even a bulbous multilighted although silent jukebox all the tables were covered in red checked cloths each topped with a totem ketchup bottle cute eh enthused paulajane fascinating allowed an unimpressed charlie the american party was already there around a centrally placed circular table charlie instantly recognized bill bundy in the middle of the group guessing from paulajanes rehearsal that the serious faced darkhaired girl to the mans right to be the lawyer shirley jenkins which made the man next to her tex probert with blond wife sarah completing the group both men stood to shake hands at their introduction and bundy said good to see you after all this time charlie and you said charlie who couldnt isolate a single apparent difference in the mans appearance from when theyd last met the preppy short haircut didnt look out of place on a man who had to be at least fifty nor did the regulation ivy league suit complete with metalpin collared shirt clamping the club tie in place you two guys already know each other exclaimed the angularfeatured probert whose accent explained the nickname the formal introduction had been john from way back confirmed bundy we two can actually remember what the cold war was like and dinosaurs said charlie to the laughing appreciation of the three women giving him the necessary moment to think bundys posting quite clearly had nothing whatsoever to do with what hed been sent from london to investigate but charlie had never before heard of a thirdtime overseas assignmentcertainly not one that involved moving such an acknowledged russophile at a time of impending political change his professional curiosity was piqued the arrival of the waiter stopped the conversation the women agreed to share a bottle of white wine while they decided the menu probert chose beer and charlie stuck with vodka in preference to doctored scotch knowing the restaurant definitely wouldnt have a bottle with the correct label let alone genuine islay malt which reminded him to collect his commissary order the following day bundy whom charlie belatedly remembered never chanced losing control stayed with mineral water insisting on breaking the bottlecap seal himself the american food order was uniformly tbone steaks upon proberts insistence that they were definitely flown in from texas paulajane wanted trout ordering from prior knowledge of the menu without needing to consult it and when charlie asked for borscht bundy said staying native charlie when in rome charlie answered using the cliche he started putting people in their pigeonholes there was very definitely a frisson between probert and paulajane which he guessed proberts wife was as conscious of as he was probert also appeared overly deferential to bundy even making allowances for the bundy legend within the cia deciding to use that reputation to goad the man in return charlie said how about you bill what brings the head of the cias russian desk back to moscow interesting times politically dont you think said the man i always thought ambassadors and diplomats assessed things politically and that people like you and me were expected to make other sorts of contributions my philosophy has always been that you cant do one without studying the other you here simply because of your murder who said i was here for that demanded charlie aware of the others shifting uncomfortably at the sudden seriousness between him and the american bundy looked around the table as if aware of it too now heres a lesson for all of us the danger of assuming too much charlies on a mission he obviously cant tell us about which is another dangerously accepted assumption said charlie raising his delivered vodka in a toast to the group to cover his irritation at losing the exchange cant say i envy you guys came in probert attempting to lessen the atmosphere must be a hornets nest down there at smolenskaya naberezhnaya its kind of busy agreed paulajane you just won the understatement of the year award pj said probert leading the laughter from the outside looking in id say theres going to be a wholesale massacre suggested bundy im keeping my office door locked said paulajane overemboldened by her earlier reception although only probert laughed again this time from what ive read in the american papers it seems too late for that said sarah adding to her wineglass for the third time i thought all this spy nonsense was over actually i never believed most of it in the first place she was blue eyed as well as blond with perfectly sculpted teeth and a milkandvitaminfed complexion she looked challengingly between her husband and the two other men and said okay let us in on the secret how many james bond coups have any of you had that you know saved the world sarah stop it protested probert the arrival of their food contributed to the interruption unasked charlie took the initiative and ordered his favorite georgian red wine intrigued by the total unexpectedness of the dinner party and the vague undertones he was detecting most surprisedand curiousat facing an adversary hed never imagined confronting ever again socially or otherwise his mind held by sarah proberts outburst charlie tried to recall a starttofinish operation of which he was proud and couldnt hed stuck a hell of a lot of wrenches into a hell of a lot of engines though and who could calculate their outcome if he hadnt done it perversely wanting to keep the uneasy conversation on its present track to see where it might lead charlie said theres no such thing as a oneman band in our business its lots of different people offering lots of different tunes eventually to create a song to hum to wouldnt you say thats how it is tex before her husband could reply sarah said john says very little about anything to me at least thats why im glad were moving back to washington dc where things will be much more normal and i can get my husband back thats enough sarah said probert moscows not the best foreign posting for a family offered paulajane sarah looked across the table at the english woman but deferred to her husbands warning pushing aside her scarcely touched meal and picking up the empty white wine bottle with her other hand to gesture for a replacement is ann coming back this time charlie asked bundy knowing the mans wife hadnt enjoyed moscow and spent a lot of time back in america during their contemporary posting jurys still out on that said bundy how long are you expecting to be here charlie shrugged openended why dont we make lunch sometime catch up on old times that would be good lied charlie whod only ever socialized with the american at mutually attended embassy receptions and even then to the polite minimum it was paulajane venables who recovered the evening using her enjoyment of russia in general and moscow in particular as the springboardalthough not in critical comparison with sarah proberts obvious disenchantmentto enthuse about the bolshoi ballet and of a trip she intended repeating to st petersburg to again visit the hermitage and the tzars village of tarskoye selo and to see more opera at the mariinsky theatre culminating with the announcement that when her tour of duty in moscow ended she intended going east not west to take the transsiberian railway all the way to the chinese border and complete her recall to england via japan if she was refused a visa into china she amusingly told stories against herself of misadventures and mistakes during her explorations to the genuine tex probertled amusement of everyone with the initial exception of sarah shirley jenkins took up the travelogue with an account of a collegegraduation rail journey the length of latin america as far as patagonia and eventually sarahand even bundyrelaxed sufficiently to keep the conversation away from embassy rumor and gossip the only real subject all of them had in common on the way back to the embassy paulajane said that wasnt anything like the fun id hoped it would be bundys a stuffy old fart frightening all of them with a reputation i didnt see or hear much to justify i think hes stuck in a cold war time warp like the way he dresses and how that fucking cafe is designed hes a very dedicated guy said charlie impressed at her analysis you work a lot with him when you were both here not at all we both preferred to work alone like you prefer to do now weve been through that you didnt share anything with bundy persisted the woman disbelievingly nothing said charlie was it just your idea to invite me along tonight paulajane turned to him in the taxi how do you mean was my name mentioned when you were invited paulajane hesitated thinking i dont remember your name coming up how could it have no one at the american embassy could have known you were here could they bundy didnt seem surprised to see me and appeared to know what i was doing here bundy tries to give the impression of knowing everything before it ever happens she dismissed i thought we came close to an embarrassment with sarah you did well to save the evening congratulated charlie you know her well hardly at all this isnt her first extended trip back to the states from what tex has told me shes spent more of his russian tour back home than here as the embassy came into view charlie leaned toward the windshield and said the media siege appears to have been lifted i thought you might have invited me back to the hotel for a nightcap said the woman id guessed you would thought charlie maybe another time lets hope there is one charlie eagerly took the offered message slip from the savoy receptionist his expectation of it being from natalia collapsing immediately the only thing written on the slip was the telephone number of colonel sergei pavel charlies second arrival at petrovka was very different from his first on this occasion there was an instant acknowledgement from a different attentive desk clerk and at whose bellpressed demand another escort officer appeared despite charlies assurance that he knew how to get to pavels office the bigger surprise coming close to astonishment continued when he reached pavels topfloor aerie already there waiting with the organized crime colonel were the weakstomached foreign ministry official of the mortuary visit together with the suspected fsbs mikhail guzov and two other men whose identities charlie guessed from their nervous footshuffling deference to be the discovering gardeners which was a bonus charlie hadnt expected but which he decided could more than justify his responding to pavels previous night summons there were thermoses of black tea waiting on a side table that hadnt been in pavels office the first time the voice recorders and film equipment would still be charlie knew the situation would appear to have become very complicated opened the foreign ministrys nikita kashev in what way queried charlie intentionally awkward to give himself time to compartment the assembled group in their necessary order of priority kashev had to be there according to the diplomatically agreed protocol for the questioning of the bodydiscovering gardening team and the murder investigation was officially the responsibility of sergei pavel which left mikhail guzov as the only one who didnt have a place which put the fsb man in charge by intruding into the meeting guzov was positively although unnecessarily confirming his own official role and purpose why could it be a test in reverse guzov wanting there to be no misunderstanding of who and what he was confronting even any possible accusation of the fsb bugging the embassy as always charlie accepted he had to dance on ballet points an agonizing concept with feet like his a lot of media speculation about continuing difficulties at your embassy offered kashev i am not concerned or interested in any media speculation apart from how it could interfere with what i am here to do charlie continued with intentional awkwardness as id hoped to have made clear at our initial meeting i am here for one specific purpose he smiled between the gardeners and pavel and i appreciate what im anticipating to be our continuing cooperation reluctantly drawn into the discussion pavel introduced the two fsb informant gardeners boris nikolaevich maksimov and petr petrovich denin formally including their patronymics pavel made the identification at the same time as offering charlie two separate dossiers concluding and here are their sworn statements bulldozing time charlie at once recognized his conviction growing that everything was being orchestrated as well as recorded by guzov disregarding the increasingly impatient fidgeting of his audience charlie took his time reading the supposed recollections of each gardener both of which stopped short of two full pages and roughlyvery roughlyaccorded with reg stouts totally inadequate account of his conversation with maksimov there are some questions of course in light of what was discovered after your crime scene investigation charlie briskly set out docking guzov two points on the professional score sheet for the mans obvious frown talking directly to maksimov charlie said how close did you go to the body the thinfaced man hesitated his look to guzov for guidance too obvious haltingly weakvoiced he said im not sure not close enough to touch it you thought at first it might be someone sleeping didnt you what asked the man now including pavel in his anxious look for help you told the head of security at the embassy that at first you thought the man was sleeping its not in your statement said charlie waving the folder i dont remember saying that why should you have thought someone was sleeping in the embassy grounds maksimov scrubbed his hand across his sweating face you see people lying drunk at night what made you changed your mind maksimov shuddered when i got closer saw what had happened to his face that there wasnt a face were the clothes wet no i dont know you did touch the body then no i told you i didnt you said the clothes werent wet how did you know the clothes werent wet if you didnt touch the body he said he didnt know came in guzov speaking for the first time after saying the clothes werent wet insisted charlie i meant i didnt know not that i touched the body i didnt touch the body how close did you go to it not close no closer than a yard close enough to see that there wasnt a face that was obvious maksimov was starting to relax charlie recognized not at first when you thought it was someone sleeping i dont remember saying that repeated the man what about the chip out of the brickwork you saw that didnt you no i dont understand that question you sure you didnt no i mean i dont know i cant remember what did you mean by telling the embassy security officer that you didnt do it did you mean that you hadnt killed him i didnt mean to say that it just came out like that when you got about a yard away you could see the body very clearly the man hesitated nervously yes time to sow more seeds charlie decided i know there wasnt a face but on which side was the head laying to its right or to its left there was another pause maksimov looked at his supervisor who shrugged maksimov said to its right youre sure it was to its right yes said the russian sounding anything but sure thats consistent said charlie as if to himself looking down again at maksimovs written statement to provide the delay consistent with what demanded pavel looking down as hed had to charlie hadnt been able to see any indication from guzov for the organized crime detective to ask the question charlie said the gouge mark in the wall our forensic people believe was caused by the bullet ricochet he looked from pavel to the others in the office you have passed on what we talked about earlier it was kashev who answered the colonel has in some detail which is why we are here and why i think we need to talk very specifically beyond this immediate subject i want to stress most forcibly that my government denies absolutely any knowledge or responsibility for what is being reported in the media as an espionage intrusion into the british embassy my colleagues also wish sir charlie broke in and before i continue any further i apologize for interrupting you i have no permanent attachment to the british embassy here i cannot therefore discuss anything other than what i have been sent here to investigate my investigation is however overshadowed by the situation to which you refer and obviously potentially hampered by it particularly by the disparities in thesecharlie fluttered the two inadequate statementsand what british forensic scientists collected from other parts of the murder scene and i intentionally use those words murder scene because every conclusion british scientists have so far reached is that the crime was very definitely committed on british territory not somewhere else i have taken the advice of our embassy lawyer on that the embassy is legally and technically british territory not russian none of those conclusionsor the proof that led to their being reachedhas been exchanged according to the cooperation understanding between our two governments intruded mikhail guzov to charlies satisfaction it would be wrong to challenge the other mans official reason for being there too easily dismissed as guzov being attached to the foreign ministry which technically he probably was another overshadowing but inevitably connected problem so whats the resolve demanded guzov a separation if its possible between the diplomatic and the criminal suggested charlie answer your own question insisted guzov is that possible i for my part believe that i can work in total cooperation with colonel pavel quite separately from whatever else is affecting the embassy i will further undertake to do my utmost to persuade london to make available the results of all scientific tests and as a gesture of my commitment i will tell you now that there are definitely images upon the cctv loops that were intended to be rendered useless by being tampered with the ricocheting score mark on the wall is still evident and has been extensively photographed although its immediate brick surface has obvious been scraped away for fragment traces of the bullet that made the mark after exiting the mans head also extensively photographed is the second border area from which earth was dug by our forensic experts team to retrieve blood residue and hopefully the bullet i must ask that our forensic officers be allowed back into the embassy for a second examination said kashev in the circumstances in which we now find ourselves and which i have made clear to you that is not my permission to give sidestepped charlie that has to be an official request from your ministry to the ambassador the most i can offer is the expectation of sharing with colonel pavel the photographs and the forensic results to which i have referred hed been cut off by guzov before getting all that hed wanted from the easily manipulated gardeners but hed done far better than he could possibly have hoped before entering the room so why wasnt he feeling far more satisfied the doubt vanished an hour later when he entered the savoy to find waiting for him on a message slip another telephone number he recognized at once to be natalias good to speak to you after so long it had to be close to five months charlie reckoned and to speak to you how are you fine you did her voice sound as distant as it had when theyd last spoken too soon to tell fine hows sasha very well said natalia why were important conversations which he judged this to be conducted in such mundane ordinary words he said id like to see her while im here you too of course im sorry i didnt put that very well did i shes away for a few days on a school trip isnt she young to be away on a trip by herself alone in his hotel room charlie grimaced as he uttered the words wishing he could have bitten them back there was a strict rule between them that he never questioned natalia about the upbringing of their daughter ignore what i just said im sorry it was the second time hed apologized in less than five minutes he was sounding like a stumbling idiot not someone determined to persuade her against all her previous refusals shes at a regulated camp up in the hills about ten kilometers outside moscow theyre in purposebuilt barracks four girls to a hut there are three permanent staff as well as security and two teachers she can telephone me every day which shes doing every day and shell be back in two days i said im began charlie stopping short to avoid repeating himself again of course we should meet why not said natalia helpfully my movements are uncertain of course natalia accepted without needing to ask why im fairly flexible although it might be more convenient if we met initially ahead of sasha getting back tomorrow demanded charlie natalia hesitated ill wait for your call following that afternoons meeting with pavel and the others there was every likelihood that some surveillance would be imposed upon him acknowledged charlie relieved that so far he had not detected any telltale delay in anything natalia had said to indicate an interception already on his hotel phone he had to assume though that the hotel line was unsafe and he knew that cell phones could just as easily be scanned ill use public phones to contact you from now on i see and you shouldnt try to call me here again no charlie had forgotten the longago subterfuge he and natalia had needed to stay safe and didnt imagine natalia would welcome the rigmarole again certainly not at the risk it created for sasha i hadnt properly thought the nonsense through neither had i we can make it work though urgently insisted charlie worried by the difficulty angry at himself that he hadnt considered it earlier but then he hadnt expected the reception committee awaiting him in pavels petrovka office which hed left less than an hour ago and still had to assess not any sort of excuse he criticized himself we both need to think about that said natalia cautiously particularly where we meet she was very sensibly putting her apartmenther and sashas apartmentoff limits charlie recognized the hotel would obviously be impossible too well talk about it when i phone definitely before sasha gets back definitely agreed charlie ill be waiting charlie remained listening after natalia replaced her receiver relieved at not hearing a second intruding disconnection reminding himself at the same time that russian technology would have obviously improved since hed last worked here harry fish whose knowledge charlie respected had described the listening devices at the embassy as state of the art which was the expression fish used again the following day when charlie entered the assigned inquiry room at the embassy to find the electronics expert with paul robertson the london director of internal counterintelligence whose peremptory summons had been awaiting charlie the moment hed arrived at the embassy fish had three more pinhead devices laid out again on a white cloth nodding to them the man said one was in the terminal relay to the ambassadors personal phone the second in that of his personal assistant the third was on dawkinss line all the bafflers on every terminal put there to defeat just such emplacements had been removed weve had our differences in the past robertson immediately reminded charlie clearly expecting to take command and control of everything thats where they are in the past and where theyll stay i want this all wrapped up which also means i want your input which further means i want to know everything youve discovered and how its going to help me the sallowfaced man jerked his head sideways to the electronics expert harrys told me what he helped you do so i dont want any of that bullshit which i dont anticipate the directorgeneral will either so we wont involve him in any discussion about it two major differences charlie remembered the first had arisen when robertson had suggested the wrong traitor in a longago operation which hed overturned by identifying the correct one on the second occasion robertson had wrongly accused charlie of security negligence and been officially censured in the subsequent exonerating inquiry charlie had suspected then the personal accusation had been in revenge for robertsons initial mistake and didnt have any doubt about the personal animosity involved this time how much lowerand heavierwas the sky going to come down on his head looking to the other man charlie said thanks harry for the discretion trying to con the russians as you are doing is a stupid idea that isnt going to work and im not going to be pulled down by it or by you returned fish ive got friends now stacking supermarket shelves who got too closely involved with you lets not get petulant warned robertson tell me what you know fuck both of you thought charlie is this embassy now totally clean guaranteed confirmed fish which isnt any reassurance dismissed charlie they scored ten out of ten with a gold star there had to be inside guidance for them to have hit every target like that as well as removing the counterprotection in the limited times between stout going back and forth between the control boxes and cctvs to check they were working properly after they were supposedly fixed our conclusion too said robertson which gives us a mole hunt and one hell of a problem the directorgeneral has told me youre working directly to him quite independently of what were trying to do which is why its only you here with harry and me and why harrys shown you what else hes found to give you some idea of the mess were in all i want is your opinion charlies first thought was that what robertson had just said was a very bad attempt to give the impression that the directorgeneral had sanctioned this meeting aubrey smiths edict categorically precluded his cooperationeven his taking part in this conversationridiculous though it seemed in the circumstances do you think the two are separate your murder having no connection whatsoever with the planting of the listening equipment demanded robertson or from what youve so far discovered do you think they are linked in some way you know ill have to give a full account of this meeting to the directorgeneral said charlie determined against a bureaucratic misdemeanor suddenly biting him in the ass i accept that completely assured robertson ive already told smith what im asking you charlie doubted he had been as specific as that until now until you showed me those three new bugs and we both reached the same conclusion about the fsb having a source embedded within the embassy i was working on the assumptionan assumption so far without any positive proofthat the russian electricians were fsb opportunists not able to believe their luck at being called in by our idiot head of security with the permission of our equally idiotic diplomats but i had a problem with that assumption still do have a problem charlie nodded to the miniscule devices on the desk between them state of the art harry calls them thats what the fsb electricians who installed them would have been stateoftheart experts at their jobs and having installed them they wouldnt have left the electrics so fucked up that they continued to malfunction for the bugs to be found when harry and his team arrived charlie paused caught by an unprompted thought unless unless what demanded fish charlie waited for the conjecture to get firmer in his mind and when it did although not completely he said i dont at this moment fully see how this helps any assessment but how about the fsb technicians not having enough time to do all they wanted at their first opportunity so they do something to continue the problem expecting to be called in a second time to get a lot more devices into a lot more sites but then you arrive to investigate the murder the security idiots here know theyve broken the rules and they start doing things properly and call in harry and his team anticipated robertson smiling no rejected charlie refusing to be tricked into confirming the other mans conclusion the way i understand itand this can be checkedthe alert to london that brought harry here was sounded before i arrived he hesitated again unsure whether to continue but then asked you spoken to david halliday yet no said robertson hes told me hes been warning london for the past six months that theres virtually no internal security here said charlie check his log to see if he knew locals were being called in before they actually arrived to look at the problem and if it was another message from him when the cctv continued to malfunction afterward that brought harry here were throwing up some interesting hypotheses but you havent yet given me an answer to whether you believe our two investigations are linked or separate complained robertson throughout the discussion charlie had been sifting what he felt comfortable sharing with the other two men against the riskheightened now by the suspicion of the fsb having a source inside the embassyof either robertson or fish or both of them inadvertently saying something that would ruin his dangerously uncertain bluff cautiously charlie said i think there is a link whoever killed my man needed to sabotage the cctv systems to get in and out without being detected what about there being someone inside the embassythe molewho separately carried out the initial entry sabotage which doesnt give me any direction in which to work robertson continued to complain it does contradicted charlie at once until now until harry found the additional three bugs where he found themand we talked it throughyou didnt suspect there was a mole in the embassy now you do and wish i didnt said the counterintelligence director charlie didnt immediately access the london messages waiting for him in the communications room intent upon filing without any interfering distraction his own account to the directorgeneral of the meeting with robertson needing two drafts before being satisfied the writing and rewriting provided the opportunity for charlie to assess the impact upon his independent investigation of a potential fsb source within the building reassured at his eventual conclusion that it affected him very little hed neither used any compromised telephone connections nor taken anything out of the secure communications system in which he now sat looking up to ross perrit the communications controller charlie said who else has access to my eyes only password to london no one but you said perrit a vaguely mannered seemingly distracted man whom charlie knew to be anything but vague or distracted what about you perrit sighed although not offended i didnt give it to you remember you used your london password when you logged on from here and it was from london that you got your operational code i dont know what it is so no one here in this embassy not even you can read my traffic you got something specific something very specific you really want to ask me pointedly asked the no longer vague or distracted man abandoning whatever it was he had been doing at another computer terminal to walk over to charlies station he had accepted charlie betrayed his knowledge of a so far undisclosed doubleagent situation in exactly the same way as hed feared harry fish or paul robertson might have let slip anything he told them about the chicanery he was orchestrating i was just trying to resolve a question that suddenly came to me and now that youve got my undivided attention why dont you ask me the question and let me help you answer it challenged the man you just have avoided charlie i know the meaning of security belligerently reminded perrit its what im here for my misunderstanding retreated charlie lets not let things get out of proportion youre right said perrit lets not charlie was neither intimidated nor embarrassed by the confrontationrather he was encouraged at the confirmation of remaining out of dangerand his spirits lifted further when he finally opened his personal eyes only file from the london scientist all the false enhancement and manipulation hed asked for particularly on the cctv loops was both technically possible and technically undetectable it did though require the personal authority of the directorgeneral charlie looked up at the unexpected return of ross perrit who said without any explanation or preamble apart from indicating the single strut suspended doubly secure box within the communications room youve got booth two whos in booth one asked charlie instinctively perrit walked away pointedly not replying ive spoken to robertson announced the directorgeneral answering charlies question that perrit had just refused what the hells happening over there too many things all of them too quickly one after the other meaning demanded aubrey smith he usually had a soft neversurprised voice which charlie guessed was being stretched to the extreme the embassys being manipulated for a reason or reasons i dont at the moment understand replied charlie honestly you in any way compromised or endangered no assured charlie at once glad of the review time do you need backup no said charlie again the refusal more professional than selfprotective more people would mean more confusion which might well be one of the several intentions he hesitated on the subject of backup david halliday the mi man here is anxious to get involved he told me his director was approaching you directly to talk about it i dont like gerald monsford and certainly dont respect his judgement said smith he did approach me i told him no thank you said charlie i appreciate that but with so much dependent upon your total success im unsure if you can any longer operate alone i can insisted charlie im keeping open the option of sending in a team would i be in charge of it asked charlie desperately no refused the other man without any hesitation whats the point of all this youve asked the technical division to create to avoid being excluded by the russians claiming its their investigation in which we have no right of participation no agreed the softvoiced man at once we most definitely dont want that with everything else thats happening there technical say its got to have your personal approval itll be authorized the moment we conclude this conversation i dont like so much appearing to happen beyond our control you any idea the faintest suspicion who the traitor might be charlie was caught by the pedantically correct word finding whoever it is isnt my remit neither was it the point of my question not yet prevaricated charlie on this occasion more for selfprotection than strict professionalism how do i deal with it if i become suspicious the way youre being told right now only and directly through me i dont want another quiet exchange between you fish and robertson smith was invoking the most inviolable rule of doubleagent penetration charlie recognized slam shut every watertight door and not answer anyones knock i understand i hope you do i sent you there to do a job not to become a puppet the selfdirected anger at allowing himself to be sidetracked physically burned through charlie robertson had occupied the adjoining compartment ahead of his charlie acknowledged able to get his explanation and story in first but to whom charlie opened his mouth but stopped himself knowing to attempt a defense would be a further mistake ill call if theres something positive from what im doing im expecting you to said the other man charlie had subjugated his irritation at having made the cooperation mistake by the time he reached his rabbithutch office more curious at the first than at the second of the two voicemail messages awaiting him although choosing to respond to the second ive pressed the pathologist for more announced pavel liar thought charlie at once pavel was offering everything that had been originally available instead of the scraps the man had imagined he could get away with but it was looking promising and hes talking about some additional medical findings and theres a lot more photographs ill stop by the mortuary first thing tomorrow tempted charlie we could go together said pavel as charlie had expected we might as well go through it all together once again bullshit had proved to be the magic fertilizer how about my meeting you there at ten perfect timing for me agreed pavel what about the others who were there the first time pressed charlie wanting as much forewarning as possible ill let them all know the arrangement promised pavel i understand theres been contact between nikita kashev and your embassy i havent heard said charlie honestly and wouldnt have confirmed it if i had he thought it had been an unthinking question even from someone as anxious as the organized crime investigator how about your scientific people in london pavel pressed i havent heard anything from them either lied charlie deciding though that he should make a gesture he added ill drop by the embassy before i come to the mortuary to check if anything comes in overnight it would be good to hear something that takes the investigation forward it very definitely would thought charlie it would be premature to become overconfident from this very preliminary conversation but it looked as if hed kept himself on the inside of the investigation but in terms of practicality the inquiry hadnt moved a stumbling step from the finding of the body surprised to hear from you so soon after our dinner opened charlie finally responding to the other voice mail from bundy id welcome talking to someone whose experience and opinions i respect said bundy bollocks dismissed charlie been away too long myself to get up to speed yet you certainly hit the ground at a busy time maybe one that talking about on an openline telephone isnt such a good idea unless youre equipped with an intercept white noise cutout at your end bundy laughed youre not trying to tell me youre calling on a phone that hasnt been swept clean enough to shine in the dark im not but someone else already has decided charlie and it was all too easy to decide who that person was im still uncomfortable after an episode like this you wouldnt be on top of your job which you always have been if you werent more than uncomfortable overflattered the american we talked the other night about lunch how about it charlies instinctive inclination was to make an excuse just as quickly discarded charlie was as much a learneverything russophile as bill bundy and wanted very much to discover the reason for bundys inexplicable interest in him he was also anxious to get off the telephone and out of the embassy to make contact with natalia lunch would be good how about tomorrow the pekin on the ring road he now had bundys direct line to cancel if the mortuary visit went on longer than he expected one oclock unless i have to cry off i hope you dont cry off said the american to make what he judged the far more important call charlie used the same telephone kiosk farther along smolenskaya from which hed rearranged his dinner date with paulajane with whom he guessed he was going to have a confrontation the following day how about the botanical gardens he suggested when she answered he heardor hoped he heardher faint laugh at the venue the gardens with their huge cultivation greenhouses had been one of their tryst locations when hed first maneuverd the posting to moscow after learning of sashas existence how long will you need to be sure two hours should be more than enough said charlie knowing natalia wouldnt require the same amount of time to ensure she wasnt under surveillance he also knew that she would still take every precaution eight then accepted natalia the tropical plant greenhouse as always shed even remembered the specific meeting spot charlie recognized encouraged natalia was waiting on the seat hed expected partially hidden beneath an overshadowing cedar but with an unobstructed view of his approach to establish for herself that he was not under any surveillance this was whereand howshed expertly waited in those initial days that now seemed so long ago it had been summer then too and although it would have been impossible for it to have been the same one she was even wearing a matching light coat that charlie remembered her wearing then she would have seen him enter of course but she didnt look up from her book and charlie made no acknowledgement as he continued past to a seat closer to their chosen glassed exhibition hall where he sat and opened that days pravda his position gave natalia an even more extensive view from which surveillance could have been established if any pursuers entered through other gates charlie was sure there was no one after the precautions hed taken over the preceding two hours the moscow metro with its eight separate but interlinked peoplejammed underground lines was an espionage olympics training ground for trail clearing and that evening charlie had used it like the gold medalist he was hed been alert to everything and everyone around him when hed left the embassy deep within as big a departing group as he could find among which to hide himself from the remaining although slightly smaller media melee knowing there would still be fsb cameramen among the photographers he kept that danger in mind while making for the already identified telephone kiosk on smolenskaya although not suspicious of any suddenly slowing pedestrian or vehicle during his brief conversation with natalia he held back from descending immediately underground at a convenient smolenskaya metro station forcing himself onto kievskaya with growing protest from unexpectedly challenged feet he changed at barrikadnaya onto the innercity sixth tapansko line disembarking at tverskaya to change lines again allowing himself two stops until transferring to the kaluzskorizskaja route to go north he became uncomfortable with a bespectacled mustached man who stayed with him as far as turgenevskaya remaining on the train after the man disembarked and only got off himself at the warning of the doors closing to trap on the departing train anyone who might have worked an obligatory observation switch charlie went back and forth between two alternative lines once coming up to ground levelbefore going back down again after five lingering minutesat poljanka hed finally emerged at botanicheskiy sad with fifteen minutes to spare before his rendezvous with natalia sorefooted but confident he was alone it was an additional fifteen minutes before natalia finally got up from her bench and crossed to where he rose to meet her youre clear she said i know she was wearing her hair shorter but otherwise he didnt think shed changed at all you look wonderful you look like you she said smiling id like to kiss you do you have to ask im not sure do i im not sure either she turned her head as he came toward her offering her cheek we know were alone but i cant remember anywhere around here where we could move on to said charlie hurriedly he added a restaurant i mean i know what you mean theres a place on the next block ive never been there so i dont know what its like a discovery shed made clearing her own trail charlie guessed lets look at it it specialized in georgian cuisine already with enough people inside to recommend it and able to provide charlies choice of wine which he ordered the moment they secured a secluded table at the rear against an inner wall he also ordered chilled vodka with the beluga which they both appropriately chose before their fish natalia said you ordered caviar for me the first time we ate out i was trying to impress you then too it had been natalia whod taken the risk then agreeing to the outing while still officially debriefing him to confirm he was a genuine defector which he hadnt been living another professional lie as you are now nows a celebration of our being back together in the same city together she qualified heavily its a start youre rushing charlie theres a lot to talk about maybe too much for one night ive got as many nights as we need natalia made as if to speak but didnt then she said do you really know how long youll be here now it was charlie who hesitated itll be some time i didnt enjoy the botanical gardens routine natalia declared i didnt the first time i didnt imagine you would and wouldnt for all those nights we might need nor would sasha they both waited for their main fish courses to be served charlie considered a second bottle of wine but decided against it natalia had often complained of his drinking too much when the waiter left charlie said of course sasha wouldnt be involved in anything like tonight it just had to be this way to make contact and she asked laying down her knife and fork unnecessarily to show the importance of her question it was a protective demand she was justified in making not an investigative inquiry into what he was professionally involved a possibility at turgenevskaya i slipped it if indeed there was a watcher with me you hope you were the final cutoff check you know i arrived clean this wasnt evolving as hed expected natalia began eating again sasha called before i left shes enjoying herself the encounter wasnt working out as natalia had intended either charlie guessed what do you tell her about me about us that youre her father but that you have to work away doesnt she question that shes starting to there are other fathers of children in her class who work away but they come home sometimes she cant understand why you never do doesnt she remember me at all not really shes got all the toys and dolls you spoiled her with my meeting her nowbut then having eventually to go away againis going to confuse her even more isnt it said charlie objectively yes agreed natalia abandoning her meal altogether do you want me to meet her now this time asked charlie pushing his own plate aside youre her father who doesnt want to confuse her upset her any more than is happening now any more than i do echoed natalia shaking her head against charlies offer of more wine i cant live here again and its not primarily a question of my not wanting toalthough i dont as you knowbut the practicality of not being able to not anymore said charlie urgently the fsb are involved in what im doing here im identified to them now you wouldnt just be dismissed from the service if you and i were found out youd probably be arrested jailed id be expelled and wouldnt be able to take sasha with me shed end up in a state orphanage the answers what its always beenfor you to resign and come to london with me the question is who do you love more sasha and me or russia thats a cheap unfair question protested natalia only just managing to keep her voice under control its the practical one insisted charlie unrepentant do you think your service would let you go on working for them with me in london i doubt it its not important not anymore terrorism is the new buzzword with my backgroundas much of it as i would be able to disclose on a cvi could get work as an antiterrorist consultant like thatcharlie snapped his fingersat probably three times more money than im earning now and hate every minute of it predicted natalia i hate every minute of what im doing now said charlie having to control the loudness of his own voice i want to be with you and sasha more than i want to be in this fucking job it wasnt entirely true but it was close enough between assignments his existence was an aching aimlessness of pub closing times and reheated supermarket dinners for one in a vauxhall flat more resembling a monastic cell than a place in which to live the apartment would certainly have to go if he could finally convince natalia sasha would need a house with a garden and a good school and and everything that other normal families had whatever that was it isnt as easy or as simple as that isnt as easy or as simple as what demanded charlie you think you can appear from nowhere without any warning after five years and expect everything to be the same as it was with us charlie felt physically chilled no i dont think that at all neither looked directly at the other across the table grateful at the interruption of the waiter clearing their table charlie shook his head against their ordering any more asking for the bill instead natalia said ive got to go can i call you again i dont know im not sure we havent decided if i can see sasha we havent decided anything ill call not tomorrow when i dont know a couple of days it would be a mistake to ask why charlie decided he wasnt actually sure he wanted to know why a couple of days then ill leave first give me fifteen minutes i love you declared charlie a man to whom expressing emotion was always difficult i love you and i love sasha and i want us to be together fifteen minutes natalia repeated you know youre safe safe is what ive never been with you charlie and safe with you is all ive ever wanted to be safe with you and sasha charlies very determined effort to separate his personal from his professional confusions wasnt helped by the headtourniquet hangover from the previous nights consumption of islay single malt after hed got back to the hotel from his reunion with natalia the ache worsened by the eyewincing glare of the sun the moment he stepped outside his hotel to hail a taxi charlie who knew his every natural as well as carefully cultivated fault had never included being a fantasizer among them but thats what hed been he acknowledged accepting natalias accusation a headintheclouds fantasizer in imagining he could pitch up in moscow as he had and expect everything to be as it once had been between them so if it wasnt as simple and as easy as hed fantasized howexactlywas it he didnt know he was encouraged by her parting remark but unsettled at the thought of some hidden meaning behind her telling him their being together with sasha in london wasnt easy or simple was her remark so hidden though hardly the impossibility of their being together in moscow was entirely practicable for all the reasons hed spelled out to her what was not so easy in natalias mind was surely the mystical obstacle of abandoning russia which charlie had never been able to conceive as an obstacle no matter how many times theyd talked about it from so many different directions it had to be the suddenness of his being here charlie tried to reassure himself that and the botanical gardens reminder of how threatened their existence had once been wasnt that what shed actually saidsafe with you is all ive ever wanted to be it would all be differentbetterwhen they met the next time after shed had the opportunity to think everything through charlie had intentionally arrived at the mortuary thirty minutes ahead of the time hed arranged to meet sergei pavel wanting to talk alone with the pathologist but the organized crime detective was outside waiting so was mikhail guzov youre early guzovs smile combined satisfaction with a rebuke at charlie imagining he could outsmart him as you are charlie pointed out give the man all the rope he needs to tie himself up in knots thought charlie i think its impolite to keep people waiting so do i sparred charlie thank you for your courtesy guzovs smile faded im representing the ministry secretary kashev is occupied talking with your embassy why had guzov volunteered that probably to convey the impression of cooperation when he was offering virtually nothing which made the gesture hardly worth the effort apart from trying to establish his control of the gathering less likely to upset his stomach as his being here did last time so its just the three of us lets go in suggested pavel talking to charlie not the other russian vladimir ivanov was waiting in the postmortem room the body of the onearmed man already on the examination slab it had a ghostlike grayness from its refrigeration a faint mist from the rooms warmth wisping from the edges of the cloth in which it had been wrapped from the disinterested expectancy of the pathologists greeting charlie guessed guzov and pavel had already been into the room once that morning probably to check that he hadnt gotten there ahead of them youve found more to help us prompted charlie following ivanovs inquiring look to the fsb officer charlie caught the nod of permission from guzov he was curious at the fixed almost irritable expression on pavels face the pathologist said its for you to decide how much help it might be the body had thawed sufficiently for the man to raise slightly the remaining hand the fingertipsand therefore any printswere taken off with sulphuric acid i lifted traces from the thumb as well as each finger and see here the man isolated the little finger and that next to it both of which were roughly stitched after incisions i originally thought these distortions were contractions caused by exposure to extreme heat but when i found the acid traces i reexamined the hand much more closely in my opinion the disfigurement was caused by frostbite a long time ago possibly even when he was a child and this ivanov turned the back of the hand again i thought that was a heat burn but it isnt its a strawberry birthmark thats been made darker by an acid splash maybe when he was flailing against the acid being applied to his fingertips unquestionably tortured broke in charlie including guzov in the remark more in challenge to the official casualness of the first dismissive examination than for confirmation of his own early judgment remembering his earlier torture oversight he saw that the fingernails of the right hand were intact but turned brown by the acid without any doubt agreed the pathologist detecting the possible criticism he added i suggested the possibility when we met before neither guzov nor pavel reacted and we have much more now to help with an identification persisted charlie i wouldnt exactly say much more disputed pavel briskly actually turning as he gestured toward the door guzov said ive had a room made available for us where we can talk about the london findings far too anxious decided charlie ignoring the invitation nodding toward the body and an obvious abdominal incision charlie said to the pathologist there was nothing in your first report of stomach contents a partially digested meal eaten maybe an hour to an hour and a half before he died replied ivanov at once possible to analyze ivanov nodded i dont think it would have been normally there was some in the gullet as if it was being expelled i think he died as he was about to vomit from the agony of what was being done to him i recovered ground beef and some bread residue id say hed eaten a hamburger there was also some liquid mixed with the ort with a high sugar content which id say came from a cola mcdonalds is very popular here in moscow offered pavel and our victim wore cheap clothes and shoes so a man with a limited income would eat in a fastfood outlet wouldnt he said charlie familiar with the menu from his own london diet eaten more for disinterested convenience than economy going back to the pathologist charlie said there is another thing i need to establish your first report didnt give a blood grouping its in the addendum said ivanov defensively picking up and letting drop the manila folder at the bottom of the slab its ab charlie nodded head momentarily forward on his chest of course it is what exclaimed pavel frowning its what the british forensic people recovered from the separate soil samples from the area we examined charlie lied five minutes earlier he hadnt even thought of the need to match the russian blood findings we really do need to hear what youve got to tell us insisted guzov the earlier bombast weakening as we really do need to examine one thing at a time argued charlie instantly registering pavels apparent smile of approval at the confrontation what about toxicology also in the report sighed ivanov tapping the folder theres evidence of barbitumiv acid in the blood how concentrated demanded charlie identifying another russianconvincing bonus weak not barbiturates of anaesthetic strength definitely not is that what your toxicologists found asked ivanov making it even easier for charlies improvisation they wouldnt positively commit themselves tiptoed charlie cautiously my impression from the conversation was that it was a little stronger than sedative level id go along with that agreed the pathologist are you saying this man was sedated before he was tortured demanded guzov too eager again charlie was almost too eager himself to put the russian down but held back for the pathologist no of course not rejected the doctor careless of the obvious exasperation whoever did what they did to him certainly didnt want to spare him pain picked up charlie its an outside guess that his killers used sleeping pills or draughts to sedate him after the torture to get him into the embassy grounds without risking an alarm once the cctv was out of action it was too faint for that argued ivanov its a sleeping preparation i called it an outside guess reminded charlie an escape route prepared having established far more than hed hoped charlie turned to guzov and said why dont we talk things through now putting the impending exchange very firmly under his not guzovs control the room was a marginal improvement upon what charlie had at the british embassy but it would have required a micrometer to measure that margin at least the smell of formaldehyde and disinfectant was less and his success in reversing how guzov had clearly intended their meeting to go had done a lot to ease the tightening alcoholic band around charlies head in fact there was hardly any ache troubling him any longer determined to build upon what he had already achieved and using his newly acquired folder as a prompt charlie said at once this has been an extremely useful confirming discussion our respective scientists have positively but independently matched the blood as well as the barbitumiv content within the victims body there has been a very calculated and wellplanned attempt to conceal the identity not just upon the body but by cutting all the labels from the clothing as well as emptying its pockets he looked between the two russians refusing to accord seniority to guzov london believes there could be a lot more discovered from the clothes and so far we havent discussed them im told forensically they could be far more productive providing dust fibers hair other than that of the victim under detailed analysis ive been asked formally to request that everything the man was wearing be made available to london when your detailed examination is concluded so that we can continue the cooperation that were enjoying now lets stop right there halted a now very redfaced guzov unable any longer to contain the indignation at being so completely steamrollered what cooperation so far everything has come from us nothing from you i do not know anything about cooperation being agreed and i thought i had explained my operational difficulty very clearly and fully blocked charlie in turn and understood from what you told me earlier today that secretary kashev was currently involved in trying to resolve that difficulty until which time and until there is some reciprocity from your side i do not consider a case for cooperation has been established or agreed hardball or softball somewhere in between charlie decided you also told me this morning that you were representing your ministry is the view you have expressed that of your ministry if it is then it is obviously a matter i shall have to raise with london i am talking of the lack of reciprocity the man backed off which wasnt an answer to his question but certainly was to guzovs bombast thought charlie i find myself at a loss to know how to continue this conversation i believed i had made very clear the matching medical findings i shall be able to provide from london as well as the cctv enhancements that we talked about at the meeting at petrovka were at a stalemate here i am sure it is something that can be resolved although perhaps not today came in pavel whose irritable looks at the other russian as well as annoyed shifting in his seat charlie had been aware of during his exchange with guzov i would certainly hope so as soon as possible said charlie hed achieved everything and more than hed hoped and there was still time to keep the luncheon appointment with bill bundy he hoped hed do as well there too it was virtually instinctive for charlie to check for unwelcome company particularly when he was on foreign assignment and after that mornings confrontation with mikhail guzov charlie ratcheted up the concentration not going directly to the pekin but taking the taxi by a roundabout route to the arbat shopping area and holding it while he briefly toured the stalls and outlets ready actually to buy something for natalia or sasha if anything caught his eye nothing did but a small bmw hed isolated close to the mortuary continued three cars behind when the taxi moved off again the detour and the traffic buildup on the freeway delayed his arrival and bundy was at their table mineral water already poured by the time charlie got there bad traffic apologized charlie just got here myself said the american which charlie doubted guessing someone as old school as bundy would have given himself at least an hour to clear his trail although not a hairofthedog advocate charlie decided the success of his morningand the gradual settling of his stomachjustified a preprandial vodka raising it to the other man in a toast charlie said to the death of all our enemies difficult to pick them all out these days dont you think charlie i guess white hats against black hats or vice versa was easier encouraged charlie relaxing back in his chair like a confident boxer before the first round i think its more interesting now in many ways hows that take your reason for being here youve got to admit we never had anything like this right in our own front garden in the old days youre talking about the murder at the embassy right asked charlie unable to find a connection to what bundy appeared to consider logic what the hell else do you think im talking about i dont recall telling you thats what im here for fenced charlie the american spread his hands in front of him as if he were pleading charlie its me bill bundy remember weve been here since the beginning know all the tricks difficult to remember them all sometimes said charlie refusing to contribute to whatever the other man was trying to establish its true insisted bundy but if you tell me youre here for something else then ill take it youve got another agenda you cant tell me about bill exclaimed charlie were not running a joint operation here maybe i could provide some input and maybe get burned in the effort ive always thought myself pretty fireproof im not refused charlie he found this entire exchange absolutely bewildering except for one thought bundy could be a convenient sacrificial escape if the need arose theres a nostalgia about the murder dont you think persisted the american guy gets whacked at the moment of his defection is that how you think it happened queried charlie remembering some of the newspaper conjecture id give the idea some room to run how do you see it the waitresss arrival spared charlies need for an instant reply although he didnt need time to consider one he was enjoying the verbal pingpong the vaguest idea of its purpose forming in his mind but in no hurry to confirm it in deference to the abuse hed inflicted upon himself the previous night charlie restricted himself to pancakewrapped duck crispy beef and spicy noodles with boiled rice and a bottle of rice wine despite bundys protests that he wouldnt share the alcohol so how do you see it repeated bundy when the girl left im keeping an open mind everythings at a very early stage still a lot of technical and scientific stuff to be analyzed and assessed so you are here for the murder openly demanded the american its not carved in stone avoided charlie there seems to be a lot else happening things good with the local homicide guys theres some diplomatic protocol to work through you know what its like not helped by your guys finding a big bunch of bugs nesting right there in the ambassadors phone system not helped one little bit agreed charlie without pausing at the alarm bells that rang in his mind surprised you dont have help pressed bundy something as serious as this with the bugging on top strikes me as a heavy workload im just about keeping a handle on it claimed charlie hoping his voice conveyed the conviction he didnt feel at that moment ive still got a few open lines here you wanna bounce anything off me feel free charlie needed his control to hold back his surprise at that remark thats very good of you maybe its jealousy at everything happening on your patch and nothing on mine charlie recognized the perfect opening i got the impression that you guys were very much caught up with the new presidential elections here i guess your political section was too until last week said bundy you keeping out of it asked charlie risking directness himself tex has been keeping a tight watching brief you would have been on station here the first time when lvov was with the kgb right demanded charlie direct again right i was here in moscow agreed bundy stepan grigorevich lvov was in charge of st petersburg its a long way away and i got moved to cairo after about six months so i didnt do much but add him to the list of known kgb personnel you run a file on him we knew who he was basic biog stuff wish we had managed more now that hes emerged to be the rising star and promised friend of the west the american shrugged expansively but there it is all down to the political analysts now their food arrived charlie couldnt remember the last time hed ever knowingly helped another foreign country intelligence agent he trusted as little as he trusted bundy predictably for someone who never drank anything but mineral water bundy had ordered the blandest possible food steamcooked vegetables scallops and bean curd you want to try anything of mine go ahead invited charlie wondering why someone who ate like an invalid suggested such a restaurant in the first place im okay but thanks refused the man measuring out his water you keep in touch like this with paulajane and halliday not on a regular basis pjs a cute kid tex seems to think so risked charlie the guys thought very highly of back at langley said bundy cleverly choosing an alternative gossip from that offered by charlie i knew pjs daddy davy venables was a very formidable operator you ever come across him in london charlie shook his head tipping the last of his wine into his glass eager to get back to the embassy to set up everything he now knew he needed london to arrange its been a good meal lets do it again my treat next time ill keep you up to that said bundy its good to talk to someone whos been around the block a few times ive got your number said charlie enjoying his own double entendre confident hed got more from the encounter than the other man charlie didnt detect the already identified bmw until just before his taxi turned onto the embankment it continued straight on over the kalininskaya bridge sure of his destination which wasnt good or proper tradecraft charlie recognized curiously but there was so much else that had been unexpected during the meeting with the american so much that it was going to take time to interpret whatever its purpose had been its taken long enough for you to talk to me complained jack smethwick the director of the agencys technical and scientific division in london the moment they were connected wanted to make sure i had as much as possible before bothering you said charlie soothingly hed forgotten the mans almost perpetual irritation i hope you have so do i said charlie from the secure strutsupported compartment in the communications room and i want to get some things clear in my mind that might make a change lets talk about the loop which is most important said charlie refusing an argument cant the fact that its computersimulated be scientifically detected by the russians if it could be i wouldnt have done it this way said smethwick the loop will be clearly marked as a copy of the supposed original which weve enhanced here its perfect so precise was the technical clarity of the line that charlie could hear the noise of other people working in the mi laboratory on the northern outskirts of london it was another affectation of the scientific director to take phone calls standing up at a laboratory bench rather than in his separate more confidential office three men looking to be close around a fourth head bowed as if hes being forced along thats what you asked for reminded the scientist curtly weve put a woolen ski cap on the shortest of the three representing the assassins another seems to be wearing an anorak with the hood up it opens with a lot of broken zigzagging film the figures scarcely identifiable through the interrupting tearing that tearing briefly stops but its very hazy and of course the lights very bad it looks as if they were picked up after theyve come into the grounds off the embankment from the photographs of the official opening weve superimposed with sufficient clarity for it to be positively identified the ornamental hedge by the exhibition hall none of the figures is fully framed leaving the height to be estimated although the dead man is close to being accurate from the calculations weve been able to make from the russian mortuary photographs the man stopped have you shipped me the new set of photographs you picked up today in tonights diplomatic bag along with the updated medical report promised charlie the ab blood grouping is listed there too and the note about the barbitumiv traces im not comfortable about that complained smethwick sure we can mix some ab blood with the soil samples youve already sent us from the flowerbed area but what if they do a dna typing it wont match what theyve got and your great big scam will be blown skyhigh charlie hadnt needed the reminder of the weakest part of what he was trying to set up they wouldnt give me the clothes for me to give you a match but theres nothing in their medical reports of their having taken dna which doesnt mean they havent typed it dismissed the scientist dna is the first of any blood tests these days it would certainly be for me in these particular circumstances its a gamble ive got to take admitted charlie you wont forget to mix in some of the soil fertilizer i sent back with the soil smethwicks pained sigh was audible of course i wont forget to mix it in weve already tested some of what you provided and found a previous residue but the fertilizer wont affect dna im taking the gamble repeated charlie what about the makarov mm shell it will test to be russian if moscow runs a metal comparison assured the man we put a cross in the tip as they did with the bullet that killed your man and took most of the slow down wadding out of the butt before backing a steel sheet against which we split it with kevlar all traces of which weve taken off the fragment youre going to claim came from your hole in the ground i think weve got enough to convince them said charlie forcing the confidence he didnt fully feel i dont disputed smethwick i think itll be exposed for the nonsense it is and actually create what could escalate into an official diplomatic incident in an embassy that has got too many already and because i think that im filing to the directorgeneral my officially recorded written objection to what he ordered me to do for you thanks for doing it despite how you feel everything youve asked for will be back to you in a couple of days guaranteed smethwick and comes with the best of luck youre going to need it charlie already knew that but smethwicks dismissal deflated charlies usual optimism his hope lay in his belief that he had sufficiently convinced the russianspavel perhaps more than guzov but if that hope was misplaced smethwicks doomsday prediction could become a reality and with it his exposure and immediate recalleven expulsionback to england before any possible conclusion between himself and natalia there were no voicemail messages on the rabbit hutch telephone but on the card table there was a twoword note from paulajane drop by ive been censured she announced at once not smiling up at his entry im not sure yet if its going to become official from london or stop here i was two hours in front of paulfuckingrobertson and his inquiry team this afternoon like a child whod done something wrong a role for which charlie strongly suspected she might qualify censured for what not going over everybodys head here in moscow to alert london about the security chaos appears that hallidays been doing so for months why didnt you im just past my first year on my first foreign station sotleys fiftyfive years old a senior ambassador dawkins served in rome canberra and berlin before coming here do you think i was going to risk a career that hasnt even started by taking them on even if id recognized how bad things were which i didnt not properly until all the shit happened at once there was a catch in her voice that charlie feared might be a prelude to tears you heard the other news what sotley and dawkins have been recalled today as quietly as possible the public announcement isnt going to be made from london until tomorrow by which time theyll be under wraps peter maidment the chef du protocole is going to stand in until there is a proper replacement was there proof against either man of being the inside source wondered charlie paulajane was very definitely the wrong person to ask instead he said whats maidment like bit of a dreamer assessed the woman passed over too many times for promotion until now and this isnt permanent i feel sorry for him he tries but cant sustain the momentum was he involved with the discovery of the body asked charlie hopefully never saw him there dismissed paulajane timing the announcement charlie said i had lunch with bill bundy today i remember him suggesting it said paulajane he knew a bug had been found in the ambassadors personal telephone which hasnt been publicly disclosed paulajane remained looking up at charlie but said nothing and he knew my temporarily assigned direct number here at the embassy thats how he got in touch by leaving a callback message i told him she blurted he called me the night after we all had dinner together i didnt think i was doing anything wrong as you two appeared to go back a long time but i didnt tell him anything about a bug being in the ambassadors telephone because until you just told me i didnt know exactly where it had been found you do believe me dont you im trying very hard said charlie in addition to paul robertson and harry fish there were two other men and a matronly grayhaired womanto none of whom there was any formal introductionwhen charlie gained entry into the inquiry room by insisting his need to speak to them was urgent there were also two technicians to one side of the room clearly supervising an equipment bank including a polygraph machine and its adjoining cablefestooned chair this is surprisingly unexpected greeted robertson particularly as i personally understood from the directorgeneral that we were absolutely forbidden any further contact from the tone of the other mans voice charlie guessed that robertson had been equally rebuked for their earlier encounter he looked sideways to the equipment setup and said is this being recorded of course visually as well as audibly confirmed robertson has your coming here been authorized by london no said charlie further reassured by the mans obvious concern then i dont intend allowing it to continue refused robertson and i dont want to be part of it either insisted harry fish please leave the room said robertson nodding to the recording equipment charlie said its my ass in the air everythings being doubly recorded so none of you are endangered youre here to expose and arrest an inside source and i think i know who that source is you still want me to leave i will your choice being visually and audibly recorded as you make it the unknown man to robertsons right came quickly sideways for a whispered exchange which concluded with a nod of permission for the man to leave the room coming back to charlie robertson said well hear what you have to tell us but not with me participating refused fish rising to follow the other departing man the hurriedly leaving investigator was on his way to speak to london charlie knew fish probably intended to cover his ass too deciding that he needed belatedly as much professional protection as possible charlie said my instructions from london personally from the directorgeneral were not to discuss with you anything concerning the investigation in which i am involved nothing i intend to tell you reflects in any way whatsoever upon that is that understood and accepted were waiting to hear what you have to tell us said robertson and im waiting to hear the answer to my question returned charlie hoping he wasnt coloring as obviously as the equally furious robertson robertson shifted in his chair but didnt speak and charlie stood shrugging your choice and you blew it ill tell the directorgeneral and he can tell you and well all keep our fingers crossed that nothing else goes wrong while you piss about wait called robertson when charlie was almost at the door we understand what youve said that nothing youre going to tell us will compromise your purpose here charlie took his time walking to the seat and settling himself robertsons face remained puce the anonymous woman had colored too charlie said a few nights ago i went out socially with people from the american embassy accompanying paulajane venables one of the americans was william bundy an acknowledged cia expert on russian affairs who has been reassigned here for a third tour of duty after running the agencys russian desk for a number of years i was on station here during one of his earlier assignments during that period we knew each other but were never friends nor did we liaise operationally in any way whatsoever the most recent evening ended with bundy suggesting that he and i get together while i was here no arrangements were made the following day a voicemail message from bundy was left upon the temporary telephone number allocated to me here at the embassy i had not given bundy that number i responded to bundys call we lunched yesterday during that lunch bundy made a remark about listening devices having been installed within the telephone systems of the ambassador to my understanding no mention has been made in the media coverage either in english american or russian newspapers of the precise location of any of the devices that were discovered by harry and his team charlie paused at the reentry into the room of the man whod left after his earlier whispered conversation with robertson and didnt continue until after another handshielded exchange between the two men when i returned from that lunch i confronted paulajane venables about the disclosure of my telephone number and of the undisclosed location of the bugs she admitted providing my number but categorically denied passing on anything about the listening devices insisting she didnt know where they were placed i know she has already appeared before you i consider that from the conversation i have just recounted there is sufficient cause for her recall and reexamination before you an echoing silence descended upon the room it lasted several full minutes before robertson said you believe paulajane venables to be the traitorous source within this embassy i believe the indiscretion that i have personally experienced justifies her being questioned further replied charlie apart from harry and me and a very limited number you were one of the few to know about the devices reminded the other man the threat churned through charlie he said perhaps you should take that remark further we intend to said the same panel member you are to go at once to the communications room to speak personally to the directorgeneral the man indicated the recording assembly at the side of the room he will instruct you leaving no doubt of the authority to return here to undergo a polygraph test to establish the truth of what you have just told this committee and to eliminate you from the investigation in which we are currently engaged a polygraph test that your colleague paulajane venables underwent yesterday and passed to the complete satisfaction of the technical examiners and the members of this panel completed robertson how the hell can i be involved in things that happened before i even arrived here demanded charlie so angry was he that charlie failed to detect the approach of the outside office guardian until the man was behind him shall we go sir charlie muffin was the foremost exponent of the credo never to panic but he found rational thinking difficult as he was humiliatingly escorted along linking corridors to the basement descent he managed itjustprecisely because of his need to keep the secret that no one could learn charlie knew all about lie detector tests he hoped that he could remember how to defeat the supposedly undefeatable machine that distinguishes lie from truth by measuring breathing rate pulse and perspiration flow robertsons investigation was restricted solely to uncovering a traitor within the embassy which should keep the questioning well away from anything risking natalia but would it couldnt he by the strictest interpretation of the word be regarded a traitor secretly married as he was to a senior analyst in the russian federations internal counterintelligence organization not if he were able to argue semantics but he wouldnt be restricted to yes or no what the fuck were the rules the protection from being exposed by the machine remain calm allow no anger or agitation he remembered easy enough adviceeasily followed advicein a simulated situation where there was no anger or agitation the total opposite from how he felt now keep what is not to be disclosed firmly out of mind charlie further recalled hed thought that particular mantra a complete load of bollocks at the longago training school and hadnt changed his mind since the unsympathetic ross perrit was waiting expectantly among all his electronic paraphernalia the door to the first cubicle in the supported box already open the dgs waiting on the line what the hells going on demanded smith the moment charlie identified himself i tried to report things i believed relevant to robertsons inquiry things that had no bearing upon what im doing here from the tone of the directorgenerals unusually harsh voice charlie decided that the prevailing political wind was blowing slap into his face what things the man listened without interruption to what charlie had earlier told the inquiry panel and did not speak for several moments after charlie finished then smith said venables underwent a polygraph examination there were no difficulties i know but at the time the panel was unaware of bundys knowledge of where the listening devices were found the examiner wouldnt have been prompted to ask her she was specifically asked about her associations with the americans disclosed smith a liaison was suspected with a married cia officer john probert charlie felt the first stirrings of unease and i told you said the man irritably she passed the polygraph without any doubts arising who suspected the liaison with probert youve interfered in something from which i categorically barred you refused smith all ive got so far as the result of your being in moscow are official complaints from the forensics and technical divisions being asked to manufacture evidence that can be exposed as fake with a schoolboy science kit weve discussed the need for what i want reminded charlie you cause any more public embarrassment by what youre doing this will be your last assignment you hear what im saying i hear said charlie i also hear that i have got to undergo a polygraph myself its been requested i wasnt even in moscow when the listening devices were installed and the electrical system was sabotaged everyone attached to the embassy has to undergo a polygraph test until the apparent inside source is found even you pointless though it will be another indication that smith was accepting defeat in his battle to retain the directorship of mi from the internal maneuverings of jeffrey smale if i dont answer a question honestlywhich i might not be able to do if i think it impinges upon my function which youve ordered me not to discuss with anyone there will be a reading indicating that i am lying charlie resisted desperately that will be taken into consideration of course assured the other man and robertsons people have been told that no questions should be phrased that might lead to that particular conflict of interest he had a possible escape charlie recognized but the uncertainties were too many and too great this was probably going to be the biggest test ever to discover if he were as smart as the smartass hed always prided himself upon being ill get back to you hopefully with something worthwhile from what youre there to do for which i seem to be asking every time we talk let me explain the procedure managed a polygraph technician before charlie broke in i know the procedure arm cuff chest strap and handpalm sensors only yes or no answers and the first question is usually whether i masturbate to which everyone says they dont and gets a lie reading that proves the machine is working properly so my answer is i did a lot once when i was younger but not so much now the technician didnt look up from attaching the band around charlies chest that comfortable fine its better if you relax and dont let yourself get uptight i know the inquiry panel had all left the room by the time charlie returned leaving him alone with the two technicians the one whom charlie guessed to be the questioner was sitting facing him going through a list of questions on a clipboard while his colleague hooked charlie up to the machine which was between him and the questioner positioned so that it would be impossible for charlie to see any movement or to register from the attached computerscreen tracing its peaks and troughs charlie wondered where the film and audio apparatus was among everything else you ready asked the questioner looking up from his clipboard he wore a woolen sweater beneath a tightly buttoned jacket and had a spare pen in a special holder on his clipboard when you are he had to find a way out an explanation for the inevitable spike that would show up a lie is your name charles edward muffin yes are you an operative of an organization known as mi britains internal counterintelligence agency he had reason for the wrong answer charlie realized no there was a pause from the questioner do you tell lies yes how would that be recorded wondered charlie the wisp of an idea threading its way into his mind was your previous answer a lie no there was another hesitation do you lie to your superiors yes charlie believed he could see an escape actually available to him by the oneword answer restrictions are you an honest man no that had to show as a truthful response are you proud of what you do yes charlie decided he was confusing the questioner which was precisely what he wanted to do have you ever come into contact with or had dealings with members of a foreign intelligence service yes he wasnt endangered by the question that could have encompassed natalia have you ever cooperated with a member of a foreign intelligence service yes the technician shifted awkwardly in his facing chair have you cooperated with a member of a foreign intelligence agency within the last month yes he hoped to christ it worked have you ever betrayed your country to a foreign intelligence service or agent no have you ever accepted money financial rewards or any benefit in kind from a member of a foreign intelligence agency yes are you aware of listening devices bugs being installed within this embassy there was impatience in the mans voice now yes did you have any prior knowledge of those devices being installed in this embassy before they were discovered no have you any knowledge of how those devices were installed in this embassy yes have you kept that knowledge from your superiors no the questioner was visibly flushed suspecting he was being mocked charlie was surprised it had been so easy do you believe there to be an informant to a foreign intelligence agency within this embassy yes do you know who that informant is no have you ever served a term of imprisonment yes were you guilty of the crime for which you served that term of imprisonment no were you subsequently pardoned no the other mans exasperation was palpable do you regard this polygraph examination as a joke no what about remaining relaxed and not getting upright reflected charlie noting the frown toward the questioner from the man whod attached him to the sensors has every answer you have given been an honest one insisted the questioner close to a repeat of an earlier demand he was rattled to buggery which would show on the tracing replay of the computer tracing charlie knew yes enough decided the questioner abruptly snapping off the machine nodding to the other technician to disconnect charlie from the sensors that was ridiculous what are you talking about asked charlie in feigned surprise you know damned well what im talking about you were taking the piss from start to finish i was doing nothing of the sort denied charlie i cant wait to hear the reaction of the panel neither can i said charlie which was another honest response he only had to wait thirty minutes for his escorted recalltwo men this time the first indication of what was to comefrom his tiny office knowing the reception to expect the moment he crossed the threshold of the inquiry room the panel sat with what had to be individual printouts of the polygraph before them there were separate sheets of paper with what charlie hoped to be copies of the questions to which hed responded there were matching sets of paper before the questioner and his associate the escort who had accompanied him to the communications room actually took charlie by the arm to put him very firmly into the waiting chair he and his companion stationed themselves directly behind charlie one on either side charlie turned to them smiling and said dont worry guys i cant do a runner with the flat feet i suffer from he wasnt suffering any discomfort at that moment which was a good omen so the cabaret continues commented robertson im sorry questioned charlie have you the slightest idea what youre doing behaving like this the slightest idea whats going to happen to you id appreciate your telling me you are being taken under escort immediately back to london announced robertson disciplinary proceedings are already being formulated upon the basis of your ridiculous polygraph performance each and every aspect of which has already been communicated personally to the directorgeneral together with my recommendation that it be treated with the utmost severity recorded on that recommendation is my personal assessment that you can no longer be considered for any employment within the service from which you should be dismissed after the most intensive investigation to discover the damage you have caused in the past you are a disgrace to be treated as such gosh said charlie not believing it possible for the furious mans face to get any redder which it did that completely absurd contemptuous remark confirms every assessment this panel and the polygraph team has already arrived at that you are suffering some mental illness making it necessary for you to be put into protective care declared robertson have you sent that assessment to the directorgeneral along with everything else asked charlie coming forward in his chair conscious as he did so of the two guards behind him coming restrainingly forward this examination is over said robertson there is no need or purpose for any further conversation someone has already gone to the savoy hotel to pay your bill and collect your belongings you are booked together with the two escorts who will accompany you on a plane leaving for london in three hours we would like you now to leave for the transport that has already been arranged for you he was a whisker too close to leaving it too late charlie recognized waitand listenfor a moment longer if i am taken back to london today the careers of each and every one of youhe turned to include the polygraph duowill be over i am astonished at your collective ineptitude which might still end your careers which it shouldhe included the polygraph operators againthe most inept of which has been your analysis of my examination this is madness said robertson yours is the madness if you dont hear me out retorted charlie relieved at the shifts and sideways exchanges among some of the panel confronting him culminating in another whispered conversation between robertson and the messenger next to him robertson said all of this is being recorded which saves me asking the question to ensure that it is said charlie and guarantees that i have a complete untouched copy of every word that has so far been spoken and everything that follows upon which i am insisting what do you want to say demanded robertson you each have the questionbyquestion analysis of the polygraph examination together i hope with the transcript of the voice recording i do not because i dont believe i shall need it but if i omit anything please question me about it when i finish saying what i have to say okay robertson nodded refusing a spoken acknowledgment charlie inhaled a deep breath knowing he was going to need it i denied being a serving officer in mi because denial is the inviolable rule never to be broken under the severest pressure even torture i do tell lies it is an essential necessity in my professional life as it is now if i am to succeed in remaining part of the investigation with which i am entrusted and which i did in answer to the question of whether i lie to my superiors you paul robertson are my superior both by seniority and grade i am under the strictest orders from our directorgeneral not to discuss anything involving my separate investigation if there was not this ridiculous insistence upon yes or no answers i would not have replied yes to that question i would have replied that i lie to my superiors when necessary if i lie i am not by definition an honest man but my answer to that specific question was honest if you examine it properly and yes i am proud of what i do lying and deceitful and deceptive though it is and how i have to be because i believe that ultimatelyalthough perhaps not alwaysit is for the common good not bad charlie had to stop both breathless and dry mouthed wishing hed asked for water before hed started to talk there was no offer of any from anyone in the room have i come into contact with foreign intelligence agents of course i have i had dinner with american cia personnel this week i believe one of the russians with whom i am now in contact belongs to the russian fsb by a strict definition of a yes or no answer i am cooperating with him and have cooperated with others many times in the past but always dishonestly on my part to achieve whatever my objective has been in doing so yes if i have to answer yes or no i received money and accommodation and rewards from the former kgb i was a supposed defector who escaped from wormwood scrubs with a known and legally convicted british traitor to discover his secrets which i did but because the sentence that got me into prison was phony i never got pardoned i was aware of listening devices being planted in this embassy because you mr robertson told me when we agreed it indicated an inside source i do not know who that source is i thought i did which was why i appeared before all of you earlier today but when i spoke to the directorgeneral he assured me that paulajane venables has been exonerated from any culpability drawing to the end of his uninterrupted diatribe charlie once again turned to the now tightfaced technicians and no i do not regard a polygraph examination as a joke although i might wonder about todays particular operation of it and the complete misconception that has been drawn from it the yes or no restrictions allow grossly misleading readings to be drawn as they were in this case no one spoke when charlie fell silent but there was a lot of headturning looks back and forth among the panel as each sought someone who would spare robertsons very obvious discomfort when no one else volunteered robertson said i think we need time to consider our responses so i must ask you to withdraw again before i do leave the room i need to have my own copy of everything that has been said during this session to submit in its entirety to the directorgeneral in london while you reconsider we resent the inference of that demand said robertson as i resent much more deeply what i have been subjected to said charlie and while youre discussing things it might be an idea to have my things returned to the hotel and for another room to be reserved for me that had been too smartass acknowledged charlie in immediate regret while charlie didnt go as far as conceding it to be a pyrrhic victory he didnt expect a christmas card from anyone on paul robertsons investigation team and even less from the directorgeneral aubrey smiths acceptance of charlies defense had been begrudging in the extreme tempered with accusations of arrogance insubordination and camera posturing with a repeated warning that charlies future employment depended on results that had been too long in coming apart from all of which charlie consoled himself hed survived charlie encountered david halliday on his way from smiths tirade to check his voice mail his mind equally split between doing something as quickly as possible to impress the distinctly unimpressed directorgeneral and making the promised contact with natalia you looked outside greeted the mi officer ive been so long underground im not sure if its day or night said charlie then youre in need of a reviver even though its not yet midday said the man jerking his head back toward his own quarters i duplicated your islay single malt order and im glad i did charlie gratefully followed welcoming the drink and the familiar death to our enemies toast halliday said were virtually under siege since the london announcement of sotley and dawkinss recall reg stout says his outside guards estimate the media mob at more than fifty stouts still on duty queried charlie surprised apparently he took the nazi defense of strictly obeying orders thats neither a defense nor an excuse which ive been telling london for months was it you that finally got things moving asked charlie openly id like to think so but for anyone in london finally to admit it would be to concede that theyd been hibernating wouldnt it you going to argue against stout remaining on station pressed charlie accepting a top up from the offered bottle specifying names could risk a libel or slander accusation said halliday charlie didnt believe it could but he was more interested in pursuing the conversation than in challenging it you been before robertsons inquisition pj got a mauling apparently seems to be pissed off with me for not telling her i was ringing alarm bells you didnt answer my question halliday smiled at charlies persistence underwent the whole yes or no shebang survived without losing a single fingernail or crushed testicle so whos whispering all the secrets halliday shrugged how do i know all i do know is that this embassy has been wide open to any sort of infiltration for months against which how about the finding of the listening devices where they were being a complete coincidence the fsb gets a chance they cant believe and are doubly lucky when their guys hit all the right places entirely by accident you believe in that sort of coincidence no admitted halliday im just pointing out that lucky coincidences sometimes happen like miracles what about paulajane said charlie consciously ignoring every london edict what about her she have any bother halliday smiled knowingly what have you heard i havent heard anything denied charlie you told me you came out smelling of roses but she was pissed off just wondered if things went badly for her this is her first posting after all halliday shrugged again she didnt go back on the same plane as sotley and dawkins so i guess shes okay she didnt tell me anything specific apart from getting a bollocking about lack of earlier warning but lets face it thats not her function here the man offered the bottle again charlie who disagreed with that assessment shook his head in refusal still got things to do hows it going slowly my offer still stands im not exactly overstretched and you know my director is more than willing to get me involved which was what bundy had said remembered charlie he could set up a sideline business selling tickets londons orders are to keep everything strictly compartmented certainly until robertsons inquiry is resolved the bastards in london expect too much from ground soldiers like you and me sympathized halliday the slightest of slurs to his words things go right they get the glory things go wrong we get the shit why was it charlie asked himself as he made his way along the corridor that he still didnt like halliday even though he was now serving islay single malt charlie wasnt surprised to find his roughly packed suitcases tossed carelessly into his office nor to be told when he called the savoy hotel that no new reservation had been made for him charlie took the offered suite all that was available when he was told his original room was no longer vacant his initial amusement at wondering what innocent conversations the fsb was going to hear from its new occupant became serious at the realization that until guzov learned of the change hed probably have an untapped telephone line there was one call on his voicemail register but when he accessed it there was no message just the click of a telephone being replaced it wouldnt he knew be natalia he called sergei pavels personal number at petrovka but got no reply and matched his unknown caller by deciding not to leave a message knowing that no local taxis were permitted within the embassy grounds and with no intention of making himself the focus of the waiting photographers by leaving the embassy like a refugee carrying his possessions on his back charlie called the transport office for an embassy car and wasted an additional twenty minutes arguing with harold barrett to get one charlies telephone rang the moment he replaced it after the transport dispute sergei pavel said whats going on the hotel told me youd checked out its a misunderstanding said charlie i want to stop another one from happening said the russian charlie became aware of traffic noise in the background of pavels call and realized the man was telephoning from the street charlie was confident he could juggle the newly added ball without dropping any of those he was so far managing to keep in the air there was still an explosion of camera lights when the car left the embassy but charlie was sure that while not making the evasion suspiciously obvious hed sufficiently obscured his face to avoid any identification on the fsb cameras the media horde actually helped in that overflowing on to the embankment road to slow the traffic and give charlie more than sufficient time to check for pursuit nothing was obvious so charlie ordered the english driver off the river road as quickly as it was possible using his knowledge of the city to twist and double back until he was sure they werent being followed charlie hurried his reregistration at the hotel although taking his usual care reestablishing his room traps and was back on the hopefully watcherfree street within half an hour he kept to the outskirts of red square using the tourist groups for cover but holding back from getting too immersed not wanting too many faces from which to pick out the one more interested in him than in st basils cathedral the kremlin or lenins tomb satisfied after half an hour that he was not under surveillance charlie moved in the direction of ulitsa varvarka and the sidealley rendezvous chosen by pavel although not immediately searching for either he found the street telephone just off the main varvarka highway ideally wedged into a corner formed by two side roads that gave him a vantage point from which to continue searching all around him after dialing natalias number i thought youd call before now she challenged at once we agreed two days is there a problem no is sasha back yes have you told her im here not yet i wanted us to talk some more before i did talk about what im not sure i can do it leave everything not sure i want to do it charlie wished there wasnt so much traffic noise its the only way it can work for us sashas happy at her school im frightened it would be too much of an upheaval for her children are resilient adjustable arent they not like this this would be like taking her to the moon we cant make decisions like this on the telephone we need to meet again charlie waited and when she didnt respond said natalia we have a routine said natalia if shes done well which she did with the summer school project i take sasha to the central park of culture to let her enjoy herself on the rides and amusements were going there tomorrow afternoon everything was arriving from london tomorrow charlie remembered and he still didnt know why pavel had approached him as he had insisting upon the varvarka rendezvous you want us to meet there no said natalia sharply i thought you wanted to see her i dont want you suddenly to appear like a ghost i want to prepare her before any meeting there might be a problem with tomorrow some things might be happening it wont matter if you cant make it said natalia realistically were going anyway around three oclock be by the ferris wheel if you can sasha always likes to ride it if i dont see you ill know youre held up and ill wait for another call like this ill be there promised charlie unsettled by the arms length dismissal if youre not call it hadnt been the sort of conversation hed expected or wanted charlie thought as he continued on toward varvarka sure from watching everything around him that he remained quite alone natalia had obviously acknowledged their only chance of being together permanently was for her and sasha to resettle in england so why wasnt he feeling encouraged because he supposed of the reservations in almost everything shed said capped by her idea of his seeing sasha from afar but not meeting her but natalia was right about preparing the child perhaps even it was a good idea that he be prepared too he hadnt done anything about a present for either of them plenty of opportunity for that better probably not to go bearing gifts the first time they got together as a family charlie had no difficulty locating the workers cafe in the side street off the main road in these casual inexpensive barcafes there was normally a scattering of places to sit but the preferred way of eating and drinking appeared to be standing up at small mushroomstyle tables pavel was already at one a salami sandwich before him there was no recognition charlie bought himself a coffee at the counter intent upon any warning gesture of refusal from the waiting detective as he went toward the rear of the smokefogged cafe finally going to pavels stand this might have all been overdramatic apologized pavel at once what exactly are we doing opened charlie cautiously meeting properly by ourselves as we should be doing not having everything monitored and orchestrated by mikhail aleksandrovivh guzov pissedoff policeman or poorly prepared provocateur wondered charlie whatever he had to go along to see where it led but watch his back even more closely and carefully than he was already doing if that were possible you got a professional problem you know hes fsb dont you it wasnt too difficult to guess tiptoed charlie waiting for the question about his own genuine profession which surprisingly didnt come instead pavel said the way things are goingor rather not goingthis will end with me being the takeallblame victim of a failed investigation guzov is doing his best to sabotage with whatever shit that doesnt get dumped on me poured all over you which in general terms was what hed already worked out for himself decided charlie becoming increasingly bewildered by the conversation why does he want to sabotage everything i dont know not completely admitted pavel but theres one thing that i think might be an indicator guzov is absolutely insistent that the listening devices werent planted by the fsb or by the sluzhba vneshney razvedki because the foreign service doesnt have internal authority or remit how else could listening devices get into the embassy unless fsb officers put them there pavel shrugged i dont have an explanation for that either but if the murder investigation ends in a mess then so too do allegations of planting bugs and spying leaving you and me the two failed investigators taking the blame for each and every failure i dont want thatcouldnt professionally survive thatand i dont imagine you want to fail either certainly not after the litany of complaints and criticisms hed endured from london over the last few days acknowledged charlie that thought colliding with another that no provocateur could be as inept as pavel was showing himself to be what do you want me to do start making things happen the way they should be happening despite guzovs interference and obstruction ive done all the routine stuff missing persons gang feud rumors informer whispers ive gone through forensics until i can recite every finding practically from memory and got nowhere were looking at the perfect murder theres got to be something innovative to break it open and i dont know what it is or could be and even if i did guzov would overrule whatever i suggested the russian paused smiling tentatively but he couldnt do anything to stop you which is why he wants to be at your shoulder every time we meet charlie found a lotmostof pavels reasoning convoluted and obviously unsubstantiated leaving him with only one point of total clarity he couldnt for a moment professionally risk everything collapsing as the russian was predicting but could he remotely consider exposing himself in the way pavel was suggesting there was a way he supposed although it would expose him to public recognition which hed never done before and had argued against so very recently but did that matter if he were going to resign the service to make possible what he wanted with natalia and sasha if i do something to exclude guzov hell exclude me from anything youre going to do hes doing that anyway but i wouldnt exclude you we could go on like this why are you taking such risks i stand to lose either way pavel pointed out i need to think things through said charlie consciously avoiding the commitment if guzov knows weve met like this hell get me off the case which hes already tried to do disclosed pavel he wants to replace me with his own tame militia man how can we stop him from doing that pavel shrugged lose me and you lose any possible cooperation in how many different ways could he lose charlie asked himself and didnt bother to start counting for something upon which charlies future if not his actual existence still depended the supposed forensic evidence of assassination appeared remarkably inconsequential apart from the totally manufactured cctv record and its freeze frames showing the entry into the embassy grounds of the victim and his killers the only other tangible evidence was a comparatively small vial of provable embassy soil into which ab blood had been introduced and a sliver of provable russian metal from a provable mm makarov bullet there were also photographs of the supposed score mark caused by that ricocheting exiting bullet there were also duplicated stacks of technically phrased forensic tests and findings in russian to accompany and support every exhibit charlie ran the loop through the replay machine several times before going just as exhaustively and individually through every exhibit and report finally convinced despite the reservations of technical director jack smethwick that with the exception of dna testing it was all unchallengeable positively separating the professional and personal dilemmas with which he was confronted charlie concentrated first upon the bizarre cafe confrontation with sergei pavel and always arrived back at the conclusion hed reached walking with aching feet back along varvarka the previous evening that pavels approach and reasoning was so open to question and doubt that it had to be genuine not a layered deception devised to eliminate him from an investigation the russians were determined to keep to themselves which was how he put it to the directorgeneral from the familiar communications room reluctantly making the approach not so much from the need for a general sounding board but very specifically to relay guzovs disclosure to a fellow russian that the fsb was not responsible for bugging the embassy the devices are provably russian exclaimed aubrey smith impatiently who else but the fsb put them there im not inviting a debate because i think the denial is as absurd as you do said charlie matching the impatience youve ordered me not to talk to robertson so im passing it on for you to tell him guzov is technically pavels superior hes got no reason to try to persuade pavel its part of the same patchwork dismissed smith nikita kashev has summoned the acting ambassador twice to the foreign ministry to make the same denial the russian ambassador here has sought two meetings at our foreign office with the same message now guzov joins the chorus for pavel to tell you hoping that youll tell melondon at least because i hope theres no way they know you and i are liaising directlyfor it to be spread as fully and as thickly as possible isnt that unusual asked charlie i dont understand the question every western embassy has had listening devices installed by the russians and weve done our fair share in return charlie pointed out the embassy protests moscow denies itas we do when were caughtand in a few months its all forgotten until the next time why the continued persistent denials this time because everything is supposed to have changed since the demise of communism which we all know it hasnt said smith still dismissive i felt i should pass it on said charlie reminding himself it was not his investigation and that his day had to run on a strict timetable youve got all you wanted said smith now i want resultssome significant developmentspretty damned quick ive got some things in mind said charlie disliking the vagueness but not wanting to risk the directorgeneral countermanding what he was considering charlie phoned ahead and by the time he arrived at petrovka a replay machine was already set up in pavels office cramped by the two rows of chairs arranged in a viewing semicircle charlie accepted without protest his relegation to the second row leaving those closest to the screen to mikhail guzov and the assembled but unidentified forensic specialists and technicians pavel positioned himself behind them alongside charlie but gave no indication of any prior contact they all watched the twoandahalf minute tape without comment but immediately after it faded a heavily bearded forensic officer demanded a replay coming intently forward to watch it for the second time once he leaned sideways to mutter to the man next to him something that charlie strained to hear but missed he didnt hear the conversation between the man and guzov when the second viewing ended either turning to charlie guzov said the cctv copy isnt of much practical use charlie had spent both replays intently studying the fsb officer for the slightest facial indication that the cafe encounter had been a setup and detected nothing charlie said together with what london identified as part of a makarov bullet it proves the victim was alive when he was brought into the embassy grounds by at least three men and that the murder was committed there positively establishing that the crime was committed on british territory which further establishes that it is primarily a british investigation i meant of practical use in identifying the victim or the men who killed him corrected guzov theyd accepted the phony cctv film as genuine realized charlie they wont know that though will they what who guzov frowned i intend to hold a press conference at the embassy announced charlie i consider the cctv to be a breakthrough in the investigation showing the murder in the process of it being committed youll be asked if you can identify the victim and his killers said pavel nodding to the freeze frames stacked on a side table together with all the other london material there will also be demands for those photographs to be released of course im going to be asked agreed charlie and i am going to describe what weve got as vital evidence that cannot be released for fear of affecting the outcome of any trial in the vain hope that the killers frightened of being identified will make the mistake thatll do just that queried guzov the sneer very obvious that would be a little too much to expect but not totally beyond the realms of possibility said charlie what we do have is a reasonably good physical description of the dead man and whats definitely not beyond the realms of possibility is that it will be recognized by someone who will come forward to identify who he is and that would very definitely be a breakthrough wouldnt it guzovs face hardened at the awareness of how easily he was being outmaneuvered trying to make it sound more like an already agreed decision rather then the question it really was the russian said the press conference panel will need particular and careful planning very particular indeed picked up charlie the film very positively establishes the united kingdoms primary legal jurisdiction which requires that any public discussion has to be conducted on british territory he hesitated the affect timed to the ticking second which presents a difficulty of your participating in view of the current diplomatic problem between our two governments are you trying to tell me that no russian participation will be allowed im just pointing out that the degree of participation has to be diplomatically agreed i shall need to discuss the legality of the situation with lawyers at our own ministry said guzov trying to make it sound like a challenge of course you must agreed charlie as i will with my embassy how much of an obstacle were temporary ambassador peter maidment and his own foreign office going to be to the media proposal wondered charlie guzov swept his arm to encompass the cctv tape and everything else that charlie had brought to petrovka and there may be further need to discuss everything you have provided after closer study by our scientists shit thought charlie charlie accepted he could not have expected it to have gone betteralthough being a pushy footinthedoor optimist hed hoped that it wouldbut mikhail guzovs implied threat nagged at him despite charlies balancing belief that pavels cafe approach had been professionally genuine and he was thirty minutes behind schedule getting back to the embassy with only time to check his telephone messages before his courtesy appointment with the acting ambassador again the one call routed to his voice mail disconnected without identification when charlie was ushered into the ambassadors suite peter maidment was at the window overlooking the river and didnt immediately turn there was a weariness about the man when he finally did so waving charlie to the waiting chair your directorgeneral sent me a message that you wanted to see me and he was taking his biggest risk yet not clearing his intention first with aubrey smith conceded charlie i want to conduct a press conference for the media camped outside the gates there was no outrage or theatricality at the idea from the lankhaired man to tell them what i need to identify the victim said charlie encouraged there are some physical characteristics i hope might be recognized by a wife or a girlfriend or a work colleague therell be russians among the media journalism is a very common front for the sort of people who installed the most recent listening devices the conference could be very strictly controlled pressed charlie they could be escorted to the conference hall quite separate from the embassy building itself and escorted directly out again at the end all the accreditation could be thoroughly vetted and the local russian staff is still being allowed in and out whats wrong with simply issuing a statement listing what you want someone to recognize im looking for the maximum response from the maximum publicity said charlie bringing them inholding the conference in a building close to which the body was foundwill be far more effective than a printed statement under the circumstances this isnt a decision i can make alone itll have to be approved from london everyone ducking responsibility as usual charlie realized except himself who couldnt but you wont oppose it not upon your assurance that it will clear up at least one of the problems were facing here it could qualified charlie now to the more difficult part he thought theres something more youand londonneeds to know i believe the russian coordinating their side of the murder investigation is in fact an officer of their counterintelligence service and that the russian intention is not to solve the crime but make the failure a british responsibility if the conference is approved i intend that man be excluded maidment remained silent for several moments i will not be drawni will not allow this already embarrassed embassy to be drawninto any further difficulties it wont be insisted charlie its to avoid any further difficulties that were having this conversation there was another pause are you convinced this whole thing is necessary beyond any doubt i dont believe the russians have made any progress whatsoever despite a genuine effort from the militia officer involved have you got any evidence to substantiate that belief none this isnt going to be an easy discussion with london i wish there were more i could offer said charlie sincerely i expect there to be a lot of pressure for it to be a joint britishrussian affair what will you do if youre refused permission it would be the easiestand safestcourse for the man to take accepted charlie if i am refused i will lose the control i wanti needover the investigation which means we go on being manipulated by the russians to whatever end or purpose they intend and youve no idea what that is absolutely none we might even return to london together both emptyhanded reflected the man quite possibly accepted charlie fatalistically charlie was in gorky parks cultural center with time to spare despite the necessary metrododging trail clearing on a bench that gave him a view of every path approach to the ferris wheel over a concealing copy of that days pravda charlie was cautiously encouraged by peter maidment although objectively accepting that if he were in the diplomats position hed probably play it safe reject the suggestion and blame it all on london which hed tried to anticipate by sending as cogent a written argument as he could asking aubrey smith to support the whole fragile proposal charlie told himself hed done everything and more to pushstart his role in the investigation the rest of the day was personally his he was going to see for the first time in five years the daughter he adored and the woman with whom he was determined to spend the rest of his life wherever and whatever that life might be there was a physical stomach jump when he saw them natalia was wearing a cream skirt and a deeply colored shirt dark blue or maybe even black sashas hand in hers sasha was taller than hed expected from the photographs up to her mothers waist she was wearing lightcolored trousers faded jeans perhaps and a rollnecked sweater as dark as her mothers her blond hair was long practically to her shoulders in a ponytail that jumped and tossed in time as she skipped at natalias side gesturing excitedly toward the slowly revolving ferris wheel there was not the slightest recognition but charlie was sure natalia had isolated where he sat watching he kept to their arrangement remaining where he was as they joined the short queue not getting up to move closer until they were next in line to get into their gondola moving close enough to the ride the better to see sasha before it rose above him natalia looked very directly at him then but still showed no recognition sasha was looking up to see how high they were going still gesturing for natalia to look too charlie backed off although not as far as his original bench stopping about five yards away that was close enough to see them both when they got off see them practically near enough to touch and imagine what it was going to be like when they were all together in englandor wherever natalia wanted them to live charlie followed their ascent until his neck ached from how far back he had to strain and picked them up again on their descent seeing natalia pick him out as the gondola got closer to the ground at first she remained as impassive as she had been when they lifted off but when they were at the point of getting off natalias face broke into a frown and charlie hurriedly although as unobtrusively as possible shook his head in reassurance that he wasnt going to attempt any encounter physically pulling back farther it was sasha who got off the ride first obviously saying something to her mother as she did so and not stopping on the raised platform but running down the steps with her arms outstretched toward a fairhaired slavicfeatured man in jeans who held his arms out toward her lifting her laughing high in the air and twirling her around and around charlie muffin drank for enjoyment not oblivion which kept the bottle of islay single malt untouched upon the bureau of the savoy suite in which he slumped the conflicting half thoughts jostling in his uncertain mind this wasnt natalia couldnt be natalia or could it she was a kgbschooled debriefer trained to suspend all personal operational feelings that was how theyd met when shed been his relentless interrogator determined to discover if his british jailbreak and supposed defection was genuine or phony hed professionally cheated her then not just by convincing her he was an authentic defector but by persuading her and her superiors that the real defector with whom hed fled england was the fake hed cheated her again on that occasion personally as well as professionally whennot knowing she was pregnant with their child from their moscow affair before he escaped back to englandhe hadnt trusted her sufficiently to keep their london rendezvous from which just once she had decided to defect from a kgb escort assignment which had her monitoring visiting russian politicians hed atoned charlie mentally insisted seeking a balance to his own deceits and failings when hed learned about sashano he stopped himself refusing the selfserving excuse when belatedly accepting his being in love and learning about sashahed connived the moscow embassy posting and married her under russian law in the hall of weddings and set up home to create an ultimately unlivable knifeedged existence that neither could possibly have sustained and so again hed left to go back to london swapping one unsustainable existence for another couldshouldhe really be so surprised that after suffering all those abandonments natalia had chosen the revenge she had orchestrated those few hours ago in the park yes he answered himself despite what had happened he could neverwould neverconceive natalia to be a vengeful person so what had it been why had she set up the opportunity for him to see their daughtervirtually choreographing the situationto include a man whom sasha very clearly knew and trusted and into whose arms shed so unhesitatingly ran charlie didnt know no matter how many different conflicting contradictory arguments he advanced to himself and so he couldnt conclude it to be anything other than understandable and ultimate revenge for all the hurts and fears and uncertainties hed inflicted upon her which inevitably brought more conclusions the most numbing of which was that shed forced herself to make the nostalgic botanical gardens reunionnostalgic for him if not for herto set up the scourging gorky park proof that everything was over between them that shed found another mana younger even more presentable russian manwhom she loved and whom sasha very obviously loved which he could do nothing but accept charlie acknowledged that it was finally time for long overdue reality hed have to convince her it wouldnt be difficult for him to make everything as easy as possible for her and sasha although in reality it would be impossibly achingly difficult he didnt know anything about russian civil law but theyd been apart for five years without any cohabitation which should make grounds for a divorce straightforward enough for her desertion was the most obvious he supposed if it existed on the russian statute books if it didnt there was sure to be something similar that would fit would he surrender sasha for adoption if natalia wanted to remarry that wasnt even a question of course he would hed have to to make everything complete for them thats what he had to do make everything complete for both of them as easily and as smoothly as possible which required of course his making contact with natalia talking to her discussing it all with her being adult but not yet certainly not tonightthat was unthinkableand probably not tomorrow either or the day after that he had other things to do not more important things but necessary arrangements to take the assignment forward he didnt any longer have the optionthe reasonto quit the job hed been prepared to abandon so he needed at least to get the assignment right to avoid losing his job as well the twoword commandcall nowawaiting him the following morning scarcely needed the your eyes only security designation before obeying the instruction charlie logged his request for a meeting with the temporary ambassador and when he did call london aubrey smith without any greeting declared i dont like the idea neither does the foreign office why didnt you discuss it with me first i need room to work and room a lot of room from mikhail guzov charlie said fighting back realizing the other man had already made up his mind youve read my reasoning of course ive read your reasoning itll cut you off from any future russian cooperation there isnt any russian cooperation not now or in the future im risking nothing charlie hadnt included anything about the cafe encounter with sergei pavel in his overnight argument and didnt intend mentioning it now not wanting to give the directorgeneral any further opposing reason what about obviously revealing your personal identification which seemed to worry you a lot about a week ago the concern then wasnt personal identification the fsb will have already run their checks the concern was that i didnt have a clue what the hell was going on i still dont but ive got enough for a description of the dead man for somebody to recognize its his identification i want and cant make any progress without getting it youll be inundated by cranks predicted the man of course there will be cranks im not suggesting its going to be easy what could he dowhat was thereto reverse smiths opposition what happens if cranks are all you get ill be answering all the questions reminded charlie heavily so ill get at least some direction toward the answers i need there was a momentary silence from the london end at the obvious inference smith said if guzov and the fsb are determined somehow to obfuscate the bugging with your failure to solve the murderand i still cant understand how theyre going to use one to achieve the othertheyre going to go through everything youve had fabricated here with damned more than a toothcomb thats clearly what you are more worried about than what i want to get from a press conference openly accused charlie his instant regret at the outburst worsened by smiths totally controlled reaction not more worried corrected the directorgeneral equally worried at the fallout from your being publicly exposed as a liar and a cheat in a situation from which it would be impossible for you to recover that would sweep away any chance of our resolving either the killing or the bugging your being exposed impossible for you to recover isolated charlie accustomed to the abandonment rules in his particular workplace not our being exposed or impossible for us to recover then with abrupt awareness he thought youve shot yourself in the foot then ive got very little personally to lose by publicly identifying myself in front of a group of inquiring journalists have i you havent matched the other man careless of the threat being made obvious which virtually brings it down to being my decision reached after the required consultation seized charlie got you provably recorded on the statutorily insisted upon inquiryproducible recording the further pause was the only indication of aubrey smiths realization of charlies verbal entrapment is what you propose essential to continue this investigation absolutely said charlie then you must go ahead you again not we noted charlie but then smith had made it glaringly clear that was how it was going to be how realistically it was always going to be if smiths personal survival required his sacrifice maidment wants the foreign offices approval which i doubt theyll give without knowing the decision youve just reached charlies stress on the identifying word was intentional i see said smith after yet another pause of awareness as ill see whether youve passed it on if i get a rejection from the acting ambassador thought charlie i want to get everything underway as soon as possible i understand its good that we both understand each other and thank you for your support that final remark hadnt been necessarytoo smartass againcharlie accepted but it sure as hell made him feel better there were two calls on charlies voicemail register but no message on either when he accessed them it reminded him though that if approval came from the foreign office which he still wasnt totally confident it would even if aubrey smith did officially endorse the idea he was going to need a separate dedicated line and a message servicepossibly even twoto accommodate the hopedfor responses could guzov and the fsb get around their intended exclusion by somehow tapping into the numbers that would have to be made publicly available for him to receive incoming calls harry fish would know and have the expertise to prevent further bugging or cellphone interception from scanners charlie hoped he wouldnt have to go through any more getpermissionfromtheheadteacher nonsense when he asked fish but thought it probable that he would as well as having to ask harold barrett for the apartment he had earlier refused and for special telephone facilities pain in the ass compounding pain in the ass and he still had warning discomfort in his awkward feet it was another hour before the summons came from peter maidment and as soon as he entered the ambassadorial suite the man indicated a grayhaired fixedface note taker and announced a written account of everything thats said will be kept which had to auger in his favor charlie thought at the same time disappointed that the man needed the visible threat like a stage prop in a room which all of them knew to be fitted with automatic recording apparatus if that is your wish charlie flattered it is claimed the man it has not been an easy permission to obtain there was opposition let maidment have his brief moment charlie decided recalling the diplomats passedover disappointment thank you for the effort youve made on my behalf there are essential strictures i expected there to be there will be separate film and audio records of the entire event which would disclose all his intended manipulations accepted charlie essential everything will be confined to the conference hall and every accreditation of every person attending has to be submitted listed and approved before monitored admission into the embassy precincts which would ensure the required publicity buildup although create a delay he hadnt wanted recognized charlie a worthwhile restriction those checks will be carried out by robertson and his team what about the separation of investigations charlie wondered surprised for the first time is that a london decision yes confirmed maidment after a pause another change of direction in the prevailing wind accepted charlie recognizing it amounted to his being monitored too but there could be advantages has robertson been told his meeting follows this is he to participate in the conference from the mans hesitation charlie knew it was a question that hadnt been considered that is something that needs to be discussed with him would you have any objection none whatsoever responded charlie seeing the first possible benefits but no one diplomatically accredited to the embassy will participate of course not questions must be restricted to the murder investigation there must be no discussion whatsoever about listening devices or withdrawal of embassy personnel questions will inevitably be asked and must be refused an outright refusal could result in a misleading misunderstanding risked charlie nervous of erecting any barrier but wanting to log a minimal warning thats the ruling insisted the ambassador which of course i will observe emptily promised charlie there have also been further representations both to me here at the embassy and in london through the russian ambassador denying any russian knowledge or responsibility for the listening devices said maidment in each approach there was a demand for participation in the press conference i advised you to expect that reminded charlie and i warned london said maidment looking more toward the note taker than charlie no one suspected of any involvement with any russian security service will be allowed within the embassy precincts which is the purpose of the accreditation confirmation charlie decided against bothering to remind the other man that it was he who had talked earlier of excluding guzov whats the official response going to be to moscows representation an acknowledgement of their note which was fence sitting not a response charlie recognized could he risk including sergei pavel without actually mentioning it he could by the strictest interpretation of maidments caveats ill announce the conference for wednesday its important that you understand that everything about this is your responsibility insisted maidment what wondered charlie was the collective noun for a group of shitscared diplomats a cower of diplomats was all that came to mind i totally accept that and i am declining any further involvement added the frightened man from now on everything goes direct to your directorgeneral who in turn will deal with the foreign office of course said charlie snatching a benefit he hadnt imagined possible unsure from which direction the next problem might comesimply resigned to the inevitability that one wouldcharlie did his best to cover his back with his own account to london of the encounter with maidment before moving on to his dedicated apartment and telephone requirements sparing himself the playground petulance by emailing his demands to harold barrett he posed his telephone interception queries to harry fish the same way as well copying londons authorizing approval to both men charlie completed his computer correspondence by announcing the press conference on the tass ria novosti and izvestia online news agencies and duplicated the information to the associated press wires for the western media although knowing that they would pick up the constantly read russian news services in every email he identified paul robertson as the man to whom all necessary accreditation information should be addressed he also set out the admission and exit restrictions and stipulated that the conference would be strictly limited to the murder investigation finally he duplicated everything to london and then he sat back to wait wondering who would be the first through his door it was paulajane venables she burst into the room without knocking the slip from the tass service still in her hand and said hey we got a breakthrough here weve got enough hopefully to unlock some doors like what i want to keep that until wednesday for christs sake charlie she protested no one officially accredited to the embassy can be involved for obvious reasons whats official got to do with it how its got to be her face hardened and i was prepared to forgive and forget forgive and forget i know know what charlie frowned genuinely confused how you tried to stitch me up a second time with robertson i didnt try to stitch you up denied charlie you did wrong and in these very particular circumstances it was right to do what i did which was to prove youre a bastard which was to behave professionally which you hadnt been doing and were not achieving anything debating it fuck you she was red faced now her hands trembling as if with the effort of holding back from hitting him quite a few people seem to be trying to do that one way and another remarked charlie mildly paulajane remained where she was shaking and with no words left but reluctant to retreat the loser the impasse was broken by robertsons entry again unannounced the man looked between paulajane and charlie before saying im sorry am i interrupting something important not at all said charlie paulajanes just leaving arent you she took the offered escape but paused at the door and said bastard sneaking fucking bastard before slamming it closed behind her charlie said did you tell her id suggested she be recalled robertsons face opened in understanding not personally i did recall her though it came out during her reexamination which she passed the second time to everyones satisfaction shes not our inside source you found out who is robertson shook his head the concentrations now on dawkins back in london i hope there arent any bad feelings about that polygraph business i hope there arent at the way it ended responded charlie who didnt care a wet fart about robertsons feelings but was intrigued at the mans surprisingly changed attitude this conference is going to be very much your show said robertson youd better tell me what you want me and my guys to do his performance wasnt just going to be monitored by film and audio recordings charlie decided like sinbad the sailor he was going to have robertson on his back just as sinbad had the clinging old man of the sea harry fish was added to the mix within fifteen minutes to answer charlies queries in person it took another ten to go through the nohardfeelings bullshit before fish insisted that he could defeat any russian scanner interception with white noise equipment which would at the same time detect russian eavesdropping attempts additionally he could attach to charlies phones recording apparatus sensitive enough to pick up extraneous and hopefully identifying background soundsto establish whether the incoming calls were from a pay phone from a street kiosk a cell phone or a landlinethat would normally be inaudible to the human ear in certain circumstances landline calls would be traceable the email from the facilities and housing officer allocating charlie his two requested telephone lines and numbers both within the available compound apartment arrived in the middle of the discussion with fish my people will install both connections and everything else youll need to block any intrusion guaranteed the electronics sweeper and install his own duplicate eavesdropping equipment charlie accepted unconcerned its good to be part of a team none of this will work without your help lied charlie to make them believe he didnt suspect the bullshit they were shoveling its still got to work cautioned robertson it will insisted charlie feeling as claustrophobically enclosed as he had in the communications compartment in the embassy basement but not charlie was determined in the way that these two men planned for him to be charlie got his preferred corner stool in the hotel bar with its fuller view of anyone who might approach from behind reflected in the glassfronted bar mirror he was as expectant of an approach as he had earlier been for the first entry into his office although as equally unsure now as he had been then as to who might come he knew only that it most certainly wouldnt be paulajane venables which was a comfort charlie still wished hed known about her second clearance not from any mistaken interference on his part but rather for its reassurance what he didnt find reassuringor even believablewas that jeremy dawkins could possibly be the spider in the middle of any embassy web he was more than content for robertson and fish to be coopted although unsuspected by them on his terms not theirs he needed people to sift the hopedfor kernels from the chaff for which robertsons investigators were preeminently suited charlie was reasonably confident he could manage the essential secondary sieving to separate those leads he intended personally to pursue from the cranks hed leave to robertsons team the further even surprising benefits from their embassy planning session had been robertsons apparent expectation before it being suggested that he should appear on the conference podium and fishs insistence that he could generate during the conference sufficient white noise to defeat any mobile or landline spying interception of all communication charlie nodded his acceptance of another vodka from the attentive bartender finally confronting the reflection hed consciously refused to consider all day trying to convince himself that he hadnt expected contact from natalia for him to have done so would have been like budgeting to win a lottery the approach had to come from him and with the press conference not scheduled until wednesday there was no reason why he shouldnt initiate it apart from fear of rejection drink in hand on the point of finishing it before making the call charlie turned more fully into the gradually filling bar curious about which of the supposed relaxing drinkers was the watcher assigned to him professionally sure that there would be one possibly even one of the assembling working girls grouped conveniently for an easy exit close to the door in the hope of early evening trade charlie raised his glass to drain it but abruptly stopped halted by the most unexpected approach of all im glad i found you said mikhail guzov from their obvious reaction to guzovs appearance charlie decided his surveillance was a dual operation between a bearded man and a fullbreasted blond girl whod ruined the charade by snatching her hand from her pretend lover as if embarrassed at being caught out by her fsb superior charlie began to doubt his expectations when instead of choosing mineral water at his drink invitation guzov asked for vodka suggested a toastto friendshipand settled comfortably on the adjoining stool without following up on his opening remark to fill the gap charlie said youve got all my numbers without looking away from his drink guzov said and youve got all mine and didnt call any of them about the press conference you knew i was organizing it and you knew we wanted participation i also told you of the problem with that which i cant do anything to reverse you know none of our intelligence agencies had anything to do with planting those devices i know you continue to tell me that to tell the same to the embassy here and the foreign office in london this was going beyondfar beyondthe normal diplomatic denials almost into the realms of farce thought charlie its true charlie spread his hands palms upward in a gesture of helplessness its an impossible situation and one i cant do anything about you could authorize our attendance our queried charlie pedantically myself and sergei romanovich this is supposed to be a joint investigation if we are not publicly there it amounts to a positive accusation and will be interpreted as such the man was genuinely concerned at the personal professional damage of his being excluded charlie suddenly decided warmed by the further unnecessary recognition that everyone at their level lived at the receiving end of the shit sluice with that reflection came another far more important awareness this encounter wouldnt be taking place if the russians had subjected his phony forensic material to dna testing charlie said surely it wont be a personal accusation against you and sergei romanovich there needs to be a russian presence insisted guzov giving charlie the cosmetically salvaging cooperation opening hed never anticipated getting im not handling the attendance applications said charlie but the conference is sure to be covered in its entirety by russian television a full tapenot an edited transmission versionwill provide you with every question and every answer i also undertake to make available the embassy film and audio recordings it was guzov who gestured for more drinks before sourly looking sideways the purpose of press conferences is to generate public response whats your undertaking about that responses will be made available along with everything else replied charlie expecting the demand for you to chase the chaff behind robertsons crew charlie thought guzov looked back into his drink i was forbidden from making this sort of approach why did you asked charlie astonished that guzov was shoveling the special relationship professionaltoprofessional crap it was a mistake to try admitted the russian ive given you every possible undertaking that i can there isnt any more charlie had turned more fully into the bar for the conversation with the russian and got an impressionwhich was all it was the barest flicker of a face of a personat the entrance to the bar which he imagined to be natalia things arent as they seem declared the russian i dont understand said charlie dismissing the distraction and i cant explain thats even more difficult to understand i know charlie gestured for more drinks but guzov covered his glass with his hand can we meet officially tomorrow of course agreed charlie petrovka at noon ill be there for what wondered charlie deciding not to ask his mind still held by the splitsecond image of natalia knowing that was allthe only thingit could have been a mental trick it was an additional ten minutes the time it took him to finish his drink and get to his suite floor before charlie learned after the briefest of alarms that it was nothing of the sort it was not a shifting sound or the faintest breathing but instinct alone and charlie stopped his hand short of the light switch knowing at once there was someone already in the room and when the single sidelight clicked on it was not he who caused it but the momentarily still unseen intruder who said close the door and charlie finally knew who it was you frightened me he said guzov frightened me natalia moved from the shadows for charlie to see her at last she was wearing a hat that hid her hair and a dark tightly belted raincoat you know him he was once my section leader i only just saw you convinced myself it was a mirage guzov didnt see you but there were others in the bar who must have alerted him i was there and who might have seen you there was no one else who could have recognized me there was no guarantee of that charlie knew you shouldnt have taken this risk i wasnt getting any reply at your embassy number and couldnt leave a message someone else might have accessed i didnt want to leave things as they are do you want more lights asked charlie giving himself time to analyze what shed said no natalia refused shortly it shouldnt have happened in the park i didnt know didnt mean charlie at last moved farther into the room standing directly opposite natalia who is he his name is karakov igor anatolivich karakov how long natalia shrugged six months maybe seven are you together natalia frowned not living together no it would confuse sasha what have you told him about her he knows i am married but separated but nothing about you obviously it is serious i think so what do you want me to do the usual ordinary inadequate words i dont know i never thought youd come back didnt expect ever to see you again i was going to write try to explain i actually tried to write but nothing sounded as i wanted it to ill do whatever you want i mean i told you i dont know what i want she stopped him its important that you know for me to tell you what were you going to do about the park i mean call you ask to meet to talk like this i was going to do it tonight but guzov arrived im sorry very sorry that it happened as it did she said you explained hes a teacher at sashas school thats how we met he was one of the escorts on her trip she seemed fond of him comfortable hes very kind is he married no why should he simply give up charlie abruptly asked himself do you love him i dont started natalia but she stopped appearing to change her mind it would be easy to hed lost her charlie decided but then hed already come to that conclusion it seems to make everything pretty clear im not sure that it does said natalia you havent told me how you feel charlie curbed the instant reply not wanting it to degenerate into an argument i thought i had i understand what has happened it was almost inevitable that it would happen because of how we are how weve been but what about you natalia broke in have you got anyone no but i dont think that comes into it not into what youve got to decide which i guess youve already decided i havent decided anything yet said natalia her voice angry for the first time im going around in circles which i have been ever since you came back i dont see cant think that theres anything else i can do to help to say dont call not for a few days im worried you might have been recognized guzov was the only danger be very careful i have worked in the field dont forget how do you think i got in here to be waiting for you and i outmaneuvered you twice thought charlie let the move come from me dont come anywhere near here again guzov is going to pack this hotel with eyes and ears probably already has it was conceivable the man would even have live microphones in the suite if hed discovered the room transfer hed have to check his intruder traps when shed gone not for a few days natalia repeated ill run hare charlie announced dont leave here for thirty minutes after me ill have one more drink in the bar for them to get organized and in position ill leave by the main exit going right toward sverdlova square and the bolshoi you go through red square in the opposite direction you really sure all this is necessary i wouldnt be suggesting it if i werent charlie isolated the boredlooking man in a lobby armchair directly facing the elevator that he left and knew he was right when the same man no longer bored came into the bar behind him within minutes now with a darkhaired woman whom hed earlier decided to be one of the working girls and who took the most obvious table closest to the door charlie chose armenian brandy and talked about a nightcap as he ordered it using the bar clock to count off the time schedule hed given natalia the initial team remained at their table when charlie left but there were three replacements a couple and a woman by herself close behind when he went out through the main entrance sidelights immediately went on a parked car outside charlie paused as if undecided in which direction to walk he identified the solitary woman and the slowly cruising car as he entered the square unhurriedly strolling passed the metropol hotel pausing again as if undecided to enter before continuing on to study the program offerings outside the brightly illuminated theater he used every pause and halt to monitor the time not turning back toward the savoy until a full twenty minutes had elapsed beyond the time hed given natalia to leave all his intruder traps were in place and undisturbed when he checked them but charlie wasnt reassured that the rooms remained untouched but then he reminded himself he had nothing whatsoever about the evening to be reassured about by the time charlie reached the embassy the following morning just after nine there had been press conference applications of them from television companies which included every russian channel all american british and satellite majors and every leading european national and commercial outlet there were three television requests among the nine japanese submissions a minor conference room within the main embassy building had to be made available for robertson and his team two of whom were additionally assigned permanently to the basement communications room transmitting accreditation photographs names and identification documentation of every russian journalist photographer cameraman and technician to london for vetting by mi which called in exchange cooperation from cia record duplication that second check duplication under similar cooperation agreements was extended to the external intelligence agencies of germany france italy spain and japan so widespread was the attempted trawl that media leaks were inevitable the first came from paris quickly followed by a longer and more detailed account in the new york times and washington post liberation in paris wrongly reported that two agents from the external kgb successor the sluzhba vneshney razvedki had been discovered among the applications which london refused to confirm or deny because of the varying time differences throughout the world moscows positive denial was the initial lead item in more than fifty european american and asian daytime radio and television news bulletins associated press was the first international news agency to create a composite file of the global reaction which halliday brought into the embassy hall in which charlie stood with robertson watching the applications in the process of being sorted into their security level checks robertson said i wasnt told london was going to go into this degree of duplication and i dont believe anyone anticipated this sort of result this could turn the conference itself into an anticlimax if you dont have enough to say charlies concern had already gone way beyond that awareness to the fear that it might diminish the all important public response it wasnt properly thought through how many times have i heard those precise words at the beginning of a disaster assessment said halliday whose inhouse mi embassy records were the first to be consulted for application comparison before their onward submission to london its a fuckup before it even gets started judged robertson only if i allow it to be said charlie there are two logical interpretations from all this speculated robertson one is that the russians gained something of enormous importance from the embassy bugging the other is that its the dead man whos important you going to be able to answer either of those questions those werent the priorities in charlies mind at that moment in little more than an hour he had to confront guzov and god knew who else and whatever demands they might make one uncertainty prompted another surely he wasnt being set up in some way he couldnt see how but then he wouldntshouldntbe able to it was on londons orders that everything had been so abruptly turned on its head with the involvement of robertson and fish and he hadnt expected that either where was fish came another question i think i can do enough to ensure it wont turn into a disaster assessment which im glad im not going to be part of if youre wrong said the mi rezident i wont be insisted charlie thinking that halliday was the sort of man hed always want to have in front rather than behind him at least itll ensure you come out on top of the local viewing figures which i never imagined you would said halliday whats that mean demanded robertson his voice indicating the annoyance at the man your timings head to head against stepan lvovs majorliveelection address to his party conference said halliday didnt you realize that no admitted charlie who the hells stepan lvov asked robertson the guaranteed new russian president whos going to turn the world into a better place identified halliday does that include not having his people bug our embassy asked robertson top of his list along with a cure for cancer and the common cold persisted halliday reminded by robertsons remark of the initial reason for the man and his team being there charlie said wheres harry fish isolating the embassys conference hall from any electronic intrusion into the main building said robertson hes apparently got some gizmos thatll shatter the eardrums of anyone trying to tap into any embassy system and others that detect a lot more electronic intrusion suddenly thought charlie reminded of his bugging concern when natalia had been in his suite the previous evening you think all the accreditation checks will be completed by wednesday he asked the man well probably manage the clearances providing we dont get more than another fifty to sixty applications undertook robertson the problem already looks like equipment accommodation even with handheld cameras and minimal sound booms its going to be a crush getting all the television crews in and then theres the radio station gear therell have to be pool agreements two or three stations using one group of technicians and equipment decided charlie they dont like doing that robertson pointed out and if you impose that restriction on any russian station therell be the automatic assumptionand accusationthat the excluded technicians are suspected of being intelligence agents added halliday let there be dismissed charlie most of his concentration still upon harry fish this isnt a friendwinning exercise im still not sure what sort of exercise it is complained robertson winning precisely the right sort of friend provided charlie which he wasnt going to do at petrovka charlie guessed hunched in the back of the now readily available embassy car which was blocked for more than ten minutes getting through the media siege directly outside the embassy gates that spilled over onto the gridlocked embankment road that delay compounded by the timeconsuming detour to locate harry fish meant he was going to be late getting to the headquarters of the organized crime bureau but charlie was encouraged by the necessary conversation with the electronics expert an impatiently waiting sergei pavel was actually at the point of going back inside the police building when charlie arrived only just managing to bring pavel back by shouting as he got out of the car which on impulse charlie asked to wait pavel said at once what in the name of god is happening london miscalculated theyre planning something inside i dont know what but a colonel from the sluzhba vneshney razvedki arrived with guzov so youre facing both intelligence agencies and someone from the kremlin itself what about forensics risked charlie a dna challenge at that moment his main concern pavel frowned none why its not important hurried on a relieved charlie whatever happens inside now i will personally get you into the conference freeing you from guzovs control and satisfying a russian presence which is his argument but i dont want to announce it to him or anyone else today how would it affect you personally and professionally would it be a problem at either level from whats already happened today i dont knowcant knowuntil we meet the others ill call afterward its chaos up there the group gathering in pavels office numbered the same as those of charlies original confrontation there but the three he didnt recognize replaced the earlier forensic scientist charlie said i apologize for my lateness it was a full fifty minutes he calculated to charlies surprise it was not the baleful guzov who opened the expected attack but the foreign ministrys nikita kashev everythings been escalated beyond any common sense complained the man at once we have done everything possible to maintain an amicable working relationship the united kingdom has done everything to sabotage it with false and unfounded accusations and i for my part have done everything to make clear to you to everyone that i am in no way responsible nor can i in any way influence or change londons response to what the british embassy here in moscow has been subjected to argued charlie i am attached to the legal department of the presidents secretariat identified the youngest of the three strangers my name is semon ivanovich yudkin i am authorized to ask you to communicate both to your acting ambassador and to your foreign office in london the opinion of our president and our government that the current difficulties are being intentionally exacerbated and manipulated to influence the forthcoming elections in this country that opinionand protestwas officially communicated an hour ago to your ambassador here and to your foreign office to london this what you have said is nothing i can to do charlie stopped forcing some cohesive control this is nothing nothing whatsoever to do with me nothing as i have tried to make clear that i can control or influence i am here to investigate a crime nothing else we know your accredited function dismissed kashev you are the only person who has been made vocally available communication to the ambassador and your foreign office has degenerated to the point of formally exchanging unanswered notes you plead that you are little more than a messenger boy which is what we consider you to be in addition to what weve already told london there will be no further cooperation or communication whatsoever in the murder investigation in which you are supposedly involved and further that every detail of british obstruction and inconsistency will be made publicly available to counter whatever diplomatic difficulty is currently being cultivated by london it would be his name publicly attached to the russian complaints charlie immediately realized i have made it abundantly clear to your representatives attached to the murder investigation that i will make available each and every response the embassy conference generates it is an undertaking i repeat now this meeting is over declared kashev and you completed the man contemptuously can leave now to deliver your messages with the fortunately retained embassy car waiting outside petrovka charlie was back at smolenskaya long before harry fish left for their earlier arranged sweep of his hotel suite we got another problem asked fish i dont know what the hell we have admitted charlie continuing on to the basement unsure what the russians intended to announce charlie included in his warning to london every accusation threat and challenge hed faced at the petrovka confrontation as much as possiblewhich was a lotverbatim he was near the end of his second revision when the hammered summons came at his cubicle door and when he opened it ross perritt said get up to your rezidentura now paulajane halliday robertson and fish were already there when charlie arrived grouped unspeaking around the widescreen television pj needed both hands to gesture him in at the same time as warning against his saying anything to overlay the programinterrupting news announcement charlie at once recognized the bespectacled solemnfaced anchor of the main rossia news channel can only be interpreted as an intentional and provocative determination to interfere in the internal democratic activities of the russian federation charlie picked up concerted and genuine attempts by members of the russian federation to understand the escalation of the intrusion by the united kingdom have either been rebuffed or ignored imposing upon the two countries the severest strain over recent years that strain culminated earlier today in a recorded confrontation between a representative of the british government and officials of the russian federation up to and including the presidents office in a final attempt to rectify a deteriorating situation the picture switch to pavels petrovka office of four hours earlier dominated by charlie isolated against the russian phalanx hed faced was so abrupt that both paulajane and halliday audibly gasped harry fish exclaimed jesus charlie said fuck it was a montage but charlie at once acknowledged that the editing was so brilliantphotographically as well as verballythat only he and the russians whod been there would have recognized it as such apart from an opening shot of the assembled russians the camera concentration was entirely upon charlie and he cringed inwardly at the variety of facial expressions he had been totally unaware of making there was the wideeyed surprise of his entry into the room despite pavels warning but by far the worst was his brief blankminded reaction to the statement from presidential lawyer semon yudkin which had been retained in full charlie judged to be the most devastating of all the editing of his initial response to nikita kashevs opening attack which had been cut to just i am in no way responsible nor can i in any way influence or change londons response when the transmission reverted to the studio commentator charlie was identified by name and portrayed as an ineffectual dupe who could be recognized as such by his contribution to what was referred to as a highlevel government meeting the segment ended with a separately recorded statement by yudkin declaring that the strongest possible protest note had been delivered by the london ambassador to the british foreign office and repeating the suspension of all cooperation between the two countries until a full explanation accompanied by an apology was made an aching embarrassed silence disturbed only by more embarrassed foot shuffling descended on the room the moment the news break faded charlie broke it he said i have just been sucked up and blown out in bubbles that doesnt even come close to describing it said the resentful paulajane thats going to become an idiots guide training film for every intelligence agency for at least the next hundred years didnt you guess youd be filmed and recorded asked harry fish more professionally i didnt need to guess i knew charlie flagellated himself i fucked up bigtime except for transmitting his account of the meeting before responding to the summons here he thought hopefully were on the third floor persisted the woman with luck youd probably kill yourself outright if you jumped we wont stand in your way theyve been incredibly clever generalizing every accusation and even making it sound as if the presidential elections were in some way involved assessed halliday reflectively years the commentator claimed that covers them for whatever they wantthe murder and the bugging and any other embarrassment since the end of communismand a london denial will simply be laughed at just as youre being personally laughed at right now the mi officer was right conceded charlie running the realities through his mind until he came to one that stopped him would natalia have seen him wriggling like a worm on a hook it was too forlorn to hope that she wouldnt youll obviously have to cancel your precious conference insisted paulajane what the russian have just done turns it into a farce does it challenged charlie back in control or is that precisely what they expect to happen why they staged what they just did because they werent going to be part of it and wanted to stop whatever i might have said in answer to something i was asked you surely dont expect london will allow it to happen now demanded the woman youll be eaten alive i just have been admitted charlie again if the conference is canceled they win and i might as well jump as you suggest i think shes right came in robertson speaking for the first time londons only thought now will be containment containment of what refused charlie thats the russians strategy i think you should talk to london suggested robertson so do i agreed charlie fervently wishing that he could have avoided doing so but yet again he was surprised to the point of bewilderment when he did having by now come to know the directorgenerals emotionalcontrolling demeanor charlie didnt expect a shouted tirade but he hadnt anticipated aubrey smith hearing him out as patiently as the man did thinking again as he anxiously explained his side of the debacle how lucky it had been to send his recollected account of petrovka ahead of his televised humiliation when charlie finally finished the other man said youve still been made to look absolutely stupid a naive stumbling idiot i know accepted charlie but i wont continue to appear that way if you let me go ahead i know the basis upon which youve planned everything you cant possibly guarantee any sort of exoneration theyre gambling that well cancel insisted charlie if we do they will have won beaten us not beaten us beaten me he thought by elevating everything as they have talking about affecting russias supposed internal democracy theyve taken any decision totally away from me personally its government to government now you could argue the point and the impression that will be created if we back off risked charlie and i will argue it promised the man but that argument logical and realistic though it is wont necessarily prevail with politicians who think and act in sound bites then what the hell can i do asked charlie hating the sound of his own inadequacy pray replied smith unhelpfully to whose god the one whos best at miracles said smith which helped even less bill bundy was the only one of his three listed callers to have identified himself with a message and the american answered his phone the moment charlie returned it you managing to stay sane greeted the american im not sure you going to go ahead with the press conference its not been decided yet why was bundy interested wondered charlie id like to be there if you do he had to ruffle his feathers start acting professionally charlie decided ill let you know if its decided we go ahead so you might not persisted bundy i said it hasnt been decided youll fix my admission if it does yes promised charlie to try to work out your reason for being so anxious to be there he thought i cant imagine how it might help but my offer to pitch in still stands i appreciate it said charlie emptily he really could have sold tickets he thought what are you going to dois london going to doif you dont go ahead we havent decided about whether or not to go ahead wearily reminded charlie you want a break someone to relax with youve got my number okay i appreciate that too charlie lied again look forward to your call whatevers decided charlie pressed back in his inadequate chair in his inadequate office deciding the dedicated number and its answering facility should be transferred to the comfort of the compound flat in which the hopeful response lines were being installed he was about to concentrate upon the americans approach when the telephone rang once more the traffic noise obvious the moment charlie lifted the receiver i didnt know what they were going to do apologized sergei pavel at once from his untapped phone from the street kiosk i realize now that telling me to wait outside for you was to get me out of the way while they set everything upin my own fucking office you did warn me they were planning something said charlie as confused at the russians approach as he had been by that of bundys just minutes earlier theres nothing you could have done if you had known except given you a better warning said pavel i didnt want you to think i was part of it tricking you like that i wasnt thinking that replied charlie honestly you said i could get into the conference with you it took charlie several moments to reply hed believed the man up to now but couldnt any longer pavel had to be a plant to discover what the british response to the television broadcast was going to be which meant charlie realized at once that he couldnt indicate any uncertainty about the conference how can you hope to be there beside me after what kashev and yudkin said im not part of anything they said or did or the trap they set i told you before none of them wants the investigation to continue and if it doesnt ill be held ultimately responsible for its failure you cant confront both intelligence agencies and the office of the president itself things arent that bad not like they were in the old days theyre not that much better either argued charlie i want to be there then you shall be decided charlie having pavel publicly at his side would make the russian televised denunciation of noncooperation almost as ridiculous as its portrayal of his stumbling inadequacy almost he qualified but not quite how call on this number this way unless a londonordered cancellation were announced in advance there would not be enough time for any further sabotage to be mounted even if pavel were a provocateur thank you said pavel lets wait to see if youve got anything to thank me for the car had the now familiar difficulty getting through the thronged embassy gates and it hadnt gone more than yards along the embankment road when charlies now regular driver said it could be two cars following us one certainly a bmw again harry fish swiveled to stare out of the rear window charlie didnt bother the electronics expert said you actually think the fsb are tailing you it would be pretty standard practice after everything thats happened wed do it if it were london i most certainly wouldnt like to do my job charlie finished for the other man at the moment i dont like doing it either he hoped the intended hotelroom sweep wouldnt take too long he had a lot to think about and work out and the urge to call natalia was becoming stronger despite his undertaking not to attempt contact so soon its definitely two reported the driver the bmw and what looks like an old skoda what do you want to do if i do find something asked fish nothing said charlie frowning toward the man to indicate his discomfort at the driver being able to hear the conversation even though he probably wouldnt understand it just show me where if the suite were bugged hed have a genuine and essential reason to speak to natalia fish nodded in understanding and said nothing more until they were crossing the hotel foyer sorry about that stupid of me no harm done said charlie standing back for fish to enter the elevator ahead of him glad they were alone if you find anything i want to use it to my advantage which is why i want it left is there any way they can detect your searching for it only if we speak if and when i do find something ill indicate it and mark it we can talk later out of the room the briefcasesized bag that fish opened was sectioned to hold and clamp various instrumentsincluding a doctorlike stethoscopeand yards it was a yard with an elongated attachment like an elephants trunk that fish extracted and looped around his neck by a thin strap there was a regimentation in the way the man operated with virtually immediate results when he put the nose of the attachment to the telephone turning to charlie and nodding in thirty minutes he detected six emplacements three in the living room and three in the bedroom having stickermarked the location of each fish unscrewed the first detected telephone handset pointed into the diaphragm to the sort of pinhead device charlie recognized from the embassy search and examined it in situ and from several angles through an intensityenhanced magnifying glass before looking up both frowning and shaking his head after a further even more concentrated examination fish handed the glass for charlie to look in detail for himself charlie was able under the enlargement to see that the device was not completely cylindrical which hed imagined it to be but had an extension like a finger from its left side several times unnecessarily gesturing charlie against any utterance fish painstakingly opened every identified location and subjected each bug to the same intensive scrutiny finishing every one with the same frowned head shaking there were people in the outside corridor and again in the descending elevator so it wasnt until they were in the familiar bar charlie in his backprotective corner seat and the drinks ordered that charlie was able to say whats all the head shaking about theyre not the same declared fish with another appropriate head movement whats not the same the listening devices said fish patiently remember i told you those in the embassy were state of the art which i thought they were because id never seen anything like them before these are even better theyre fantastic and id sell my soul as well as my body to get hold of one to dismantle and reverse engineer what are you telling me persisted charlie feeling another sink of unwanted bewilderment these are state of the art ive never seen anything so sophisticated even without taking them apart why werent those the same in the embassy potentially a far bigger and more important target you tell me invited charlie i cant admitted fish but id like to be able to so would he charlie decided adding it to his list charlie was glad hed protectively warned the television media of the likelihood of pooled arrangements because overnight effectively with just six hours before the start of what he realistically accepted to be one of the greatest gambles hed ever taken fortythree more attendance applications ten of them from additional stations were logged at robertsons embassy vetting room by that time charlies painstakingly created priority list was mentally shredded by harry fishs discovery in the savoy hotel suite and charlie personally and arbitrarily decreed the share between russian american and british tv stations rejecting any decisionreversing arguments against his edicts with the warning that any station refusing to accept his ruling would be refused attendance altogether anxious not to miss sergei pavels expected approach charlie accepted fishs offer of a pager attachment to his dedicated apartment telephones as well as his previously allocated line his suspicion of the mans overall monitoring confirmed by fish not asking for an explanation for the request charlie was surprised to the point of astonishmentalthough in turn not seeking an explanationthat reg stout was included by robertson for their final tour of the specially assigned conference facility and the route to it from the gatehouse accepting fishs assurances without fully understanding the detailed explanations that the embassy and its ancillary buildings were totally secured against electronic intrusion charlie did understand how completely those attending the conference would be recorded from the three television cameras presenting a degree surveillance within the hall in addition to those temporarily added to the now fully operational outside cover there still hadnt been any contact from pavel when they ended the tour back in the conference chamber with a complete rehearsal of the embassy secretaries who were to be stationed throughout the room with handheld microphones for individual questioners and a final check of the translators booth charlie waited until stout left for his selfappointed supervision of the gatehouse arrivals before saying whys reg to be included hes officially responsible for embassy security said robertson charlies intended protest at not being consulted was stopped by his pagers vibration its source registering on its screen charlie at once recognized the street phone number its your now transferred original line its not secure if its transferred a second time through the switchboard hurriedly intruded fish youve just told me everything electrical is totally secure behind a white noise barrier said charlie as the pager continued to reverberate theres a risk with a double transfer insisted the other man mumbojumbo bullshit decided charlie picking up the conferencehall extension and telling an immediately responding operator to put the call through the voice charlie instantly recognized to be pavels said fifteen minutes yes acknowledged charlie though unsure if the russian heard him so quickly was the outside street telephone replaced turning back to the other two men charlie said your secondary monitor the one im not supposed to know youve attached to the apartment lines wouldnt have got that would it harry a backup is an obvious precaution tried robertson why play silly buggers and not tell me there was one demanded charlie were not spying on you insisted fish i would if i were in your position said charlie sardonically i just wouldnt be so bad at it who was it demanded a tightlipped robertson charlies hesitation was more to continue the other mans annoyance than to avoid the answer sergei pavel initially there was blankfaced silence from the two men until robertson said it was my understanding that no one officially involved in your murder investigation was to attend your isolated charlie yet again pavels militia not fsb working entirely independently from the fsb questioned robertson its my decision and my responsibility stated charlie he was unsure approaching the thronged entrance if the already assembled media were early arrivals or a separate assembly of fsb agents and informers to record and identify those arrivals within the gatehouse in addition to its now totally functioning cctv system reg stout was virtually at attention behind russianspeaking embassy staff there to confirm that every attending journalist and technician was listed against their official accreditation documentation the setup reminded charlie of the passport controlled and suspectindexed checks at the long ago checkpoint charlie crossing between east and west berlin during the numbing days of the cold war hed once had to let a man be killed there to prevent being shot himself he further recalled it was wrong to remember to invite ghosts it was difficult through the gate office window to isolate the face for which charlie was looking but from the main better windowed exit and entry section he at last saw pavel trying to keep himself apart from the ebbing and flowing melee while at the same time hopefully using its protective concealment from the sweeping camera lenses the russian detective located charlie at the same time hurrying through the door charlie opened to an instant explosion of camera lights i didnt expect this greeted pavel the mans excitement was obvious who is this i need an identity officiously demanded stout it was charlie caught by a sudden idea who answered although in the russian stout was supposed not to understand colonel pavel is attending upon my authority charlie told the registration clerks i need to see some provable id insisted the clerk also in russian youre looking at it its me said charlie impatiently stout shifted as if to intrude further but didnt pavel nodded back toward the gatehouse as they emerged into the crashbarrier controlled walkway was that a problem well see said charlie he was conscious of one of the temporary camera installations keeping them constantly under observation as they approached the hall neither robertson nor fish were there charlie led the way past fishs monitoring technicians making their lastminute equipment adjustments into a rear anteroom in which three closed circuit screens were already operating although without sound one showed the approach from the gatehouse along which they had just walked the other two were focused on the inside of the hall from two different angles totally covering the area at that moment on both were pictures of sound technicians moving along the already setout chairs depositing on each ear pieces for simultaneous translation pavel looked briefly at the screens it all looks very impressive its got to be impressive said charlie if something doesnt come out of this i dont see a way forward ive lost any contact certainly any cooperation with guzov with everyone except you and what about you whats your position going to be after today its a gamble i had to take if they believe im the only conduit being here today is my best guarantee to be kept in the investigation im betting on their not being able to risk pushing me aside anymore here they come said charlie attracted by the sudden influx through the gatehouse led by the first group of equipmentburdened television and radio engineers there was a bottleneck at the very entrance to the hall and almost immediate shoving charlie looked away at robertsons entry unexpectedly followed by stout robertson said i want reg on the platform with us this wasnt a lastminute move charlie knew any more than stouts earlier inclusion hadnt belatedly occurred to the spy hunter im not allowing any questions about the bugging its strictly limited to the murder he told the security chief ive already made that clear intruded robertson im making everything even clearer said charlie still talking to the exarmy major dont get in the way by trying to involve yourself in any english exchanges what if theres something i need to make clear asked stout pass me a note ruled charlie unless i have your absolute guarantee that youll say nothingjust sit thereyoure not coming on to the platform reg has got every official started robertson im setting the rules and this is what they are halted charlie you dont like it youre not coming on the platform either i wont try to contribute promised stout charlie remained staring at the man for several moments thats a positive order one word that fucks up what im trying to achieve youre on tonights plane back to london i dont think began the exsoldier but abruptly stopped then he said i understand i wont say anything just be there the confrontation was broken by the arrival of harry fish the man said at once we didnt build in enough time for all the gatehouse checks theres got to be at least fifty still waiting to be processed and god knows how many more not yet in the hall he waved his hand toward the television screens look at it the jostling line outside stretched unbroken the complete length of the forecourt from the gatehouse to the hall the inside of which was shown by the internal cameras still to be only half full despite charlies insistence upon pooling samecountry television and radio technicians the area directly in front of the raised stage was already a thicket of trailing television cables and there was a hedge of stationidentifying microphones running the entire length of the official table from the number of chairs at the table charlie realized a space had been set for stout before their argument from beside him pavel offered charlie a slip of paper and said these are the two headquarter lines dedicated exclusively for any response we might get from today ill have them included on the list to be distributed said charlie ill leave it to you to announce it from the platform robertson turned from the television sets we need to announce a delay well make it together insisted charlie telling pavel what he was going to do as he moved toward the door gesturing robertson ahead of him directly outside in the linking corridor charlie said what the fuck game are you playing its necessary said robertson awkwardly what is why wasnt i told it came up there wasnt time bollocks what is it i need to keep stout on a leash harry thinks one of his tracking devices has picked up something he and his guys want time i should still have been told repeated charlie sure robertson had manipulated the episode to establish his seniority you just have been told lets get on with it shall we charlie accepted leading the way out into the hall charlie had expected the immediate eruption of noise but not the sunburst of blinding lights that almost made him stumble into the waiting empty chairs he gestured robertson down beside him and said my senior colleague and i on behalf of whom i speak are delaying the start until everyone gets into the hall we dont expect that delay to be more than half an hour were not imposing a time everyone will get their opportunity to ask their questions there was an immediate protesting cacophony and charlie rose hearing words like deadline and murderer and mafia and spy and cold war and a lot more in several other languages robertson momentarily remained where he was only rising at charlies encouraging nudge and even then slowly turning to put both of them facially beyond any camera focus few but someone of charlie muffins experience would have recognized robertsons look to be one close to hatred back in the linking corridor robertson said you just made me a bigger target than yourself identifying me as your superior im going to bring you down for that do everything i can to destroy you you know the problem with bad gangster movies paul they all have that sort of crap dialogue turns them into comedies instead of being frightening the noise at their reentry was an unintelligible roar which visibly startled stout and pavel charlie managed to avoid the blinding brightness of the strobe lights the three looked to charlie for seating directions charlie put robertson beside him at the center of the table with pavel flanking him on his left and stout on the other side of robertson it took several minutes for the uproar to subside and when it did he still had to shout into his microphone flapping wavingdown motions with both hands charlie identified the three other men and insisted the conference was restricted solely to the murder of the onearmed man any other questions on anything else would be refused there would be simultaneous translation through the available earpieces into russian english french german and italian and within the hall were six embassy officials with handheld microphones for individual questioners those questions would be amplified for the benefit of everyone there would be no individual onetoone television interviews after the main conference nor would any photographs be released of the murder scene or of the body deferring to pavel as he spoke charlie said the joint british and russian investigation had so far been extremely productive which would become obvious during the conference but that they were still seeking help from the public to receive that help three dedicated telephone lines had been established at the embassy and two at the petrovka headquarters of the organized crime bureau after slowly reciting eachand repeating eachcharlie said information sheets listing them would be available to everyone upon departure and he was asking that the phone numbers be printed in all newspapers their web sites and repeated on television and radio broadcasts as well as being published on their web sites too no identification of any caller would be publicly disclosed anonymous calls could be made there would be recording apparatus on every listed line along with the telephone list would be separately printed information which the joint investigation hoped would lead to the identification of the victim another sheet would illustrate the precise spot where the body had been found showing its proximity to the hall in which they were assembled and its relationship to the main embassy building and the entry gate into the forecourt the victim was male five feet eight inches tall weighing pounds and was aged between fortyfive and fifty the left arm had been surgically amputated between ten and fifteen years earlier he had been killed by a shot in the back of the head from a makarov pistol its bullet made to flatten on impact to destroy all facial and dental features he had also been tortured and the fingers of his surviving right hand had been burned by acid to remove all fingerprints all makers names had been removed from his russianmanufactured clothing a brown polyester massproduced suit a blue shirt and a redandblackstriped tie the laceup shoes which were well worn and also of russian manufacture were brown all the suit pockets had been emptied there was a red birthmark affected by the acid burning on the right hand and the little finger of that hand had been distorted possibly since childhood by what forensic pathologists believed to be frostbite in the past again possibly in his childhood the man has undergone an appendix operation there had been traces of a barbiturate in the mans blood lets start the questioning invited charlie there was an immediate burst of inaudible shouted questions which charlie had to again subdue by shouting louder and standing to gesture the noise down shielding his own microphone robertson said this is a farce a waste of time needing his amplification charlie still had to yell this is going to be canceled right now if everyone doesnt start behaving sensibly a woman in the third row gestured for a handheld microphone identified herself from the new york times and said are you treating this as an assassination charlie deferred to robertson who appeared startled leaning hesitantly forward he said it is certainly one avenue of inquiry so the man could have been an informera russian spypursued into the embassy by russian security officers seized the woman refusing to surrender the microphone to charlies gesture pavel said we have been officially assured there is absolutely no involvement of any state security organization so that is untrue you would be wouldnt you said the persistent woman to isolated sniggers at the mockery there is also no involvement of any british intelligence organization came in charlie to help pavel wed be told that too wouldnt we have been told that already said a man in heavily accented englishan italian charlie guessedwho reached across from his seat directly behind the woman to take the microphone nothing can be ruled in or out of the investigation until we get the victims identity said charlie so it is a possibilitya strong possibilitythat it is an intelligence assassination persisted an nbc reporter from the middle of the hall nothing has been ruled in or out repeated charlie identifying bundy next to the questioner relieved at the comparative order that had finally settled thered be a publicity benefit from the inevitable concentration upon an intelligenceorganized assassination as the thought came to charlie another woman this time from the london times demanded which british intelligence organization do you mr robertson and mr stout represent that is not a question that will be addressed refused robertson without any prompting from charlie why not pressed the woman next question insisted robertson mi or mi came a shouted question not needing amplification next question repeated robertson charlie had to listen intently to his own earpiece for the translation from german of the question what other lines of inquiry are you pursuing apart from it being a stateapproved killing of which comparatively recently there is evidence of the russian authorities being prepared to sanction after a momentary hiatus pavel said regrettably there is a great deal of organized crime in russia particularly in moscow assassination of this sort is a very common method of settling gangland feud and disputes how many others have there been in the grounds of the british embassy immediately demanded the german to more mocking laughter none quieted charlie but it would be a very effective way of misdirecting an investigation along the espionage lines that appears to be the media preference whats your preference asked the determined german i have none responded charlie with my colleagues i am conducting this investigation with an open mind with no preconceived impressions or theories there was more disbelieving laughter which brought a heavy sigh and a pointed sideways look from robertson charlie was happy for the next question to move away from the espionage fixation a demand for more evidence of the murder having been committed within the embassy grounds which enabled him to expand upon the supposed discovery of part of a mm makarov bullet and the score mark on the outside wall of the hall in which they now sat which inevitably brought the question of how the killers and their victim got into the embassy grounds unseen the killers werent unseen snatched charlie seeing the first opportunity to stage manage the event as he wanted despite a partial malfunction of the entrance security cameras the actual moment of the murder by a number of men was indistinctly recorded the images are being scientifically enhanced and the hope is that such enhancement will be sufficient to identify the killers although from the position in which the victim is shown on his knees no recovery of his features will be possible the hall erupted into a far noisier outburst than any previously and it took charlie a full five minutes to once more subdue the babble sufficiently to continue the most obvious and frequent demand was for the cctv and stills from it to be released for publication which charlie refused with the easy escape that as the film was in the process of being sharpened hopefully to form the core evidence in a prosecution any release was legally impossible he refused too any verbal description of those featured on the loop apart from saying that all appeared to be male heas well as robertson and pavelwere able to avoid any demands that didnt serve their purpose by refusing to let the questioning go beyond the actual murder despite determined and repeated attempts to get a response to the bugging charlie was however selective in his refusals alert to whatever maximized his chances of getting that one essential victimidentifying response when no opportunity presented itself after almost another hour during which the predictable insistences expanded into the recurring possibility of the victim being a russian intelligence officer killed at the point of an intended defection charlie decided to bait his own manufactured hook to a question that had been phrased in varying forms at least three times beforehow endangered were relations between the united kingdom and the russian federationcharlie replied the successful conclusion of this investigation toward which we are moving ensures there is no risk whatsoever to that relationship what successful conclusion insisted the original questioner from the new york times youre asking for help that doesnt convince me youre anywhere close to solving this i have already told you why we cannot release the surviving images on the cctv film said charlie you will surely understand and accept that there is other evidence we cannot make publicly available we might be able to come some way towards providing moremaking arrests evenonce we have named the victim the fresh outburst was less strident than those that preceded it youve already got enough for an arrest demanded the woman the answer to that will have to wait for the next conference evaded charlie rising to bring the other three men up with him to yet another protesting uproar that was a disaster insisted robertson back in the anteroom it did everything and more to achieve what i wanted rejected charlie what if you dont get a name from it persisted robertson today will bring something out of the woodwork robertson appeared oddly to become aware of stout listening to the exchange lets hope so ill walk you to the gate charlie told pavel as they went across the forecourt charlie spoke to the other man of his rejection of robertsons assessment which he translated pavel said hes got every reason to be doubtful to be honest so am i we laid out enough bait insisted charlie wishing he sounded more confident we need to establish undetected personal communication said pavel what about individual cell phones we might as well stick tracking devices up our asses dismissed charlie in england we foiled dozens of islamic terrorist plots before they had been mounted and captured the perpetrators of a lot more that we missed the first time through mobile phones once detected by scanners they can be listened to and the users traced to within fifty yards by the electronic signals they emit wed be more discreet standing on streetcorner boxes with megaphones pavel lifted his shoulders in an awkward shrug stay with phones at street kiosks then by far the safest when they stopped just before the gatehouse the russian suggested the already used cafe as another unmonitored meeting place allowing an intervening gap of two days for incoming calls to begin on the publicly announced numbers during that time we can make our choice of telephone kiosks get some numbers to exchange from now on guzovs people are going to permanently be just one step behind both of us probably literally which will make the varvarka cafe an important test acknowledged charlie confident of his own trailclearing ability but wondering about pavels one of the designated telephones was ringing when charlie entered his assigned embassy apartment and for the briefest moment he hesitated before snatching it up from the unexpected internal line robertson said somethings come out of the woodwork charlie muffin was engulfed by a feeling of deja vu on the threshold of the spycatchers inquiry room paul robertson occupied the chief inquisitors position from which hed conducted charlies interrogation flanked by the same male and female team the two polygraph technicians were at their momentarily quiet equipment but looking far happier than during charlies session and charlie recognized on either side of the door the two heavyhanded guards whod stood threateningly over him before hed ridiculed his polygraph examination harry fish was to the left of the judgemental bench in front of him the familiar white handkerchief upon which lay three pinhead bugs as charlie came fully into the room reg stout in the same chair upon which charlie had sat was saying vehemently i have only ever seen devices like these once before in my life when the original six were discovered in the telephone relay box and ive already told this inquiry i found them in your compound flat taped to the underside of a chest drawer insisted fish and shown you the polaroid photographs prior to those we also digitally took later as part of official evidence whats your explanation for the bugs being where they were demanded the unnamed man who had orchestrated charlies confrontation im being set up protested stout his voice rising you wont find my fingerprints on any of it the surface of the devices is too small to register fingerprints they have to be handled with tweezers dismissed fish theres enough surface though on tweezers we did find in your apartment theres only one set of printsyours what about the logs demanded stout desperately your fingerprints are on the spirals and the log cover said fish i want a lawyer demanded stout his voice wavering almost beyond control youre framing me with an illegal search planted stuff you need a warrant you will be appointed a lawyer when you arrive back to london under arrest came in robertson and to help you when you meet with your lawyer it was not an illegal search we have a warrant to search wherever and however we want in this embassy including all staff accommodation abruptly in russian charlie said itll go easier for you reg if you make a full confession attracted by charlies voice stout turned to the side of the room where charlie stood and said i should have guessed youd be part of it too what did you say robertson asked charlie you tell them what i said reg hopefully suggested charlie in english how the hell can i protested the man you know i dont speak the fucking language i know youve told me you dont and i dont ill go to the papers about thisexpose you all youre a signatory to the official secrets act which precludes you or your representatives speaking about anything official to any media outlet or organization said the woman panelist whom charlie presumed to be a government lawyer you will remain overnight under guard in your apartment from which the telephone will be disconnected preventing your contacting anyone outside this embassy officially recited robertson youll be repatriated still under guard on the first direct london flight tomorrow in london you will be formally arrested and will appear in camera before a magistrate a lawyer will be present to represent you at this and any subsequent hearings im being set up repeated the exarmy major in a near hysterical babble ive served my country loyally all my life got medals decorations this isnt right take him back to his quarters ordered robertson gesturing to the two waiting guards stout twisted his face contorted to the advancing men he stood obediently at the gesture from the larger of his two custodians and was led unprotesting from the room what did you say to him in russian robertson again demanded of charlie i told him it would be better for him if he made a full confession why did you tell him that asked the woman hes always insisted he cant speak russian reminded charlie he was distressed disorientated i thought there was a chance he might have slipped up and answered me in russian it would have undermined his denials dont you think the three at the table frowned between themselves dismissively robertson said not particularly but thanks for your effort whyd you go back to stout after clearing him the first time asked charlie robertson hesitated we didnt clear him absolutely his original polygraph was better than dawkinss or sotleys and thats all we had contradictions and inconsistencies in their separate statements no supporting evidence londons decided that was because of their arrogance that they were affronted having to undergo the polygraph at all they performed much better under more formal investigation in england theyre both being prematurely retired of course because of their obvious incompetence but there were some inconsistencies between what stout told us the first time and what dawkins said under reexamination so we decided to go back to stout picked up fish as small as they are these bugs have miniscule transformers to connect with their outside receivers and they generate a pulse which we picked up when we swept stouts apartment we found them within an hour of your press conference getting underway confronted with the positive evidence stout came close to collapsing although he recovered by the time you came in resumed robertson he was all over the place on his second polygraph he certainly wasnt admitting anything from what i heard challenged charlie he doesnt have to insisted fish weve got the evidence which isnt enough by itself is it challenged charlie again youve got to sweep the entire embassy all over again to ensure stout hasnt replaced the first lot of bugs you found robertson gave charlie a condescending look what exactly do you imagine harrys people are doing right now its good to know everyones staying on top of their job said charlie unabashed and when thats done i guess youre all looking forward to going home robertson slowly shook his head you think that all by yourself you can monitor three contact appeal phones and what might come in on themsift the cranks from what could be your breakthrough callas well as liaise with whatever your russian militia friend might get from his end the directorgeneral himself thinks you need help he hasnt told me that said charlie was this another act of desperation by the losing aubrey smith he will when you speak to him hes expecting your call ive arranged five oclock his time looking toward the electronics expert charlie said you staying on to hold my hand too harry obeying orders as we all have to do replied the man ignoring the inquiry panel charlie walked the length of their table to look down at the still displayed listening devices to fish he said you got a glass fish paused frowning before handing charlie the magnifying glass squinting down through it charlie said theyre not the same as those you found in my hotel with the spur to their left these are the same as the others that were found here the first time of course theyre the same echoed robertson impatiently what else did you expect youre right of course agreed charlie what else could i have expected more professionalism he thought answering his own question im relieved that robertson and fish have solved their problem announced the directorgeneral have they questioned charlie from his suspended telephone booth aubrey smith hesitated they will have when the new sweep is completed and if we locate some fresh bugs that will give us even more evidence i would have appreciated being told directly that theyd been seconded to my investigation there was another pause from the london end lets not get petulant robertson called to tell me what had been found in stouts rooms and how stout being kept at the press conference helped there was a natural progression to the conversation that followed you cant be expected to handle everything by yourself i thought paulajane could be brought in too her speaking russian would help wouldnt it maybe halliday too mi have offered their help i dont want any permanent embassy staff included argued charlie why not theres been very little so far to give me any confidence or faith in existing staff here i want to maintain the separation robertson and fish are sure stouts their spy im not disputed charlie is there something youre not telling me this wasand still isan appallingly mismanaged embassy reminded charlie my investigation should remain entirely independent from anyone here unquestionably the people with robertson and fish are sufficiently security cleared but i need a system under which i personally examine and assess all recorded messages without my authority being questioned apart from by you charlies irritation was growing i know a secondary recording system has been installed ensuring calls will be taped to provide you with immediate access to every contact i would like your guarantee that you will not instigate any action whatsover as a result of what i have begun today without prior discussion with me that is impudent insubordination interrupted the directorgeneral that is a very necessary operational request expressed as directly as it was to prevent the slightest misunderstanding between us persisted charlie glad that as always the exchange was being automatically recorded in london you have gone with metrusted meso far in risks that i have accepted to be entirely my responsibility if i fail i want that failure to be of my own mistakes and making not through the interference of others following their insufficiently prepared initiatives or an agenda of which neither you nor i have prior knowledge ive read your file know your history charlie muffin the maverick loner bucking all authority and opinions other than his own warned smith and ive backed you all the way sometimes ive got to defer to collegiate pressure here the internal counterintelligence department in which robertson and fish operated was under jeffrey smales direct control charlie remembered many unexplained irritations abruptly becoming clearer the directorgeneral continued i think upon reflection that misunderstandings have occurred robertson can come back with his other two adjudicators leaving his support staff with fish and his people to provide your backup was smith according him the battle honors or allowing paul robsertson a tactical retreat ill let robertson know you want to talk to him again if he hadnt won the battle hed at least come out best in the skirmishes charlie decided dont for a single moment forget anything ive told you pressed the man not for a single moment hunched on his bar corner stool at the savoy hotel charlie resisted the sink into selfpity surprised at the feeling selfpity wasnt an emotion he very often if ever allowed himself of all his feelings after such an overfilled daynatalia still firmly compartmentedthe hovering depression was the easiest to identify when hed finally left the embassy less than an hour ago there had only been six calls to his dedicated telephone numbers four of them predictably had been from journalists seeking the earlierrefused personal interviews or followup information the other two predictable again had been from cranks a woman complaining that she was being sexually motivated by the fsb with a mindcontrolling laser beam and a man who interspersed his insistence upon a return to communist rule with a slurred rendition of one of the former soviet unions marching anthems charlie had tried pavels personal line as well as the two publicly supplied petrovka numbers and got the answering service on all of them working to retain his momentarily lost objectivity charlie acknowledged that it had been ridiculous to expect a worthwhile response so soon after the press conference as yet the appeal with its allimportant contact numbers was virtually confined to television coverage and the late editions of two evening newspapers and so far the tv coverage would not have been seen by anyone working normal office or factory hours charlie was encouraged by the one early evening tv repeat he had already seen in his suite by the stations assurances of two additional and longer segments later that night and the promise of an extended although edited version being carried the following day he wasnt though encouraged by his own hesitant stumbling and very visible perspiration during the press conference questioning by his own judgement hed appeared amateurish suspiciously ill at ease and haphazardly disheveled alongside the other three men briefly allowing a thought of natalia to emerge from the locked part of his mind charlie hoped she would not have watched the full live coverage the victor savoring his triumph said the easily recognizable voice behind him you staying with fake scotch charlie asked halliday not needing to turn to identify the man its an acquired taste accepted the mi man settling on the adjoining stool whats the triumph asked charlie ordering from the attentive bartender been watching satellite tv said halliday cnn got hold of the viewing figures for your event to compare with those of stepan lvovs keynote speech to his partys annual assembly you got percent against lvovs his people are going to be pissed off with that the success or otherwise of stepan lvovs election isnt in the forefront of my mind dismissed charlie its picking up elsewhere remarked halliday time magazine made him and that gorgeous marina their cover story this weekthe man to revolutionize russia for the second time thought you would have seen it ive had a few others things on my mind said charlie sourly and now youre going to get a hell of a lot more predicted halliday really thought paulajane and i would be seconded to help with the workload there was a throb in charlies left instep along with the thought that hed be running out of comejoinme tickets if hed turned it all into a commercial venture you know the problem involving embassy personnel in highprofile situations like this paulajanes really upset thinks its personal do you and paulajane get included in everything that london decides here im sure i do its a question of courtesy what about paulajane questioned charlie i get the impression she does too said halliday what do you think about reg stout what about reg stout halliday actually turned for a more direct confrontation glass suspended before him charlie ill give you the benefit of the doubtjustfor keeping paulajane out but i know that you know about reg its the only thing anyones talking about at the embassy you ask me robertson and his band of merry men were pretty fucking inefficient taking so long to expose the obvious at least now the embassy is finally secure is it asked charlie doubtfully he had his question answered when back in his suite he tuned into the late evening ort stations news which quoting informed sources led with the disclosure of reg stouts arrest and the suggestion that the embassy security man was involved in the murder investigation as well as the spy hunt by the time charlie reached the embassy the following morning just after seven the message capacity on one of his dedicated telephones was blocked by the overflow of incoming calls and the register on the second showed there was less than two minutes recording space left there were just three minutes remaining on his personally assigned line it only took seconds for two of fishs technicians to download the messages from all three instruments each of which was switched to speaker reception practically every call they reviewed was a media demandworldwide approaches almost equaling those from within russiafor comment or more information on the previous nights ort disclosure so were all but seven on the overnight tapes three of the outstanding seven were cranks one again from the singing communist zealot charlie ordered all but four of these callseach duplicates from ortto be wiped with no intention of responding of the four that remained three were from men the other from a woman two of the men insisted the murder of the onearmed man to be a gang killing offering an identity for moneyone for the other forwhich had to be left in advance at designated places before theyd call back with the name the third man who didnt leave a return number said he personally knew the victim and would make contact again the woman who sounded old thought the onearmed man was her husband who hadnt returned from the siege of leningrad during the great patriotic war one exception on charlies personally allocated line was from bill bundy the cia man said you feel in need of a sympathetic ear youve got my number charlie robertson was as pissed off as hell at being called back to london said fish whod remained in the room with his technicians listening to every playback hell be even more upset about the tv disclosure im sure he will be agreed charlie philosophically fish indicated the tape still containing the television station approaches you going to return those i need to know whos still leaking from inside this embassy you think the stations going to tell you i wont know unless i ask will i said charlie a woman answered the ort number her voice lifting the moment charlie identified himself we very much appreciate your calling back mr muffin you are harry fish turned from the apparatus he was now operating alone nodding confirmation that the sound levels were providing a perfect recording i am svetlana modin orts main news anchor your information at yesterdays conference was extremely useful fish gave a thumbsup nodding approvingly at the identification and mouthing that they had her image on film you called me invited charlie his feet beginning to throb in warning there was just the slightest uncertainty in the laugh we certainly have a lot to discuss about what the laugh was stronger this time about your security chief reginald stout the man close to you on the platform yesterday are you recording this conversation demanded charlie i can assure you that we at ort are jealous of our integrity and consider accuracy the cornerstone of our journalism thats not an answer to my question do you want me to stop the recording your integrity didnt extend sufficiently to your telling me what you were doing ive stopped doing it now why dont you come to speak to me here at the embassy with a film crew the woman asked urgently no definitely not with a film crew refused charlie i will see you here in one hour i have also recorded this conversation you will not be allowed to bring any recording equipment into the embassy dont attempt any hidden devices after openly surrendering an obvious machine at the gatehouse the room in which we meet will be electronically protected against any attempted recording i cant accept those restrictions the woman tried to argue hurriedly then there is no purpose in continuing this conversation or in your coming here goodbye no blurted svetlana anxiously okay i accept the conditions that sounded pretty good to me suggested fish as charlie replaced the telephone but i still dont imagine shell give you her source reflectively charlie said i think svetlana modins a very very clever lady and that she thinks i am a very very stupid man which is hardly surprising after my performance can you get me a written transcript of that conversation did i miss something fish frowned i think the definite intention was that i should judged charlie we still got yesterdays cameras on the gatehouse yes and theyre still operational in robertsons inquiry room with all the recording gear there yes said fish can you record whatever conversation i have with her there while at the same time preventing her using a concealed device it wont be perfect said the electronics expert cautiously but still audible i can enhance it later why dont you tell me whats going on charlie i will when im sure myself charlie watched fish hurry from the room adding another uncertainty to all his others why hadnt pavel made contact by now it was irrefutable logic that the russian wouldshouldhave done so after the television revelation quite irrespective of all the petrovka lines being tapped by guzovs fsb when charlie got the answering machines on two of pavels numbers and an unavailable signal from the thirdwhich charlie assumed to be jammed to overflowinghe rang the main petrovka switchboard the operator insisted that no one in the headquarters building knew the militia colonels whereabouts there was no reply from the personal line charlie had for mikhail guzov and although there was a listed number for the federalnaya sluzhba bezopasnosti charlie held back from ringing it reminding himself that he was not officially supposed to know that the man was a serving officer charlies frustration was broken by harry fishs return two closely typed foolscap pages in his hand now ive read what she said as well as hearing it id say svetlana modin is one hardassed bitch charlie didnt speak until hed read the transcript through himself twice on his third reading he worked on the typed pages deleting and rearranging the context finally looking up at the other man charlie said id say shes a hardassed professional and that shes going to think shes got me by the balls even before she gets here he handed the marked pages back to fish and said you think you can keep our master copy but make another record still in our respective voices what ive written there fish looked quizzically up from what charlie had created they surely wouldnt do this you told her yourself that we were making our own copy we could refute it remember the golden rule of propaganda urged charlie tell a lie enough times to a big enough audience and itll become the truth both men looked toward the suddenly ringing telephone at once recognizing hallidays voice on the speaker phone for christs sake turn on your television the picture that flickered on to the screen was a virtual replay of the media scrum outside the embassy gates the previous day the frenzy greater now because of reg stout and his two escorts being the focus in its very center robertson and his two panelists were separately surrounded by more jostling yelling journalists and cameramen there were two uniformed british airways stewards attempting as ineffectually as three uniformed russian militia officers to force a path along the airport concourse to the waiting london flight as charlie and fish watched the tv camera abruptly zoomed in upon the embassy security officer tight enough to show his escorts were gripping stout by either arm to force him on and that the man was struggling against them his head thrown back as he shouted inaudibly the russian voiceover commentary was of stout demanding protection by the russian authorities and for the militia officers to intercede to prevent his kidnap back to england he is saying reported the commentator that in london he will be put on trial for his life the charge will be treason the maximum penalty for which is the death sentence despite the united kingdom supposedly no longer having capital punishment on its statute books jesus christ exclaimed fish id like what i wrote back on the recording and ready for replay before svetlana modin gets here said charlie shes due in fifteen minutes and i dont expect her to be late she wasnt from the concealment of the gatehouse charlie decided that if svetlana modin was indeed as hardassed a professional as she was attractive he was confronting a formidable adversary the jacket of her fullskirted dark brown business suit was cut wide to make the browntrimmed yellow shirt a part of the ensemble one too many buttons unfastened to hint at the deep cleavage beneath the blond hair meticulously fashioned by an attendant hairdresser brushed her shoulders and on the second by second countdown to a live transmission a makeup girl applied lastminute touches to an eyebrow that arched questioningly on cue as the woman began her piece to camera enclosed as he was charlie was unable to hear what she was saying but saw almost overexpansive gestures toward the embassy and from the reaction of other journalists and cameramen closest to her guessed the woman was announcing her impending exclusive entry into the embassy he was proved right when with her camera still running svetlana modin handed her microphone to an expectant sound recordist before walking to the gatehouse door where she stopped and posed before pushing into the entry control area once over the threshold she relaxed the tightly fixed presentation smile twitching the cramp from her face and began i have an appointment before she saw charlie at the far side of the shadowed cubicle she said thank you mr muffin for inviting me here to talk at length about the murder and everything else that has happened in and around the embassy there was an agreement about recording reminded charlie because of which i have not brought a machine with me you have no recording equipment whatsoever smiling svetlana held her arms away from her body stretching the shirt further over the impressive breasts and said search me if you wish lets go into the complex invited charlie he remained silent as they crossed the forecourt at the main building he said no unauthorized electronic equipment works now i told you i dont have any electronic equipment i heard what you told me assured charlie ushering her into robertsons interrogation room svetlana said at once this looks like a torture chamber nothing electronic works in here either you really dont believe im clean do you did you really expect me to not if youre the intelligence agent i believe you to be thats what you are arent you an agent to svetlanas obvious bewilderment charlie said were ready her frown cleared at the entry of harry fish a flashlightlike device in his hand a club to beat me with are you still willing to be searched now her face hardened why shouldnt i be are you still willing to be searched for electronic recording equipment repeated charlie formally svetlana smiled once more extending her arms in an expansive invitation enjoy harry fish was professionally painstakingly thorough standing behind her to sweep every inch of svetlanas back and sides even going over the curtain of hair beneath which something might have been concealed reversing from the heels of her shoes to their toes to start ascending from her front a bleep accompanied the sharp flash on fishs sensor when he got to the top of the womans thighs there it is said the man unnecessarily youll be escorted to a cloakroom to take off whatever recording apparatus youve got under your clothes announced charlie slowly provocatively svetlana lifted her skirt above her waist she wasnt wearing any underwear the brown stockings were supported by a black lace suspender belt framing her natural blondness the device was strapped around her right thigh tight against her crotch not looking at the woman exposing herself harry fish said its a microphone ignoring her too charlie said would it have transmitted from the gatehouse and coming across the courtyard yes confirmed fish at once eventually looking back to svetlana who was letting her skirt gradually drop charlie recited thank you mr muffin for inviting me here to talk at length about the murder and everything else thats happened in and around the embassy that really was too scripted although i didnt expect the pubic demonstration as well take the microphone off the skirt rose again why dont you help me both of us or do you have a preference asked charlie she shrugged im a fun person charlie jerked his head backward your vaginas been on camera now for close to five full minutes maybe longer you look closely you can see the fisheye lens just above the light switch on the wall opposite you and my sound system isnt affected by what will have destroyed yours once you got inside the embassy i cant imagine that you thought youd get away with it i even warned you the microphone came away from her groin with a crackle of tornapart velcro with the second descent of the skirt motherfucker listen said charlie smiling and nodding to harry fish at fishs press of the replay button the room was filled with the sound of charlies edited version of his earlier telephone conversation with svetlana modin dominated by her voice svetlana modin we very much appreciate your calling mr muffin i am svetlana modin orts news anchor we certainly have a lot to discuss about your security chief reginald stout i can assure you that we at ort are jealous of our integrity and consider it the cornerstone of our journalism charlie why dont you come to speak to me here at the embassy i will see you here in one hour svetlana okay i agree and accept the conditions you set out earlier im not suggesting that is precisely how you planned the edit but its pretty close isnt it screened with the scenes at sheremyetevo airport this morning youd have had another world exclusive wouldnt you you really are a motherfucker arent you well complete the check shall we harry the second microphone was between the fulsome cups of her bra black lace to match the suspender belt charlie said lets not fuck about with helping you disconnect it just take it off as she did so quickly buttoning her blouse afterward svetlana modin slumped into the interrogation chair legs splayed but covered what do you want the name of your informant you know i wont do that ive got a much better idea you give me something ill give you something if youre as clever as youre making yourself out to be youll have the name and ill have the exclusive i hope to get hows that sound you were too obvious with the way your framed your questions from the word go on the telephone but i never expected the pussypeek youd be surprised how often its worked before charlie turned to harry fish you think you could run that part of the film on which svetlanas proving herself to be naturally blond fish made the connection within minutes beckoning the russian to the small viewing screen from which she very quickly looked up very enticing even if i say so myself whats your point your international as well as national fame if i released that footage to all your rival moscow tv stations as well as those throughout europe america and asia your vaginaeven with the necessarily discreet editingwould have phenomenal viewing figures alongside the edited and unedited tape of our telephone conversation wed describe it as evidence of how farup to and including blackmail and sex with your invitation to harry and me to take the first microphone offyoure prepared to go to get what you want ive got enough to face you down you bastard and ive got film of your openly offered and freely displayed crotch whose face is going to be redder yours or mine it was an anonymous caller said the woman tightly male or female it sounded male but it was difficult to be sure why it was distorted through a synthesizer in russian or in english russian a genuine russian speaker or with an accent there was an accent what sort of accent the synthesizer made it impossible to guess try i cant how soon after the press conference here an hour maybe an hour and a half id just gotten back to the studio id told the switchboard to put any calls that referred to the press conference directly through to me wed made an appeal for callers throughout the morning tell methe actual words the caller used svetlana gave another of her familiar openarmed gestures i cant remember the exact words try charlie said it was something like i have information about the conference at the british embassy the man on the far right of the platform the one who didnt say anything hes been arrested for spying its to do with the listening devices that were found earlier thats as much as i can remember youre lying accused charlie that sort of conversation couldnt have been within a ninetyminute time frame stout was still being questioned an hour and a half after the end of the conference maybe it was longer than an hour and a half doesnt your recorder have a time counter svetlanas face twitched i dont remember the precise timing there was sufficient time for me to catch the main news bulletin you went to a lot of trouble when i first called you today telling me how important integrity and accuracy is to your station so set out the sequence in more detail for me you get an anonymous call from someone whose gender you cant even identify because theyre using a synthesizer i asked him questions so tell me the first thing he said it was something like i have information about the murder at the embassy charlie made as if to speak but didnt not immediately then he said lets go back to integrity and accuracy what did you do to substantiate the information you got from your anonymous caller before going on air svetlana looked steadily across the space separating them her mouth a tight line only broken when she said im getting very pissed off with this dont for a single mistaken moment imagine that i wont do what i warned you i would if you tried to fuck me about as i think youve tried to fuck me about ever since we began talking so you know what were going to do to achieve a lot more a lot quicker were going to stop now youre going to go back to the station and you are going to get me the tape you recordedthe original not a copy charlie gestured to the silent harry fishi know youll take a copy but hell know if youve doctored it in any way and if you do ill expose you more effectively than youve ever exposed yourself before and youre going to tell me who you called here at the embassy to confirm reginald stouts detention is there anything ive said that you dont understand or need me to explain in more detail svetlanas face had been reddening as charlie talked and now it was blazing you shouldnt talk to me like this imagine you can talk to me like this noon stipulated charlie ill be waiting charlie was halfway back across the courtyard after escorting svetlana modin to the gatehouse having enjoyed her furious gestures to her crew to stop filming her emergence outside when harry fish came hurriedly out of the embassy waving him back into the building what is it demanded charlie hear for yourself said the electronics expert bustling charlie into the elevator to the apartment where the dedicated telephones were recording incoming calls one of fishs technicians was by charlies personal line and as they entered the room the man depressed the replay button the voice in russian began charlie ive got before the room reverberated with a deafening roar charlie said that was pavels voice fish said and that was a gunshot charlie muffin was again swept by a feeling of deja vu the comparisons everywhere the same mortuary in which hed first seen the body of the onearmed man facing across his dissecting table the same pathologist with mikhail guzov hovering at the mans shoulder as hed hovered then and sergei romanovich pavel had been killed the same way as the first victim by a single shot to the back of the head although this time the bullet had not been hollownosed or had dumdum crosses carved into its tip so the face apart from the absurdly neat exit wound to the forehead remained comparatively intact although the mans nose was broken and his left cheek lacerated from the force with which the impact had smashed him into the wall of the telephone kiosk charlie wasnt sure if the deathmask grimace had also been caused by that impact or if pavel had felt a brief second of agony mikhail guzov said hed been searched pockets pulled inside out but he wasnt robbed some coin was lying around the body as well as his wallet with some rubles still in it twenty dollars in american money too what about his militia identification still in his jacket pocket and his gun was in its holster he was most likely killed by a makarov too offered vladimir ivanov ill confirm that when i complete the autopsy forensic will positively identify the compressed remains of the bullet they dug out of the kiosk frame where was it the kiosk asked charlie the questions more instinctive than formulated to a pattern the greater part of his concentration on why guzov had so quickly included him particularly after the previous tv entrapment at petrovka by the time guzov arrived personally at the embassy an hour earlier charlie had already been alerted to pavels murder by the obediently returning svetlana modin with the tape of the anonymous tip of stouts detention shed still been there when guzov arrived at the embassy recognized the man at once and just as quickly addressed him familiarly by his patronymic which was another memorizedforlater curiosity as was guzovs apparent willingness to confirm to the woman that pavels murder was unquestionably linked to that of the onearmed man which had provided her with another exclusive to mitigate charlies earlier outmaneuvering at the junction of bogoslovskij and palashevsky identified the russian intelligence agent without hesitation two busy innercity roads in broad daylight exclaimed charlie knowing the location guzov shook his head bogoslovskij is closed off for roadwork theres a lot of drilling which would have covered the sound of a shot we havent been able to find any witnesses no one who heard anything wouldnt the roadwork and the drilling have still made it a bad choice persisted charlie hoping to encourage the russian further was it a good idea to have brought pavels murder tape with him theres no indication that he had made a call the telephone was still on its rest when his body was found by one of the workmen farther along the street if it hadnt been it might have given us a lead its possible he was lured there charlie briefly hesitated before taking from his pocket the cd harry fish had copied from the master tape of pavels call offering it to the russian charlie said he did make a call to me he manages three wordscharlie ive gotbefore the sound of the shot theres no disconnection sound but theres noise in the background which i now guess was the roadwork charlie ive got echoed guzov what the hell had sergei romanovich got i doubt well ever know accepted charlie if hed written it down it would have been found by whoever went through his pockets maybe why he was searched why replace the telephone persisted guzov to prevent the call being traced said charlie i didnt get the impression of anyone listening trying to discover if hed made a connection there was a noise which until now i couldnt identify then silence ive been put in charge of the investigation into pavels murder disclosed guzov straightening at his side of the dissection slab as if expecting a confrontation which you told svetlana modin was connected to the first murder whyd you do that hopefully itll make the killers think we know more than we do that pavel told others what he was doing charlie didnt completely follow the other mans reasoning but decided against questioning it lets hope youre right and they make a mistake we can follow my being put in charge of the russian side of the investigation means well be working together sharing everything said the russian staring very directly at charlie across the corpse which the fsb had been determined to achieve from the outset recalled charlie and which probably explained guzovs quick arrival at the embassy the obvious preparedness to include him in the most preliminary of medical examinations surely not charlie thought as his reflection lengthened into a possible conclusion surely the fsb wouldnt have taken their determination to the extreme of sacrificing a militia colonel whod openly opposed them as sergei romanovich pavel had done why wouldnt they charlie at once asked himself pavel had even suspected he was being set up as a sacrifice although not literally there was an unarguable logic in guzov taking over pavels role the switch from militia to fsb cosmetically easy to adjust by stressing guzovs prior participation i look forward to that if the head of your embassy security is responsible for planting the listening devices hell break under interrogation suggested the other man i would expect him eventually to make a confession mildly qualified charlie when he does youll have to finally concede that no agency of the russian federation is in any way involved in a security breach within your embassy nor in the death of the still unidentified man said guzov when that is accepted well be able to make progress in solving both crimes instead of constantly wasting time charlie muffin knew all his faults and failings but hypocrisy was not on his selfcriticizing list neither was it a factor in the unsettling uncertainty that he began to feel as the day progressed which was inconceivably that russian intelligence might not be implicated in the bugging of the british embassy and genuinely sought not just to resolve the murder of the onearmed man but now that of militia colonel sergei romanovich pavel from the mortuary he drove with the russian directly to petrovka where he was presented with sheaf after sheaf of transcripts of telephone responses to the press conference and with a minimal selection of actual tape recordings the overwhelming majority of the printed log contained exactly the samedeja vu againpress approaches with a similar sprinkling of crank and confidence trickster demands for money in advance of information there were six separate sheets each with its relevant tape segment that were selected as possibly informative although none was sufficiently complete to be acted upon three had been traced to public telephones and guzov anticipated charlie by saying that none was that of the kiosk in which pavel had been shot charlie was impressed by the infrastructure assembled to monitor the inflow the assigned telephones all in a large room charlie guessed normally to be a conference facility but manned now by a staff of predominantly male operators on one side divided from its other by a pool of mostly female typists maintaining a simultaneously transcripted record of the tapes contents six peoplethree men and three womenwere in the center of the room pointed out by guzov as trained interrogators ready instantly to take a call from the initially alerted telephone operator who judged it sufficiently important to intercept and hopefully extend before any nervous disconnection none was summoned during the time charlie was in the room all were in civilian clothes as further confirmation that all were fsb after the practical demonstration guzov led the way back to pavels office which hed clearly commandeered it appeared much tidier than when pavel occupied it even during the ministerialattended conferences on the desk was a wooden frame its back to charlie intercepting charlies look guzov turned it to show pavel in the center of a family group and said he had three daughters the youngest will be six next month the month of sashas birthday too charlie recognized he was a day late with his promised call to natalia he said that looks an impressive setup speaking of the telephone room which charlie didnt imagine pavel having either the resources or the authority to have established nor did he believe that guzov and the fsb would have been able to create it in the short timea matter of hourssince pavels murder was that what pavel had been so anxious to tell himwarn himthat the fsb were quite literally in total control of the russian investigation irrespective of pavels attempted independence reducing that effort to irrelevance in fact it was an unavoidable speculation that at the same time did nothing to undermine charlies nagging thought that guzovs denials might be genuine guzov said does what you saw help to convince you of what stalled charlie that we are as anxious as you areas your country isto bring this investigation to its proper and hopefully quick conclusion said guzov as i believe is the case in your country there is always a greater more personal commitment to solve a murder in which a law officer is the victim shouldnt we stop dancing around a situation and stop distrusting each other until there is a real and positive reason for that distrust the russian smiled which we both know and expect to happen before its all over i think perhaps we should allowed charlie the tip about stout was definitely made through a synthesizer confirmed harry fish ive already had it transcribed in full its pretty much as svetlana modin paraphrased what about the sex of the caller asked charlie accepting the transcript the electronic expert shook his head its not the usual sort of synthesizer there seems to be an additional distorting device that jumbles the tonal range you telling me you cant decide whether the voice is male or female it renders whats recorded to be virtually androgynous and youre also going to tell me youve never confronted anything like it before said charlie sighing right confirmed fish hefting in his hand the russian recordings what do you want me to do with these in an uninterrupted rush of impatience charlie said run every check to establish if theyve been tampered with whether theyre genuineparticularly if the callers were indigenous russian or from any of the other republics or outside foreignerswhether the calls were from public telephones or private lines anything identifiable in the background that cant ordinarily be heard without enhancement to suggest a location and whatever else you think might help you going to work with guzov demanded fish charlie was surprised there hadnt been any response by now from the directorgeneral to everything hed filed to london after his return from petrovka surprised too that it had taken fish so long to start asking the recorded question to be relayed back to thames house on channels to which he had no access with pavel lying dead in the mortuary guzov is now my only link to the russian investigation dont you find it curious that pavel had us dollars in his wallet whats your point just that theres nothing whatsoever to be curious about insisted charlie us dollars are the currency of russia moscow particularly it has been since before that even he pulled out a bundle of mixed notes from his own pocket ive probably got fifty dollars or so myself it was the currency he provided natalia in cash and by post and at irregular dates and amounts to avoid creating a pattern judging a regular electronic transfer from an english to moscow bank too liable to arouse suspicion over time so far surprisingly nothing had been lost fish shrugged no longer interested surely you dont think guzovs given you these to prove the russians are genuinely going to work with you it would be stupid to turn my back on anything without seeing whats in it for me which was charlie accepted the central core of his rigidly followed survival credo i really wouldnt like to do my job charlie wearily finished for the other man you told me now tell me something else the leak of stouts arrest came from inside the embassy so who in this embassy has the need for or access to a voicedistorting synthesizer fish considered the question paulajane venables and david halliday but as far as i knowand its my job to knowthe synthesizers that we and mi supply to its officers do not include the gender distortion facility we both also know reg stout couldnt have been orts source he was already incommunicado with robertsons heavies at either elbow theres another source within this fucking embassy im going around in so many tight circles im expecting to disappear up my own ass protested fish just as exasperated you survive thisand i dont think youve got a chance in hell of survivingand im told ive got to work with you on something else ill do whatever i can up to and including killing myself to avoid it you contaminate and bring down everyone and everything with whom you come into contact charlie let some silence into the cavernous room intrigued at the unexpected outburst you got something more you want to tell me harry point out to you qualified the other man quietvoice now seemingly embarrassed dont you think you might be next on the murder list after sergei pavel i certainly believe its a possibility i might be expected to think lets hope some poor innocents dont get caught up in the crossfire some poor innocents like natalia and sasha thought charlie and wished he hadnt no longer opposednot even questionedby transport officer howard barrett charlie improvised on basic tradecraft dispatching three unoccupied embassy pool cars in three different directions before uncomfortably hiding himself in the rear of the fourth to run the embassy gauntlet redirecting his first time driver after awkwardly hauling himself up from the concealing foot well he halted the car in less than a mile descending to the metro on the sokolniceskaja line at park kultury and carriage jumping between stations and three interconnecting lines for an additional thirty minutes before finally with aching feet regaining ground level at kitaygorod satisfied that he was alone he was lucky with the guess initially to go along novaka almost at once locating a telephone kiosk at its staraja intersection its me proudly announced a childs voice on the second ring charlie swallowed against the unexpected difficulty in his throat is your mother there he consciously turned protectively to put his back toward the wall against which the kiosk was built there was a swirl of traffic but few people none showing any interest in him yes charlie could hear sasha breathing not calling for natalia can i speak to her shes in the kitchen will you ask her to come to the phone whats your name charlie had to swallow again please call your mother to the telephone charlie heard the sound of natalias approach and of sashas voice away from the mouthpiece say its a man who is this demanded natalia me said charlie unthinkingly repeating sashas identification oh sashas very good on the telephone she likes answering it natalias voice was neutral neither welcoming nor rejecting im sorry i didnt call when i said i would i didnt expect you to i guessed youd understand i feel it doesnt matter it matters a lot said charlie whats happened hasnt made things any easier i told you id get out of the business had he charlie asked himself he couldnt remember when she didnt respond he said natalia im in a mess dont know what to say she suddenly blurted charlie was surprised not able to recall natalia ever sounding so uncertain lost even another impression a hope began to form we were going to talk about meeting you sure you can safely do that now hed never been safe in his life reflected charlie you know ill never put you or sasha at any risk wouldnt ever endanger either of you im not sure he couldnt let her uncertainty grow give her any reason to refuse i wont allow any risk ive promised to take sasha to mcdonalds on saturday charlie was jolted by the recollection that mcdonalds was where the onearmed man had most likely eaten his last meal bulldozing her not allowing her any escape he said how do you want me to do it be there and approach you natalia hesitated just come in i want time to be sure you take time ordering look about for a seat when you get your meal if i look directly at you itll be okay if i ignore you its not or at least i dont think its okay there was a muffled sound of someone calling which charlie didnt hear not sufficiently even to decide if it was sasha clearly turning away from the telephone natalia said in a minute charlie began who was but abruptly stopped there was another pause before natalia said no ones here with me apart from sasha im sorry so am i how will you explain to sasha what im doing at mcdonalds that youre someone i know it will be all right but you must be sure youre clean there was nothing to be gained from trying further reassurance how long does it take you to get there half an hour what time will you arrive lunchtime say twelve dont leave the apartment until i call to tell you its okay that i can make it ill still take her of course even if you say you cant make it thats why its important you dont have to tell me the importance of anything maybe i just need to keep telling myself said natalia betterfar betterthan hed hoped assessed charlie as the conversation ended this right now would have been her moment her arms length opportunity to tell him everything was over between them but she hadnt more than that even very much more shed agreed to meet him with sasha she wouldnt do thateven contemplate thatif shed already made her final irrevocable decision but enough for the moment until saturday charlie got back to the savoy in time for the main evening news which as he expected was led by anchorperson svetlana modins overexaggerated claim to have another world exclusive based on her fortunately coincidental encounter with two of the senior investigators into both murders there were photographs of pavel but neither charlie nor guzov were initially named although there was footage of the press conference and of the kiosk in which pavel had been shot there was also predictably a lot of locationestablishing footage of svetlana going in and out of the embassy she relied heavily upon impressivesounding although empty cliches like major international exchanges between moscow and london being considered at the highest levels and used the word major againas well as sensationalwhen she hinted at impending developments just as charlie believed hed escaped identification there was more footage showing him dismissing a question about a highly trained international and professional murder incorporated assassination squadwhich at the time hed refused even to speculate uponedited to appear instead as if hed suggested such a ridiculous possibility and that there was indeed an international search for such a group with airline checks and requests to worldwide intelligence agencies charlie was conscious of several looks of recognition as he went through the lobby on his way to his nightly barstool ritual sure that in turn he recognized the girlalthough tonight with a different surveillance partnerwhod played the role of a handholding lover the night of guzovs unexpected visit sure of guzovs professionalism charlie knew her repeated presence was not an oversight but something he was intended to recognize maybe even a warning against established routine theyd briefly discussed such precautions during the drive between the mortuary and petrovka it was perhaps something to which he needed to pay more and closer attention although not so much for his own safetywhich he never endangeredbut for the now absolutely essential security for his saturday rendezvous the bartender and the already poured vodka were waiting when charlie got to his wallprotective stool as charlie settled himself the man said i reserved it for you ill do that from now on shall i id appreciate it accepted charlie the program being shown mute on the bar television was that which followed the evening news so the man would have seen the transmission charlie guessed at an approach from the way the bartenders attention switched beyond him and turned from his corner before bill bundy reached him charlie said i think i need to employ an appointments secretary what the american frowned i seem to get a lot of visitors here im not surprised youre getting enough publicity to stand against stepan lvov smiled bundy the predicted new russian president and reason for bundys return to moscow charlie remembered after a momentary blankness itll be mineral water right ill break the seal reminded bundy in russian and loud enough for the bartender to hear more quietly the american said tried you earlier at the embassy to make sure you were all right not involved i mean what do you mean queried charlie the accident havent you heard what accident one of your embassy cars got driven off the embankment road there was a piece on the tass wire when i couldnt get you i spoke to paulajane she told me the driver was pretty smashed upmight have broken his back even she said she hadnt heard from you all day charlie swallowed against the sudden nausea what about the other car involved didnt stop said bundy the militia are looking for it you catch tonights television news there wasnt anything about it on the channel i saw i wasnt talking about the accident i meant svetlana modins i knew it was going to be screened said charlie forcing the calm why hadnt paulajane or hallidayanyonemade contact to tell him about the accident which hadnt been an accident at all because he hadnt told anyone about the exit subterfuge and no one had made the connection yet why are you feeding her exclusives im not its a confused story which youre not going to tell me anticipated bundy charlie didnt bother to reply gesturing instead for another drink bundy said you know guzov your new partner is big time fsb of course i do he tell you himself he didnt have to pavel did and could have been killed for doing so charlie thought did he tell you guzovs a general sits on the top floor no he didnt admitted charlie thered only be the nightduty officer at the embassy this late charlie calculated hed have to wait until tomorrow to find out anything more guzov will use you in each and every which way he can warned the american as ill use him said charlie we all know the rules bill youre here all by yourself you really think you can compete with the resources hes got ill do my best you know why pavel got whacked you got any theories bundy shook his head the most obvious is that he had something and from your hugger mugger press conference performance and how svetlana spun her piece tonight the even more obvious inference is that if he did have something youve got it too which id say makes you target numero uno wouldnt you its crossed my mind and was now very firmly fixed in the forefront of it threatening the determination not to panic youre not impressing me with all this flip talk charlie youre in the crosshairs and you know it so did natalia charlie knew and would think so even more if the accident was reported in any media like i said we all know the rules i also know we didnt hit it off in the past to become friends but im talking to you now at least as a colleague in the same business a concerned colleague i appreciate that said charlie keeping the disbelief from his voice but i didnt come here tonight to tell you that or about the accident it had taken the american long enough thought charlie what then you didnt call me back i was getting round to it you heard from london today no said charlie which hed expected to after pavels killing my people at langley have officially approached yoursmi toowith an offer to help in any way we can lets face it charlie you need all the help you can get and probably a lot of protection charlie thought i dont like armies people get in other peoples way and mistakes happen ive never liked the phrase friendly fire it was langleys idea i just thought you should know before being told officially charlie was disappointed bundy didnt lie more convincingly you going to show guzov the same consideration you know as well as i do how welland how muchweve worked with the russians in the past as you have but thats not the game plan this time what is the game plan this time charlie echoed we work through you without telling guzov this investigation has become too public the fsb couldnt risk the embarrassment of it becoming known that were on board too lets face it this thing is leaking faster than the titanic much faster accepted charlie at least recognizing his way out of an american involvement even if there were an official edict from aubrey smith thats another good reason for the linkup you could transfer everything to the leakfree security of our embassy here cut that problem out of the loop for linkup read takeover thought charlie astonished at the unashamed hubris you seem to have thought it through to the end were offering help charlie im sure london will appreciate that as much as ive already told you i do i look forward to talking more tomorrow i guess we will bundy who hadnt bought a drink fingered the till receipts of those that charlie had purchased you need these for your expenses be my guest invited charlie remember what i said about taking care physical care i mean said bundy pocketing the slips i will promised charlie it was very easy after an almost sleepless night for charlie again to be at the embassy by seven the following morning sitting low but alert in the back of a taxi hed insisted draw right up to the savoy steps the overnight duty officer didnt know anything more than bundy the previous night nor was there any further information on the tass slip which halliday had left in his original office inscribed with his name and a lot of question marks to fill in the time charlie coordinated the advantage of his early arrival with the time difference between london and moscow to reach the directorgeneral the moment the man arrived at thames house and sat unspeaking for thirty minutes listening to aubrey smiths account of whitehall and american embassy meetings the previous day when smith finished charlie bluntly declared no after a moments surprised silence smith said bringing in midespite my personal dislike and suspicion of mis director gerald monsfordand the cia are convincing arguments we get a lot of extra manpower without risking any more from our own department we get out of a leaking embassy to which im sending robertson back to finish the job he clearly hasnt and if it ends up in a disaster which theres every indication it will we offload a hell of a lot of responsibility on to the americans and our doubtful mi friends across the river at vauxhall cross its a bullshit argument that scarcely stands examination rejected charlie its an attempted takeover of an investigation that has to remain under our control were you told at the american embassy that langley wants to work unofficially without telling the fsb from the silence charlie knew the directorgeneral hadnt been not in as many words let me spell it out without any inference demanded charlie okay i know guzov will cheat on me just as ill cheat on him if its necessary or advantageous for either of us but at the moment we are talking as fully and properly as we can expect harry fish tells me the material guzov made available hadnt been tampered with or doctored in any way if the russians learn were letting washington in by the back door the slamming of the front right in our faces will make a noise youll hear all the way over there theres a percent chance id be expelled along with a diplomatic ice age that will take years to thaw and moscow will be in the position theyve wanted to be from the beginning of this in charge of everything able to fudge everything and anything they want particularly the bugging of the embassy in which theres still an undetected informer and washington will lie insist wed asked for unofficial help on the side and come out squeaky clean which is probably their intention from the beginning my guess is that the russians would learn about it from washington and from what youve inferred about monsford christ knows what mis contribution would be you lost me about three turns back complained aubrey smith although without any irritation what reason is there for america getting involved in something that has nothing to do with them the cia and the american administration arent charities for christs sake try this scenario we accept the american offer they leak it to moscow claiming we sought their help which they refused russia gets full control we get frozen in the new and personal cold war and in a matter of months a new russian presidenta new russian president who seems to be the only item on the agenda of the american embassy heregets sworn into office who do you thinks going to be invited to form a new special relationship london or washington almost reflectively smith said this all began with the shooting of a onearmed man in a suit and cardboard shoes the first world war began with the shooting of an austrian archduke by a student in a suit and cardboard shoes reminded charlie its not the perfect analogy but its the closest i can think of so it will have to do weve got more meetings scheduled today disclosed the directorgeneral ill raise your points id like to be told at once of the final decision if any final decision is reached heavily qualified aubrey smith it was still only when charlie reached his compound apartment but harry fish was already there with his two monitoring technicians the man said at once im glad youre early knowing about the bugs in your hotel suite i held back from ringing you there is it the accident anticipated charlie whod put the reason for his being so early out of his mind during the confrontation with the directorgeneral no said fish frowning what keep everything separately compartmented charlie told himself he had to stay on top of whatever confronted him something i think could be important said the electronics expert pressing the replay button on a recording machine this is before enhancement but with the volume at its highest there was intermittent sound but charlie couldnt decided what it was or represented although twice he thought he heard what could have been a human voice he looked between the three other men shaking his head now the enhancement announced fish in his conjurors voice there was still a lot of indistinguishable sound but the human voice was identifiable now so were two outbursts of crying charlie positively translated from russian please oh please followed by weeping then do it there was a burst of recognizable wordsplease have to make more sobbing noise that meant nothing and finally the repeated click of a lost connection charlie again looked questioningly to fish so what is it a compilation of three calls the first within two hours of the press conference and initially dismissed as a crank approach someone ringing the number for no reason thereve been at least twelve and ive had every one reexamined which is how we picked up the other two over following days the noise is traffic sound so its a public street telephone always put down before we can get number traces the timing is always the same though precisely ten minutes past noon and always on the first of our listed numbers its a womans voice i havent had it voiceprinted not yet but im going out on a limb to say its the same voice im also suggesting its a russian woman brought to tears trying to force herself to make the call but not being strong enough when the connection is made he paused im suggesting a pattern charlie considered what the other man had said the last call on the compilation that was yesterday right fish nodded her lunch hour id say i thought it might be an idea to have a human voiceyour voiceanswer the first number on our list at precisely ten minutes past noon today so do i agreed charlie looking at his watch there was just over three hours to fill before the possibility of her calling again coming back up to fish he said now tell me about the accident fish had just begun when halliday came into the apartment instantly picking up the conversation and nodding for the electronics sweeper to continue it only took minutes it had been the second of the decoy cars charlie had dispatched ahead of his own hidden departure the vehicle had got less than two hundred yards in the direction opposite from that in which charlie was traveling when an overtaking car cut in too sharply at that point the camber of the embankment road dipped toward the moskva close to where the argument had been staged to distract the gate guards the night the body of the onearmed man had been dumped at the embassy it had been instinctive for the driver to swerve in the direction of the river hed clipped the low embankment rail but the force of the collision had tipped the embassy car over it had rolled four times before coming to a halt at the waters barrier what about the other car demanded charlie hit and run said halliday traced yet halliday shook his head the only description was that it was big something like a fourbyfour registration persisted charlie too dirty to be read said halliday what about the driver of the embassy car hes got a fractured spine already on his way back to london in a hospital plane that came in overnight said halliday the prognosis is that hell certainly be paraplegic possibly quadriplegic who is he asked charlie expectantly halliday hesitated jack hopkins thats why i came up here when i heard you were in the embassy he was my regular driver finished charlie it had to be didnt it the man had only talked of just failing to qualify for the tottenham hotspur junior soccer squad charlie remembered but of being determined to coach his son to succeed where he hadnt when his moscow tour ended im here to talk to you the englishman you saw on television read about in newspapers you can talk to me just to me charlie spoke in russian very consciously keeping any urgency from his voice anxious that she didnt detect the other emotion surging through him even after the hour thered been for him to rationalize the only possible interpretation from the car ramming the reception volume was tuned to its highest without risking an earsplitting playback and charlie could clearly hear heavy breathing quick jerky gulping snatches magnified as the receiver was he could very definitely detect traffic noise the sticky tire sound against the street an occasional impatient horn burst dont be frightened you mustnt be frightened i promise nothing bad will happen ill look after you better that time proper comprehensible sentences her breathing sounded heavier positively panting talk to me tell me you understand what im telling you from his equipment bank harry fish hand signaled that the connection had been kept for two minutes not safe the words hissed out scarcely above a whisper it was a hoarse voice a smokers voice ill make it safe keep you safe cant i can and i will ivan said she began before stumbling into a coughing fit it was definitely a smokers cough a discernible wheezing what did ivan say tell me what ivan said hed spoken too loudly too demanding stop thinking about the car crash safe that hed be safe groped charlie hopefully concentrate on one thing only one thing he told himself killed him help me catch who killed him cant i can insisted charlie wanting the forcefulness in his voice now if you help me i can catch them no refused the voice just as forcefully and the line went dead hello hello repeated charlie shes gone announced fish unnecessarily you did well holding her as long as you did did you get a number demanded charlie we know the time shes going to phone if she phones again if we could find the kiosk we could stake it out identify her i told you that was what i was going to try to do did you do it fish shook his head i think the russians are trying to monitor the line can they asked charlie even more demanding there was another head shake ive washed all the lines to stop them being able to do that but their device blocks me in return electronically its a standoff after a pause charlie said i think she was genuine not a crank ill need a translation of the actual words said fish guardedly the tonethe fearcertainly sounded genuine unless unless what while you were talking it suddenly occurred to me that it could be an fsb trick testing you out you just told me they cant monitor the line hear whats said it was a reasonable suggestion from the other man from the accident report on hopkins theyd know theyd failed if it was a ploy they could plan it better the next time theyd know the call was made fish pointed out they can count them quite easily now that the calls are trailing off and just as easily know how long they last so far that day thered only been eight incoming contactsfour from journalists two cranks and two seeking money in advance of imparting promised informationin addition to that which charlie had just finished now charlie shook his head if guzov challenges me ill dismiss it as a crank a hysterical woman i didnt believe but i think shes our most likely he hesitated our only possibility in fact apart from the silent ones who didnt call back twentyeight who didnt call back itemized fish pedantically will this one asked charlie in selfreflection i think so you kept her on far longer than i expected thats what made me wonder if she might be a plant if she isnt shes someone who wants to talk but is too frightened and our onearmed man was named ivan charlie remembered would he ever know the name of his attempted murderer at once irritation overwhelmed the thought he wouldnt be able to protect himselfsurvive evenif he allowed himself to think nonsense like that what about her voice youve got the language i havent well educated high born low born what difficult from what little she actually said the hoarseness with which she said it my impression is well educated you intend telling anyone theres nothing to tell which wouldnt stop harry fish navigating his back channels to london charlie accepted and probably halliday whod fortunately left the apartment before the call would have already told his mi case officer in london of the car crash just as charlie was sure that fish would already have done all we can do now is sit and wait hopefully no longer than just after noon tomorrow maybe all youve got to do thought charlie he had a hell of a lot more than that to do and at that moment wasnt at all sure where to start paul robertsons returning inquiry team arrived during the course of the afternoon each traveling separately routing themselves through paris amsterdam and frankfurt only robertson came direct from london getting to the embassy ahead of the rest it was the directorgenerals idea hoping to avoid the sort of identification debacle we had going out explained robertson that was an absolute bloody nightmare im surprised he didnt send a different team said charlie harry fish had already been with the other man when charlie arrived in the retained inquiry room and he was curious if the man had already told robertson of that mornings telephone call or of the embankment crash you all right robertson asked charlie answering charlies uncertainty they failed said charlie this time said robertson whats the directorgeneral say we havent talked about it yet youll be going back to london of course no said charlie dont be ridiculous said the man whats ridiculous demanded charlie im reading it that i am close to something or someone theyre frightened that im too close this isnt the time to run thats what theyll be hoping having missed with the crash you think the directorgeneral will risk another killing well see said charlie hes under a lot of pressure in london said robertson he considered sending in an entirely new inquiry team to find this inside leak i argued against risking different people my group and i are already blown robertson was desperate to recover from his mistake recognized charlie and youve limited the number of people whove been told in advance so if the rest of your people get in unspotted and your return leaks youve got your list of suspects robertson smiled humorlessly and i know he only told you he was thinking of sending us back wheres this new indication of an inside whistleblower leave reg stout and all the others for that matter asked fish entering the conversation theyre all bound by the official secrets act under which we use different rules before we actually get into court until then theyre all guilty until proven innocent but stout cant be your man even though i found those bugs fish pointed out he was incommunicado from that moment on thats the defense hes trying ahead of even seeing a lawyer offered robertson im safe calls dismissed charlie exactly agreed robertson what questioned fish the embassy was known to be under investigation reminded robertson if stout didnt make a call any sort of contact at or on a rigidly fixed time schedulemiss one it could be circumstance miss two its alarm bells miss three hes in the baghis control knows hes lost him he didnt make his im safe call its a basic tradecraft routine added charlie youve never heard of it before im not operational indignantly protested fish flushed at the reaction from the other two men this is the closest ive ever got or ever want to be again i wish we were closer picked up robertson none of us is winning accolades at the moment back at thames house its a common concern said charlie thered be a concerted effort to get him withdrawn he accepted which perhaps absurdly strengthened his determination to stay to rebase would obviously be the safest thing to do but despite his apprehension he didnt want to run which was probably pride and common sense gone mad and came the everlooming awareness selfishly unfair on natalia and sasha fish who was nearer answered the telephone but handed it immediately to the spycatcher robertson smiled said good and smiled more broadly as he replaced the receiver all in undetected including the guards and the polygraph technicians lets hope our luck holds said harry fish it didnt that night svetlana modin once more led the ort main evening news bulletin with the disclosure of londons rejection of cia assistance predicting that it would result in a deterioration now of relationships with washington because of the refusal and with moscow who had been unaware of any possible collusion between the two western governments her report concluded with the announcement of the inquiry teams return to moscow which included footage of robertsons earlier airport departure melee fuck said charlie aloud in the solitude of his hotel suite and hesitated undecided when the telephone rang five minutes later finally snatching for it and was glad he did son of a bitch bill bundy loudly questioned charlie audibly to establish the callers identity was the american going to join the long line of commentators on the embankment crash you know damned well it is just as you damned well know how much shit youve dropped me in actually bill i dont know that at all i told you in advance what washington was doingthe offer we were makingas a friend your intervention to london has totally screwed me not the crash at all acknowledged charlie and there was no way the american could know of his conversation that morning with the directorgeneral i did nothing of the sort bill i said it would be londons decision remember all the vibes were good and then suddenly bang the door gets slammed in our faces you telling me you didnt have anything to do with that thats exactly what im telling you lied charlie hed never imagined there was going to be this amount of benefit from having harry fish leave the fsb listening devices in place recalling his doubts about the man charlie wondered if fish had installed his own bugs to record incoming conversations to the savoy suite trying to run everything as a oneman band as youre trying to do is going to fuck up bigtime i think this is something thats actually going to kill you so did a lot of others some actually trying very hard to make it happen im not trying to conduct a oneman band its a joint operation with the russians you know that mikhail guzov wouldnt give you a head cold unless it was guaranteed to turn into a fatal pneumonia i thought a pretty good relationship was developing okay so you tell me one just one useful scrap of information youve got from him were talking liaising ive heard you called many things over the years charlie until now naive wasnt one of them dont you think it was naive of you to expect that you could have worked unofficially with me without guzov discovering what was going on it stood a better chance of producing something than what youre left with now what im left with now is what ive got to live and work with i guess youre not going to live with it youre going to die because of it dont you think youre getting a little overdramatic here bill you suffering amnesia or alzheimers forgetting what happened to sergei romanovich pavel you got a theory about that bundy snorted a jeering laugh jesus h christ i dont think youre suffering amnesia i think its alzheimers you sucker me like youve just done and then expect me to offer you murder theories had london accepted your approach i would have expected you to bring something to the table now youre never going to know what help i could have provided are you buddy the americans vernacular like his dress sense really was in a time warp thought charlie its unfortunate you brought a decision between our two governments down to a personal level your loss charlie we could have walked away covered in glory now who was sounding naive thought charlie whatever he might minimally have gained from managing to extend his stumbling conversation with the terrified woman he could far too easily have lost by that evenings television disclosure which would have already been picked up for repetition in every newspaper the following morning when it would doubtless be repeated yet again not only by ort but by every other tv and radio station in moscow it was impossible for the caller to remain unaware of the latest twist in the already overtangled killing of the onearmed man would it frighten her away destroy any fragile confidence he might have instilled it was the most obvious possibility but then again there was an alternative the television presentation could work to his advantage rather than disadvantage if the unknown caller had seen it its thrust had been entirely upon the collapse of cooperation not just with america but with russia would she be able to rationalize through her fear that shed be safermore protected evenby his being ostracized by the russians charlies hesitation was longer when the telephone rang for the second time reluctant to talk on a line open to the fsb but conscious of the benefits if it were something he could use as hed just used bundys diatribe curiosity won over caution and the concern ebbed away at the voice of harry fish who knew of the russian bugging did you see ort yes said charlie all our dedicated lines are in meltdown everyones asking for you im referring them all to london surely the man hadnt forgotten what hed personally located here thats what i want all press calls referred to london four have been from your favorite tv anchorwoman who says shes going to go on calling every fifteen minutes until she gets to you personally i thought youd like to know what else did she say could he use her as hed used bundy just that apart from leaving a number why dont you let me have it you going to talk to her maybe shouldnt you get clearance from london shes fish paused her storys attracting a lot of attention maybe you should come back here now the man was trying to warn him about the listening devices charlie realized i might if i decide to call back give me the number anyway charlie dialed from the public telephone kiosk closest to the hotel the one near red square glad it was enclosed again with a protective wall to his back and with a view of about twentyfive yards over which to see any suspicious approach svetlana answered personally charlie said i dont want my phones blocked every fifteen minutes it might be someone important she laughed unoffended i really didnt expect you to come back to me what do you want despite the video recording he held as insurance he still had to very carefully weigh every word he uttered id say the points were about equal in the teachingeachotherlessons league wouldnt you from the background sounds charlie guessed she was talking from an open newsroom phone i didnt know it was a competition youre making it one i really dont want to screw up your investigation you know the arrangement im offering based upon her success over the past few days she had every cause for arrogance which is why dont we meet to talk about it charlie thought there was an eerie familiarity about the conversation you wont forget that i know where you keep your microphones hidden will you are you ever going to let me the bar at the metropol in an hour suggested charlie why not your room the bar ill be there she was ahead of him although charlie got there early she wore the clinging black dress in which shed appeared on the screen earlier but now high on her left shoulder there was a jeweled clip of what charlie was sure were genuine diamonds she sat majestically in the very center of a banquette champagne already poured from a bottlefrench not georgianresting in its cooler his concentration as he made his obvious way toward svetlana was as much upon identifying potential danger around her as it was upon the woman herself i tried to call your room but the desk told me that you werent staying here neutral territory said charlie which shed taken over by being first there was a second glass already waiting but charlie shook his head against champagne ordering vodka mikhail guzovs taken to dropping in unannounced i thought it would be better not to be interrupted although i got the impression at the embassy that you knew him quite well quite well she agreed cautiously if youve got with him the same sort of deal youre going to put to me he might have thought you were playing one of us off against the other did it occur to you he also might have thought you were my source no lied charlie svetlana touched her glass against charlies when his vodka was served and said you stay pretty concentrated upon the job dont you i got the same impression about you which makes us well matched whats your suggested deal svetlana waited for their attentive waiter to top up her glass how about you and i speaking before every evening transmission i tell you what im going to say you tell me anything that might seriously impede or endanger anything youre doing i cut it out surely she couldnt be serious if he accepted her offer it would give her a spreadopen map along which to track from what he asked her to omit every twist and turn of the investigation but by the same token she was offering him a map of her own which could lead him directly to the embassy informant which wasnt his investigation but also something he wasnt going to ignore give me an example how about the killers of your first victim and sergei pavel being so worried how close you are to them that they tried to kill you on the embankment hed got it right by agreeing to meet her charlie decided i dont want that broadcast its a good story that no one else has picked up on i thought the idea was not to screw my investigation as well as for me to get exclusives he had to be careful not to show his desperation you broadcast it i lose the lead ive got exaggerated charlie are you threatening me with the video recording are you going to make me svetlana regarded him expressionlessly for what seemed a long time if i hold off we agree to my deal from scouring the russian papers as intently as he had charlie knew she was right about no one else picking up on the connection and his concern was as much to avoid natalia learning about the attempt as the hoarsevoiced woman and if svetlana kept her promise there could be the other opportunities to manipulate things to his benefit i agree to the deal svetlana smiled gesturing the waiter to replenish their drinks and i get my exclusives he couldnt risk her having a change of heart charlie decided since putin got to power a lot of the freedoms achieved by gorbachev and yeltsin have been taken back or eroded particularly press freedom how long do you think you can go on like this she laughed genuinely amused think back before gorbachev and yeltsin to the bad old days how did the famous dissidents and nonconformists stay out of the gulags by becomingand stayingfamous in the west too well known to be moved against thats my point risked charlie if you keep cutting things when i ask you you could end up nights in a row with nothing to say okay so ive made the first concession accepted svetlana but i want the big ones those thatll make me untouchable forever i help you as ive just agreed to do and you give me your solemn undertaking that youll repay me at the end i get something thats going to keep me on tv screens around the world when you learn whatever the hells going on you tell me you also tell me how you finally got all the answers i get my global exclusive with enough to produce the supporting documentary you get your man and i give you all the credit hows that sound better than he could have hoped conceded charlie could there be some physical protection in it for him as well he couldnt at that moment imagine what but it was something to keep in mind the only obvious drawback was the one hed already identified that she had the same sort of arrangement with mikhail guzov not a problem charlie decided he was feeding the source not drinking from it it sounds like something to explore to our mutual benefit lets see how it works ill make it work so would he determined charlie since the relocation of the monitored telephones to the compound apartment charlie had virtually abandoned his original assigned rabbit hutch but on his way to the embassy the following morning he decided to check for any misdirected written messagesor anything elsethat might have been misdelivered nothing appeared to have been disturbed but on the card table to its left were neatly stacked by date hallidays englishlanguage publications to its right set out on a white sheet of a paper upon which was drawn a large question mark was a polished brass bell charlie was reaching hesitantly for it when through the leftopen door behind him paulajane said if it werent for those raftlike shoes which id recognize anywhere id believe id caught the embassy spy himself breaking into offices charlie turned leaving the bell how are you me i couldnt be better which i guess youd very very much prefer to be she was designerdressed as always the interlocking c of the chanel logo on the jacket buttons matching those on her suede loafer for the first time charlie acknowledged the coquettish similarity between paulajane venables and svetlana modin whod predictably ended their previous nights encounter with the clear invitation which hed just as clearly declined to share either her bed or his he wondered where pj hid her recording equipment sure there wouldnt be too much objection to his making his own discovery i assume youre talking of the car business invited charlie wanting to get it out of the way as soon as possible among other things said the woman you trying to convince me it really was an accident you wanted to see me i was sneaking in to get it back what frowned charlie the bell i put it there as a joke when i got back last night the lepers bell or for whom the bell tolls whatever id been to that american cafe with tex his final farewell and id drunk too much this morning i decided there was nothing funny about anything thats happened to you and wanted to get it back stop the whole stupid thing im sorry she appeared contrite which was something else he didnt expect its not the best joke thats ever been tried on me but thanks for trying to lighten the burden it should be me thanking you for not involving me youre probably well enough established to survive this other business with america as bill bundy is or would have been if youd let him in im sure as hell not charlie was immediately attentive was bill with you last night paulajane shook her head there was a big crisis meeting at the embassy apparently after the television broadcast tex was only able to make it because he wasnt any longer officially attached to the embassy hes flying back to the states today thered been an inference of an affair between pj and the american charlie remembered im not sure i can survive if i dont wrap it up soon the woman looked very directly at him ive heard things about you this wasnt pj the coquette things like what that you dont like to lose which is why you so rarely do irrespective of the shortcuts you take what do you want me to tell you demanded charlie trying to jar the innuendo into something more recognizable if youre not going to trust mewhich i know you dont from what you did during robertsons first investigationi cant expect you to tell me anything can i i thought you were grateful not to be involved the woman smiled wanly grateful doesnt begin to describe it im sad we got off to such a bad beginning and lost the colleaguetocolleague relationship though i could have learned a lot or lost a lot if you believe the car accident wasnt an accident the smile broadened how longs it going to be charlie how longs what going to be paulajane shrugged i suppose i should have known better but i thought id worked it out thought id run it by you see what youd say run what by me charlie continued to question refusing to volunteer anything london wouldnt have knocked washingtons offer back and you wouldnt have been isolated for so long by yourselfmy even being excluded despite all the diplomatic bullshitif you werent on the very edge of the big denouement thats going to knock everything and everyone on its ass what do you say to that charlies first reaction was to say that the vocabulary of people to whom hed spoken over the preceding twentyfour hours appeared to be remarkably similar instead he said i say that its very fanciful and i wish it were more realistic the woman remained silent and solemn faced for what seemed a long time so much for my trying to make things a little more pleasant between us i suppose i should have expected it she made another vague gesture behind him time to get back to the office work charlie glanced behind him what office work if you bother to look through what daves left youll see that the western media have well and truly adopted stepan lvov as their own even before hes elected the buzz phrase is russias new camelot inevitably london is asking for a full profile halliday told me hes already provided one for his people apparently we need our own daves given me all his stuff and tex passed on a lot more the smile was a frigid one some people work quite harmoniously with others as she turned to leave charlie said dont you want your bell she paused at the door you keep it charlie you might want to ring for help lets hope someone hears charlie made his way slowly from the main embassy building into the residential compound trying to decide if the previous thirty minutes really had been a genuine olive branch offer from an inexperienced operative on her initial overseas assignment firsttime appointeescertainly to a highprofile embassy like moscow which was rarely if ever a beginners postingwere rigidly vetted for any personal weaknesses and there certainly hadnt been any weak frailty during their initial encounter why then the near embarrassingly inept act not something to be mulled over at any length but perhaps mentally filed for later reference both duty operatorsone male one femalewere lounged in easy chairs disinterestedly flicking through outofdate newspapers their boredom shown in the log listing only four incoming calls after the tidal wave of the previous nights tv broadcast one of the four was from the familiarly ranting communist zealot two were new japanese press calls and the fourth was a heavybreathing blank the man said harry told me to tell you hed be along later around eleven hes with robertson in the inquiry room if you want him mikhail guzov wasnt at his petrovka telephone when charlie called he told the woman who answered that hed courier transcripts of the overnight contacts although there was nothing of significance and asked that guzov return his call slumping into another easy chair he managed to go through hallidays newspapers relieved there was still no reference to the embankment crash before fishs arrival whats robertson doing asked charlie expecting the molehunter to be in tow his job starting the reinterviews retorted fish more belligerent than unhelpful you tell him about the hopeful call you didnt ask me not to or that you should youre surely not expecting her to call again after last night and todays newspaper followups thats not really the point is it i dont think theres any longer much point in anything were doing here dismissed the electronics specialist did you call that anchorwoman back thats not a point of discussion either refused charlie raising a threedayold copy of the daily telegraph to create a physical barrier between himself and the other man an odd uncertain silence settled beyond charlies screen the operators found unexplained reasons to check and recheck their equipment and fish very obviously close to mockery constantly checked the time as it approached noon once loudly calling for the two operators to synchronize their watches with his charlie kept checking too at the same time as forcing himself to read the newspaper comments and poll predictions of the landslide victory in the forthcoming presidential elections of stepan lvov a minute to go if shes going to call announced fish unnecessarily charlie finally lowered his newspaper and said thanks disappointed he didnt convey the intended sarcasm all four watched register on their individual watches a full minute later fish said youve lost her as it was obvious you would the woman monitor coughed and began rummaging in her handbag fish said a good job you didnt tell london im pretty sure they know arent you said charlie how could started fish but was stopped by the telephone i couldnt decide im glad you did said charlie im frightened it was more a wheeze than hoarseness i know dont be we have to meet i need to be sure whatever you want tell me and ill do it whatever you want need to be safe ill make sure youre safe kept safe it wasnt so difficult for him to say today charlie could hear the growl of her breathing which sounded as if it was quickening as if the fear was building but he held back from speaking waiting for her tensed against the line suddenly going dead the other three in the room were tensed forward too the female operator with her cupped hands to her mouth charlie didnt understand the single word the hoarsevoiced caller said despite the magnification forcing the calmness he said what was that arbat she repeated you know the arbat yes i know the arbat moscows tourist flea market jammed with people the best place for a jostled easily escapable assassination he thought saturday go there on saturday natalias day was charlies immediate thought the day he had to meet natalia and sashaafter now trebly ensuring he was free of any unwanted companyto make all the promises he intended to keep make any concessions she demanded to persuade her to come with him to london what time on saturday be there at ten where what part its a long street just walk look at the shops and the stalls how do we meet ill decide dont be surprised i need started charlie but the line went dead its a hoax declared harry fish youre going to be made to look a fool again or be killed the bastard was probably right conceded charlie before the other thought registered i didnt think you could speak russian he said to the man during the initial seconds that followed charlie regretted his challenge his intuition was that the hoarsevoiced woman had something to offer but objectively he had to recognize that harry fish could be right and that it could all be an elaborate hoax or he had to accept another attempt on his life charlie contemptuously refused fishs near incoherent insistence that what he had intended to convey was not so much a denial of the language but a qualification that his superficial restaurantrussian was insufficient for him properly to discuss and assess the shaded nuances of any exchange in an insistence of his own charlie demanded the names of both monitoring operators to be witnesses at any future inquiry that might be convened by london after the documented protest he intended to make to the directorgeneral which he did consciously invoking more cliches charlie wrote of climates of suspicion vindictiveness unjustified internal spying and distrust exacerbated by a still undetected internal informant positively obstructing every investigatory move he attempted and further endangering any continuing already fragile cooperation with the russian authorities it was not until his second complaining page that charlie mentioned the contact from the hoarsevoiced woman inferring londons awareness of everything he did having been under constant observation by warning that if the woman suspected for a moment that he was not entirely alone for their arranged encounter as hed promised any chance of maintaining that contact would be lost for that reason he intended employing even more evasion to keep the hopedfor appointment than he would normally have done to defeat any russian surveillance which he had to anticipate the more so since the most recent publicity about the american approach since that publicity he had not been able personally to reach his replaced russian liaison indicating further exclusion as the result of the debacle charlie concluded the unaccustomed officialese by formally requesting that his protestto which he added the addendum that it was being copied as a matter of courtesy to both harry fish and paul robertsonbe attached to his personnel file for production at any future inquiry into the manner and outcome of the investigation so protectively cocooned was the communications room against any outside electronic intrusion that it was not until charlie got into the corridor outside that his pager showed two calls from mikhail guzov the second within fifteen minutes of the first harry fish was no longer in the setaside apartment when charlie reached it the earlier operatives had been replaced by two men both of whom regarded him sullenly without speaking one offered a log of eight new incoming calls all from journalists in addition to the two from guzov the fsb general personally answered the petrovka phone immediately breaking into charlies greeting we know who your dead man is everythings wrapped up the man was in the former office of sergei romanovich pavel when charlie arrived at the headquarters of the organized crime bureau there was another plainclothes man introduced as leonid toplov from the interior ministry and two in militia uniform nikolai yaskov wore the epauletes of a colonel viktor malin those of a major slightly behind the four stood the pathologist vladimir ivanov whom charlie at first failed to recognize out of his stained autopsy scrubs an extremely attractive blond stenographer was at a side table charlie could not remember being there before notebook open in readiness which charlie thought an unnecessary prop on guzovs commandeered desk was an already diminishing bottle of vodka its cap discarded russianfashion once opened a bottles contents had always to be drunk all five men held glasses and as soon as he saw charlie guzov filled a waiting glass and said join the celebration charlie accepted the drink touched invitingly offered glasses from the other men and cautiously said everything seems to have happened very quickly and proven us right from the beginning insisted guzov who was he maxim semenovich poliakov announced the uniformed colonel professional criminal major activities include pimping prostitutes and trafficking heroin from afghanistan ran with a chechen gang that we finally broke up entirely three days ago we wouldnt have been able to do so without poliakov we got him a month ago coming into moscow with two kilos of heroin and did a deal information in return for no prosecution but missed out protection observed charlie he thought he could look after himself said guzov you got an admission of the murder from other members of the gang asked charlie intentionally ingenuous guzov gave a derisory laugh these guys are too professional to confess to anything theyre actually claiming not to know anyone named maxim poliakov but theyve given away enough for us to realize theyd discovered poliakov was our original source were sure three of them were involved in planning the beslan school massacre too it all seems to have been resolved remarkably quickly and completely encouraged charlie he was reminded of a theatrical production in which everyone knew their scripts but recited rather than performed them it almost seemsguzov searched for the expressionan anticlimax after all thats happened over the last few weeks any theories why they killed him in the british embassy have they said something well probably never know dismissed the colonel nikolai yaskov shaking his head maybe to cause all the distractions by making it an international incident bringing your country into the investigation suggested guzov they certainly succeeded in doing that didnt they the absurd suggestion was undisguised mockery charlie accepted they were baiting him these people believe theyre above any law offered the colonel they like making grandiose gestures aping the gangster movies they try so hard to model themselves on isnt murdering senior militia detectives more than grandiose asked charlie im assuming of course that you believe they also killed sergei pavel guzov nodded sergei romanovich was the investigator who personally arrested poliakov persuaded him to turn informant killing sergei as well as poliakov was their settling every score and of showing their derision of us thats how we got them came in the colonel going back through all pavels cases there it was someone who perfectly matched the description of your dead man everything fell into place it was a lie a setup from start to whatever finish they intended charlie realized pavel would have at once remembered personally arresting a onearmed man he would have recognized the body even without a face that very first day in the mortuary and then charlie remembered pavels assurance that hed found no similarities in the complete archival search he had personally carried out but why why the hell were guzov and his team of amateur actors putting on this performance playing the part in which theyd clearly cast him charlie said what proof is there that the gang killed sergei romanovich pavel guzov who was going around the group adding to their glasses snorted another laugh were hardly likely to get a confession are we even without charges no one in the court is going to be left in any doubt who killed both men but were going to get the proper fitting punishment even if we cant proffer the actual charges of murder heroin trafficking on this scale carries the death penalty and weve got enough proof of that against every single one weve arrested its going to be a show trial stalin was good at show trials reflected charlie on even less manufactured evidence than this he still couldnt understand why they were doing it i should congratulate you on such a successful investigation im sorryembarrassed perhapsnot to have been able to contribute he hoped the attractive notetaker behind him hadnt missed the denial of any part in the farce youve had a lot of side issues to distract you emptily sympathized guzov was that a reference to the embankment incident hardly decided charlie in fact the belief that it had been a russian initiative didnt square with the bullshit they were shoveling now if they were setting out to smother the two murders this way there would have been no point or purpose in mounting the embankment crash from the almost imperceptible lisp charlie guessed the russian was getting slightly drunk id appreciate a complete dossier ill obviously have to submit a full report despite being able to contribute so very little we anticipated that you would said yaskov everythings being duplicated id also like a full copy of poliakovs criminal record there was a hesitation from the uniformed colonel im not sure of course you can have it came in guzov and we can also provide you with a more complete medical reportmore complete even than that which your medical examiners in london gave uscant we dr ivanov the chill began to envelop charlie yes we can said the rehearsed pathologist the nervousness making his voice almost as hoarse as the unknown woman on the phone dr ivanov realized there was no dna recorded on either his initial report or that from your people expanded guzov he and other specialists carried out tests on hair follicles and skin tissue as well as the blood which in your case was heavily contaminated now youll have everything to take back to london they knew what hed done how hed faked everything to stay involved in the case charlie accepted and theyd neutered him against any possible challenge because by making one arguing against anything they intended to say or do he would expose himself and his own attempted deceit and not just himself london and the department as well forcing himself to go on charlie said youre making an official announcement i suppose guzov looked theatrically at his watch in an hours time he came back to charlie and tomorrow were holding a full press conference although i dont imagine it will be as extensive as yours at the embassy im presuming youll want to attend with me they werent just boxing him in charlie acknowledged by appearing on the same platform hed be confirming that every claim the russians were making to be the truth and that the investigation was over thats very generous of you considering its come down to a successful russian investigation with virtually no input from me our agreement was full cooperation mocked guzov and theres something else the conference is at eleven sergei romanovichs funeral is in the afternoon not just boxed in thought charlie the lid was being firmly hammered down as pavels coffin would be i would of course like to attend that as well i expected that you would said guzov you have already been included on the list of those officially attending has london been informed of these developments they will be before the formal announcement said the interior ministry official leonid toplov he smiled as he added as a matter of courtesy continuing that courtesy picked up guzov ill ensure you receive all the official reports at the embassy before the end of the day we wouldnt expect you to appear before the world media without being fully briefed thank you said charlie with little else left to say publicly at least it will appear to have been a very successful and well coordinated joint operation between our two countries i presume youll be returning to yours very shortly the first possible crack in guzovs confidence picked out charlie why did the man need to know how quickly he would be leaving moscow theres no hurry now that the murder investigation has been resolved is there there might be a few things i still need to tidy up as he spoke charlie recognized it to be a pitiful attempt to have the last word and wished he hadnt bothered theyve beaten you judged aubrey smith wiped you off the board and me and the department with you it looks like it at this moment the admission came out of his mouth like a bad taste this and every moment thats going to follow insisted the directorgeneral you cant recover from this i havent received all their promised documentation yet you think theyre likely to have left you an opening there theyve done it all perfectly what if there is something that doesnt make sense or add up you cant challenge them without destroying yourself and all the rest of us theyve been brilliantly clever which a lot of other people here seem to have been trying to be there was a silence from london then smith said there have been some contrary instructions to moscow of which i have been unaware until now the situation as far as you are concerned has been corrected or had been it hardly matters anymore id like you to explain that said charlie who believed he understood completely but wanted confirmation youve been caught up more than i suspected in internecine maneuverings here in london i regret that the first open reference to the power struggle between aubrey smith and the disgruntled jeffrey smale charlie recognized it would account for his being the choice for the moscow assignment in the first place has whatevers been happening in london been blocked id hoped it had been until this conversation said the other man now its academic im still going to keep the appointment with the woman do you genuinely imagine that shes going to keep any appointment after the publicity theres going to be over the next few days demanded smith she could even be part of all the russians have done to trap you i need a way out said charlie maybe your return is that way out i dont follow hopkins has been interviewed as far as the doctors had judged it safe to do so said the other man hes adamant that the other car drove into him intentionally to force him over the edge that they whoever they are believed you were in the car too it was a deliberate assassination attempt how is he hell live but hell never walk again is he going to be looked after demanded charlie refusing the dismissal medically and financially i mean i know what you mean and of course he is said the other man impatiently and now i want you out let me see this through pleaded charlie ill not be responsible im not asking you to be this is being recorded theres no responsibility on the department no we both need my resolving this and i can do it there was a pause day to day ill judge it day by day no one could have anticipated this opened svetlana modin no one did agreed charlie accepting the desperation of his making the contact theyd agreed could he use the broadcaster find an escape or at least a stay of execution through her he had been quite prepared to resign if that was what it would have taken to get natalia and sasha with him in london but hed wanted the decision to be his at his timing and on his terms not ignominiously thrust upon him with accusations of gullible incompetence and failed professionalism and unfair to natalia and their daughter though it was it was still what he wanted how much were you involved charlie shifted in the telephone box alert to everything outside there has to be no indication that weve spoken i want to go with what ive got tonight which youre not going to like it is that youve been intentionally humiliated because of what happenedor rather didnt happenwith america the wrong reasoning but she was certainly right about humiliation conceded charlie but she had kept her part of the deal making no mention of the embankment collision and there could conceivably be some physical safety in that being promoted i certainly had no input in whatever the official communique says my first and only awareness of the murders being solved was when i was summoned to petrovka today to be told an hour before the official announcement but i havent yet seen any evidence to support the claims are you suggesting the investigation isnt over he hadnt been but an idea began to wisp in his mind ill answer that after ive seen the evidence do you believe you were excluded because of the proposed inclusion of americas cia could he maneuver her in the direction he wanted his idea settling it was important to put the cia more firmly in her mind if that were the reason it was misguided or perhaps misunderstood the approach came from washington as far as i am aware it wasnt considered in any depth by london youre going to be at tomorrows press conference and also be at sergei romanovichs funeral why exclude you one moment and include you the next neither of which had been mentioned in the official communique charlie at once isolated his disappointment that she hadnt picked up the leadin as hed intended tempered by the suspicion that shed come close to confirming an arrangement with mikhail guzov thats a question for moscow to answer not me i dont think they believe london has genuinely rejected the american approach that london still hoped to work with washington in the background but that theyve beaten younot you personally your peopleby solving everything first that had to come directly from guzov seized charlie and fitted perfectly with what he was trying to implant in the womans mind if they are then i know nothing about it but then perhaps i wouldnt i dont understand youre going to right now determined charlie perhaps i was never intended to be the proper investigator just the person everyone including the russians were supposed to believe had been assigned to the case are you suggesting there wasstill isan entirely separate investigation that no one knows is going on it would explain a lot of strange things that have happened in the investigation up until now the word humiliation did not feature in that evenings ort broadcast and charlie was only mentioned once by name and without a photograph being shown it was the lead item fronted by svetlana modin and once more claimed to be a world exclusive a combined and absolutely covert investigation between british and american intelligence had been defeated by the brilliance of russian detectives who had solved both the murder of the mystery man at the british embassy and that of the originally appointed russian investigator the revelation insisted the woman would further worsen diplomatic relations between moscow and the two western capitals both of which had issued statements strenuously denying any such joint operation when it had been put to them a russian presidential spokesman was quoted that despite the already issued denials formal explanations were being demanded from washington and london had he manipulated the program sufficiently to deflect any further physical attacks wondered charlie hunched over a tumbler of islay single malt in his firmly secured hotel suite still too unsure to relax he decided turning to the promised and combined russian dossiers that had arrived an hour before he quit the embassy and carried back with him to the savoy it took charlie three hours fully to read the dossiers the first time and an additional two to reread everything for a second before finally pouring himself his second islay single malt of the evening his minimal satisfaction at manipulating the television broadcast muted by the russian material charlie had seen weaker evidence some of it more obviously fabricated overwhelm barristers in english courts in what passed for justice in russia total victory was a forgone conclusion the russians hadnt missed a single trick it was to take another twelve hours for charlie to change his mind there was one trick which even charlie couldnt at that moment have imagined or hoped for charlie changed direction reaching for the ringing telephone instead of the television remote control for the first broadcast of the day david halliday said have you seen the news and charlie pressed the power button in time to see a photograph of svetlana modin fading from the screen and to catch strongest protest as the commentators voiceover finished too whats happened demanded charlie according to the broadcast she was arrested at four oclock this morning relayed halliday the station says theyve no idea where shes been taken or what charge is being made against her if any one suggestion was that she is being accused of acting for a hostile foreign power in the dissemination of false information is there such a charge so much thought charlie for fame keeping her safe probably i havent checked the tv picture now was of orts senior newsreader svetlanas photograph in the background the man expanded the protest statement beyond that from the station itself to include the moscow journalists union there was a reference to that mornings scheduled murder press conference which the anchorwoman had intended covering with the speculations that russian journalists might boycott it in protest at her arrest that was followed by stock footage of svetlanas most recent appearances accompanied by a commentary describing them as a series of unrivaled world exclusives theyre going to sweat her for her sources predicted halliday you think theyll disclose them when she tells all he had to be wary of the recording equipment in the suite charlie reminded himself they might if it serves their purpose and totally destroy him in the process if they chose to do so he accepted if his belief of guzov initiating svetlanas approach to him the previous day was right you think it could cause us more problems here at the embassy asked halliday with unknowing prescience it could i suppose ill just go to the conference see what i can pick up there said charlie and lay himself out for sacrifice if guzov were listening which charlie was sure the fsb general was it didnt really matter whether the russian press boycotted the event the rest of the world media most definitely wouldnt and there he would be displayed for all to see if guzov chose that moment to denounce his contact with the woman you spoken to london since last nights broadcast no said charlie dont you think you should particularly now that shes been arrested i intend to harry fish has been withdrawn incidentally did you know that the planted bugs charlie thought deciding the conversation had to end no i hadnt heard i need to get going ill see you at the embassy could he infer fishs removal to be a victory for aubrey smith at that moment charlie didnt think it was safe for him to assume anything and even if he didand was righthe couldnt imagine that it would indicate anything to save or protect him it was a lastminute thought to order an embassy car to collect him and charlie was glad he had as he approached the legation it was once more under media siege the embankment road close to being impassable he was recognized during the vehicles slow progress through the crush and it took several moments for charlie to recover from the flash and strobelight blindness when they finally reached the sanctuary of the inner courtyard charlie asked his driver to wait to take him to petrovka unsure what to expect within the building the answer to which appeared to be very little neither pj nor hallidaydespite his earlier conversation with the manwere in their offices although in hallidays there was a pile of that days newspapers all headlining the tv program there was already waiting for him in the communications room a message from the directorgeneral that the claim of a covert americanbritish operation was being officially denied and an instruction that he should not become embroiled in any public or private discussion whatsoever about it the message concluded that the man would be unavailable the entire day which without conceding paranoia charlie took to be abandonment compounded by his being told when he called the ambassadors suite that peter maidment was at the russian interior ministry and not expected to be available until late in the afternoon neither in the rabbithutch office nor in the setaside apartment was there any message or notification of harry fishs withdrawal the same two sullen operatives of the previous day were on duty again the overnight log again offered by the elder of the two listed seventyeight press calls in the two hours following svetlana modins program an obviously alerted paul robertson arrived at the apartment five minutes after charlie just as charlie was replacing the phone from being told that mikhail guzov was also unavailable has there been a nuclear explosion i didnt hear everyone appears to have been vaporized charlie greeted robertson ignored the remark going instead to the other two men why dont you two take a break well handle anything for the next fifteen minutes the man waited until the door closed behind them before coming back to charlie maybe people dont want to become contaminated by the fallout youve caused and on a very personal notethe man nodded generally around the room which you know is going on record as we speak i resent and refute all the inferences in your note to the directorgeneral im not part of any cabal or conspiracy and im demanding a formal personnel inquiry when i get back to london into any suggestion or claim that i am i dont knowand dont want to knowwhat games are going on back there or here apart from what its my function to uncover and expose that clear good for you mocked charlie refusing the rehearsed attack harry fish isnt here any longer though is he and how are your own inquiries going robertson swept his hand toward the recorderlinked telephones im now responsible for the duties of fishs technicians here thats where any contact between you and me begins and ends comforting for me to know ive got your help and support said charlie youve gotand will getabsolutely fuck all from me you got all your explanations and excuses ready for that inquiry panel youre demanding when they ask why its taken you so long and why youve fucked up so many times trying to find the inside source here paul most of it could be in the material in which you feature in the diplomatic bag going back to london with harry fish no they cant and you know it the sequences dont fit in times or dates or events or leaks charlie made his own movement around the wiredforsound room and dont forget that all thats being recorded now will be available as a reminder for that inquiry panel of yours there was a sound at the door directly followed by it being opened by the elder of the two sound technicians hesitantly the man smiled you said fifteen minutes perfect timing said charlie before robertson could speak best of luck succeeding eventually in your function of getting your stillfreetooperate informer for the first time charlie welcomed the camera flash gauntlet getting out of the embassy and into the similarly mediacordoned petrovka confident of its physical protection although finding it difficult to focus in the sudden darkness of the building he did not immediately recognize mikhail guzov waiting for him just inside the entrance guzov said all this is ridiculous absolutely and completely ridiculous believing as he did that the fsb officer had been involved if not totally in control of svetlana modins approach and of the ort broadcast charlie had anticipated a tirade of supposed outrage for the man to distance himself from it but not by this degree of vehemence i tried to reach you embarked charlie cautiously everything and everyones gone mad i havent been able to talk to anyone reach anyone the outrage definitely wasnt faked charlie wouldnt have risked his lunch money on the bet wanting more time to be sure but his initial impression was that the redfaced russian was genuinely furious i havent seen or heard a full newscast i dont know everything thats happened you know at least that the militia arrested svetlana modin in the middle of the night i didnt know who initiated it encouraged charlie the interfering militia commandant thats who acting without reference to anyone the russian media are threatening to boycott the conference which we decided to cancel until we sorted out the mistake but now lvovs involved himself lvov how can he involve himself easily and brilliantly hes declared it an attack an infringement on the supposed freedom of the press its a platform hes made all his own chasing publicity like a dog after a bitch in heat are you still going to cancel how can we now demanded guzov exasperated if we cancel lvov canand willclaim the currently elected government can no longer properly run the country and that canceling everything is a panicked reaction to a mistake they shouldnt have madehe hesitatedwhich the militia certainly shouldnt have made guzov was echoing a politiciansmaybe even a ministerialjudgement charlie guessed where was his benefit apart from the most obvious that an assassination attempt was unlikely here it was an additionally hopeful thought that his personal humiliation was being overshadowed at least for the moment unless perhaps svetlana was coerced into naming him unlikely came the reassurance from his experience svetlana modin wasnt easily coerced rather than being frightened by her detention the selfpromoting woman would be reveling in it already having calculated how it would increase her fame and notoriety so what are you going to do wait its being discussed elsewhere disclosed guzov leading the way farther and down into the building into what from its lingering smell charlie assumed normally to be a staff canteen although any trace of its use had been removed charlie thought there was something almost pitiful about the very obvious anythingyoucandowecandobetter determination to improve upon the facilities of the british press conference the improvised petrovka facility was actually bigger with far more attendancerecording cameras and the addition of four huge instantreplay screens at the front sides and even rear of the room each backpadded chair had its individual translation earpiece and microphone in its holster with a separate already assembled but uncertainlooking group of backup microphone runners to be ready if the main questioning system broke down there was another group of men and women moving along the lines of setout chairs distributing press packs in manila folders it was impossible to see into the temporary smokewindowed translators booth but charlie guessed it could accommodate at least a dozen linguists charlie wondered if the russians had also copied the internal video and audio recording equipment that harry fish had assembled at the embassy the elevated dais was a goldfish bowl of even more lights and cameras charlie turned to the fsb general but at that moment leonid toplov hurried into the room and without any explanation guzov moved toward the man the discussion between the two russians began quite calmly but within minutes degenerated guzov making expansively sweeping movements about the room before tryingand very clearly failingto reach someone on his cell phone with a very visible shrug of despair guzov bustled out through the door followed by the hapless ministry official they did so with difficulty struggling against the flow of early arrivals who at once began to spread out throughout the hall quickly overwhelming the placeallocating greeting officials at the initial influx charlie very quickly attached himself although not closely enough for conversation to the momentarily unoccupied backup group of additional microphone distributors charlies impression from the incoming flow of journalists was that the threatened russian boycott hadnt materialized although from the muted outside broadcast being relayed upon the wide screen on the far wall of the hall the now bannercarrying crowd outside appeared greater than when hed arrived on the perimeter of the demonstration there was a disjointed line of confronting uniformed militia officers as well as plainclothes officials but charlie could not locate either guzov or toplov among them as charlie watched more confronting uniformed officers began to move in from either side of the headquarters building which oddly appeared to be matched by the growth in the number of protesters creating surge and countersurge to a silentmovie background of armwaving fistshaking bannerfluttering jostling charlie had intentionally positioned himself to keep the entrance partially in his eye line so he saw guzov the moment the man reentered the hall like a piece of flotsam on an incoming tide for the briefest moment inside the hall the fsb general appeared disorientated gazing around until establishing the raised stage area and as he moved toward it where charlie stood the russian sweatstreaked as well as visibly flushed escaped from the flow and said short breathed a fiasco we couldnt stop it nothing we could do what demanded charlie lvov managed the russian heading a demonstration here the rest of what guzov said was drowned by the increasing outside noise and there was briefly the surreal combination of silent television footage on the inside screen accompanied by the permeating uproar stepan lvov his surprisingly still immaculately designerdressed and coiffuerintact wife by his side was clearly visible on the screen now the surrealism heightened by their being in the middle of a marching chanting crowd but separated and untouched by it protected as they were by an inner cordon of bodyguards the militia barrier melted in the face of the oncoming tidal wave of people which was on the screen one moment and the next sweeping into the hall charlie later reasoned that the politician must have had advance scouts already inside because without pause lvov and his inner caucus turned as if choreographed by unseen directions toward the raised area where a man already stood handheld microphone ready for lvov to reach out and take as he mounted the small stage which immediately became an oasis of calm just slightly ahead of the room quietening svetlana modin is a brave and courageous woman a symbol a visible and recognizable face of the oppressive brutish and even murderous attacks of the government i am going to sweep from office declared lvov illuminated by a thousand cameras flashes as he turned to suddenly raised photographs of svetlana her fight for the freedom of the press is my fight for the freedom of this country and when i am elected we will work together to achieve and enjoy both there had charlie supposed been time enough for lvov to formulate at least a framework but the speech itself had to be virtually impromptu and verged on oratorical brilliance each attempted and successful act of censorship after the early perestroika spring of press freedom was recited by lvov in perfectly dated sequence and outcome each arrest suspicious death and unquestionable murder of investigative journalists dated and itemized the rasping keys to journalistic shackles was a familiar sound in every newspaper office in the land a chorus to the cracked songs of a communism desperately trying to regain its former tyranny and to enslave its people as it had once done but must never be allowed to do again there should not just be a media strike until svetlana modin was freed every industry and shop and workplace should stop immediately until she was released from illegal arrest and detention and all those who had tasted the brief democratic freedom piece by piece inch by inch being daily taken away from them should show their determination that it stop never to be imposed again by registering their vote for him lvovs exit was as triumphal and swift as his entry trailed by the majority of people in the hall all attempts at a formal press conference abandoned charlie allowed himself to be carried along unresisting in the exodus he did not detach himself until he was well outside isolating david halliday on the periphery of the watching crowd and then nearby saw first paulajane venables and just beyond her bill bundy none gave any sign of recognition but halliday said you know what the stupid bastards of a government did they were taken so completely by surprise they didnt jam the already setup television satellite feeds worldwide the next absolutely guaranteed leader of the russian federation has just delivered his winning presidential address to a global audience of five billion people the man smiled directly at charlie and at the same time you charlie got let completely off the hook charlie thought a further comment of hallidaysthat lvovs protest matched that of boris yeltsin in being carried to presidential victory after boarding a government tank threatening the russian white houseto be an exaggeration until he learned that the seat of the elected russian parliament was the destination of the continuing peoplespower protest and it didnt stop there but meshed together with the stage managed continuity of a hollywood blockbuster from the white house orderimposing stewards now quite clearly in evidence the march proceeded in perfect coordination to vagankov cemetery at which pavels wife three daughters and a small group of officersnot one in militia uniformwere gathered for the funeral of sergei romanovich pavel the crowd control was absolute lvov and his wife and just four otherswith charlie tagging himself on until he separated to join a suddenly emerged mikhail guzov none of the huge no longer bannerwaving crowd attempted to enter the cemetery instead completely encircling it in silent respectful solemnity creating for the banked cameras a burial tableau at the center of which stood lvov now as silent as his followers his wife with one supporting arm around the sobbing widow the other stretched out in comfort to the children the politicians total hijack of the dayand the governments equally total ineptitudewas completed with the release of svetlana modin just two hours before orts main evening broadcast stepan lvov and the attentive wife not a hair misplaced or an ugly crease marking the virginal white suit were waiting with their inevitable crowd outside the finally identified militia detention center to receive her svetlana carefully crumpled disheveled and dirtsmeared as befitted someone presumed to have been incarcerated in a dank and filthy cell disdainfully and on camera waved away an approaching makeup girl to remain as she was for a live broadcast which completely filled the transmission slot she used an impromptu interview with lvov to hint heavilybut not positively to claiminterrogation under physical and sexually threatened torture and picked up like the accomplished performer she was on lvovs repeated diatribe against official media censorship intimidation violence and murder to approving roars and applause from the crowd threatening to drown out her words svetlana concluded i resisted it all refused it all and did not break they learned nothing from me nor will they apart from the truth there were matching shouts and applause in the packed savoy bar in which charlie and halliday watched her release halliday said you aint seen nuthin like that before in your entire life and you never will again youre probably very right accepted charlie it certainly took the focusand any threatoff you remarked halliday for how long wondered charlie charlie began his day tensed against the immediate setback of mikhail guzov personally responding to his petrovka phone when he called from the bugmonitored savoy suite relieved there was no reply he told the duty officer who answered that guzov could reach him at the embassy about the rearranged conference and quit the suite at once he used the stairs instead of the elevator and took the side corridor to the baroque dining room and its conveniently separate entrance and exit without needing to go through the central lobby and its main door as he knew from his previous three days reconnaissance there were no cars in the outside slip road and only a few disinterested people he got a taxi at the corner and gave the driver a destination that took them through side streets until the precistenka turn to go south in the opposite direction from the arbat to follow the gradual loop north again charlie divided his attention between his deadline and the following vehicles upon such a crowded multilaned highway it was impossible ever to be absolutely certain but charlie remained reasonably confident there was no pursuit he waited until they climbed as far as the kurskaya okalovskaja metro sign at the last moment double fare ready and the door ajar he ordered the stop for his hurried dash to the metro escalator he was fortunate with an arbatbound train coming into the platform as he reached it but traveled only one stop on the fifth line to switch south as far as kitaygorod where he disembarked to return northwest on the sixth line as far as tverskaya puskinskaya for the final line change and the arbat it was exactly five minutes to ten charlie had preferred the arbat as the flea market it had been when hed first known it not the hybrid now of doubtful antique galleries western designer shops russian bricabrac and icon stalls artistattendedand eagerly sellingexhibitions and touristtrap outlets and most definitely not the soccercrowd volume of people from which to stage the perfect assassination as he stepped out into the throng his apprehension began to tighten like a spring his skin reacting into something like an itch at the jostling inevitable physical contact the irritation so immediate and intense he had to feel out to scratch his arms and shoulders he moved as instructed the wandering pickupandputdown loiterer unsure after so much and so many public interferencesand not one single confirming telephone approach since the rendezvous was arrangedif his was not an entirely pointless performance to a nonexistent audience he guessed the crowd at this particular midpoint was as dense as that at lvovs demonstration and even more difficult to be part of the previous day those demonstrators had all moved in one direction but now there was a constant ebb and flow of people struggling every which way to get himself out of the crush charlie frequently detached himself from the main outside stream and went off the stallcluttered road into some of the more established and permanent shops and boutiques constantly checking the time either from his own watch or available clocks at he finally allowed himself the thought of his other rendezvous natalia had said it would take her an hour to get from her flat to mcdonalds which only gave him thirtyfive minutes to be at one of the two public telephones hed already isolated to warn her of his inability to keep their meeting if there hadnt been a personal approach from the hoarsevoiced woman but natalia had told him shed be going to the fastfood restaurant anyway and it would only take him thirty minutes less even to get there from the arbat he was being stupid unprofessional charlie accused himself what if the woman in whom hed put every hope of survival did make contact he had no way of judging what she had to say or would want to do whether shed be a crank or a wouldbe killer if she were neither and he for a moment believed she were genuine it couldinevitably wouldtake hours days to gain her confidence and trust natalia and sasha had to be a secondary consideration no charlie refused at once not relegated to second place put in their rightful place that of being of absolute personal importance to him but separate from what was professionally essential separate too from the potential danger at that moment burning through him their meeting had to be postponed maybe only put off for a day freed from the noon deadline he could remain in the arbat for the rest of the day and if there was no approach hed know the episode had been a hoax or a crank or that the woman had been frightened away he reached the closer of his two chosen telephone phone booths at to find it occupied by a woman with a notepad and a heap of replenishing coin on the ledge in front of her and an increasingly fidgeting man waiting ahead of him the milling crowd in which hed so recently immersed himself for its concealing protection now became an obstructive delaying interference when it came it wasnt the tighttogether pressure of people jamming him between them for a quick agonizing knife thrust or the hard jab of a silenced pistol it was a tug a dip into his jacket pocket he started to snatch toward whatever had been planted and he only just managed to turn it into the jerk of someone colliding into him the hoarsevoiced telephone warningdont look or act surprisedechoing in his head as if he were hearing it at that moment he didnt stare about him either but forced himself on leaking perspiration but not touching his pocket until just before he reached the intended telephone the interior of charlies pockets invariably resembled a schoolboys treasure pouch which like so much else about the man was intentionally misleading he was aware of everything in every space and immediately detected the folded piece of paper taking it out as if it were a reminder which it could easily have been a telephone number which charlie instantly recognized to be another street kiosk that days date and a time the numerals were written in a russian hand it was five minutes before eleven charlie saw he could get with time to spare to where he knew natalia and sasha would be he needed time to calm himself as well as a drink to help probably two to help even more and because he had that much time charlie chose again to fill it linehopping across the metros centralcity spiders web the tradecraft dance subconsciously prompted by what hed recognized during the preceding hour and now wanted more reassurance fully confronting what he was contemplating hed lied to nataliaagainand was about to lie further after promising he never would again that instead he would always put her safety and sashas safety before anything or anyone else it was ridiculous for him never to accept the possibility of failure or to delude himself into thinking the car crash might have been a coincidence ridiculous too to believe hed always be able to lose a surveillance tail and the possibility of another assassination attempt an assassination attempt in which natalia and sasha might all too easily be caught up and even die with him so why was he going on as he was thinking more of himselfonly of himselfand what he wanted instead of how he should be thinking of what he should do if he loved them both as much as he insisted that he did he didnt have an answer not one that came even half close to justifying anything there was one thing he did know from the arbat experience the hoarsevoiced womans apparent nervousness during the arranging telephone conversation might have been genuine but her claim not to be sure of a rendezvous definitely hadnt been shed planned the arbat as shed planned everything elsethe concealing crowd on the busiest day of the week the protective watch for which she would have been in place long before ten to ensure she wasnt risking a snatch squad and the brush contact drop within a yard or two of the escaping arbat metro she was charlie recognized a professional intelligence operative with the knowledge and ability of operational fieldlevel tradecraft and could so easily have been a killer he reminded himself refusing to push aside the selfaccusation of cheating natalia and their child everything was planned he further reminded himself he knew he was clean that he wouldnt be endangering them today just this one more time then maybe the lasthis only chanceto be with sasha hed see them today judge how the encounter went and then find the answer eluding him he scuffed on aching feet up the slightly inclined kreschatik square upon which he saw the line stretched at least twentyfive yards from the entrance of the mcdonalds out into the square and which didnt appear to be moving and then he saw natalia close to its front sashas hand obediently in hers he knew nataliad seen him virtually at the same moment although she gave no indication of doing so neither did he happy that the delay would give her all the time she needed to satisfy herself he had not been followed if he had been he would have been hit by now natalia had secured a corner table her large briefcasesized valise securing a third seat which would put sasha between them shed already finished whatever shed eaten and had her coffee cup before her sasha was still eating a hamburger but her attention was upon one of the restaurantsupplied coloring books natalia gave him the briefest welcoming smile moving her valise from the third chair and said something to sasha at the counter he ordered the obvious his mcmuffin was soggy and the coffee was a gray color when charlie reached the table natalia said i told sasha we might be meeting a friend hello said the child im sasha whats your name charlie looked inquiringly at natalia who shook her head charlie couldnt think of an appropriate russian transliteration and said ivan sure it wasnt a pseudonym hed forget after the mornings still hopeful expedition natalias forehead creased as she raised her eyebrows at the name smiling down at his choice of meal i guessed thats what youd order what else could it have been charlie smiled back sasha made an attentiongaining slurp sucking at the straw in her cherry milkshake and said would you like me to color you a picture id like that very much said charlie how could it be like this small talk easy words that ordinary people said in ordinary situations he didnt have to sift and scrape every word for a second or third or fourth meaning you choose sasha insisted an elephant or a giraffe or a lion it will have to be one of those because theyre all ive got a giraffe please said charlie you wouldnt like a lion instead all right a lion sasha smiled the giraffe is for mama and the elephant is for igor hes my teacher at school and our friend i started charlie stopping himself from saying he knew hell like that he finished hed seen natalias wincing frown how are things she asked as sasha began scribbling with her crayons confused you look terrible drained are you all right theres a lot happening he was glad there was a wall behind him natalia frowned again from what ive read and seen on television i believed it to be all over i thought youd be going back very soon not yet innocuous though the words sounded they marked a change from neither ever discussing work with the other it seems bad for you it could be i could be recalled not instantly forgotten small talk after all but she would have surely mentioned the embankment ambush if shed known about it rejected his even approaching them now he was lying by omission he recognized how would you feel about that natalia didnt want small talk either charlie accepted it could make a lot of things easier could it really i mean i think so and i have thought about it very seriously thought about it hed done the right thing by keeping the meeting despite all the deceit and soulsearching so have i although not to the extent of your quitting it might not even be an option of my choosing you wouldnt like that perhaps i wouldnt charlie agreed the circumstances i mean not the result what are you talking about unexpectedly demanded the child something a long way away said natalia not here you mean not in moscow no not in moscow said charlie dont you live here no said charlie i live somewhere else my papa lives somewhere else a long way away i dont see him but mama says she might take me there one day charlie was conscious of natalia flushing very slightly to his daughter charlie said would you like that im not sure said sasha with the seriousfaced sagacity of a child returning to her coloring i wish that hadnt been said i dont have a problem with it said charlie the opposite in fact it doesnt mean anything that ive decided anything now im even more unsure dont be urged charlie it really could be so much easier now you couldnt live without the job you know you couldnt and i know you couldnt i could insisted charlie and will by choice or otherwise finished announced sasha triumphantly offering charlie the crayoned image the lions mane and feet were colored green its body yellow shed strayed over most of the guiding outlines in her eagerness to complete it its the best picture of a lion ive ever seen enthused charlie may i keep it i want you to insisted the child are we going to see you again i hope so said charlie so do i next time you can have the giraffe and igor can have the lion we have to go abruptly declared natalia the flush returning as she collected up her valise we havent properly talked protested charlie this could be the last opportunity it would be safe for them to meet for him to persuade her you knew we couldnt not today that wasnt what today was about ill call again when things get clearer but dont forget what i said and that i meant all of it youve told me you meant what you said a lot of times before charlie and havent meant them this time i do i really do ive got a call to make insisted natalia ushering sasha before her so had he thought charlie and a hell of a lot depended on it hello a mans voice slightly slurred charlie said i have this number to call this is a public phone who are you surely not a hoax it couldnt be get off the line i want to use the phone the voice was slurred the belligerence rising did you answer because it was ringing get off the fucking line i will when you answer the question otherwise ill keep it open blocked it was ringing as i got into the kiosk now get off the fucking line charlie did stepping away from the telephone for a woman who was waiting with a tugging child on reins but stayed close enough to hear her voice when she spoke in case the contact was planned differently from how he expected it was high pitched a complaint about a gas installation not at all the tone he wanted to hear there could be a simple easy explanation the belligerent man could have got to the telephone seconds before the woman no thought of politely deferring to her using it first probably wouldnt have wanted him to hanging around to hear everything she said made every sense for her to be the one to hold back she would have heard the ringing know hed understood and was trying to reach her all he had to do was wait but not too long the woman for whom hed stepped aside appeared to be having an argument with whomever she was talking the tugging child was pulling away distracting her charlie walked to and fro in her eye line to remind her he was waiting pointedly she turned her back on him it was six minutes past five his feet throbbed the child became entangled in its reins and fell pulling the woman off balance he began screaming and she finally slammed the phone down dragging him away charlie wedged himself into the kiosk determined against abandoning it again and dialed out the number from the paper slipped into his pocket the line was engaged he had to redial continuously four times before he got a ringing tone counting each separate sound he got to six before the receiver at the other end was lifted no one spoke charlie said hello there was no response i have this number to call youre late the relief surged through charlie at the recognizable hoarseness a man answered when i called before right on time i saw him then you know i kept my word yes she agreed do you now trust me i dont know its a decision youve got to make yes i promised to be alone at the arbat and i was and im alone now no one with me i know how can you know demanded charlie i can see you again charlie avoided any startled reaction confident that hed lost any pursuit he hadnt bothered to check out the streets directly around hlebnyj pereulok the street from which he was speaking then you must know youre safe its not true what theyre saying about gangs and drug running and whores they havent even got the name right he had to put pressure on her charlie decided imperceptibly to prevent her panicking but sufficient to get out of this conversational culdesac we have to meet start talking differently from this you know youre not in any danger i dont know that at all at last charlie looked around him casually there was what could be another public facility in the shadow of a building about thirty meters to his right it was too dark for him to be sure certainly to distinguish anyone inside good tradecraft again what do you want if you want the proper retribution against the people who killed ivan im the man who can get it for you the only one i dont know that at all the woman repeated youre running away charlie openly accused conscious of the risk he was taking you keep running away from me youre going to let those who killed ivan escape is that what you want for them to get away never be punished no then youve got to meet me talk to me tell me as much as you do know and let me take it on from there theyre too powerful too influential she broke into a coughing fit you dont have anyone else cant trust anyone else there was loud knocking from outside the telephone kiosk that made charlie jump he ignored it there was silence from the other end but another rap against the glass tell me how to meet you where to meet you there was a sound that didnt form into a word something like a sigh that grew into a groan what was that what did you say where the road joins rizskij pereulok on the left the cafe there tonight seven wait for me to come up to you i need started charlie but the line went dead his clandestine meeting with sergei pavel had been in a workers cafe arranged over public telephone lines and now pavel was dead charlie thought the cafe was not quite a step but at least a ledge above that in which hed met pavel but thicker with cigarette smoke the concentration of virtually everyone was on an ice hockey match showing on the screen behind the counter one group of men enthusiastic enough to shout at goal attempts and the more violent clashes there were three women already there when charlie arrived two gossiping at one table and immediately behind at another a babushka heavily muffled in a coat and scarf and woolen hat despite the warmth all three ignored him as he had for his meeting with pavel charlie chose a polesupported standup table closest to the wall farthest from the door where he was able to see everything and everyone inside he decided the coffee was better than in mcdonalds but the baklava was stale he still nibbled at it hungry after ignoring his mcmuffin he wasnt convinced she would come hed decided the unintelligible sound at the end of their conversation had been a sob of fear at edging closer to a decision she was terrified of making cutting off the words she couldnt at first utter a refusal maybe charlie didnt know what to do if she didnt come now shed cut him off before hed been able to suggest a failsafe which hed anyway been reluctant to do because it would have given her an escape now he wished shed given him the chance he supposed he could again try the public telephone kiosk for which he had a number promptly at five she seemed to need the regularity of time or hope she would call the embassy again would mikhail guzov have tried to reply to his early morning call theyd surely make some attempt to restage the press conference not to do so would give stepan lvov another victory charlie reasoned there was the danger of a further hijack by the world media ignoring the declared purpose of the conference and instead demanding from guzov and interior ministry officials answers about the arrest and detention of svetlana modin would she have expected calls from him even though it was a saturday charlie thought she probably would automatically he looked at his watch realizing the ort main news was in thirty minutes and just as automatically glanced toward the television guessing it unlikely the channel would be changed from the ice hockey coverage so engrossed in the match was virtually everyone in the cafeand so unobtrusive her entrythat charlie thought he was probably the only person there to register the arrival of the woman he instantly and intuitively was sure to be his caller it took several moments for the man behind the counter to become aware of her standing waiting and charlie thought there was a professionalism about her nonentity cultivation she was slight and very thin anonymously dressed in a buttonedtotheneck gray linen coat and gray woolen hat pulled too low to give any indication of her hair shade her only distinctive feature when she turned away from the counter was her facial coloring charlie didnt think there was any makeup and was surprised if anonymity were what she wanted because it could have reduced the strange mottled brownness to the left of her face if she were who he believed her to be he accepted that some of the coloring could have been apprehension but her appearance was that of someone who had spent the majority of her life in perpetual sunshine from which shed made little effort to protect or shield herself she hadnt appeared to look for him as shed entered and continued to concentrate head bent forward over her cup as she came farther into the cafe not bringing her head up until she sat at the table directly beside him nodding then as if in permission for him to join her as close as she now was charlie could see nervousness was trembling through her the cup shed carried from the counter puddled in a moat of spilled coffee charlie said relax nothing can happen to you ill be all right in a minute it didnt seem possible for her to look directly at him she coughed clearing her throat you know who i am can i know your name it was going to take a long time charlie guessed he would have to be very gentle not rush anything the woman hesitated irena irena encouraged charlie there was another hesitation irena yakulova novikov and ivan her hands were clenched to control the shaking ivan nikolaevich oskin she wasnt wearing a wedding band charlie saw tell me about ivan nikolaevich she jumped at the sudden roar from people watching television a mans voice from the crowd said giving the fucking game away irena coughed again and said we were together had been for a long time before afghanistan even he fought in the afghanistan war the missing arm charlie thought at once he was there she fumbled for cigarettes from her bag the cheapest that minimized the tobacco with a hollow tube half its length and had to steady the match with both hands is that where he was hurt she nodded not speaking there was another roar from the ice hockey watchers this time she didnt jump what was he doing there asked charlie registering her qualified reply the hesitation was the longest yet kgb he was a kgb field officer he was georgian as i am he had the complexion her hand came up to her own face as she spoke quicker now her confidence growing he was very good at language he had pamini as well as pashto a lot of middle east languages he was highly regarded because of his ability he had to infiltrate the mujahideen guessed charlie the most difficult and dangerous of all field assignments was trying to adopt the disguise and culture of an enemy in a war or hostile situation she nodded again looking directly at him at last he was attached to the military headquarters in kabul even though he was kgb not the military glavnoye razvedyvatelnoye upravlenie he wasnt popular because he wasnt one of them either considered an outsider and he was too honest insisting that russia couldnt win the war something happened he never knew how he was betrayed there was an ambush near the compound in kabul three generals air force as well as army were killed ivan lost his arm were you in afghanistan with him asked charlie aware now that the skin on the left side of her face was puckered as well as mottled brown does my face distress you she asked abruptly her hand up to her cheek again not at all insisted charlie unhappy at the sideways drift of the conversation her pace he reminded himself it does some people she said accepting his denial ivan and i met on station in cairo that was where this happened she laughed without humor the lobster was being flambeed at the table the chef poured on too much brandy and somehow the flame blew into my face there was another humorless laugh as she gazed around its safer here they dont go for flambe cooking they were straying even further sideways he had to get things back on track without appearing impatient groping he said did ivan go to afghanistan direct from cairo hed fixed itivan was a good fixerthat wed get married in cairo and go to kabul together the kgb liked husbandandwife teams but i got medevaced back here to moscow the concern was not my face but that id lose the sight of my eye they managed to prevent that and did the best they could for the burn scars but it took a long time the marriage was rearranged here during ivans leave from afghanistan once i got better then ivan was caught in the ambush and he was brought back and was in the hospital for even longer irena came to a gulping halt her throat working and charlie realized she was close to breaking down he held back from filling in the silence between them she fumbled another cigarette alight wincing at the sound of a goal being scored on television im sorry its just that she had to stop again sorry the wedding was finally planned for the saturday after he was found dead in the embassy irena began to shake again can i get you something offered charlie not knowing what sometimes they have brandy here they did and charlie bought two glasses it was gritty and probably home distilled and caught charlies throat almost making him cough it didnt seem to cause the hoarsevoiced woman any difficulty things havent been good for you charlie sympathized no she agreed the shaking was subsiding everything still had to be at her pace charlie warned himself again nervous of another near collapse what about the kgb were you and ivan kept on after the change to fsb irena shook her head i wasnt because of the circumstances in which i was hurt it was bourgeois criminal evenenjoying myself at kgb expense i was dismissed on reduced pension what about ivan nikolaevich he was kept on of course hed been injured on assignment he was even awarded a distinguished service medal he was getting closer thought charlie more apprehensive than encouraged but deciding to take the risk when he was fully recovered was ivan nikolaevich kept in the first chief directorate irena looked at him wideeyed openmouthed you know the structure directorates and departments shit thought charlie its all right youre not betraying anything anyone all i want to know to find out is who killed ivan nikolaevich no she refused if they find out they wont find out insisted charlie desperately no one will find out shed had both hands cupped around her brandy tumbler but the renewed shaking made it rattle against the tabletop so she released it ivan nikolaevich wouldnt want me to talk to someone like you he was loyal he was killed murdered argued charlie his desperation growing and nothings being done to find out who did it why they did it officially theyre lying you know theyre lying with stories of ivan belonging to a gang pimping whores and you know mikhail alekandrovivh guzov is fsb i know why they did it declared the woman suddenly calm and under control why irena pressed charlie quietly and controlled why was he murdered he found out something that he shouldnt have shouldnt have known about tried to do a deal what was it he found out irena remained silent for a long time both hands back around her glass sipping from it once seemingly unaware of the continued noise from the ice hockey fans she straightened suddenly and said im tired i dont want to talk anymore youve got this far been this brave pleaded charlie i wont betray you like ivan was betrayed he reached across the table taking one of her hands away from the glass to hold it to reinforce what he was saying i will find out who killed ivan and make sure theyre punished but i cant do it without your help things went bad for you both of you all the time dont let this go bad like all the rest now that you dont have ivan anymore i need to think will think she said defiantly if he pressed her any harder hed lose her charlie knew promise me well talk again when she didnt reply he repeated promise me i promise ill call the embassy no refused charlie no more telephoning give me a place somewhere we can meet like this there was another long pause here tomorrow insisted charlie give me a time to be here tomorrow i have to work on sundays from the coarseness of the hand hed briefly held it could even be close to manual labor a machinist in a factory perhaps you have a lunch break you always telephoned at ten past twelve lets meet here during your lunch break twenty past but maybe not tomorrow monday tomorrow irena insisted charlie dont run away if you run away youll be betraying ivan nikolaevich tomorrow she finally capitulated charlie acknowledged the differenceonly four or five firsttoarrivelasttoleave journalists and one television cameramanthe moment he approached the embassy there were fifteen press approaches logged in the setaside apartment none of them from svetlana modin and mikhail guzov had not returned his earlymorning call although waiting for him was a tornoff tass news agency release topped by hallidays name and six exclamation marks of an official interior ministry statement expanding its earlier claim that the british embassy murder had been solved with the arrest of a chechen drugsmuggling gang it concluded with the further announcement that the planned press conference had been postponed to a date yet to be decided there were no messages awaiting him from london when he reached the communications room he hadnt been forgotten charlie reluctantly accepted just momentarily ignored put aside because of other more important pressures he should he supposed be grateful for the respite which to a degree he was very grateful indeed the reservation was prompted by his uncertainty about how successful his overcrowded day had been by comparison charlie objectively scored himself percent out of a hundred from the meeting with natalia largely baseddespite natalias warning not to overinterpret itupon sashas childishly innocent remark about being taken somewhere far away from moscow the percent reduction came from natalias continued reluctance to step out into the unknown and sashas apparent closenessor accustomed acceptanceto igor karakov there was nothing he could do no tweak he could attempt to improve his selfassessed ratings until their next contact but it had been right to keep the personal meeting sasha had been wonderful and despite her warning hed been encouraged at how concerned natalia had been about him charlie forced his mind back to irena yakulova novikov charlie acknowledged that he still had little more than instinct to trust her disjointed story but instinct had rarelyand never completelyfailed him in the past and the very disjointedness of their conversation rang truer in his mind than a coherently timed and dated account could or would have done apart from his own physical safety the most pressing professional problem was finding the slightest corroboration of anything shed told him neither the name irena yakulova novikov nor ivan nikolaevich oskin came up on charlies kgb or fsb search of mi records which didnt surprise him because he knew intelligence officers in both organizations always operated under pseudonyms as did every other espionage and counterespionage body throughout the world despite publicly identifiable headquarter buildings and publicly named and identified directors and directorsgeneral and chairmen intelligence organizations did not officially exist to spy and murder and suborn and infiltrate and manipulate so how could nonexistent entities be staffed by real flesh and blood people russias war in afghanistan the possibility burst upon him not the possibility of obtaining a nameivan would have operated in kabul under an identity different even from his pseudonym at lubyanka headquartersbut the disastrous russian incursion gave charlie one dated marker and irenas account of the ambush in which ivan lost his arm further refined it charlie concentrated his internet search among publicly available and openly provided strategic study groups in americaknowing no such facility existed in the russian federation nor the soviet union that preceded itand located the incident in two hours it was in a newspaper cutting from the new york times dated march it was a very short twoparagraph report still with no names but with the identifying fact that three generalsone air force two armyhad been killed at the same time the only occasion of such a simultaneous loss of three senior officers a russian driver also died in the ambush ivan was described as a pashtospeaking russian interpreter in a much longer oped commentary feature again in the new york times the incident was referred to as a turning point in the russian disillusionment with the war and ivan more positively identified by his injury being described as the loss of an arm charlie was warmed by the feeling of satisfaction at his instinct proving right although realistically acknowledging that it barely took him half a step forward he needed irena to keep their meeting the following dayand be prepared to talk far more fullyto do better than this and he wasnt at all sure that she would he did though know that she workedand possibly livedwithin an area very close to the cafe with which she was obviously familiar by getting her to agree to meet him there during a lunch hour charlie hoped that she didnt realize how hed tricked her into disclosing it and giving him the minimal advantage charlie allowed himself a discomforting hour before finally approaching the cafe in which hed arranged to meet irena novikov it was less crowded than before the permanent sports channel showing a soccer match featuring moscow dynamo the clothescocooned babushka was at the same table and charlie wondered if shed even left the previous night charlie risked the brandy and chose the same table as before able from where he sat to watch the cafe clock as well as the door there had only been six press calls and two rambling cranks when hed checked the embassy earlier but nothing from mikhail guzov svetlana modin or london which gave a chance for him to consider how to utilize each when they came and how to prompt them if they didnt it was according to the cafe clock the place was filling for the midday break the majority of customers wore workmens overalls and heavy boots and by charlies estimate more vodka than beer was ordered the vodka was in unmarked unlabeled bottles and very visibly the yellow of alcoholconcentrated home distillation charlie decided hed been wise to stay with the brandy by irena still hadnt arrived hed give her an allowance charlie decided there could be reasons even for someone as timeconscious as she appeared to be how much allowance a lot shed had to force herself yesterday constantly wavering would have runavoided thingsif he hadnt gently pushed the noise in the cafe was irritatingly rising in proportion to the vodka intake his own brandy glass was virtually empty he didnt want to lose the symbolic table by going to the counter for another but was tempted it was now and the place was becoming crowded three people needed behind the counter now the noisespiked by shouted outburstsgrowing at the soccer action on tv it wouldnt be easy to maintain unnoticed surveillance outside the cafe if irena reneged after his earlier location reconnaissance charlie had naturally continued to check the surroundings of the cafe as hed approached it was situated slightly to the right of a far too expansive square directly overlooked by too many brezhnevera apartment blocks and house conversions and illogically far too few shops or other bars there were side alleys and streets but insufficient concealing activity among which he could stay unnoticed at charlie tilted his chair against the table to mark his occupancy and eased his way through the noisy tightpacked counter crush that tightnessand the noiseeased during the time he stood waiting to be served and he realized why when he looked again at the cafe clock registering pm marking the end of the break shed run charlie accepted as his brandy was finally poured hed give irena the time it took him to finish this drink maybe even another but then have to accept what hed been refusing to contemplate hed lost irena but only temporarily he determined with customary obstinacy whateverhoweverit took hed find irena yakulova novikov again and try to convince her again and then he saw her he was at the edge of the thinning counter group his first impression only of a figure at his table then his vision cleared sufficiently for him to realize who it was charlie didnt hesitate though but continued on and by the time he reached her the doubts and the reflections had gone now youre late he said relieved that there was no vibrating nervousness today she was wearing the same coat as the previous night over what appeared blue canvas work trousers the auburn hair no longer covered by the woolen hat was flecked with gray and in better light charlie guessed she was in her early fifties im glad you waited there was even a wisp of a smile but no immediate explanation what would you like that looks good she said nodding to the brandy glass he was still holding would you like any food she shook her head with even fewer people at the counter now it didnt take him as long the second time to get another brandy there was another soccer match showing on the television screen irena said i worked an extra hour and started two hours earlier this morning so wed have the afternoon she was already smoking her first cigarette i wish youd warned me last night last night i didnt intend coming back today what changed your mind i decided youd try to find me and probably succeed eventually so it would only be delaying things i changed my mind about a lot of other things too like what that i dont really care if they do find out and kill me it wasnt the answer charlie expected or wanted thats depressingly fatalistic no its not she denied its decisive my deciding what i want to do and will do get the people who murdered ivan brought to justice thats what youve been trying to persuade me to do isnt it im surprised by the change charlie admitted honestly lets both hope i dont change my mind again lets agreed charlie wondering if this were irenas first brandy of the day not trusting the covering sound of the television charlie came closer over the separating table and said you were telling me last night that ivan had found something i dont know it all qualified the woman at once tell me as much as you do know encouraged charlie gently unsure which of irena novikovs shifting attitudes he preferred it was to do with his job she began it took a very long time for ivan to get properly well she stopped reflectively i dont think he ever got properly well the field hospital operation was botched and there had to be more surgery when he got back to russia he spent months in hospitals and after that in kgb recovery and rehabilitation centers and as id been dismissed because of how id been injured in cairoand that they were kgb placesi couldnt visit him even after the kgb became the fsb he told me later he became convinced that id left him because of how hed look after losing his arm she was straying off on a tangent again charlie realized too soon yet to bring her back on course he was worried too that there wouldnt be a job for him when he finally got better because of the arm irena was saying but there was a job although obviously no longer in the field everything had become fsb by then of course but a lot of the changes were cosmetic for outsidemostly westernconsumption one of the divisions that didnt change has never changed since the first name switch from the cheka was the registry and archives department charlie felt a lurch of grateful satisfaction at holding back earlier from any interruption but risked it now ivan was assigned to archives irena shook her head not current ongoing records although the division to which he was assigned is always ongoing ivan was put in charge of the bureau keeping up to date the official history of the russian intelligence service from its foundation under feliks dzerzhinsky by lenin ivan was an ideal and very obvious choice of course with all the languages he could read and so easily translate what period was ivan responsible for interrupted charlie again conscious of his voice sounding almost as hoarse as irenas in his excitement im not sure of the actual dates said irena lighting another cigarette i guessed from what ivan used to say from time to time that it spanned the last ten to fifteen years it could have been longer it certainly overlapped the kgb becoming the fsb charlie coughed to clear his throat almost frightened to ask the question to which he might not get the answer he wanted did ivan tell you how he worked yes replied irena seeming to know the importance of the demand he had to go through all the old raw case files and distill everything into a comprehensive consecutive account for entry into the official history of the soviet and now russian federation intelligence organizations she smiled he used to laugh that the remit was always to make it appear that we were the best and always won irena had given him the answer hed wanted it wasnt actually the key but it could be a window into the biggest and richest intelligence gold mine in the world in her seesawing mood swings one moment appearing confidently determined the next relapsing into twitching uncertainty it was as if irena had geared herself to go as far as disclosing ivans job reassignment but then no further similarly to her abrupt cutoff the previous night he worked hard at soothing her suddenly returned fears reluctantly letting the conversation stray from what he was anxious to concentrate entirely upon by letting her ask questions he explained away his involvement in a murder investigation initially with no apparent intelligence connections as part of the british services hugely expanded role countering islamic and other potential political fanaticism repeatedly insisting there had been no prior identification of ivan nikolaevich oskinand most definitely not of irenabefore shed responded to his television appeal you werent linked to ivan nikolaevich by the kgb after your cairo accident or by them or the fsb after he was wounded in afghanistan and spent all the time he did convalescing reminded charlie in support of his argument and not an hour ago you told me you didnt care if they discovered your involvement anyway which i promise you again they wont it was easier for me to think brave than it is to be brave when i confronted the reality of what it could mean as i talked to you said irena the slur easy to detect in her hoarse voice you cant stop now i want to she was smoking what had to be her fourth cigarette her conviction wasnt absolute judged charlie no you dont you want ivans killers punished i want another drink let me get you some food instead the food heres shit well go somewhere else you want to be seen with someone with a face like this youve probably got more reason for selfpity than most irena dont use it to hide behind your face isnt disfigured just marked bastard not as much of a bastard as those who murdered ivan her throat began to work as she swallowed against an outburst which charlie was frightened would be yet another breakdown instead seesawing again irena said okay charlie was unsure what she meant guessing he said so lets go on ivan discovered something he shouldnt have seen in the raw case files he was going through to prepare the official intelligence history yes what demanded charlie tensed forward thats what i dont know what it was specifically what did ivan tell you irena hesitated youve unsettled me from what youve just told me charlie smothered the frustration what unsettles you from what ive just told you about political fanaticism go on urged charlie it was political whatever ivan discovered he called it sensational that was the actual word sensational but he didnt tell you what it was no he didnt even give you the slightest indication irena shook her head what he did say was that it was payback time that what he could get for what he knew would set us up in luxury for the rest of our lives you know what his words were that we could get married and live happily ever after charlie remained briefly silent unsure how to phrase his next question not wanting to drive her backwards you told me yesterday that ivan was a fixer how was he going to fix it that you lived happily and in luxury for the rest of your lives now it was irena who paused arranging her words he told me he was going to do a deal that he held all the cards and that they didnt have any alternative but to agree to whatever he asked the woman gave another humorless laugh but they did have an alternative didnt they avoid the word blackmail charlie warned himself ivan was going to deal bargain to keep you both comfortable for the rest of your lives after you got married yes because hed learned something politically sensational yes but he didnt tell you what no charlie was unsure which or what to offer next from his mental selection neither the kgb nor the fsb ever discovered you and ivan were together for all these years irena shifted uncomfortably no they never did you never lived together had the same address irena stared into her empty brandy glass we were going to of course after we got married ivan said that to do so before wouldnt be safe that wed compromise ourselves if we set up home together she was lyinglying badlyand charlie was sure he knew why ivan was already married wasnt he irena only on paper there were no children it was over years ago before cairo even his wife wasnt in cairo with him was she she was kept back here in moscow and again when he was in afghanistan unless husband and wife were both kgb it had been standard kgb operational procedure to hold spouses hostage in russia against overseas defection in the case of husband and wife their children were detained under the guise of receiving a better education than would have normally been available no she was always here which was why you couldnt visit him when he was repatriated from afghanistan wasnt it it was his wife who was able to visit and his wife to whom he went home when he was finally and fully recovered yes do you know if shes been hurt killed even after ivan was murdered whoever killed him would have torn apart the house or apartment in which theyd lived the hoarsevoiced woman sniggered the first mistake in your grand deduction she died two months ago shed had cancer for years thats why ivan wouldnt divorce her abandon her even though wed been together in every other way for so long he was a good man intended to make sure she was comfortable from the money he was going to get could a potential blackmailer be a good man if ivan had stayed with a terminally ill wife and undergone all the misfortune than he and his mistress had suffered but officially on all the records and registers ivans address is where his wife lived irena nodded not speaking so you must have it irena whatever it was that ivan found among the raw files and smuggled out of the lubyanka knowing its significance yours was the obviousthe onlyplace where it could be hidden irena began to cry at last but soundlessly without any sobs tears just coursing down her face oddly spreading out to wash completely over her scarred left cheek you know more irena directly challenged charlie and i need more properly to understand if i dont everything else youve told me is meaningless charlie believed he now understood a lot of irenas topsyturvy behavior but just as quicklyand positivelydecided it would be a bad mistake openly to challenge her further if he was rightas he was sure he wasthe prize incomplete though it might be was very close now i think we are beginning to understand each other he started out cautiously irena shrugged not replying not a good start you do trust me dont you with another shrug she said having got this far i dont think ive got any other option minimally encouraging but only just charlie thought but he hoped she realized how accurate she was certainly theres no one else who guarantees your safety as i do but is that all you set out to achieve irena apart from getting those who killed ivan or is there something more she had finally begun looking fully at him but now she turned away it was difficult to tell because of her skin discoloration but charlie thought she was blushing i dont know what you mean its not a criticism charlie said taking a chance i still dont know what you mean the advantage was slipping away from him ivan was good wasnt he apart from his expertise in languages he was a very good very competent intelligence officer everything would have been different better if he hadnt been hurt as he was in afghanistan losing his arm and having to undergo so many operations i know that sympathized charlie youand ivanhad more bad luck than most people suffer but as good as he was ivan misjudged things at the end didnt he do you think i dont realize that now she flared it wasnt the best opening but he had to take it of course i understand that you recognize it now and im glad you have ivan couldnt by himself do what he thought he could no matter how good he was you most certainly couldnt not all alone as you are youve done the right thingthe safest thingcoming to me and i really do understand im embarrassed she said suddenly embarrassed and ashamed why should you feel either said charlie soothingly she was definitely flushed it wouldntor needntbe long now it was the people who killed ivan who should have to pay no one else he had to steer everything the way he wanted in her reluctance irena was making things more awkward than they needed to be how much was ivan going to ask for i dont know admitted irena a lot i think because of how sensational he thought it was he had the key knew the full story how much were you going to ask if youd got to them instead of coming to me she looked away again do you despise methink im a foolfor imagining i could take over get the money that ivan believed he could to set us up as he thought he could im not going to risk the trust i hope ive now got with you by lying said charlie i dont despise you for imagining you could still do a deal for enough money to get you out of where and how you are here now particularly having lost ivan but i do think you were foolish believing that you could succeed where ivan failed and you dont have to feel embarrassed or ashamed in hoping that ill pay for whatever information it is that youre hiding there you didnt even have to ask me could you can you i mean i know what you mean cut off charlie and i wont lie to you about that either i dont know ifor how muchmoney i might be able to arrange for you because i dont know what youve got to sell but i will make you a promiseand you know i keep my promisesthat if it is as sensational as ivan insisted it to be i will do my best to get you as much as i can thank you she said clearly uncomfortable despite charlies insistence that she had no reasons to be thank you very much so far so good thought charlie correct analysis all the way he had to ensure it went on now ive got to see what it was ivan found and hid with you havent i it was yet another of the brezhnevera apartments that still disfigure moscow like the last decaying teeth in an old mans mouth yellowed and blackstained by neglect the vestibule stank of piss and shit and the graffitidaubed elevator was out of order doubtless rusted and clogged by more of both the graffiti and lavatory use continued up the stairs and apart from the normal protest from his feet charlie was glad he only had to climb three flights the inside of irenas apartment was in total contrast to its exterior the entrance hall gleamed from its obvious constant polishing as did the living room table and chairs and glass cabinet that displayed its prized foreign travel collection of wine and cocktail glasses the shrine to the man irena had loved was directly alongside a table festooned by photographs and memorabilia of ivan nikolaevich oskin he had been an extremely handsome man blond and blue eyed in the color prints with high slavic cheekbones and very even almost cosmetically sculpted teeth irena who was featured with the man in all the photographs had also been attractive to the point of being beautiful before the cairo accident her hair very dark before the now fading grayness slim but heavy breasted there were pictures of them both in swimming costumes on unidentifiable beaches and others obviously dating from their egyptian assignments beside pyramids and of ivan on a camel at the very front of the exhibition were three medals their citations set out before each the presentation was completed by three obviously recent photographs in which it was virtually impossible to see irenas burned face or ivans missing arm from the way each had posed the dark nighttime backgrounds showing whiteclothed tables with wine bottles and glasses that was our hobby said irena beside him pointing to the formal pictures we loved dancing ivan was good at it even after he lost his arm its difficult to balance without an arm but he learned how it was possible we could dance so well my holding him not he holding me that people never realised his deformity in the darkness people often didnt see that id been burned either irena gestured him towards the couch that ran the length of the main window and charlie hesitated before it able easily to see the telephone box hed used for their contact understanding how shed been able so safely to see him and know he was alone would you like a drink she asked indicating the decanter on the openfronted cabinet the vodka was the yellow of home distillation as it had been in the cafe id prefer to see what you were keeping for ivan she was back very quickly from what charlie assumed to be the only bedroom carrying a large manila envelope inside of which were four separate smaller envelopes in which charlie guessed oskin had divided what hed discovered in the archives more easily to smuggled from the lubyanka headquarters of the fsb each was marked by a symbol charlie didnt understand until hed taken out the asized contents and realized the markings indicated a sequence glad hed kept the packages separate and was able at once to restore each batch to its original envelope the material was photocopies of raw but codedeciphered traffic the majority cable transmissions interspersed by handwritten telephone or radio communication the cabled messages were both timed and dated enabling continuity but some of the handwritten notes on them were not and charlie was even more relieved that he had not mixed up the order if he had compiled it all together with no way of knowing how oskin had established his sequence it might have actually been impossible ever to work out what the russian believed to be his sensational discovery every printed cable and every handwritten note or memorandum was stamped with the highest security restriction with its access and readership strictly limited to specifically codenamed individuals both inside the lubyanka and the sending and receiving field stations each codehidden individual had personally signed their code designation for receipt and dispatch and each inscription had additionally been time stamped every document was heavily annotated and every annotation and comment again personally marked there were in total thirtytwo asized sheets but oskin had sometimes arranged as many as six original cable slips or handwritten notes on one sheet both to create some further chronological continuity and to minimize the bulk of what he took from the headquarters building at the end of each smuggling day it took charlie only minutes to locate from the cable dates the first envelope in the series and put the following three into sequential order and from those dates to realize that the material was not confined to a strict period of time but covered in total a possible range of eighteen years beginning with a cable sent on december the date of the final cable was july at once charlie was swamped by several realizations the excitement moving through him although at that moment he hadnt the slightest idea of its importance he was physically holding material albeit once removed from its fingertouched original not just of a well established and entrenched russian intelligence operation of the highest your eyes only secrecy but one that could conceivably be currently ongoing two entire pages in the last batch were crowded with a total of fourteen undated and momentarily incomprehensible telephone and internal memorandum slips throughout charlies initial examination irena sat motionless and unspeaking on the nearest chair her entire concentration upon him as he looked up she said well ive got a lot of copied documents the significance of which mean absolutely nothing to me began charlie so secret were the transmissions that every dispatching rezidentura was encoded in addition to everyone mentioned in every exchange no higher security designation has ever been used before not by the kgb or any of its predecessors declared irena thats what ivan told me i havent properly readand even less understooda single thing ive looked at yet but if i had the slightest idea even after a dozen readingsno matter how many dozens of times and how many readingsit would still and will always remain meaningless without the identifying code key to those involved and of the various overseas stations over what seems to be a period of more than fifteen years you telling me its useless demanded irena anguished im telling you nothing of the sort denied charlie im not telling you anything in fact that you havent already told mewithout the code key its useless impossible to understand and probably always will be at this level of security itll be a code known to half a dozen people probably electronically changed during transmission from the code grid in which it was sent to that by which it was received your people have got computer as well as human code breakers ill need to take it all even for them to try i know ill keep my promises all of them you talked earlier about our understanding each other yes agreed charlie i want you to understand totally everything i want yes repeated charlie the curiosity deepening at another topsyturvy change what is going to happen to ivans body charlie who was rarely rendered speechless was stunned by the question ive no idea he finally groped the russiansthe fsbhave it along with their bullshit story of drug smuggling gangs yes stumbled charlie for the third time theyll toss ivans body into an unmarked grave or maybe not even bother just incinerate it without even a proper crematorium i want ivan properly laid to rest what are you asking me to do irena demanded charlie striving for control you cant take custody of the body even though ivans wife is dead youre not legally next of kin and by trying youd identify yourself his body was found in the british embassy set out irena her argument clearly prepared at your press conference you twice maybe even more than twice explained british participation resulted from the embassy technically being british not russian territory ive done research a body found on british territory is again technically the responsibility of britain whatever its nationality i want ivans body given back to the embassy and repatriated to england for a proper civilized burial in return for what i am letting you have i want enough money to live well if not in luxury which ivan promised i want to live in london or wherever ivan is buried so that i can mourn at his grave every day for the rest of my life that is started charlie what i want finished irena make it happen for me charlie ignored the waiting messages and contactinsistences waiting for him descending at once to his communications cell in which he remained for more than three hours recounting the approach and final encounter with irena novikov up to and including her concluding asylum demands he also attached scanned copies of the thirtytwo pages of the stolen kgb and fsb material designating directorgeneral aubrey smith the sole your eyes only recipient he did so with increasing reluctance pridefully even conceitedly wishing he could have kept everything to himself until he was able to deliver a complete and comprehending solution to the murder investigation and the eighteenyearplus russian intelligence operation but with professional objectivity he accepted that he couldnt without the essential code key it was not until the end of those three exhaustively concentrated hours that charlie allowed himself to think beyond the topmost secret russian intelligence material and its potential significance to his physical possession and the overwhelming need for it to be totally safeguarded in normal circumstances that would not have been a consideration let alone a problem but with an apparent spy still deeply embedded within the embassy circumstances were far from normal there was no one that he could trust except as always himself but that would require his permanently carrying everything with him at all times as hed briefly carried it from irenas apartment by taxi to avoid the constant danger of metro pickpockets if not physical attack and robbery as the assassinated sergei pavel had been searched if not actually robbed to pad himself like that again would not only attract the attention of mikhail guzov and his watchers outside the embassy but the quizzical curiosity of everyone including the undetected mole inside it to carry constantly the thirtytwo sheets in a neversurrendered briefcase an encumbrance with which he rarely bothered anyway would create the same russian interest and conceivably fsb robbery either in a street or far more likely from his savoy suite could he chance the complete opposite from permanently keeping the material with him by creating his own dead letter drop an unguarded insecure hiding place known only to himself dead letter boxes contact caches between spy and controller were tried and trusted tradecraft facilities which charlie had utilized but never trusted but from which in objective honesty he had never once lost an exchange not a decision he had immediately to make charlie reminded himself tonight and tomorrow every available minute of which was going to be devoted to ivan oskins hoard a briefcase would go unnoticed as anxious as he was to start his examination charlie hoped that any waiting calls wouldnt take much time or throw any surprises it didnt take long to be disappointed it will probably go beyond postponement announced mikhail guzov when charlie asked the obvious question everythings resolved after all the thought now is to let the court hearing provide all the answers charlies instant thought was of the disposal of ivan oskins body and irenas determination that the murdered man should be buried in england his next and almost as quick awareness was that it would spare him the russians intended humiliation there are still a lot of questions to which i dont have answers guzov didnt reply at once a complete case file is being prepared for you the cancellation had to be connected with the lvov demonstration hijack charlie guessed but how iand through me londondont have any evidence that everything has been resolved until we doand there is complete and mutual agreement that it is resolvedi am going to work on the understanding that it remains an ongoing combined criminal investigation now it was charlie who paused thinking again of ivan oskins remains which means i expect every item of evidence including the body to support whatever medical evidence is produced at the trial to remain intact and available thats ridiculous protested guzov the condescension finally going ive told you how its all been sorted out its over a lot of accusations were made by stepan lvov when he took over your press conference reminded charlie wont abandoning it altogether be a virtual confirmation of those accusations thats a political consideration dismissed guzov badly canceling altogether an international press gathering intended to illustrate the professional ability of moscow police isnt a political consideration easily contradicted charlie thats a militia and special investigatory consideration and decision surely i have not been included in the discussions perhaps you should have been as much to protect your personal reputation as that of the organization you represent if im consulted i will make your opinion known certainly your belief that the investigation has not been concluded said guzov with forced formality guzov was ducking everything this number you left for me to call its not what i had before for your petrovka office there was a further hesitation from the other end weve closed down the incident room at petrovka which effectively ended any further contact acknowledged charlie im keeping everything running here there could be some reaction to your drug gang announcement where shall i courier it to you if it does perhaps youd call me on this number said guzov after another long pause and perhaps youd call me when a definite decisions reached about the press conference pressed charlie charlie was glad hed spoken to guzov ahead of returning svetlana modins call sure as he was of a link between the two the broadcaster instantly answered her direct line the impatience in her voice going the moment she recognized his im just about to make the prerecordings before going on air do you want me to call back asked charlie sure of her reaction no svetlana snatched anxiously we havent spoken for a couple of days no agreed charlie waiting for her lead did you see and hear all about my arrest it would have been difficult not to what about lvovs move today at last thought charlie hopefully i havent heard about any lvov move hes demanded more about the covert investigation between britain and america pointing out that what london and washington have so far said isnt a positive denial he wont get a response predicted charlie and wouldnt expect one he guessed it was a political stunt to continue embarrassing the existing government and keep his name and face on international television screens but it explained the possible press conference cancellation to prevent it being hijacked a second time by the presidential contender why not questioned svetlana hes not the russian president yet argued charlie so why should they respond lvov hasnt got authority officially to demand any sort of explanation nor the right to expect one hes just keeping up the pressure on the government here because of the election or perhaps britain and america dont want to make an outright denial only later to be publicly caught lying she suggested thats the angle of my exclusive interview with lvov tonight she was trying to authenticate the story hed implanted in the first place charlie realized smiling at the irony another exclusive congratulations you think britain and america are frightened of being caught lying he wouldnt be lying giving her the inference she so desperately wanted charlie decided why not go on stirring the pot no one certainly not governments like being caught avoiding the truth do they she laughed should i draw a conclusion from that remark i cant see what conclusion you could possibly make from what ive said thank you said svetlana stressing the sincerity thank you said charlie just as sincerely he got safely back to the savoy in time to see svetlanas broadcast and to hear her quote his reply verbatim to continue her factbyinnuendo reportage but then he remained staring frowning at the screen for the unexpected live interview from washington with an american state department official who actually identified stepan lvov by name insisting that there was no truth whatsoever in any suggestion that the american government or its cia were conducting a clandestine operation in russia charlie was mildly disconcerted at getting wrong what he considered an obvious prediction but his success at keeping svetlana modins disinformation pot bubbling outweighed his one miscalculation and at that moment there was another uncertainty occupying his concentration above all others why hadnt there been another attempt to kill him hed certainly taken every precaution charlie recognized that despite all the dodging and weaving a professional assassin would have by now tried again and possibly succeeded had it really been a proper determined attempt or had it instead been intended as nothing more than a warning a backoff threat still not relaxing he not only locked the door of his suite but further secured it with the triangular door wedges he always carried to prevent its innocent but unwanted opening by room servicing staff he cleared the sittingroom coffee table to set out the four separated and sequentially ordered envelopes working through one at a time he did not on first reading attempt to analyze any one item or message but tried to get a general overview of the entire haul hoping for a clue to a common direction to their contents his initial bewilderment growing until he isolated what he believed to be an incongruity encouraged by itand other dissimilarities specifically in an increasing number of other sometimes singleline slipscharlie made his first but absolutely essential discovery hed begun by assuming that each communication in all four packages was exchanges between kgband latterly fsblubyanka headquarters recognizable from its obvious and unvarying center code identification and at least five if not more codeobscured foreign field stations or rezidentura it was only when he separated the slips from the fuller messages that charlie was guided to the allimportant different language terminologies every codedeciphered word in every communication was an absolutely literal translation into russian but from the awkwardness of that translation or at least thirty of the smaller slips they had to have originated from radio intercept of a foreign language but thats exactly what at least thirty of the smaller slips were not deciphered from their firsttime transmission codes but initially translations from foreign language radio intercepts that very first item of december was not technically a message which charlie first construed it to be the literal translation into russian appeared clumsily stilted because some of the words didnt have a precise transliteral match the first impossible match that charlie stumbled upon was the phrase walkin which no russian would have written it was tradecraft terminology of american cia origin that charlie immediately and easily understood from its adoption by at least four european intelligence organisations including both britains mi and mi it was a term describing a foreign national approaching an american source to offer him or herselfor information he or she possessedeither for money or ideology asset was another americanism which charlie picked out from another radio intercept dated february and knew also to have been adopted by other western intelligence agencies to mean a foreign national suborned or willing to inform or spy upon his country both were sourced from the same kgb field station concealed behind the numeric code the next communication was a reaction from center to the alerting field station allocating the word amber as a case code it included the word struggle which at first confused charlie until he remembered being told by natalia when they were together in moscow and he was learning the russian language to be occasionally used colloquially to mean search which appeared as search several more times in messages not only to and from moscow but to and from a wider spread of field stations some numerically coded and and others under a variety of worded identifications ajax trojan omega and mars in several another recognizable tradecraft term sleeper appeared apparently as a supposition or a suggestion a sleeper was a committed spy not actively engaged in daytoday espionage but left buriedsleepinguntil the reason or decision arose to wake him to begin work increasingly charlie came to believe he was looking at a surprisingly simplealthough still totally incomprehensiblepattern rapidly escalating frustrated kgb alarm confirmed by an equally sharp rise in the secrecy and readership restrictions throughout the kgb and fsb hierarchy over the last eighteen months available to him the access limitation appeared to have been confined to six recipients with the topmost authorizing and questioning participant identified by the code word one written in words not numerals on every your eyes only exchange throughout the exchanges there were six code series included which from experience charlie knew to refer not to people but to actual espionage operations it was just past three in the morning when charlie finally straightened cramped and gritty eyed from the thirtytwo pages finally restored to their specific envelopes minimally satisfied with what he hoped to have established by listening in to american intelligence radio traffic most likely between cia field stations and their headquarters in langley virginia the kgb had discovered a russian mole to whom theyd allocated the code name amber but which possibly had been changed to icon that american asset appeared to be operating from within kgb ranks itself and judging from the rising prioritytoward the end verging on panicof those involved in the hunt for him had as recently as a period of roughly eighteen years since his first location had still not been found and who over those eighteen years had disclosed or participated or had information about at least six maybe more russian intelligence operations and everything contributed absolutely nothing to any understanding without his knowing or being able to break the concealing codes worse even if he were even half right in his interpretation it raised a dozen more questions instead of providing one single answer with whom had ivan nikolaevich oskin tried to trade the gold lode he believed he had found the most obvious answer was the cia to keep their asset protected but according to irena her lover would not have betrayed his country could one of the wilder speculations about the embassy murder be true after all that ivan had been trying to sell the information to the british but had been stopped and killed by pursuing fsb at his moment of contact no rejected charlie at once he knew as an indisputable fact that ivan had not been killed in the embassy grounds but elsewhere before being dumped where he had been found and he surely wouldnt have been sent from londonunless of course as an intended sacrificeas totally blind as he had been if oskins approach had been to the sister service mi not such an easy assurance here because mi only cooperated with mi if there was some beneficial advantage and mi operated on the same imbalanced principle and if mi had had an asset like ivan oskin they certainly wouldnt have shared him but they would have definitely tried to discover his killer which would have involved david halliday even if the rest of their investigatory team had been covert and despiteor perhaps because ofthe chaos within the embassy charlie was convinced he would have detected some sort of awareness from the contact hed had with halliday why were the fsb so anxious to close the murder investigation down with a bullshit story of oskin being a member of a drugsmuggling gang and sergei pavel being assassinated in gangland retribution it might just be conceivable that the fsb had linked the disappearance over the past near fortnight of one of its own lubyanka operatives with the embassy murder and wanted to resolve an awkward international problem still they or the uniformed militia would surely have wanted to find pavels killer was he right in believing the material lying on the table before him was about a russian or kgb defector to the cia from what he knew at that moment there couldnt be any other conclusion the cia would unquestionably have killed oskin instead of paying him off if they believed he knew the identity of their deeply embedded icon but they wouldnt have killed him before getting what oskin had taken from kgb and fsb records and that still left pavels murder unexplained what connection with anything was there in the cias attempt to get involved but cut the russians out of the linkup if the agency had killed oskin theyd surely want to distance themselves from everything about it their own spy in the embassy charlie felt a jump of irritation that the possibility of a connection hadnt occurred to him before now there most definitely was a hostile source whose activities had reduced the british legation to a laughingstock by remaining undiscovered despite every single person within it being interrogated by the best and most experienced mole hunters in the british service and oskins information was of another undetected spy could that be beyond a coincidencethe phenomena he distrustedand be in some way part of the same enigma but how and why the spy within the kgb had remained undiscovered for eighteen years the hunt for the british embassy mole hadnt yet been running for eighteen weeks the connection could only be coincidence nothing else or could it circles within circles blocking his mind until he was incapable of thinking or rationalizing anything charlie decided as an incalculable number of kgb and fsb minds had seemingly been blocked for eighteen years and the minds of paul robertson and his molehunters remained blocked which could be an answer to so much one charlie remembered that hed actually suspected days ago creating for himself yet another circle charlie confronted his earlier speculation that while not knowing what it was an answer to the constantly unremitting avalanche of apparently unrelated facts and events was creating an impenetrable mental fog through which it was impossible for him and a lot of other people to focus upon what they were trying so desperately to see and then he remembered the cliche that had escaped him when the idea had first come to him no one was being ableor allowedto see the wood from the trees because of the ever and constantly growing forest in front of them the codebreakers and analysts have managed to get some way further than you while at the same time completely agreeing and confirming every one of your interpretations but by any assessment not far enough declared aubrey smith when charlie finished enumerating his overnight impressions from the russian intelligence archives how much further have they got asked charlie station code names which we had on record in our own archives enlarged the directorgeneral the first mentioned isor rather wasbeirut it was changed to mars during the civil war there so weve got a double confirmation the kgb field station in cairo is teheran is athens is trojan all middle east where oskin worked identified charlie the connections been made here too and the fact that oskin was fluent in the languages in the region could it have any connection with the islamic terrorism were facing questioned charlie a sleeper operation conceived a very long time ago coming to fruition now not from nonislamists rejected smith he and irena were actually based in cairo charlie pointed out also flagged up here assured smith weve managed as well to identify three of the six operations itemized in oskins stuff operation midas was a kgb effort to penetrate the banking links between america and saudi arabia operation oscar was to get through kgb nominees control of two greek tanker companies which would have given moscow a limited window into world oil movements they tried to extend that oil monitor with operation bore which was targeted from beirut after its code change to mars by infiltrating tanker companies worldwide youre talking past tense questioned charlie thats how they got into our archives the tanker operations particularly lloyds of london was an obvious priority infiltrating objective because of its insurance records all three operations were discovered and blown once we got involved discovered queried charlie the lead against all three came from the cia who got it from their kgb asset completed charlie where else agreed the directorgeneral by giving it to us they protected him incidentally we also agree with you here that amber is the russian code name for the mole they cannot catch but that they changed it to icon and we know that one as the secrecy determination ratcheted up is the chairman of the kgb himself and continued on into the fsb making iconand the need to uncover himalso number one of the russians most wanted list which it would be wouldnt it for someone theyve known about for eighteen years done incalculable damage and who they still havent managed to catch suggested smith icon is up there with the alltime greats in the spy ratings my guess is theyll have a fulltime section permanently hunting him if they still havent caught him qualified charlie the analysts here dont think they have said smith you didnt mention the gaps in the intercepted cia radio traffic because i didnt isolate them admitted charlie i didnt either said smith equally honest because the gaps were filled with kgb and fsb traffic giving an impression of unbroken continuity you did isolate sleeper though and thats what our provisional assessment is that the cia has put icon to sleep until they choose to activate him and while the russians go on looking for him theyor heare expecting something big maybe a transfer back here to moscow headquarters it could be agreed smith the fsb will be going even more frantic at the possibility anyone being brought in from outside will be put through more loyalty tests than you can imagine noneor anyof which gets us any closer to understanding why ivan nikolaevich oskin came to be found dead in our embassy grounds reminded charlie do the analysts think theyve got it all or could there be more no one is going to admit weve got it all in less than twentyfour hours what ive told you is basic surface stuff of course theyre going to go on any thought of a link up with mi maybe oskin was negotiating with them even though we know he wasnt actually killed in the embassy grounds his being dumped there could have been a message to them although i dont believe the resident mi officer here knows anything about it but it would explain mis efforts to get involved wouldnt it youve asked the station officer directly not since getting this material said charlie sensing the concern in the mans voice we obviously discussed it before that im sure he doesnt know anything if mi already had oskin they wouldnt admit it or share anything in a million years and i dont want to share anything with them or anyone else yet as ive already made clear things are still far too uncertain both here and where you are aubrey smith saw this as his way to win the power struggle in london charlie recognized at once what about irena novikovs demands ill pay her of course how much depends upon the ultimate value of what shes given you and i could also arrange her asylum smith was ducking the most important part of his question charlie acknowledged what about the body she wants the whole package not part of it its a technical situation thats never arisen as far as i am aware and i certainly havent had time to discuss it with anyone yet in fact i cant think of anyone with whom i could discuss it i promised id give her a reaction as soon as i could hed also promised to make contact with natalia charlie remembered she cant expect a decision this soon on something as complicated as shes asked complained the directorgeneral neither can you whats the situation with this damned russian press conference that could make us all look absurd as confused as everything else im not sure of the benefit of keeping this joint americanbritish covert business running or using this svetlana woman said smith it could be exacerbating a situation that doesnt need to get any worse was that a genuine remark or a way of letting him know that all the recorded conversations were still being forwarded to london it generates a little confusion dont we have enough confusion already asked smith hasnt it occurred to you that theres almost too much of that coming from somewhere for the first time there was a reflective silence from the london end are you suggesting theres a positive disinformation operation going on i dont know what im suggesting if anything avoided charlie it could be a possibility by whom to achieve what charlie started to regret beginning the exchange i cant answer that either maybe im imagining theres some kind of orchestration in a lot of things that have happened maybe you have said smith his tone indicating the exchange was coming to an end ill get back to you if anything comes up from this end that would take us forward in a more positive way id like something positive to move things forward it had been a mistake to offer an amorphous idea without anything to substantiate it charlie acknowledged the embassy was still only waking up when charlie ascended to its more regular working area skeleton night staff handing over to the day workers and diplomats although neither paulajane nor halliday were in their offices that days unread newspapersincluding those brought in on the earlymorning flight from londonwere still in their undisturbed stack in hallidays outer unrestricted access room the english ones uppermost only the times and the telegraph maintained their moscow coverage and both their singlecolumn stories were on the inside foreign pages but datelined from washington pointing up the unusual diplomatic response from the state department to stepan lvovs demand charlie hadnt expected to find robertson waiting there when he got to the compound apartment were well met announced robertson i was looking for you the hotel said youd left at dawn not quite dawn said charlie early though youre looking for me ive slotted you in for this morning what to come before the inquiry panel were getting toward the end youre among the last after the previous charade dont be ridiculous you cant refuse insisted the man i can and i do said charlie and dont fuck about like you did last time threatening arrest and my being taken back to london under escort i will and i can robertson mocked back go outside for a moment will you charlie said to the four awkwardly footshuffling telephone monitors witnessing the confrontation you dont have the authority to get them to do that said robertson their security classification isnt high enough for what i am going to tell you dont be started robertson but the bravado faltered to the other four men he said give us a moment will you something has started thats far more important than my fulfilling some pisswillie regulation that cant apply to me because as you already know i dont come into your time frame im not trying to undermine your authority or what youre trying to achieve here if youre determined to persist with this nonsense i want the personal order from the directorgeneraland i mean aubrey smith himself no one elseto appear again before your panel i insist upon knowing what it is youre involved in you know i am not going to tell you are you sure youve got the backing in london to behave like this no im not at all sure admitted charlie honestly but its the stand im going to maintain until again im personally authorized by smith to tell you any more it had been a ridiculous dispute achieving nothing except his being backed by the directorgeneral but charlie didnt believe paul robertson would have invited the humiliation of being overruled for a second time robertson hadnt made any secret of his resentment at his ridicule of the first examination or of his uncovering harry fishs duplicity could it be as simple as the man trying to even a score robertson and fish were after all part of the same internal counterintelligence division of which taking the possibility further robertson was the director and by association shared some of fishs caughtout opprobrium possible but still infantile which charlie found difficult to imagine robertson would risk appearing unless of course the man had been forced into the confrontation if harry fish had been part of the jeffrey smale faction in london it wasnt a leap to think that robertson was a fellow traveler and part of the same headquarters conspiracy if robertson were he could have been obeying the instructions of the protectionpromising deputy director in staging todays debacle but to gain what although hed guaranteed by his sole your eyes only designation that the directorgeneral would be the only recipient of irena novikovs story the fact that there had been an exchange between them extending over almost three hours would have been visibly evident upon the london transmission log there was every understandable reason for smiths enemies to want to discover as quickly as possible as much as they could about such a long conversation but could robertson or anyone else have conceivably imagined theyd learn anything from yes or no polygraph answers no matter how cleverly theyd phrased and posed their questions perhaps not under the polygraph routine but they might have believed theyd learn something in a more open freeranging session just as strongly as charlie believed he would have instantly recognized what they were trying to achieve and amused himself by misleading them whatever charlie positively decided he wouldnt allow it to grow into another distraction charlies determination to avoid attracting attention to the contents of the briefcase overwhelmed his preference for comfort and directly after hearing aubrey smiths decisiona telephone message from robertsons inquiry clerk not personally from the man himselfcharlie quit the compound apartment and its too attentive telephone supervisors and descended to his original rabbit hutch employing the door wedges to ensure there was no unexpected intrusion there was less room here than hed had the previous night in his hotel suite and it was particularly difficult setting out the stolen kgb material forcing him to spill over onto the floor during his first rereading charlie factored in every addition hed learned that morning from london more fully realizing the importance the russians were attaching to the hunt for their traitor by its stalled progress being personally controlled by the chairman first of the kgb and now the fsb an echelon hed never before encountered not even in anecdotal reference in training or instructional lectures an asset remaining undetected for so longeven one put into inactive hibernationwas unquestionably of major importance but charlie found it difficult to accept that the chairman himself would participate his own directorgeneral was participating in this operation charlie reminded himself but aubrey smith had a personal survival interest as well as the initial circumstances of ivan oskins murder having potential political ramifications heightened by the bugging of the embassy and maintained by the huge international media spotlight having a cia informant within the russian intelligence apparatus although serious was far more straightforward and capable charlie would have thought of being handled at a lower operational level the most obvious and logical conclusion had to be that there were additional reasonsfurther electronic interceptions not being included in the material he had topping the listto add to all the other competing unknowns charlie read and reread for another two hours without adding anything more to his list of unanswerable questions and had just fortunately packed the envelopes away in his briefcase when there was a knock as well as an unsuccessful attempt to open his blocked door he pocketed the wedges before he noisily unlocked it for paulajane venables you make a hermit look like a party animal she said smirking with her usual coquettishness todays designer creation was beige the top button of the cream shirt beneath the pipeedged jacket predictably unfastened needed a quiet time and place to think dismissed charlie i tried the compound apartment first i checked your office earlier too i know youre on my cctv thats why i came looking for you to see what you wanted charlie hadnt known there was an internal television security system it certainly wasnt openly visible i was just passing why dont you buy me lunch or ill buy you lunch we could even arm wrestle for the bill he had more than enough time before speaking again to london and possibly irena if smith offered anything further to justify talking to the russian woman what about endangering her by association wasnt it the association with him that had crippled jack hopkins i dont want to appear ungallantand i will stand treatbut why should i pay because ive got something to tell you that i think you should know and maybe youll have something to tell me your choice of restaurant as long as its not the american cafe said charlie his curiosity piqued the pekin off the ring road its a favorite of yours isnt it the embankment episode still in mind charlie insisted they travel separately checking his own journey for pursuitwhich he didnt detectand glad that if there were a reason to talk to irena about anything from london he could do it by telephone and not dance around the moscow metro system charlie intentionally arrived first at the chinese restaurant and limited himself to one vodkaclear not homebrewed yellowfrom the aperitif carafe intrigued by the womans surprising approach but determinedly refusing any preconceptions she arrived earlier than theyd arranged too at once locating their table and as she crossed toward it aware of the sexual fantasy of at least five separate male diners charlie thought again how similar he found her to svetlana modin who he supposed would expect contact sometime that day paulajane accepted vodka touched glasses and said ill let you order for me charlie did and chose georgian white instead of its heavier red or rice wine what makes you think this is one of my favorite moscow restaurants you introduced bill bundy to it didnt you charlies recollection was that it had been the americans choice i dont think he liked it very much hes an allamerican steakandsalad guy light on the mayo and ill open my own mineral water thank you she mocked he does remind me of you in some ways though which ways certainly not the mineral water but youre both always looking to see whos behind you perhaps ive got more reason for caution than he has you changed your mind about it being a coincidence not really id still like to think it was you seem to know bundy quite well probed charlie wanting to move her on shouldnt a girl know her own godfather well bill bundys your godfather exclaimed charlie in genuine surprise he and my dad went way back as far as vietnam before he met my mother even weve only really got together here i couldnt believe it when i heard he was getting a tour here that overlapped with me charlie found it difficult too remembering what david halliday had briefly told him about paulajanes father and wondering why the mi man hadnt mentioned the godfather connection is this what you wanted to tell me paulajane laughed heavens no i thought everyone knew about bill and me id even told london fortunately before paulassholerobertson why fortunately robertson described it as a conflict of interest which is bullshit were both too professional to let work overlap i think robertson was made to look stupid by london already knowing about it hes been made to look even more stupid after his runins with you hasnt he their food arrived charlie shook his head against tasting the wine before theyd finished the vodka howd you know about that he might be their division director but the guys monitoring your telephones think robertsons an asshole too if theyd gossiped about that they would have gossiped about the incoming calls too and that would have included irenas an informant is hardly necessary in that damned embassy is he the place is like a twentyfourhour public address system paulajane stopped with a gingered prawn between her chopsticks this is terrific im glad i left the ordering to you she became serious and our embassy leak is what i want to talk to you about talk then encouraged charlie i dont believe robertson is any closer to finding who it is now than he was on the day he first arrived here i think hes casting around for a way out and you could be it you want to spell that out a little more clearly he had me in front of his panel yesterday for the second time since he got sent back the questioning was concentrated on what i knew of you and svetlana modin and disinformation what did you tell them there was nothing i could tell them was there demanded paulajane rhetorically i didnt knownot until then at leastanything about you and svetlana and disinformation which is what i told them and why robertson pulled what he thought to be the ace from up his sleeve but which proved instead to be up his ass about bundy being my godfather you didnt know until then which was yesterday questioned charlie determined against any missed nuance yesterday was the first time it was put to me and i didnt understand what i was being questioned about elaborated the woman i do today completely from all the other pissedoff people under robertsons control and i wasnt the only one called in incidentally they recalled dave halliday and put him through the same hoop about you and svetlana i got you called back the first time and as far as i can remember you called me a bastard for doing so recalled charlie why are you warning me like this paulajane smiled extending her wineglass to be filled i still think youre a bastard and i wouldnt trust you if the pope gave you a personal reference but you were being professional putting me back in front of robertsons people i accept that now although i didnt at the time what i dont accept is a colleague even a bastard of a colleague being set up as robertson is trying to set you up to cover the fact he cant do the job hes been sent here to do thats very altruistic id like to think its me being professional cant robertson do his job he hasnt caught our spy has he i dont know hasnt he she frowned pained wed know believe me thank you for the warning you are a bastard arent you im not trying to make you into a friend just to get a free lunch said the woman retreating into her more usual shell i didnt mean to sound as i just did dont you think youre treading a fine line doing whatever it is you are with svetlana modin she demanded every end justifies its means if that ends successful she qualified you think it is being successful im still not yet sure what the end is going to be she came forward across the table her glass cupped between both hands dont you believe your dead man was a gangster as the russians are saying he was im still trying to work through their evidence but youre not going back to london yet i havent been recalled yet you think you are a decoyme too i guessfor a covert operation between the americas and people we dont know about whats your godfather say about that i told you we dont talk shop you want me to believe you havent asked him i mean he reminded me we dont talk shop when i did ask him hes as ornery a bastard as you are ive been used as a decoy before accepted charlie i didnt know it then any more than i know if its happening now maybe i should be thanking you after all for keeping me at arms length i thought you already have said charlie so now im thanking you again which makes us equally grateful one to the other what are you going to do about robertson watch my back which as you know i always do shrugged charlie gesturing for the bill paulajane grimaced rather than smiled i cant tell you how much you remind me of bill and lunch was exceptional i thought so too said charlie wondering if paulajane meant it for the same reasons as he did the fuller smile came when charlie picked up the briefcase as he straightened from the table now thats one way you didnt remind me of bill until now i never had you pegged as a briefcase man its the militia material i told you i was working through i need to keep it secure and i dont have a proper office or an available safe weve got an office safe thats as secure as fort knox for christs sake maybe i could use it when ive finished what i have to do said charlie its not looking hopeful announced aubrey smith the americans seem to be using at least three different ciphers with no obvious linking connection even when they switch between them some codebreakers even likened it to enigma unbreakable without the key id hoped wed moved forward a long way since the second world war criticized charlie disappointed it was the best example they could think of to illustrate their difficulty without possessing the key dismissed the directorgeneral the one advance is that we think ajax is the cia director which would explain the involvement of the kgb chairman suggested charlie thinking back to his earlier uncertainty like for like exactly if were right agreed smith anything more from your end charlie shifted in the claustrophobic cubicle unsure how far he could stretch his response he still hadnt properly thought through the conversation with paulajane nor had he completely read mikhail guzovs invented murder case file he said ive got to finish what the russians claim to be their murder solutionthe medical stuff particularlyto see if theres anything i can use to get ivans body copy it all to me here ordered smith you really think theyll surrender oskins body even if you find enough to challenge them and agree to it coming back here for whatever supposed reason no admitted charlie flatly neither do i think irena will cooperate anymore if we dont have some hope to offer her shes already given us what ivan stole from the archive but that started charlie but was stopped by a sudden thought what demanded the directorgeneral when charlie didnt continue i wasnt thinking properly it wasnt going to make sense hurriedly improvised charlie there doesnt seem to be much progress in the mole hunt here thats not your priority or your remit nors it robertsons to question how and with whom im trying to fulfil my function here said charlie it wouldnt be an easy contention to defend if push came to shove quickly to implant the innuendo in aubrey smiths mind he added unless robertson was acting to your instructions he certainly isnt following my instructions which meant they were from jeffrey smale charlie decided hed got everything he wanted out of the exchange and was anxious now to pursue the thought that had belatedly occurred to him he made an additional copy of the russian dossier on the murder he scanned in full to london and spent the rest of the afternoon toothcombing through it himself impressed by how well the russians had fictitiously woven the murder and dumping of ivan oskins body into the drugtrafficking gangs arrest and claimed retribution killing of sergei pavel charlie believed he found four discrepancies in the oskin medical evidence but judged none sufficient to mount an effective bodydisposing challenge particularly keeping in mind his conviction that the russians couldand undoubtedly wouldconfront him in return with the blood fabrication he divided his growing bulk of material between his briefcase and the fortunately concertinasided folder in which the murder files had been delivered and after filling the briefcase carefully rearranged its combination lock numerals getting to paulajane venabless office just after five i decided to use your safe for my briefcase he told her cleared an entire shelf for you said the woman her back to him as she opened it over her shoulder she said the combination is e i wont open it without your being present promised charlie what about the folder she asked nodding to what charlie still had under his arm stuff ive still got to go through said charlie irena answered on the second ring the uncertainty obvious despite her usual hoarseness he said i need to see you ive just got in from work where are you in a call box ive just left the embassy he hadnt anticipated a metro madrigal today he remembered is everything arranged no what is it then i have to see you he repeated a means justifying an end charlie thought again reminded of his need to talk to svetlana modin where your apartment what if ill be clear im frightened ill be there in an hour said charlie knowing that wasnt the reassurance shed wanted knowing too that he should feel a shit which he didnt irena novikov perched on the very edge of the windowfronting couch like a frightened bird about to burst into flight both hands gripped tightly in her lap but unable to stop the fear twitching through her a nervous tic pulling at the corner of her mouth on the unmarked side of her face her eyes were fixed on the folder that charlie left very visibly on his lap there is a problem a big one charlie was wedged on the straightbacked chair its discomfort matching the ache from his protesting feet at the pursuitdodging underground train ritual he was sure hed identified two peoplea man and a woman working separatelywhod kept up with him for four route switches before hed managed to lose them convincing him that the surveillance manpower had been at least doubled to defeat his evasion what we cant break the code theres more than one each of which needs separate unconnected ciphers and theres obviously a further cipheragain maybe even more than onenecessary to identify the participants without all the keys we cant open any doors which proves how important it is sensational like ivan said insisted the woman she lighted a cigarette it isnt anything unless we can read it understand it all what about your codebreakers they must have decoded something ivan must have told you more coaxed charlie avoiding her question she hesitated the nerve in her cheek tugging her mouth into an unintended smirk he said cairo was involved so he must also have told you a lot of the stuff was cia traffic thats where a lot of it came from the cia station in cairo he told me some of the early stuff was she lit another cigarette from the butt of that shed almost finished coughing told you or showed you told me showed me some things her voice was almost inaudible now he also told you it was sensational yes why was it sensational pressed charlie he must have told you why irena shook her head i told you he said it was too dangerous for me to know irena i dont think youre telling me the whole truth charlie very carefully kept his voice flat hinting no irritation or annoyance she sat avoiding his eyes for several moments before her lips moved as if forming words but there was no sound i didnt hear what you said irena people she managed in a hoarse whisper what about people thats why it is sensational because of the people it is about who are they these people it is all about what are their names the woman shook her head the first forcefulness since shed let him into the apartment no he wouldnt tell me any names thats what i couldnt know to keep me safe any names you read it all didnt you charlie openly accused ivan didnt show you some he showed you all of it didnt he and you looked at it all again after he was murdered and youd recognized he was the victim from the description at the press conference from which you got my number the silence lasted much longer this time at one point irenas shoulders started to heave and charlie was frightened she was going to collapse but she didnt although when she looked up her eyes were red from the nearness of tears he showed me everything and i looked at it all again when i knew it was ivan whod been killed but i couldnt read it because i didnt have the ciphers to understand it charlie didnt speak immediately either knowing the importance of every word in every phrase from now on then theres no way forward were beaten no irena protested your codebreakers and analysts havent had it long enough theyve got computer systems that can do things calculate things in seconds theyll break it in time theyve got to in time maybe agreed charlie stressing the doubt what have your people said in london about me about what i asked in return for giving you what i had everythings possible once they know what theyre rewarding you for which brings us back to time you know how the russians are trying to close everything down officially theres no reason for me to stay any longer in moscow if we publicly accept their story and ive got nothing with which to challenge their nonsense and if im recalled with me goes your contact your only chancecharlie hesitated in brief reluctance before offering the folder across the narrow space between themwhich is why ive brought ivans material back to you for a moment irena remained staring in astonishment youre not going to do anything but london has a copy of everything of course and theyll go on trying but i dont know for how long if theyll ever break it irena hesitantly accepted the package gazing disbelievingly down at it i thought your experts would work it out that it was the way so did i said charlie moving to get up from the uncomfortable chair irena finally burst into tears hunched forward over the folder rocking back and forth im sorry said charlie moving toward the door dont go she pleaded and stood up why didnt you tell me charlie demanded when he finished reading what she had brought from the bedroom two hours earlier irena shrugged i thought youd just take it i dont want to be abandoned i want to be helped there was nothing to be achieved by scolding her he had it now everything not everything he immediately corrected himself ill buy you a ticket a return as if youre coming back and get you a new passport with a visa we can attach in london i dont want you coming into the embassy its under media siege no i dont think i could do that ill need a photograph she began gnawing at her lip i dont have one you must have something we can enhance it in london if its not very good she shook her head theres photographs of you there reminded charlie pointing to the shrine and its selection of pictures of her and ivan together wed have to cut ivan out irena hesitated all right then what ill call give you flight numbers and tell you what to do you wont abandon me will you leave me here now that ive given you all ive got no irena i promise i wont abandon you it was past midnight before charlie finally got back to the savoy unencumbered any longer by the folder he had left with irena what little he now carried making no curious bulge inside his jacket pocket glad in his initial moments of euphoria back at irenas flat that hed resisted the impulse to alert london instantly by going directly to the embassy there was the customary handholding couple in the hotel lobby and charlie was sure others watching the embassy would have inferred from such a late return that he had something so vital it had to be reported to london at once to prevent such an assumption charlie sidestepped into the bar and ordered vodka thatunusuallyhe didnt want nothing could have improved his total exhilaration which unplanned though it was made the bar stop a good idea his first place and opportunity to sit and think beyond his almost unbelievable awareness ivan oskin had been rightclose to being terrifyingly rightin assessing as sensational what hed found in kgb archives could it charlie wondered be too sensational not his question to consider or answer his remit the remit hed insisted upon the directorgeneral acknowledging not that many hours earlier was to solve the murder of ivan nikolaevich oskin which charlie accepted he hadnt done nor would he ever be able to solve it what he had discovered was the reason for the poor overconfident desperate mans savage killing and doubtless prior although unsuccessful torture had irena come close to guessing the unspeakable agonies ivan oskin must have endured without disclosing the whereabouts of what his captors would have been so frantically determined to recover charlie resolved to make her understand not the horror which would have been so bad that even charlie didnt think himself capable of fully imagining it what hed try to make her understand was how much ivan must have loved her to have resisted until hed died rather than tell them where their secret was hidden and where it remained hidden with irena because her unknown apartment was still the most secure place until he got her safely hidden away beyond their reach and vengeance charlie wished he was more confident of doing that hed studied her existing russian passport and was sure that what he had snug in his inside pocket was sufficient for what he immediately had to do his uncertainty was whether irena could hang on as long as she had to for him to get her safely away from moscow his greatest uncertainty was whether he could satisfy everything she wanted even after that the false lovers were still in the lobby when charlie left the bar after the second vodka it wasnt until he got to his suite that charlie abruptly remembered something else that irena would insist upon prompted he supposed by their charade his painfully arduous and increasingly dangerous train hopping wasnt over after all the familiar warning throb from his left instep told him that hed overlooked something and it was essential that he didnt overlook anything what made you go back to her demanded the directorgeneral for the first time ever charlie detected a quaver in aubrey smiths voice at what had taken him three hours the following morning to copy to london a hunch said charlie who wished another one would come as quickly it occurred to me when we were speaking yesterday why didnt you mention it then i could have been wrong about what shed kept back lets hope youre not wrong and the deciphering experts confirm your analysis i am and they will predicted charlie if you are right there wont be any more internal problems at this end what about external what will we do with it not my decision our function begins and ends with us advising and protecting the government which this certainly does irenas desperate to get out im hardly surprised you think youve got everything for our immediate needs qualified charlie deciding not to tell the man why he had to go back to irena one more time a usable passport picture the most difficult she always stands to hide the burn scars when shes being photographed will there be a problem with the copy of a russian passport it wont be a copy its a genuine forensically provable document which our visa entry and exit stamps will obviously be as well no problems there then you sure you dont want to copy everything to me electronically rather than use tonights diplomatic bag the bags safer in the porous circumstances here inside the embassy and there might be other things i want to include thats how it will come back to you in the diplomatic bag you sure shes capable of going through with it her training was a long time ago warned charlie and shes very close to falling apart the brush contact to give her the passport will be the most difficult part you any idea how much surveillance youll be under leaving the country a hell of a lot accepted charlie and then some ive tried to cover that what are you going to tell the russians that im being recalled for consultations it would help if you could get that officially communicated through their ambassador to their interior ministry here no problem promised the directorgeneral our forensic science people have picked up some discrepancies particularly in the medical evidence but i dont think theres enough for us to mount a serious objection certainly not enough to get oskins body back here i didnt imagine there would be does she suspect that no said charlie bluntly youre not to have any contact with her on the aircraft from sheremetyevo ordered the directorgeneral or at heathrow youll probably be under hostile surveillance on the plane and therell almost certainly be more from the russian embassy when you arrive here well know her from the photograph youre sending warn her shell be received by a man and two women as if theyre relatives or close friends shell be taken at once to a safe house when its judged shes really safe shell get a house of her own wherever in england she chooses to live make sure that none of the three meeting her has any association past or present with anyone here at the embassy or with me i dont want any recognition to link me with them and by association with irena already ensured what if irena asks about money shell have a taxfree income from an indexlinked her eventual house or apartment will be paid for as will all its services and utilities for the rest of her life plastic surgeryto alter her appearance not essentially for the burn scarring but that can be corrected if its medically possiblewill be available if she wants it as well obviously as a new untraceable identity apart from not having ivan and his grave to grieve over irena should be happy enough with all that acknowledged charlie youve done well charlie bloody well and not just there here theres still a lottoo muchthat could go wrong cautioned charlie lets hope it doesnt lets agreed charlie meaning it during the waking moments of a fitful night charlie had mentally arranged his priorities paramount among them successfully smuggling irena out of the country but with other uncertainties still to resolve paulajane venables was already in her section of the intelligence rezidentura designer demure in blue smiling up as if in expectation of his arrival you certainly like early mornings she greeted gesturing in invitation to the quietly hissing percolator coffee would be good accepted charlie i needed to speak to london early something come up she asked at once im going back to london when a day or two is it all over im not sure im closing down the compound apartment its use is over he smiled up as she brought him the coffee did anything ever come out of it it was worth a try what about the postponed russian press briefing ive got to speak to the russians about that london doesnt seem to think i need to be here for it even if they reschedule it doesnt seem to have worked out very well for you no im sorry sorry that things werent easier between us and sorry that it didnt go better for you you going to have time for me to reciprocate that lunch theres rarely such a thing as a total success in what we do and im not sure at this moment about the lunch there might be a few more things to close down it would have helped to have got this one right though in the current london climate wouldnt it would have helped a lot you didnt bring your other stuff to put in the safe said the woman looking pointedly around charlie as if she might have missed seeing the folder not quite finished with it all yet avoided charlie when i was stationed here permanently the diplomatic bag went around four thirty is that still the departure time four thirty on the button you can set your watch by it paulajane made a vague gesture to the safe in the corner of her office what about your briefcase ill pick it up later said charlie ill let you know about the lunch there was an engaged sign displayed in the occupancy slot of robertsons inquiry room door so charlie continued on to the compound apartment there were only four logged calls three from svetlana modin and one from mikhail guzov charlie told the two monitoring technicians that he was closing the operation down but hadnt yet told robertson everything wrapped up then suggested one of the men something like that replied charlie charlie chose a public telephone kiosk at random on deneznyj pereulok ensuring he had sufficient coin before finally going into the box the fsb general answered at once the condescension very evident until charlie announced he was being recalled to discuss what london considered a combination of anomalies and discrepancies in the russian material what anomalies and discrepancies demanded guzov i dont knowwont knowuntil i get back i dont guzov started before correcting himself neither my ministry nor the government expect this to become an unnecessary possibly embarrassing dispute as i am sure neither you nor your government wants either i wont know what my government wants or expects until i return to london charlie parried i thought it courteouspart of our continuing cooperationto advise you it would be unfortunate for instance if any more public statementscertainly a reconvened conference during my absence in londonwere prematurely made i had hoped you would have understood that there is not going to be a reconvened conference that everything was going to be left to the court hearing i also hope that will not prove to be a premature decision matched charlie when can we speak again when i get back from london when will that be ill call from london on this number to tell you do that demanded the russian i fear there is a risk of some serious even politically embarrassing misunderstandings arising between us our forensic medical examiners found some inexplicable anomalies and discrepancies in some of your submitted material he couldnt have hoped for a better advantage charlie recognized then its fortunate that all the assembled evidence particularly the embassy victim remains for further examination next he called svetlana modin who also responded at once and with similar initial aggression we had a deal there was nothing for us to talk about how did you know because i couldnt reach you we couldnt broadcast what i wanted guzov couldnt possibly have reached her to prompt the questions charlie knew what was it you were going to say youre not going to like it try me that the combined murder dossier is complete without any english input and that the spy in your embassy has beaten you whats your comment on that i dont have one thats what im saying tonight what about the covert us and british operation that it hasnt yet been stood down it sounds like you have other better sources than me we had a deal remember svetlana said for the second time the embassy incident room has been closed down thank you said the woman in the belief that she was getting the confirmation she wanted i can always reach you at this number i want you to it might be difficult over the next couple of days ill call when i can charlies luck held for the third time with natalias immediate reply to his call im going back to london but only briefly i want to see you talk to you before i go sure now that the car crash had only been a warning charlie was equally sure he hadnt put natalia in any danger keeping their mcdonalds rendezvous any more than he would be doing now i cant today she hadnt refused outright he thought at once tomorrow the botanical gardens one oclock not the botanical gardens natalia refused i dont like old memories charlie frowned at the rejection where the restaurant near the gardens hows sasha shes made you another picture its a tiger but it doesnt have any stripes and its blue can i buy her a present no refused natalia seeming to realize her sharpness she added more softly well talk about it tomorrow irena was already in the apartment when charlie got there promptly at twelve fifteen opening the door at once to his knock its all there she said nodding to the folder hed left the previous night ill take that too said charlie nodding to the shrine the russians would never release ivans body but at least he could ensure she had her visible memories why she asked frowning youll want it with you in england wont you yes but i dont think its a good idea for you to try to carry it out do you i hadnt thought she groped uncertainly my ways guaranteed we dont want anything to go wrong do we what could go wrong i dont really want to part with it luggage gets xrayed as an antiterrorist precaution yours could be opened if the medals showed get removed trust me irena nothing will happen to any of it charlie got back to the embassy just after three with ample time to examine the briefcase retrieved from paulajanes safe together with what hed collected from irena and pack it into his specifically assigned and waxsealed and stamped container inside that nights untouchable diplomatic shipment to london youre taking a lot of care commented paulajane i always do just like your godfather remember when hed examined it earlier in his rabbithutch room the combination numerals on the briefcase were set as hed arranged them before it had gone into paulajanes safe but the pages of the russian murder file were in a different order from how hed assembled them and two sheets hed intentionally inserted back to front from their sequential order had been corrected and the savoy suite appeared to be untouched from how hed left it but every intrusion trap hed set had been disturbed by intruders who had conducted an otherwise very professional search charlie poured himself the generous islay single malt he thought he might need and settled himself before his television in good time for svetlanas evening broadcast it wont work now it will work irena was teetering on the very edge of hysteria charlie recognized as hed recognized in his fury how svetlana had spun the broadcast totally to defeat his attempt to discover from his carefully planted information who was leaking from the british embassy guzov could have been the only source for svetlana actually using the words anomalies and inconsistencies in the official british note to the russian interior ministry but svetlana had talked of his being recalled to prove her insistence of further deteriorating relations between london and moscow shed also used library film footage of him in a segment suggesting that charlie was taking new information back to london charlie said its all going to be as i promised theres a permanent fsb watch at the airport theyll just increase it get the manifest naming everyone on board im the only person theyll be interested in well be associatedtoo closewhen you pass me the passport and the ticket the concentration will be inside the terminal argued charlie the exchange that was necessary between them already formulated in his mind i will give you a precise time when ill be arriving outside to within minutes you get there earlier so that as we go toward the entrance separately we get closer bunching nearer the door thats when ill do the drop you hesitate as if youve forgotten something so that youre nowhere near me when we get into the terminal ill do nothing to avoid attention if there is anyattract it in factand you wont even be noticed well use the attention not suffer from it none of this was how you promised it would be complained irena although slightly less anxiously listen to the promises you are already guaranteed insisted charlie taking his time to list the arrangements in place for irenas arrival in london you didnt say anything about ivans body she isolated the moment charlie stopped talking i didnt mention it because it hasnt been arranged yet i want ivan with me in england i want him buried there properly know the place where hell be he will be buried in england stressed charlie hoping he sounded sincere i wont go leave here until i know hes already there its got to be this wayyou first then ivan it doesnt have to be this way you know it does he didnt need irena anymore charlie thought brutally hed got everything he wanted from her and there was no way the fsb could find her if she stayed in moscow so why was he bothering because she deserved better than the way in which she existed because he wanted to hed abandoned too many innocent people in the past but this time hed do his best to at least get her somewhere better than whereand howshe was now shed hate him he accepted when she realized ivans body couldnt be brought to englandwhich he didnt think it couldbut at least shed get most of what she wanted when there was no response from her end charlie said irena i dont think i can do it she declared sobs snatching at her words you can you must insisted charlie knowing he had to force her do everything ive told you the moment you get to london therell be people waiting at the airport to look after you as ive explained from that moment youll be safe forever its got to be now irena with me no one will come back for you if you dont come now therell be no second chance i know she mumbled so be there ill try be there charlie was too early for his meeting with natalia so he filled the time by going nostalgically into the botanical gardens that featured so much in their relationship but wouldnt any longer there was little more he could say or do to persuade her all the promises and assurances used up could he quit the service as hed told her he could he believed so even if natalia didnt and he would resign as well as keeping the personal vow never to lie to her again thered be a lot hed miss but a lot more than he wouldnt assignments like this in particular not that he could genuinely recall any that were as similarly cluttered by what he now recognized clearly to be meticulously planned chaos the reason for which he at last knew and now understood what he still didnt know was precisely who those planners were and most important of all what london would do with the sensation with which hed presented them charlie was already inside the restaurant his chosen table so secluded in the corner farthest from the entrance that natalia didnt immediately see him when she entered fifteen minutes late i was beginning to think you werent coming said charlie as she sat i stopped at the gardens for old times sake so did i she shook her head against an aperitif but charlie held the waitress to get the ordering out of the way natalia appeared as disinterested in the food as charlie saying shed have the same as him when the waitress left natalia took a folded sheet of paper from her handbag and said heres sashas tiger you didnt tell me it had red ears sasha had strayed over the body outline again they were an afterthought did you tell her we were meeting today natalia shook her head she wanted to give it to you herself if we bumped into you again charlie held natalias eyes does that mean were not going to no it doesnt mean that what then a compromise what compromise it said on television last night that youre being recalled the inference was that you were in some kind of trouble she raised her hand a halting gesture as charlie moved to speak i dont want any details the same fear as irena of danger by association thought charlie im not in trouble i expect to be back here in a few days im glad that youre okay they stopped talking at the arrival of borsch and the red wine charlie said its complicated though things that we do always seem to be you still havent told me what you mean by compromise how longs it going to be before everything youre here for to be wrapped up i dont know a few weeks say three a month at the most theres not the difficulty there used to be moving in and out of russia said natalia im due leave and sashas school is breaking up for their summer recess it would work perfectly if youd completed everything in a month sasha and i could come to london for a vacation only for a vacation im not going to rush anything charlie i want to see how i feel when i get there and i want to see how sasha feels we wont stay with you but well see you a lot and i want to be absolutely sure that itll work before i make the final decision if you dont think thats a good idea that im not being fair and that its not going to give me or you enough time then ill understand i think tried charlie but natalia cut him off ive always been honest with you but you havent always been honest with me so heres my honesty i do love you despite all the things that have happened in the past but were not starryeyed teenagers love isnt enough im thinking mostly about sasha the adjustments shes going to have to make and we would have to make a lot of adjustments too both of us thats my compromise how i want us to go forward as i hope we can thats how i want us to go forward too accepted charlie at once natalia sipped her wine at last im glad thats over so am i said charlie meaning it youre really not in trouble are you charlie thats what im really worried about something happening that would ruin it all she hesitated this is our last chance its complicated as i told you there wasnt a complication he couldnt overcome after this literally everything was falling into place exactly as he wanted which it continued to do with minor exceptions throughout the rest of the day charlie was anxious to limit the time he spent that afternoon at the embassy he sent a courtesy memo to peter maidment advising the acting ambassador of his return to london carefully omitting departure and return dates and was glad that paulajane venabless absence from the rezidentura spared her assuming he was leaving the following day from his vagueness about her outstanding luncheon invitation david halliday wasnt in his section either but the newspapers were svetlana modins broadcast the previous night was yet again the basis for most of the print media coverage his return to londonall using the word recallconfirmed an increasingly deepening disagreement between london and moscow over the murder investigation all reported the refusal of the russian interior ministry to make any comment charlie didnt encounter paul robertson either and didnt try to locate the man irena novikovs passport arrived as promised in the diplomatic bag but separately from the preliminary forensic report charlie had asked to be conducted on the briefcase and the russian murder dossier it had contained on both the dossier and the briefcase there were five different and fresh sets of fingerprints there was also sufficient surviving residual finger sweat hopefully to provide dna traces one of the five sets was identified as charlies from their being recorded on his personnel records the other provable prints were paulajanes on his way back to the savoy charlie weighed the potential advantages against disadvantages of making contact with svetlana modin and decided not to bother there wasnt anything either half true or totally invented that might benefit him and he was determined not to risk anything that might further disorientate or unsettle irena novikov would it take a month to conclude it all as hed told natalia not everything he accepted to conclude everything hed have to identify ivan oskins killers and hed already acknowledged hed never be able to do that so it could even be as little as two weeks hed take leave directly afterward he wanted to be free of any distraction or intrusion when natalia and sasha were in london hed have to get the right hotel a suite not a room but not overwhelm them as natalia so often complained he did maybe not an hotel at all perhaps shed prefer a shortterm sublet apartment in which they could live more as they did in moscow and natalia could get a better experience of what living in london would be like they didnt necessarily have to live in london not if natalia didnt want to that was another possible idea rent a car and drive around england showing them the countryside and the beaches as well as the london tourist sites they most certainly would never see the graffitidaubed vauxhall council isolation flat in which he lived during assignments david halliday was already in the bar when charlie entered on the stool next to charlies accustomed corner seat turning in greeting when he saw charlie approaching in the bars backplate mirror i was going to give you another ten minutes before calling up said the mi officer nodding to the waiting vodka ordered for you when they told me at reception that you were here appreciate the forethought thanked charlie as he sat thought id come to say goodbye we didnt actually get together very much did we pity moscow really has changed a lot since the last time you were here there hasnt actually been much time for socializing said charlie maybe when i get back when will that be nothings fixed i might not be here which is why i came tonight said halliday lvovs off on a triumphal tour before the inevitable st petersburg odessa south as far as the black sea londons told me to tag along isnt that getting a little too close charlie frowned thats what i thoughtand saidwhen i got the brief theory is that the media entourage will be so large well all be lost in the crowd theres a rumor that the fsb have tried to bug the lvov campaign headquarters after the conference hijack and that funeral business and that they might try to derail the tour with staged agitators everywhere lvov goes well questioned charlie pjs coming along as well and for the same reason im to tell you goodbye and sorry about the lunch maybe some other time and place howd she know i called by i didnt go into her outer office to get picked up on her cctv halliday shrugged unknowing you sure youre coming back thats the intention why shouldnt i be coming back you must have something a damned sight better than anomalies and discrepancies to face down guzov insisted halliday well see evaded charlie id hate to be in the wrong place at the wrong time said the mi officer are you asking me something queried charlie just a nod in the right direction suggested halliday russias a hell of a big place takes days to get from one part to another you think theres any reason for me to stay in moscow instead of traipsing all over the country on a political ego trip no reason whatsoever said charlie i appreciate the guidance said halliday and heres my offering in return im grateful for what you did but gerald monsfords as mad as hell you guys kept us out hes making little wax effigies of you you ever end up in the same room together get out as fast as you can hes a bastard ill remember that halliday checked his watch i need to go got a six am start tomorrow if we do overlap when we get back ill definitely say thank you in a more tangible way and charlie what im sure as hell glad the embankment business was a coincidence although im obviously sorry about jack hopkins thanks svetlana made no mention whatsoever of the embassy murder on that nights program which was entirely devoted to the possibility of staged fsb disruptions to the countrywide tour of the federation by stepan lvov indicating the present governments panic at lvovs inevitable election the following morning charlie walked the short distance from the hotel to use the telephone kiosk in red square ten oclock he told irena when she answered ill be there im all right charlie didnt think she was from the tone of her voice but she was there charlie saw irena the moment his taxi joined the last ten vehicles in the final stopstart line to the departure terminal and was as relieved as he was encouraged irena wasnt standing too obviously expectant or searching but fumbling with a baggage trolley arranging and repositioning her single scuffed camelskin suitcase her handbag which hed examined and agreed perfect for their brush contact drop when hed picked up the shrine objects was exactly where hed rehearsed her to put it too on the right of the trolley handle but at that moment with the topopening zip only half undone charlie abruptly ordered his cab to stop about five yards from where she had put herself the sudden braking getting the horn blast he wanted to give her further time to locate him charlie twice queried the charge knowing that she had seen him and was walking in his direction when he turned toward the terminal with his single case in his right hand his left hand inside his raincoat pocket clutching the passport and her ticket in readiness for what he had to transfer to her he let irena pass and followed to within ten yards of the terminal entrance before closing the gap between them able to see that shed fully unzipped the handbag to gape open as he got level shouldering into the bottlenecked crush directly outside the door she showed no reaction to the slight tug she would have felt as he put the passport and ticket hed bought the previous day into the bag and in the brief seconds the drop took he was physically aware there was no nervous shaking charlie continued straight on hoping shed remember to hold back the moment he entered to a possible ambush which was exactly what he did the media frenzy was far more concentrated than hed feared a mob surging toward and around him squawking an incomprehensible babble of questions he recognized svetlana modin moments before the strobe and camera lights burst blindingly into his face distinguishing her voice through the hubbub although not what she was saying charlie forced his way on toward the checkin desk shaking his head and repeating nothing to say and no comment before being brought up short by the checkin line he had to join blinking in the whitening lights his lips opening and closing with his nothingtosay mantra charlie guessed hed look like a rare fish species landed from the deepest depths it would have been he later decided her recognition as the newsbreaking leader that finally got svetlana propelled into the demanding forefront of the media pack which quietened in expectation of her informed questioning to do so she wedged herself directly in front of charlie physically cutting him off from the shuffling line despite the melee in which he was trapped charlie concededand admiredthe expertise with which she adjusted her questions for his no comment or nothing to say replies virtually to confirm what she was asking just as he did by remaining tightlipped head shaking and mute which was his initial reaction as well as compounding the landedfish impression with which he had to live charlie accepted the sole consideration had been to create a smokescreen into which irena could safely and completely disappear and charlie was sure hed done that his flight was actually being called when charlie finally reached the checkin desk breathing in like a drowning man coming up for air at the sudden release from the crush two plainclothesmen stood beside the counter clerk the elder completely bald the other bespectacled and clearly subordinate both scrutinized charlies ticket and passport before passing each to the clerk when charlie lifted his suitcase toward the loading chute the younger man gestured to a narrow gate beside the desk and said come through here with it please there would be no problem if he missed the flight charlie knew meekly obeying by now irena had to be in the embarkation lounge if not actually aboard the plane and there were people to receive her at heathrow there certainly wasnt anything to be gained from protesting there was a burst of light from behind from television cameras recording the latest episode of his personal soap opera on the other side of the desk he again followed the gestures of the younger man into an awkwardly cluttered side office the main obstruction was a temporary bench behind which the two men positioned themselves leaving charlie on the other side a departure search is usual suggested charlie feeling that some innocuous question would be expected security check claimed the bald man have you anything to declare im not an islamic terrorist but im glad youre taking the risk seriously the men were meticulous individually taking out and examining every itemseparating each sock from its partner and handkerchief from its layerbefore feeling for anything a seam or trouser turnup or lining might conceal each item was placed beside the emptied case for it to be carried to another temporary but smaller bench to be xrayed after which the younger man repacked charlies suitcase with the meticulous care with which hed unpacked it i hope i havent missed my plane said charlie you havent assured the older man which was true everyone else was on board when charlie entered the plane the door closing immediately behind him to further separate them on the flight charlie had booked himself in business class and as he turned toward it charlie saw irena in an aisle seat halfway along the economy section charlie refused any food and limited himself to two whiskies because it wasnt islay single malt and he expected to be taken at once to see the directorgeneral charlie hadnt anticipated a repeat of the euphoria at his finally understanding the significance of oskins material but hed at least hoped for a feeling of satisfaction at getting irena safely away so why didnt he theres a lot of traffic were missinga lot the russians clearly failed to interceptbut enough for us to be sure that you got it right congratulated the directorgeneral the previous days irritation gone its definitely stepan grigorevich lvov whos going to become the next russian president charlie broke in responding to whatever whenever and however washington dictates completed an interrupting aubrey smith its the cia coup of the century when hed originally been admitted into this rarefied topfloor sanctuary the cream and green mi headquarters on the opposite side of the thames at vauxhall hadnt even been built remembered charlie that visit had been to receive his first commendation the one he had been promised today would bring his total up to eleven no doubt at all absolutely none washingtons confirmed it and from our own archives we discovered that oskin was in cairo at the same time as lvov that must be how he picked up on the transmission he would have known the ciphers of their cia opposition there there were three kgb officers on station in the egyptian capital the station chief was valeri voznoy a valeri voznoy officially listed as an army general was killed in the same afghan ambush in which oskin lost his arm bill bundy whos been reassigned to moscow served in cairo said charlie recalling their chinese lunch i didnt know that but everything fits doesnt it no refused charlie washington is aware that we know whats going on the majority decision was that we couldnt let an opportunity like this pass it got to prime ministertopresident level weve been cut in on the deal were going to handle lvov jointly asked charlie wanting as always to know it all thats the undertaking the americans wouldnt share anything of this magnitude insisted charlie theyll cheat and lie give us just enough to make us think were included and possibly use us for misinformation to provide lvov with extra cover i agree and said so at every meeting of the cabinet and the joint intelligence committee said smith i told you it was a majority decision mine was the minority dissenting opinion who led the majority argument jeffrey smale no longer the deputy directorgeneral in a fortnight his promotion to director will be confirmed after his return from washington to sign and seal the deal what about the embassy murder asked charlie resigned to the answer but building in time to think we accept the russian version and let the frenzy die down and for everything to be forgotten its still an unsolved murder protested charlie hes a smalltime unimportant kgb clerk whose mistress is going to live in luxury and safety for the rest of her life corrected the soontobe former directorgeneral unusually harsh theres still a mole inside the moscow embassy reminded charlie to find who it is robertson will remain in moscow and keep searching and while he does personnel replacement will be accelerated a year from now those in any sensitive position will have been moved if robertson fails this isnt right declared charlie none of this is right too many things too often arent agreed smith with no way of properly understanding charlies outburst charlie didnt understand it himself at that moment it was an involuntary remark to himselfa warninghe had to work out he needed a break time to sift the uncertainties flooding in upon him he wasnt uncertain about one thing smith was telling him though what are you going to do grow roses in sussex said the man smiling wanly and you will definitely get the commendation i promise you it automatically guarantees your promotion to grade iv with an additional a year pension entitlement thank you said charlie it was hardly a devastating end he accepted philosophically with natalia and sasha soon to be here with him it was rather a decision made for him instead of having finally to make it for himself this way he would leave the organization and finish up a year better off so why didnt he take the easy way out and let the inconsistencies go because it wasnt right believing america would keep its promise wasnt right and a lot of what had happened in moscow wasnt right and how hed thought hed worked everything out wasnt right and because he now didnt understand any of it anymore and he didnt know what to do to make it right im sorry charlie apologized smith itll look bad publicly because of all your exposure but that same publicity would have made things operationally limiting for you from now on what about irena charlie asked anxious to get some order into his confusion does everything i agreed stay as far as irena is concerned absolutely guaranteed smith that stuff you shipped back under the diplomatic seal is in the vault by the way under your name and release authority and jack hopkins the directorgeneral looked blankly across his desk the driver who was crippled instead of me being driven off the embankment road prompted charlie the other mans face cleared full pension and medical support for life an ex gratia payment of im glad about that said charlie one of the several working condition improvements charlie had enjoyed under aubrey smiths patronage was a singleoccupancy senior grade office and charlie had been there for only fifteen minutes running all the thoughts and half thoughts through his mind when a call on the dedicated line from aubrey smiths office broke into his reflections seems theres a bit of a problem announced smith irena seems satisfied enough with her safe house but shes refusing to undergo any debriefing until shes talked to you about what she gave you thats not right said charlie a man reciting a litany i dont want anything to go wrong with the handover to smale give an impression of sour grapes said smith ignoring charlies insistent interjection youre still officially her control can you sort it out i intend to said charlie never expectedor wantedto hear from you again greeted jack smethwick when charlie identified himself on the telephone i submitted a disassociation report like i told you i would after all that bullshit you had me set up this is much easier charlie assured the forensic scientist ill protest again if its not im definitely not falsifying anything else im not asking you to said charlie it shouldnt take you longer than an hour it didnt neither did the next telephone call charlie made i expected you yesterday complained irena the moment charlie entered the room i sent you a message that there were some things i had to sort out reminded charlie aware how cautious he had to be im here now i dont understand why i had to wait until tonight either or why i have been brought here she continued waving her hand toward the obvious recording apparatus on the table separating them this is a debriefing room with the exception of that television which i also dont understand ive told you everything i know given you all i had you know the bureaucracy of these things said charlie soothingly spreading out his hands in apparent helplessness you wanted to see me ivans things all my memories and mementos you said youd get them here for me but they werent here when i arrived i want them with me as i had them in moscow ive got them promised charlie irena smiled unexpectedly her familiar tension lessening i was frightened something might have happened to them when they werent here theyre all safe im sorry i was rude just then but theyre all i have theyre my life what life ive got left i suppose can i have them id like to set everything up as i had it all in moscow i first want you to see something thats very important said charlie picking up the television control box he estimated that he had an hourninety minutes topsand the recording ran for ten minutes could he get it all in that time if he didnt he could quite easily be a dead man hed never gambled as desperately as this in his entire life and hoped it wasnt showing the room was filled with the familiar theme tune introducing orts nightly news backing a montage of svetlana modins recent exclusives before dissolving into a wide outside broadcast shot of the anchorwoman with the british houses of parliament in her background tightening down into a closeup of svetlanas face as you can see from the buildings behind me i am broadcasting by satellite tonight from london england a country so recently the subject of so much mystery intrigue and speculation from moscow following the unexplained murder in its embassy grounds there tonight i can solve that mystery identify the victim and disclose the most sensational story in the history of modernor even premodernrussia it is that stepan grigorevich lvov until tonight and until this revelation so confidently predicted to become the next president of the russian federation is and has for almost two decades been an agent of americas central intelligence agency a spy against the very country he wanted to lead irena broke away from the hypnotism of the tv screen to look at charlie bulging eyed the nervous tic pulling at her open mouth which moved but from which no words came had lvov attained that presidency then heand the russian federationwould have become puppets performing in whatever way the strings were pulled by the president of the united states of america reducing our great country to a vassal jumptoorder client state svetlana was saying the british picture dissolved into a compilation of library footage dominated by film of lvov at crowded rallies at the hijacked russian press conference giving his undertaking of openness and cooperation with america and at the funeral of sergei pavel all the time with svetlanas voice relayed over she identified ivan oskin as a longserving russian intelligence agent and afghan war hero who discovered evidence of lvovs treachery in kgb and fsb records but of his having been detected and murdered by an american assassination team as he tried to reach the sanctuary of the british embassy believing as he had that it was impossible for lvov to be working alone but supported by a major but unidentified cabal of suborned russian spies deep within the lubyanka the outside broadcast returned to svetlana holding up to the camera a sheet of paper she claimed to be the evidence of secret cia cables identifying lvovs code name as icon svetlana concluded that she was broadcasting from london because shed feared the lubyanka cabal would have prevented her transmitting from moscow she was right about that remarked charlie conversationally inwardly in turmoil at twentyfive minutes having passed since his entry into the room that was the full transcript what was being shown in moscow was blacked out after about four minutes just enough time to identify lvov as a cia agent and to name oskin but the satellite feed came from london and went out worldwide translated and uncensored to all the tv stations whod bought the transmissionblind before its broadcaston the reputation of her previous exclusives do you realize have any conception the destruction irena groped no coherent thought held in her mind my destruction uppermost thought charlie completing the womans thought i think i do i was close to missing it because like everyone else i missed the little things and as an actress you were phenomenal if you hadnt been so anxious to get your phony shrine back so that you could destroy it you would probably have gotten away with it the message i got was that you wanted the things youd given me meaning what i shipped here for you but then i remembered you gave me the ciphers for the transmitted cia cables which wouldnt have been in the kgb archives so conveniently close to the cables themselves would they it would be unthinkable for them to be together even in an ongoing operation precisely because it would make it all so easy to understand as it was easy for me virtually to understand youre talking in riddles not making sense i think i am making sense irena although that isnt your real name is it that phony shrine which totally fooled me was your only danger wasnt it id missed your having the ciphers ready to convince me further and i really did think your shrine was genuine come on charlie thought for christs sake break forty minutes had already gone by youre mad gone mad accused irena shaking her head our forensic people thought all the memorabilia was put together brilliantly continued charlie as if she had not spoken those superimposed photographs of you and ivan together were fantastic they really did look as if you and he were a genuine couple did you ever really know him you werent ever in cairo togetherthat camelskin case was a clever prop by the waybecause we named everyone who was there and they were all men an oversight but again one that would have been easily missed stop it demanded the woman none of it would have amounted to a row of beans without your shrine though you totally convinced me it was your altar to the man you loved but then i thought back to the picture i had to have for your passport that wasnt your real apartmenti realize now it was an fsb operational nestand you wouldnt have had any individual photographs of yourself there but instead of promising to find one the following day you let me cut up one supposedly of you and ivan together in happy times that was your one mistake although again i didnt realize it at the time only when other things didnt knit together loving him as you convinced me you did youd never have let me destroy a picture of you and him together but you were thinking more of how cutting it up would destroy the evidence of it having been doctored photographically to join you and him together which it did it wasnt until all the other stuff was looked at scientifically that i worked it out when the hell was she going to crack and fill in all the missing bits i want help someone to get me away from you well send you back to moscow of course weve got everything we can possibly get from you therere no more flights tonightive checkedbut theres plenty tomorrow no she said her tone audibly different he was getting there shouldnt rush irenaits easier to go on calling you thatnow its you who isnt making sense why should we keep you here look after you here knowing what we know now theyll think i told you not that you worked it out had the sense to have that fucking shrine forensically examined blurted the woman hed got her not my problem youve got nothing more to give me yes i have you havent got the half of it ive got all of it it took her thirty minutes running right up to his longest time estimate and throughout it charlie remained coiled springtight tensed for the interruption that might still have ruined everything but never came when she finished he got as far as youll get everything i promised you what i before the door burst open and the room was suddenly crowded with men to charlie the leading arresting officer said weve got you you bastard one of charlies many fears was that hed be interrogated at the american embassy where he would probably have been denied any opportunity to speak he wasnt although there was little comfort in his being taken to an anonymous hut complex at the securityrestricted raf base at northolt on the outskirts of london with the obvious threat of his being put aboard an alwaysdenied cia rendition flight to the united states or worse with islamic terror suspects to one of the torture destination flights to romania or albania but at least it appeared that jeffrey smale was chairing the panel of eight unidentified men confronting him the deputy director was the only man charlie recognized apart from the directorgeneral himself aubrey smith was not part of the examining group but ostracized to one side like a fellow defendant from the way they were dressed at least three of the men facing him were american charlies reassurance came from the operator hunched at the recording apparatus on its separate table and that in their urgency to get him before a kangaroo court his arresting officers had not searched him to discover the video he had extracted from its debriefingroom recording machine seconds before they had swept into the room in which hed been with irena normal formalities are being dispensed with announced smale his usually red bloodpressured face purple with unsuppressed fury you have knowingly wrecked an intelligence operation twenty years in its planning and execution and caused incalculable harm and damage to the united states of america and to this country any recovery or salvation of that operation is impossible but you will provide immediately the names of all others with whom you are in contact for them to be detained as soon as possible is that clear to you time isnt your problem said charlie youve been saved all of you from making the biggest intelligence mistake since the creation of the cia and possibly in the modern history of either british security service there was at least a full minute of total silence before the man next to smale exploded in an accent confirming charlies american recognition for christs sake whats happening here aware of at least six of the arresting officers grouped in a semicircle behind him charlie extended his arms fully in front of him and said in my right inside jacket pocket is the recording of my debriefing of the woman known as irena novikov if you will not allow me to take it out to be played to you i ask that someone does it for me stay as you are came the command behind him and a hand was thrust roughly into his jacket the man whod called charlie a bastard came into view examining the disc to smale the security officer said its a recording not a weapon start it as eightyfour on the use register charlie told the recording technician at smales nod of agreement into the room came charlies voice youve got nothing more to give me then irenas yes i have you havent got the half of it ive got it all charlie thats what its got to be all of it irena its my only operation ever a lifetimes work all gone charlie im waiting there was no hint of the anxiousness hed been feeling decided charlie satisfied irena the americans were wrong as they so often are about my not having been in cairo they simply didnt identify me valeri voznoy wasnt the kgb station chief i was my cover was a typist it was my idea all of it after vladimir putin left the kgb and became the russian president why cant we become president of the united states of america i thought that was my concept and i chose lvov too we were lovers even then bundy was the cias cairo station chiefa laughthat was our first success making bundy into the supposed russian expert feeding him whatever we wanted it was genuine stuff of course but low level everywhere lvov went bundy was transferred with him the cia was convinced lvov was theirs and bundy was his control lvov fed him the idea of going into politics using putin as an example and the stupid bastards fell over themselves over maybe ten years theyve paid us over all of which has gone into other operations against themanother laughchrist theyre so gullible and stupid there was a visible shift of discomfort from five of the men facing him finally identifying the entire american contingent irena it couldnt stay perfect of course cairo was the problem from where it all began i didnt bother about oskin or voznoy after cairo it was only when everything started to go wrong when it was too late that i went back through their personnel files and discovered theyd been posted to afghanistan together we never found out who suspected anything although it was no secret that lvov and i were sleeping together but i suppose it must have been voznoy we couldnt interrogate him because he died in the ambush in which oskin lost his arm it wasnt us who killed oskinalthough i would have done if id known the blackmail he was trying to set up he died under american interrogation and we dont know enough of what he told them just scraps like he didnt go at first to the americans but tried to speak to the british embassy charlie ive got to stop you there how did the british embassy come into it why was oskins body dumped there if he died under american interrogation irena if only we could have known it all it wouldnt have ended like this it would have ended with lvov as the president of the russian federation appearing to work for the cia as far as they believed with the american president unquestioningly reacting in whichever way we wanted because lvov had supplied them with genuine lowgrade material for so long the american president would have been dancing to our tune i wouldnt have had to improvise so much give away so much what we do know is that before he diedof a heart attack incidentally not from the bullet to the back of his head that blew his face awayhe said he had been to the british embassy but not who hed seen or what he said charlie oskin was already dead why shoot a dead man irena probert decided on a mystery as much confusion and disinformation as possible according to what bundy told lvov charlie how how do you know this there was a long silence charlie everything irena i want it all there was a further laugh from the woman irena im not holding out on you shes not our spy not anyones spy not properly i suppose just a little gossip who cant keep her mouth shut charlie she irena your colleague paulajane venables charlie youre losing me irena shes been seduced in every meaning of the word it started out normally enough like these things do an affairbesotted on her part according to bundy who couldnt stop boasting to lvovbetween her and john probert shes drawn to all things american her father having been one she became more than a bed partner for probert when oskin talked of going to your embassy before trying to sell whatever he thought he knew to the americans she didnt know what it was she hadnt seen oskin but halliday might have it was proberts ridiculous idea to dump the body in your embassy grounds which was stupid and wouldnt have happened if bundy had already been in moscow but he wasnt not for another five days by which time it was too late probert thought paulajane would be able to get whatever it was from halliday if the body was dumped literally on his doorstepdont ask me the reasoning i dont think there was one just cia stupidityand that it would be an investigation handled by russian police that would get nowhere because bundy could get it fixed through lvov which he could have done still tried to instead of which you came and refused to have anything to do with the venables woman and started your own disinformation which we had no way of stopping and halliday didnt have anything to tell her anyway because it wasnt until probert got back to the embassy after having the body dumped that he was properly able to read the pages hed ripped from the gatehouse log of the day he knew oskin had gone there that oskin hadnt seen anybody neither venables nor halliday had been at the embassy the log note was that oskin had refused to give a name or a contact when hed asked to see an intelligence officer which is hardly surprising but that hed call back instead he went to the american embassy and told probert what he knew expecting to be paid off but instead he got tortured to death there was renewed and even more obvious discomfited movement from the americans confronting charlie charlie i still dont understand how you know as much as you do irena dumping oskins body in your embassy was disastrous for me i didnt have control anymore but we had an open line into the american embassy through lvovs constant contact with bundy who in turn milked the venables woman as much as he could because he really is her godfather which he told her to report to your people to avoid any suspicion but it still wasnt enough for me charlie who put the bugs into the embassy irena the americans probert could come and go as he liked to see venables before you arrived thats how he knew the embassy cctv cameras were faulty and could dump the body after fixing the distraction for the gatehouse guards that night bundy told probert to do it with some russian bugs theyd found in an earlier sweep of their moscow embassy and electronically tweaked them to their receiver frequency you found those we put in your savoy suite of course you never talked as i hoped you would for me to get in front not behind you i guessed youd found them and wanted to play against us charlie i never understood the different design though how did the bugs get into stouts apartment irena i told you probert could come and go in your embassy whenever he liked more accurately he could come and go in the residential compound your embassy under sotleys ambassadorship and stouts nonexistent security was a joke we needed to cover ourselves against there being a sweep that found the other bugs probert planted in stouts apartment on his way from a sex session with the venables girl it was easy for probert to get into stouts apartment which shed pointed out to him and which stout of course never bothered to lock it was bundy who persuaded venables to finger stout to your spy catchers after we had lvov suggest it to him charlie paulajane beat the polygraph irena bundy laughed about her to lvov that she genuinely didnt believe she was doing anything wrong so i suppose she didnt have any guilt taking the polygraph which is a flawed test anyway charlie who killed pavel irena we did he was a bad choice and i was wrong in not supervising the militia enough which was how svetlana modin came to be arrested later and why we had to stage lvovs big scene pavel was too ready to listen to whatever you suggested like that ridiculous press conference of yours even too willing to go along with you instead of his own force and use public telephones our own monitoring at petrovka fouled up and we were frightened hed taken some calls we didnt know about it was easier just to get him out of the way and for guzov to take over although he wasnt much better i had to suggest that your phony blood samples be tested for dna charlie and you decided to take me over irena twenty years of planning was all going wrong i had to get back in complete control and i was with a double bluff that would have worked if i hadnt had to let you take that fucking shrine to avoid your becoming suspicious charlie tell me about the car crash on the embankment irena i was getting desperate because i wasnt able to take you over i thought your people would withdraw you if you didnt actually get killed put in someone else less awkward the venables woman hopefully charlie but i stayed and you were running out of options irena the only one left was for me to get personally involved charlie with your only weakness the shrine which i brought here because i knew wed never get oskins body here and wanted to leave you with something irena my last hope was that you might have packed it in your case i arranged for it to be searched if it had been there the whole operation would still have worked the shrine would have been seized and i the grieving woman couldnt have lived here in britain without my memories could i charlie but it wasnt in the case irena i still had one last failsafe you wouldnt have gotten ivans precious body back even if youd tried id made sure of that all i had to do was get that fucking shrine back destroy it to stop your discovering it was a fake and maintain the grievingwoman shit and demand to go back to moscow to mourn charlie and from the lubyanka through lvov youd have led washington and london along whatever paths you wanted them to follow youd have ruled the world irena not the entire world but america and england would have been enough charlie youll get everything we agreed but id imagine youll have to properly work for both washington and london a lot more now irena i think id like the plastic surgery to fix the scarring charlie how were you burned irena it was stepan with me in the restaurant that night we were celebrating hooking washington and looking forward to how it would all work out we stayed lovers all the time right up to last week marina is a front to satisfy the american need for celebrity all part of the game plan for a game that isnt ever going to be played the recording clicked off charlie broke the following silence id like to go back to london now im sure no one has any objection you can come with me offered the directorgeneral aubrey smith appeared far more subdued than hed been when charlie left him the previous night after a celebration dinner at the directorgenerals pall mall club that had included two bottles of vintage margaux and four doublemeasure snifters of fiftyyear oldbrandy charlie knew the other man had been at thames house by nine while hed had an additional four hours to recover its been a very busy morning said the directorgeneral everything resolved i dont imagine the americans would describe it as that but at least they havent suffered the public humiliation the good people of des moines will still sleep soundly in their beds believing they are protected by the best intelligence service in the world what about our good people of barnsley ive never believed the people of barnsley have the countrys intelligence services in the forefront of their mind and jeffrey smale hes resigned with immediate effect his last official duty was to order paulajane venabless recall from moscow we wont bother with any official secrets act nonsense with her it wouldnt suit any practical purpose just the wrong person in the wrong job should never have been employed in the first place with her fathers background and with a serving cia officer as a godfather to boot she was a smale protegee by the way as were fish and robertson theyll both be leaving the service of course ive never been involved in such an operation before but it all seems to have concluded successfully charlie suggested no it hasnt denied smith you wont have heard yet of course its not yet reached any of the wire services what svetlana modins car was shot up from three other vehicles on her way in from sheremetyevo airport this morning she a cameraman and their driver all died instantly stepan lvovs limousine blew up when its ignition was turned outside his hotel in odessa about the same time his wife campaign manager and secretary were in the car with him i gave svetlana back the embarrassing film of her exposing herself to thank her said charlie reflectively you realize the implications i think i do every resource is available to you safe house wherever you choose everything paid for of course and plastic surgery that will be very necessary after so much exposure ive never fancied a protection program i think id go mad trying to be someone else and whatever precautions there were id still be recognizable from the way i walk with these awkward bloody feet of mine the other man didnt smile you need to think about it think hard you certainly need to go directly to a safe house from here totally abandon your apartment well have anything you particularly want brought to you for a few days agreed charlie for the rest of your life insisted the directorgeneral charlie didnt expect natalia to be at her moscow apartment but she was her voice lifting the moment she recognized charlies voice ive already taken leave and told sasha shes very excited already colored you another picture im going to buy the tickets whenever you tell me no said charlie you cant come not now whats happened youll realize why when you hear the news how long before we can come charlie couldnt immediately reply charlie never charlie finally managed
