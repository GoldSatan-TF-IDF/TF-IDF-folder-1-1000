mercedes lackey last herald mage magics promise dedicated to elizabeth betsy wollheim who said go for it one the blue leather saddlebags and a canvas pack all abulging with filthy clothing and miscellaneous gear landed in the corner of vanyels room with three dull thuds the lute still in its padded leather case slithered over the back of one of the two overstuffed chairs and landed with a softer pumph to rest in the cradle of the worn red seat cushion once safely there it sagged leaning over sideways like a fat drunken child the dark leather lute case glowed dully in the midmorning sun still coming in the single eastwardfacing window two years of mistreatment had not marred the finish too much although the case was scuffed here and there and had been torn and remended with tiny careful stitches along the belly vanyel grimaced at the alltoovisible tear torn no no tear would be that even say cut or slashed and it would be nearer the truth pray nobody else notices that better the lute case than me that came closer than i really want to think about i hope savil never gets a good look at it shed know what that meant and shed have a cat heraldmage vanyel took the other chair gracelessly dropping all his weight at once into the embrace of comfortable upholstered arms home at last havens i sound like the pack hitting the corner oooh vanyel leaned back feeling every muscle in his body crying out with longignored aches and strains his thoughts fumbled their way into his conscious mind through a fog of utter exhaustion he wanted more than anything to close his gritty eyes but he didnt dare because the moment he did hed fall asleep someday im going to remember im not sixteen anymore and keep in mind that i cant stay up till all hours then rise with the dawn and not pay for it a few moments ago his companion yfandes had fallen asleep standing up in the stable while he was grooming her theyd started out on this last leg of their journey long before dawn this morning and had pushed their limits eating up the last dregs of their strength just to get to the sanctuary of home the sooner gods if only i would never have to see the karsite border again no chance of that lord and lady if you love me just give me enough time to get my wind back thats all i ask time enough to feel like a human again and not a killing machine the room smelled strongly of soap and the beeswax used to polish the furniture and wall paneling he stretched listening to his joints crack then blinked at his surroundings peculiar why doesnt this feel like home he pondered for a moment for it seemed to him that his modest goldenoakpaneled quarters had the anonymous overlyneat look of a room without a current occupant i suppose thats only logical he thought reluctantly they havent been occupied much ive been living out of my packs for the last year and before that i was only here for a couple of weeks at a time at most gods it was a comfortable warmand quite averageroom like any one of a dozen hed tenanted lately when hed had the luxury of a guest room in some keep or other sparsely furnished with two chairs a table a desk and stool and a wardrobe a curtained canopied bed in the corner that bed was enormoushis one real indulgence he tended to toss restlessly whenand ifhe slept he smiled wryly thinking how more than one person had assumed hed wanted that particular bed for another reason entirely theyd never believe it if i told them savil gets more erotic exercise than i do oh well maybe its a good thing i dont have a lover hed wake up black and blue always assuming i didnt strangle him by accident during a nightmare but other than that bed the room was rather plain only one window and that one without much of a view it certainly wasnt the suite he could have commanded but what good is a suite when i hardly see haven much less my own room he put his feet up on the low scarred table between the chairs in defiance of etiquette he could have requisitioned a footstool but somehow i never think of it until im five leagues down the road headed out theres never enough time forfor anything not since elspeth died anyway and godsplease let me be wrong about randale his eyes blurred he shook his head to clear them only then did he see the pile of letters lying beside his feet and groaned at the alltoofamiliar seal on the uppermost one the seal of withen lord of forst reach and vanyels father twentyeight years old and he still makes me feel fifteen and in disgrace why me he asked the gods who did not choose to answer he sighed again and eyed the letter sourly it was dauntingly thick hellfire itand every other problemcan damned well wait until after ive had a bath a bath and something to eat that doesnt have mold on it and something to drink besides boiled mud now did i leave anything behind the last time i was here that was fit to wear he struggled to his feet and rummaged in the wardrobe beside his bed finally emerging with a shirt and breeches of an old and faded blue that had once been deep sapphire thank the gods not whites and i wont be wearing whites when i get home its going to be so nice to wear something that doesnt stain when you look at it unfair nagged his conscienceproperly treated the uniform of heraldic whites was so resistant to dirt and stains that the nonheralds suspected magic he ignored the insistent little mental voice although i dont know what im going to do for uniforms dear father would hardly have known his son covered in mud stubbled ashes in his hair he emptied the canvas pack on the floor and rang for a page to come and take the mishandled uniforms away to be properly dealt with they were in exceedingly sad shape stained with grass and mud and bloodsome of it his ownsome were cut and torn and most were nearly wornout hed have taken one look and figured id been possessed not that the karsites didnt try that too at least nearpossession doesnt leave stains not on uniforms anyway what am i going to do for uniforms oh wellworry about that after my bath the bathing room was at the other end of the long woodpaneled stonefloored hallway at midmorning there was no one in the hall much less competing for the tubs and hot water vanyel made the long trudge in a halfdaze thinking only how good the hot water would feel the last bath hed hadexcept for the quick one at the inn last nighthad been in a cold stream a very cold stream and with sand not soap once there he shed his clothing and left it in a heap on the floor filled the largest of the three wooden tubs from the copper boiler and slid into the hot water with a sigh and woke up with his arms draped over the edges and going numb his head sagging down on his chest and the water lukewarm and growing colder a hand gently touched his shoulder he knew without looking that it had to be a fellow heraldif it hadnt been if it had even been someone as innocuous as a strange page vanyels tightlystrung nerves and battlesharpened reflexes would have done the unforgivable hed have sent the intruder through the wall before he himself had even crawled out of the depths of sleep probably by nonmagical means butmagical or nonmagical he suddenly realized that he could easily hurt someone if he wasnt careful he shivered a little im hair triggered and thats not good unless you plan on turning into a fishman herald tantras said craning his head around the partition screening the tub from the rest of the bathing room and into vanyels view with cautious care youd better get out of that tub im surprised you didnt drown yourself so am i vanyel blinked tried to clear his head of cobwebs and peered over his shoulder where did you pop out of heard you got back a couple of candlemarks ago and i figured youd head here first tantras chuckled i know you and your baths but i must admit i didnt expect to find you turning yourself into a raisin the darkhaired dusky herald came around the side of the wooden partition with an armload of towels vanyel watched him with a halfsmile of nottoopurely artistic appreciation tantras was as graceful and as handsome as a king stag in his prime not shayachern but a good friend and that was all too rare and getting rarer vanyel thought soberly though havens i havent exactly had my fill of romantic companionship either lately well celibacy isnt going to kill me not by any stretch of the imagination gods i should apply for the priesthood there was concern in the older heralds deep soft eyes you dont look good van i figured youd be tiredbut from the way you passed out hereit must have been worse out there than i thought it was bad vanyel said shortly reluctant to discuss the past year even for the most powerful heraldmage in the circle holding down the positions of five other heraldmages while they recovered from magical attack drainage and shock was not a mission he wanted to think about for a long while much less repeat he soaped his hair then ducked his head under the water to rinse it so i heard when i saw you playing dead in the tub i sent a page up to your room with food and wine and sent another one off for some of my spare uniforms since were about the same size name the price its yours vanyel said gratefully levering himself out of the tub with a groan and accepting the towel tantras held out to him i have nothing worth wearing right now in the way of uniforms lord and lady the other herald swore looking at him with shock what have you been doing to yourself vanyel paused in his vigorous toweling looked down and was a little surprised himself at the evidence of damage hed always been leanbut now he was whipcord and bone and nothing else then there were the scars knife and sword scars a scoring of parallel claw marks on his chest where that demon had tried to remove his heart burn marks toohe was striped from neck to knee with three thin white lines where magelightning had gotten through his shields and there were a few other scars that were souvenirs of his bout with a master of magefire my job living on the edge trying to convince the karsites that i was five heraldmages playing target he shrugged dismissively thats all nothing any of you wouldnt have done if you could have gods van tantras replied with a hint of guilt you make me feel like a shirker i hope to hell it was worth what you went through vanyel compressed his lips into a tight line i got the bastard that got mardic and donni and you can spread that as official tantras closed his eyes for a moment and bowed his head it was worth it he said faintly vanyel nodded worth every scar i may have accomplished something else that particular necromancer had a flock of pet demons and i turned them back on karse when i killed him he smiled or rather stretched his mouth a little i hope it taught the karsites a lesson i hope they end up proscribing magic altogether on their side of the border if you can believe anything out of karse theres rumor that theyre doing just that tantras looked up again hard on the gifted he ventured vanyel didnt answer he was finding it very hard to feel sorry for anyone on the karsite side of the border at the moment it was uncharitable unheraldic but until certain wounds healedand not the physical oneshe was inclined to be uncharitable theres more silver in your hair too tantras observed head to one side vanyel made a face just as glad of the change in subject nodemagic every time i tap into it more of my roots go white moondance ktreva was pure silver by the time he was my age i guess im more resistant he smiled it was faint but a real smile this time one nice thing all those white hairs give me respect i might not otherwise get he finished drying himself and wrapped the towel around his waist tantras grimaced againprobably noting the knife wound on his backand handed him another towel for his hair you already paid that forfeit by the way he said plainly trying to lighten the conversation vanyel stopped toweling off his hair and raised an eyebrow you stood duty for me last sovvan vanyel clamped down on the sudden ache of loss and shrugged again you know you get depressed when youre tired fool dont let it sink you oh that any time tran you know i dont like sovvannight celebrations i cant handle the memorial services and i dont like to be alone either standing relay duty was as good as anything else to keep my mind off things he was grateful when tantras didnt press the subject think you can make it to your room all right the other asked i said you dont look good i mean it falling asleep in the tub like thatit makes me wonder if youre going to pass out in the hall vanyel produced something more like a dry cough than a laugh its nothing about a weeks worth of sleep wont cure he replied and im sorry i wont be able to stand relay for you this year but i have the obligatory familial visit to discharge i havent been home in gods four years and even then i didnt stay for more than a day or two theyre going to want me to make the long stay ive been promising theres a letter from my father waiting for me thats probably reminding me of just that fact parents surely know how to load on the guilt dont they well if youre out of reach randale wont find something for you to dobut is that going to be rest tantras looked halfamused and halfworried i mean van that family of yours they wont come after me when im sleepingwhich i fully intend to do a lot of he pulled on his old clean clothing reveling in the feel of clean soft cloth against his skin and started to gather up his things and the way i feel right now id just as soon play hermit in my rooms when i get there leave that stuff tantras interrupted ill deal with it you go wrap yourself around a decent meal you dont look like youve had one in months i havent they dont believe in worldly pleasures down there great proponents of mortification of the flesh for the good of the spirit vanyel looked up in time to catch tantras raised eyebrow he made a tragic face i know what youre thinking that too especially that gods do you have any idea what it was like being surrounded by all those devastatingly handsome young men and not daring to so much as flirt with one were the young ladies just as devastatingly attractive tantras asked grinning i would say sogiven that the subjects fairly abstract for me then i think i can imagine it remind me to avoid the karsite border at all costs vanyel found himself grinning backanother real smile and from the heart tran godsim glad to see you do you know how long its been since ive been able to talk freely to someone to joke for ladys sake since i was around people who dont wince away when im minus a few clothes are you on about that again tantras asked incredulously do you really think that people are nervous around you because youre shaych im what van asked startled by the unfamiliar term shaych short for that hawkbrother word you and savil use dont know where it came from just seems like one day everybody was using it tantras leaned back against the whitetiled wall of the bathing room folding his arms across his chest in a deceptively lazy pose maybe because youre as prominent as you are cant go around calling the most powerful heraldmage in the circle a pervert after all he grinned he might turn you into a frog vanyel shook his head again gods i have been out of touch to miss that little bit of slang yes of course because im shayachern why else would people look at me sideways because you scare the hell out of them tantras replied his smile fading because you are as powerful as you are because youre so quiet and so solitary and they never know what youre thinking havens these days half the heralds dont even know youre shaych its the magegift that makes them look at you sideways not that anybody around here cares about your bedmates a quarter as much as you seem to think theyre a lot more worried thatoha bird will crap on you and youll level the palace me vanyel stared at him in disbelief you youve spent most of the last four or five years in combat zones we know your reflexes are hypersensitive hellfire thats why i came in here to wake you up instead of sending a page we know what you can do van nobody ive ever heard of was able to take the place of five heraldmages by himself and the very idea of one person having that much power at his beck and call scares most people witless vanyel was caught without a reply he stared at tantras with the towel hanging limply from his hands im telling you the plain truth van i wish youd stop wincing away from people with no cause its not your sexual preferences that scare them its you level the palace hellthey know you could level haven if you wanted to vanyel came out of his trance of astonishment what do they think i am he scoffed picking up his filthy shirt they dont know they havent the magegift and most of them werent trained around heraldmages they hear stories and they think of the mage warsand they remember that once before there was a valdemar there was a thriving land to the far south of us now the dhorisha plains are therea very large circular crater no cities no sign there ever was anything not even two stones left standing nothing but grass and nomads van leave that stuff ill pick up after you but vanyel began to object look if you can spend most of a year substituting for five of us then one of us can pick up after you once in a while tantras took the wet towels away from him cutting off his objections before he could make them honestly van if you insist he wanted to touch tantras mind to see if he really meant what he said it seemed a fantastical notion but tran had not invited and a herald did not intrude uninvited into anothers mind not unless there was an overriding need to do so is that how you feel he asked in a whisper im not afraid of you but let me tell you i wouldnt have your powers for any reward im glad im just a herald and not a heraldmage and i dont know how you survive it so just let me spoil you a little all right vanyel managed a weak smile troubled by several thingsincluding that just a herald business that implied a division between heralds and heraldmages that made him very uneasy all right old friend spoil me im just tired enough to let you the fog of weariness came between him and and the corridor and he was finding it all he could do to put one foot in front of the other lady bless you for tantras there arent many even among the heralds i trained with that will accept what i am as easily as he does whether its that im a mage or that im feyalthough i cant see why magepowers would frighten someone weve had heraldmages since there was a valdemar i wish he was as right about that as he thinks he is i still think its the other thing the stone was so cool and soothing to his feet it eased the ache in them that was the legacy of too many hoursdaysweekswhen he had slept fully clothed ready to defend the border in the blackest bleakest hours of the night that reminder brought bleaker thoughts every time he came back to haven it was with the knowledge that there would be fewer familiar faces to greet him so many friends gonenot that i ever had many to begin with lancir mardic and donni regen dorilyn wulgra kat pretor all gone not many left besides tran theres jays savil andy and hes a healer erdane breda a couple of the other bards how can i be anything but solitary every year im more alone true to tantras promise vanyel found an overflowing plate waiting for him beside the pile of letters it held a pair of meat pies soft white cheese and apples and beside the generous plate of food was an equally generous pitcher of wine id better be careful with that stuff im not used to it anymore and i bet itll go straight to my head he stifled a groan as he sagged down into the empty chair poured a goblet of wine then picked up the topmost letter he broke the seal on it gritted his teeth and started in to heraldmage vanyel from lord withen ashkevron of forst reach my dear son vanyel nearly dropped the letter in surprise and reread the salutation to be certain that his eyes hadnt played tricks on him great good gods my dear son i havent been dear much less son foryears i wonder what happened he took a long breath and continued though you might find it difficult to believe i am pleased and grateful that you are going to be able to find the time for an extended visit home despite our differences and some hard words between us i am very proud of my heraldmage son i may not care for some aspects of your life but i respect your intelligence and good sense i confess vanyel that your old father has need of some of that good sense i need your help in dealing with your brother mekeal vanyel nodded to himself with cynicism now we come to it he has made some excessively poor judgments since i turned over the management of some of the lands to him but this spring he has outdone himself hes taken the cattlegood solid incomeproducing stockoff long meadow and installed sheep down there instead vanyel chuckled whoever withen had roped into being his scribe on this letter had reproduced his fathers tones perfectly he could feel the indignation rising from the page and as for that socalled shinain warsteed he boughtand a more illtempered illfavored beast i never sawthe less said the better all these years i spent in building up the forst reach lineand hell undo it all with one unmanageable stud i feel sure hell listen to you youre a heraldthe king himself trusts your judgment the boy has me ready to throw him down the blamed well vanyel shifted a little and reached for a wedge of cheese this letter was proving to be a lot more enlightening than hed had any reason to expect this is no time for meke to be mucking about not when there may be trouble across the border maybe you remember that alliance marriage between deveran remoerdis of lineas and ylyna mavelan of baires the one that brought a halt to the lineanbaires war and that brought that minstrel through here that you were so taken with as a boy it doesnt seem to be working out thereve been rumors for years that the oldest child was a bastardnow deveran seems to have given substance to those rumors hes disinherited the boy in favor of the next in line in some ways i cant blame him too much even if the lad didnt look so much like his uncleive seen both the boy and the man and the resemblance is uncannythe rumors alone would have been enough to make his inheritance shaky i wouldnt trust that entire mavelan family frankly a pack of wizardly snakes the lot of them the only time they stop striking at each other is when they take on an outsider i only thank the gods that theyve stayed at each others throats all this time but thereve been some nasty noises out of them about tashirs disinheritance and if it gets to be more than noises we may have trouble across the border your brother is all fired up for a war by the way gods that is the last thing we need i just thank the lady that randale had the good sense to send a plain herald into lineas as envoy and not a heraldmage a good solid herald might be able to keep this from growing into another feud like the one the marriage was supposed to stop in the first place the lineans will certainly be far more inclined to listen to a plain herald they dont trust anything that smacks of wizardry and given what the mavelans did to them who can blame them vanyel bit his lip the halfeaten scrap of cheese dangling forgotten from his fingers withen was showing a great deal more political astuteness than hed ever given his father credit for but this business in lineas please he sent up a silent prayer not now its evidently worrisome enough that randale sent your sister lissa and her guard company to keep a crossborder eye on the mavelans youd know what that would mean better than your old father i think if were lucky and things stay calm perhaps she can slip off for a few days visit herself i know youd both like that by the way i hope you arent planning on bringing any of your friendshome with you are you you know it would upset your mother you wouldnt want to upset your mother by the hand of radevel ashkevron and my seal lord withen ashkevron vanyel grimaced dropped the letter back down on the table and reached for the wine to take the bitter taste of those last words out of his mouth he held the cool metal of the goblet to his forehead for a moment an automatic reaction to a pain more emotional than physical he doesnt mean to hurt chosen yfandes mindvoice touched the bitterness but could not soothe it awake again dearling you should sleep too much noise she objected equitation lessons and im too tired to find a quiet corner of the field ill just stand here by the stable and let the sun bake my sore muscles and wait for the babies to go away your father truly does not mean to hurt you vanyel sighed and picked up a meat pie nibbling the flaky crust listlessly i know that it doesnt stop it from hurting if i werent so tired it probably wouldn t hurt as much if i werent so tired it might even be funny he swallowed another gulp of wine painfully aware that even the simple act of chewing was becoming an effort he put the pie down you have nothing left she stated no reserves at all thats ridiculous love its just that last push we made and if i havent anything left then neither have you not true i may be spent physically but you are spent emotionally magically mentally chosen beloved you have not spared yourself since elspeth peacemaker died thats because nobody had a choice he reminded her reaching for a piece of cheese but holding it up and staring at it not eating it seeing other times and places everybody else has been pushed just as hard the moment poor randale took the throne that fragile peace she had made for us fell to pieces we had no warning it was going to come to that mardic and donni the cold hand of grief choked his throat the lifebonded couple who had been such steadfast friends and supporters to him had been two of the first victims of the karsite attacks he could feel the echo of his grief in the mourning of yfandes mindvoice poor children goddess hold them fandes at least they died together i could wish he cut off the thought before he could distress her he contemplated the white wedge of cheese in his hand as if he had never seen anything like it and then blinked and began nibbling at it trying to force the food around the knot of sorrow blocking his throat he had to eat hed been surviving on handfuls of parched corn dried fruit and dried beef for too long he had to get his strength back it wouldnt be long before randale would need him again well all he really needed was a couple of weeks of steady meals and sleep you ask too much of yourself who me strange thoughts from a companion who was it who used to keep nagging me about duty he tried to put a measure of humorous teasing into his own mindvoice but it felt flat but you cannot be twenty places at once chosen you are no longer thinking clearly the cheese had finally migrated inside him and most of the lump in his throat was gone he sighed and reached for the meat pie again with enough wine to help he might be able to get that down too the trouble was fandes was right for the past few months hed been reduced to a level where he really wasnt thinking much at alljust concentrating on each step as it came and trying to survive it it had been like climbing a mountain at the end of a long and grueling race just worrying about one handhold at a time not thinking about the possibility of falling and not able to think about what hed do when he got to the top if he got to the top if there was a top stupid herald looking at the bark and never noticing the tree was about to fall on you the sun coming in his window had crept down off the chair and onto the floor making a bright square on the brown braided rug he chewed and swallowed methodically not really tasting what he was eating and stared at the glowing square his mind going blank and numb randale uses you beyond your strength because of the nodes yfandes said accusingly breaking into his near trance you should say something hed stop if he realized what he was doing to you if you were like other heralds unable to tap them if i were like other heralds the karsites would be halfway to haven now instead of only holding the disputed lands he replied mildly dearest there is no choice i lost my chance at choices a long time ago besides im not as badly off as you think all i need is a bit of rest and ill be fine were damned lucky i can use the nodes and that i dont need to rest to recharge except that you must use your power to focus and control he shook his head beloved i appreciate what youre telling me but this isnt getting us anywhere i have to do what im doing im a herald its what any of the others would do in my place its what lendel griefhe fought it clenching his hand hard on the arm of his chair as he willed his emotions into control control yourself herald this is just because youre tired its maudlin and it doesnt do you or anyone else any good i could wish you were less alone dont encourage me in selfpity love its funny isnt it he replied his lips twitching involuntarily though not with amusement dear father seems to think ive been seducing every susceptible young man from here to the border and ive been damned near celibate the last waswhen the weeks the months they all seemed to blur together into one long endurance trial a brief moment of companionship then a parting inevitable given his duties and jonnes three years ago yfandes supplied immediately that rather sweet guardsman vanyel remembered the person though not the time hello youre the heraldmage arent you vanyel looked up from the map he was studying and smiled he couldnt help itthe diffident shy smile the guardsman wore begged to be answered yesare you guardsman jonne your guide i was born not half a league from here the guileless expression the tanned face and thatch of hair the tiny net of humor lines about the thoughtful hazel eyes all conspired to make vanyel like this man immediately then you friend jonne are the direct answer to my prayers he said only later when they were alone did he learn what other prayers the guardsman had an answer for jonne odd for such a tough fighter to be so diffident even gentle though why he should have been shy when he was five years older and had twice my uh experience your reputation beloved a living legend came down off his pedestal and looked to him for company yfandes sent him an image of a marble saint statue hopping out of its niche and wriggling its eyebrows in a come hither look there was enough of a tired giggle in her mindvoice to get an equally tired chuckle out of him but he sobered again almost immediately and that lasted how long two months three certainly not more you were busy you had dutiesboth of you it was your duties that parted you i was he replied bitterly a fool more than duties would have parted us in time i know exactly what im trying to dowhen i admit it to myself im trying to replace lendel i cant i cant ever so why do i even bother to try a love like that happens once in a lifetime and im not doing myself or my would be partners any favor by trying to recreate it i know it and once the first glow wears off they know it and it isnt fair to them silence from yfandes there really wasnt much she could say he was left to contemplate the inside of his own thoughts as faint sounds of distant people and a bit of birdsong drifted in his window damn it im feeling sorry for myself again heralds are all lonely it isnt just me were different made different by our gifts made even more so by the companions then driven even farther away from ordinary people by this fanatic devotion to duty of ours heraldmages are one step lonelier than that he couldnt help himself the next thought came automatically despite his resolution not to fall into a morass of self pity then theres me between the level of my gift and my sexual preferences he buried his face in his free hand gods i am a fool i have fandes she loves me in a way no one else ever will or ever did except lendel that ought to be enough it really oughtif i wasnt so damned selfish she interrupted his thoughts van you almost need a friend more than a lover a different kind of friend than me one that can touch you you need to be touched you humans her mindvoice trailed off grew dim in the way that meant she was losing her battle to fatigue and had fallen asleep again you humans that phrase said it all that was the telling difference he realized suddenly the telling lack yfandes was not humanand she never felt exactly the way a human would there was always the touch of the other about her and the strange feeling he got some times that she was hiding something some secret that she could only share with another companion it was not a comfortable feeling he was just as glad she wasnt awake to pick it up from him he dragged himself up out of the depths of his chair to rummage paper and a pen and inkpot out of his desk he slouched back down into the cushions and chewed thoughtfully on the end of the pen trying to compose something that wouldnt set withen off to lord withen ashkevron of forst reach from heraldmage vanyel ashkevron so far so good dear father im sorry ive had to put off spending any length of time at home but duty must always come before anything else and my duty as a herald is to the orders of my king he licked his lips wondering if that was a bit excessively priggish probably not and i dont think ill say anything about how visits of less than a day keep mother from having vapors at me he reached for the goblet again and another swallow of wine before continuing as for meke ill do my best with him father you must remember though that although i am a herald i am also his brother he may be no more inclined to listen to me than he does to you with regard to your news about baires and lineas may the gods help us i have seen far too much of conflict of late i was praying for some peace and now you tell me we may have a situation on our very doorstep unless randale asks me to intervene there isnt much i can do let us hope it doesnt come to that i promise i will try to put some sense into mekes head about that as well perhaps when he has heard some of what i have seen a war will no longer seem quite so attractive perhaps when he sees some of what war has done to me no father i was not badly hurt but i picked up an injury or two that left scars it may be that will impress him he closed his eyes and carefully picked out the least loaded words he could think of for the next sentence when he thought he had it he concentrated on setting it carefully down on the paper so that there could be no mistake with regard to my friends i promised you ten years ago that i would never indulge in anything that you did not approve of or that made you uncomfortable under your roof do you still find it so difficult to believe that i would keep my word he nobly refrained from adding odd no one else seems to have that problem that would not serve any purpose and would only make his father guilty and then angry i do have a request to make of you and a reminder of a promise you made to me at the same time you pledged to keep mother from flinging young women at me under other conditions i would not feel that i needed to remind you of this promise but i truly cannot handle that particular situation this time father im exhausted you cant know how exhausted all i really want is some peace some quiet time to rest and catch up with the family matters please do me this one small favor i dont think its too much to ask yours vanyel he folded the letter and sealed it quickly before he had a chance to add a postscript to that temptingly empty space at the bottom all i want from you and mother is to be left alone i need that rest before i fall on my face he picked up the second letter and heaved a sigh of relief liss oh bless you big sister my antidote to father to heraldmage vanyel ashkevron from guard captain lissa ashkevron dearest van if half of what ive been hearing about you is true im tempted to abandon my command and kidnap you and hide you someplace until youve had some rest thank the gods somebody saw enough reason to give you a leave and before you bleat to me about duty just you remember that if you kill yourself with overwork you wont be around to do that duty vanyel smiled biting his lip to keep from chuckling good old liss i should tell you whats going on out here since you may be riding right into another hotbed of trouble deveran of lineas has disinherited his eldest the boy supposedly has magepower which since his mother does not is being read that he is probably a bastard the uneans in any case are not likely to allow anyone with magegifts to rule over thembut this tashir is altogether too like his uncle vedricfor comfort and vedric is protesting the tacit slur on his good name not that he has one and is being backed by the entire mavelan clan i suppose it is a bit much to imply that your brotherinlaw was fornicating with his own sister before your marriage to her havens bless talk about soiled goods at any rate i suspect theres far more to it than that what i dont know but the mavelans seldom unite for anything and theyre uniting on this one i much doubt its over concern for vedrics reputation or tender feelings for tashir my guess is theres another attempt at acquiring lineas in the offing but since theyre both clientsbyalliance to valdemar the mavelans cant just begin flinging magefire over there randale would definitely take exception to that so here we are camped on the border and watching for one false note what really worries me is that its vedric whos fronting this theyre all snakes but hes a viper the only reason hes not lord mavelan is because his brothers been very lucky or smart enough to buy some really good spies and bodyguards vedric is definitely the most ambitious of the lot my guess is hes been promised lineas if he can get it quietly through tashir perhaps vanyel found his eyebrows rising with every sentence lissa had come a long way from the naive swordswoman who had accepted that commission in the guard she was a lot more politically astute than van would have dreamedwhich gave him the second surprise of the day first father then liss no bad thing either no one living in the days of king randale could aiford to be politically naive i hope to steal away long enough to spend at least a little time with you love but dont count on it theres nothing going on overtly but the whole thing feels very touchy to me like the moments before the storm hits if i feel the situation has calmed down enough ill come be well love liss that was by far and away the easiest letter to answer hed had in a long time he scrawled a quick reply of affection including the fact that he missed her badly sealed the note and laid it with the other there were two or three other letters all nothing more than invitations to various entertainments hunting parties mostly at noble estates parties meant to last a week or more despite the fact that he never attended these things wouldnt have even if hed had the time the invitations never stopped coming he wrote brief polite notes and sat back again staring at the packs in the corner he knew he had to sort things out of his traveling kit for his trip home and he just couldnt muster the energy it was so much easier just to sit and let all the kinks in his muscles respond to the soft motionless chair a rap at the door interrupted his lethargy it was the page sent by tantras with the promised uniforms and one more thing a note and vanyel recognized randales handwriting on the outside oh gods no no for a moment he tensed fearing another call to duty on the eve of his promised chance to rest then he saw that it wasnt sealed not even by randales personal seal he relaxed no seal meant it wasnt official he took it from the wide eyed page and motioned to the youngster to stay for a reply vanyel come by after court and say goodbye dont come before then if im not being official i dont have to find something for you to do or rather i dont have to assign you to one of the hundred messes that needs dealing with im sorry you arent staying but i understand and if you werent planning on leaving id probably tie you to yfandes and drive you off before i work you to death but do come by jisa wants to see her uncle van before he vanishes again randale if you dont make the time to see her ill bite you when you try to saddle me vanyel had to smother a laugh woke up again did you why is it anything about jisa snags your attention like nothing else does because shes adorable as most sixyearold humans are not besides shes your daughter im just grateful she doesnt look anything like me he replied sobering if shed gotten these silver eyes of mine for instance or black hair when both randale and shavri are light brown dont you dare let that slip to anyone not even another companion she reassured him im not sure i understand what the problem could be though shavri wont let randale marry her so should it matter who jisas father is it would disturb some folk because theyre lifebonded besides we dont want anyone to know that randales sterile if he has to make an alliance marriage that could ruin it and there are damn few people even inside the heralds who would understand someone wanting a child badly enough to go to bed with someone other than her lifebonded yfandes mindvoice was hesitant truth chosen in seems to bother you vanyel leaned farther back into the chair scrawling replies to the invitations with half his attention it did bother him and in a way that made him reluctant to even think about shavri sometimes its not that he temporized lts just that im worried about them but the uneasy feeling continued an uncomfortable unhappiness that he couldnt define so he continued hastily poor shavri you cant know how much she wanted that child that was the only reason we did it you like her of course i like her he answeredagain just a shade too quickly she and randaletheyre friends how could i have told them no he shied away from examining his feelings too closely besides it was never anything more than a physical exercise for either of us no more involved for me certainly than dancing shavri being a healer she could make sure she caught the first time neither of us were emotionally involved or ever likely to be i suppose that could have been a problem she replied exactly thats why shavri and randale asked me to help in the first place i was perfect a herald already a friend physically able and not going to get romantically entangled dont you want the child sometimes yfandes sounded wistful vanyel was a bit surprised frankly no im not very paternal it takes more than seed to make a father love great good gods can you see me as a parent id be awful randale has what i lack in that department his thoughts darkened as he recalled what had been bothering him since he scanned the palace when they rode in fandes im worried about them when lancir died truth i almost expected taver to choose me kings own insteadinstead he chose shavri and im desperately afraid it wasnt because she was randales lifebonded im afraid it was because shes a healer there was a long silence on yfandes part then why havent you said something before this because i wasnt sure ive been wrong about things so many times and i didnt really want to think about it shavri told me once that she was afraid that randales sterility was a symptom of something worse i didnt know what to say so i told her not to worry about it but now you know how sensitive i am follow my line to rondale vanyel could feel every herald and heraldmage in haven all tied to him by a kind of tenuous network of lines of lifeenergy with every identity as plain to him as if he could see the faces most heraldmages could follow the line to anyone who had shared magic with them vanyel could follow the line of anyone who had shared magic just by virtue of being a herald he had the line that led to randale without even thinking about it and felt yfandes follow it down with him seeing what he saw theressomething not right she said after a moments study something out of balance physically not mentally or emotionally but i cant tell what it is exactly he agreed i felt it as soon as we came in he wasnt like that when we left i wish i was a healeradept like moondance ktreva or even little brightstar theyre much better at understanding imbalances than i am he rubbed his forehead his headache starting again i dont think i will ever forget the look on shavris face when you told her this wasnt the first time youd done someone the favor of uh stud service yfandes mindvoice colored yellow with laughter and he was just as pleased to change the subject moondance and starwind wanted a child to raise and neither of them can function with a female he reminded her and snowlight was willing to have twins one for her one for them you certainly produce lovely children brightstar is a good lad he said shyly theyre rightly proud of him and thats their doing not mine but im beginning to think i ought to rent myself out do you think i could command the same fees as a shinain stud oh at least she giggled as he reached for pen and paper double if your gift and beautiful silver eyes breed true he smothered a chuckle and turned all his attention to the reply the page was waiting for dearest friends of course im coming by dont you realize that youre my last taste of sanity before i spend the fall with my lunatic family he sealed this last note and handed them all to the page to take away he stood and hauled the packs over to his bed resisting the temptation to throw himself there instead of his belongings and began sorting out the items hed need for his visit home there was an awful lot of money in there money he didnt remember getting but it all seemed to be in those silly little sealed stipend bags most of them still unopened at least a halfdozen then again he hadnt had much to spend it on going from post to post like a madman never getting regular meals seldom sleeping in a real bed he combined all the bags into one and tossed the empties onto the table for the servants to collect then had second thoughts and added some coins to the pile of empty bags no harm in leaving a little something for the ones who kept things picked up for him they did a good job they could have just sealed the room up until he returned but they kept it open and aired even though that meant extra work hed acquired a much greater appreciation for good servants since hed become a herald he returned to his packs there were a lot of small valuable trinkets he just barely remembered being gifted with in there why do people insist on giving me all this stuff he asked yfandes a little irritably it isnt bribery id have sensed that and given it back i told you she replied they wanted something of the excitement of your life to rub off on them so they give you things thats what it means to be herald vanyel second only to kings own he made a sound of contempt as he sorted through the things jewelry mostly i bet they think i have everything i could want i suppose on a lot of levels i do im ungrateful i guess i dont know why im not happier vanyel ashkevron you are being an idiot she replied acidly stop feeling guilty about feeling like youre overworked and unhappy youre only human beloved i think you know me better than i know myself he laughed to keep from wincing she was cutting a bit too close to the truth his hand fell on more jewelry and he changed the subject ah now these i remember i bought them honestly he selected the three trinkets that he had thought would please randale shavri and jisa when hed seen them a cloak clasp for randale in the form of a vine of healall twining around a beryl the green of a healers robesa pendant that matched for shavri and a wonderful little articulated carving of a companion complete with formal panoply for jisa the rest went back into the pack he would need presents for the mob at forst reach and there was surely enough there to make a start he paused with the last piece a crystal magefocus stone rosequartz sadly and not a stone he cared to work with still in his hand think savil would like this you know she would rosequartz is her prime focus and you dont often see a crystal that big or that clear good he put it with the little gifts on his bedside table the bed looked better than ever courtesy calls yfandes reminded him then you cant take a nap lazy he groaned too true oh well he picked up the crystal and slipped it into his pocket savil first shell put me in a good mood for the others there was a touch of smile in yfandes mindvoice when he slipped out his door and down the hallstill barefoot you dont really need to be put in a good mood for jisa do you he grinned although she couldnt see it she would feel the rise in his spirits nobut if randi ends up giving me an assignment anyway i wont feel so bad about it two vanyels room was in the old palace the original building dating back to king valdemar in the oldest section still used for heralds quarters savils suite was in the new wing added some fourteen years ago she no longer occupied the suite hed had when he first was put in her custody by lord withen she didnt teach more than one pupil at a time these days so having no use whatsoever or a suite with four bedrooms shed moved instead to another suite still on the ground floor though without an outside door to the gardens moving had been something of a relief to both of them her former quarters held too many sad memories memories of the painful weeks following tylendels suicide vanyel had helped with that move since it had coincided with their return him in full whites from the pelagir hills and the vale of the tayledras ktreva the touchiest part had been moving the magic work room a transfer of energies rather than physical furniture savil had left that to him since theyd shared magic so intimately and so often he knew her resonances and more importantly her protections recognized him the magical transfer had been a kind of graduation exercise for himnot to prove to savil that he could do it but to prove his ability and his trainingto the rest of the heraldmages he could still remember jaysen kondres face when hed stood in the middle of the new work room and called the shields and protections and theyd swarmed up and followed him like bees with a migrating queen settling into place as solidly as if theyd been cast on the new room from the beginning jays had looked as if hed just swallowed a live fish savils suite now was of four rooms only her protages bedroom and her bedroom sitting room and work room van yfandes said sleepily into his mind ask jays to get you a work room this time you need a work room i thought you were asleep how many times do i have to tell you that i dont need one before youll believe me he replied but even after all these years yfandes still wasnt used to the idea that vanyels methods werent quite the same as the other heraldmages i can use savils if im working formal magic when im in the field i dont have time to muck about with formalities but he shook his head glad that the only other people about were used to heralds and the way they seemed to mutter at themselves when hed been in the field hed frequently gotten knowing looks and averted eyes go back to sleep fandes she gave up you ought to know by now that you cans outstubborn me sweetling savil was still his master when it came to magic that required long painstaking setups vanyels talents lay elsewhere he had neither master nor even peer when a crisis called for instant decision and instant action it was that ability to use his powers on a moments notice that made him second rank to no one in power and second only to shavri in the heraldic circle that and the ability to use the lines and currents of power and the nodes where they met as the ancients had done and the tayledras could still do though none of the other heraldmages except savil could he squinted against the light as he entered the new wing the paneling of the new section had not had time to darken with age the halls here seemed very bright though they no longer smelled new this section feels even emptier than the old quarters i dont think more than half the groundfloor rooms have claimants theres less than that on the second floor and none at all on the third i cant see how weii ever fill it the hall was so quiet he could hear the murmur of voices from one of the farther suites without straining his ears at all a quick look gave him identities savil and jays he paused for a moment and sent the tentative little mind probe on ahead of him that was the thought sensing equivalent of a knock on the door and got a wave of welcome from both minds before he had taken two steps now sure of his reception and that he wasnt interrupting anything he crossed the remaining distance to savils door and pushed it open savil her silver hair braided like a coronet on the top of her head was enthroned in her favorite chair a huge blue monstrosity as comfortable as it was ugly tall jaysen who always looked bleached somehow was halfsprawled on her couch but he rose at vanyels entrance then did a double take and staggered back a step hand theatrically clutched to his chest my heart he choked savil look at your nephew barefoot shaggy headed and shabby where in havens has our peacock gone he got lost somewhere south of horn vanyel replied i last saw him in a tavern singing trios with my mind and my wits i havent seen either of them in a while either well you surely couldnt tell it from the reports we got back jaysen answered coming quickly forward and clasping his forearms with no sign of the uneasiness hed once had around the younger herald theres three new songs about you out of your year down south in case you didnt know very accurate too amazingly enough vanyel sighed gods bards jaysen cocked his graying head to the side you should be used to it by now you keep doing things that make wonderful songs so how can they resist he grinned maybe you should stop become a bricklayer for instance vanyel shook his head and groaned its not my fault jaysen laughed id best be off before that trio wrecks my workroom did savil tell you ive been given the proteges youd have gotten if you hadnt been in a combat zone count your blessings ones a farmgirl who had much rather be a fighter than a heraldmage thank you ones a very bewildered young man who cant for a moment imagine why he was chosen and as a result has no confidence whatsoever and the third is an overly confident sharpster whos actually a convicted lawbreaker convicted of what vanyel asked amused at the woebegone expression on jaysens face chicanery and fraud the old shellandpea game at midsummer fair he was actually chosen on the way to his sentencing if you can believe it i can believe it its keeping you busy anyway it is that its good to see you van jaysen hesitated a moment and then put one hand on his shoulder vanyel he locked his pale nearcolorless blue eyes with vanyels and van saw disturbance there that made him uneasy take care of yourself would you we need you i dont think you realize how much he slipped out the door before vanyel could respond van stared after him with his mouth starting to fall open what in the name of sanity was that about he asked perplexed turning back to his aunt who had not left the comfortable confines of her chair she looked up at him measuringly have you any notion how many heraldmages weve lost in the last four years she asked her high cheekboned face without any readable expression two dozen he hazarded now she looked uneasy not much but enough that he could tell slightly more than half the total we had when you and i came back from ktreva we cant replace them fast enough the magegift was never that common in the first place and with a rate of attrition like that she grimaced i havent told you about this before because there was nothing you could do about it but after the deaths of the last year you should know the facts you become more important with each loss van you were the only one available to send to replace those five casualties on the karsite border you were the only one who could replace all five of them all by yourself thats why we couldnt relieve you lad or even send you one other heraldmage to give you a breather we simply didnt have anyone to send speaking of which she raised one eyebrow as she gave him such a penetrating look that vanyel felt as if she was seeing past his clothes to count his ribs and mark each of his scars you look like hell cant anyone greet me without saying that he complained you tran jays cant you tell me im looking seasoned or poetic or something horseturds you dont look seasoned you look like hell youre too damned thin your eyes are sunken and if my othersenses arent fooling me youve got no reserves youre on your last dregs of energy vanyel sighed and folded himself up at her feet resting his back against the front of her chair and his head against her knee that was home and always would be as savil was more his mother than his birthmother ever could be its nothing he replied at least nothing a little sleep wont cure come on you know how you feel at the end of a tour of duty youre still your old tactful self savil tact never was one of my strong traits lad she replied and he felt her hand touch and then begin stroking his hair he closed his eyes and relaxed muscles began to unknot that must have been tensed up for the past year for the first time in months there was no one depending on him looking to him for safety it was nice to feel sheltered and protected instead of being the shelter and protection there are times when id give anything to be a child again and this is perilous close to one of them i am mortally tired savil he admitted finally i need this leave it wont take long to rest up but i do need the rest you know i didnt ask for this i didnt want to be a heraldmage i wanted to be a bard i sure as havens didnt ask to be vanyel dragonsbreath or whatever it is theyre calling me demonsbane the increasingly shrill tone of his own voice finally penetrated his fog savil i am i whining she chuckled throatily youre whining son hellfire he said i swear every time i lose a little sleep i turn fifteen a bratty fifteen at that im amazed you put up with me darling boy she said her hand somehow stroking his headache away youve earned a little whine youre thinned out in more ways than one she sighed thats the one thing i regret most about the past few years you never do or say anything anymore without thinking about it thats good for heraldmage vanyel but im not entirely certain about vanyel ashkevron there was a long silence behind him then theres no joy in you anymore kechara no joy at all and that bothers me more than the circled eyes and thin cheeks weve all endured too much the last five years to be able to afford to do things without thinking as for joy is there joy anywhere anymore weve all lost so much so many friends gone another long silence i dont know he cleared his throat and changed the subject i didnt feel a third here you arent teaching cant dont have the stamina anymore not and be guardian too hed half expected that and he half expected what quarter so they made you guardian in whose place lancirs shavri cant she tried and she cant the four guardians have to be heraldmages wed hoped healinggift was close enough but she didnt pass the last trial i think shes relieved its a pity the guardian of the east has always been kings own but in that case the present i brought you may be handy he shifted so that he could get at his pocket and pulled out the crystal he closed his hand around it feeling all the smooth planes and angles pressing into his palm dont you need a prime focus stone of your own to set in the web i thought you didnt have a good prime to use for anything but personal stuff you do and i put a stone there but it was a secondary focus an amethyst and not what id have he raised the hand holding the crystal above his head parting his fingers so she could see it but not opening his eyes or moving his head sunsingers glory she breathed where did you find that gifted me he said as the weight left his hand people keep giving me things savil an opal or amber i could have used still you can use it so do i shall her hand began to stroke his hair again and he heard the little click as she set the stone down on the table beside her that will make my job a bit easier she chuckled richly i thought i was so lucky when it turned out my resonances worked best with rosequartznot like deedre who was stuck with topaz or justen with ruby nice cheap stone i thought wont have to go bankrupt trying to get a good one little did i know how hard it was to find a good unflawed large crystal little did you know you were going to turn out a guardian he replied drowsily hmm true her mind touched softly on his vanyel kechara you are not well theres more silver in this lovely black hair he couldnt lie mindtomind not to her so he temporized the silvers from working with the nodes you should know that as for the rest im just weary teacher love just weary too many hours fighting too many battles and all of it too much alone heart wounded her mindvoice was etched and frosted with concern no heart whole just lonely only that you know i havent time these days to go courting a friend not on battle lines and i wont ask for more than friendship gods how could i ask anyone to make an emotional commitment to somebody whos out trying daily to get himself killed im better off alone the hand on his hair trembled a little and rested i know she replied finally there are times when i wish with all my heart i could take some of that from you now now dont encourage me in my selfpity honestly you and fandes if wishes were fishes wed walk on the sea teacher love he said aloud id rather you could keep father and mother off when im home so youre finally making that major visit theyve been plaguing you for she took the unspoken cue and switched to less intimate vocal speech randale sent me word just as i was leaving the border several weeks leave of absence at least and i must say that while im looking forward to the rest im not at all sanguine about this little sojourn in the bosom of my loving family out of experience im forced to tell you even if they behave themselves youre all too likely to find yourself the court of appeal for every family feud thats been brewing for the last ten years she said and laughed and no one will like your judgments and everyone will accuse you of favoritism he opened his eyes and moved his head around propping his chin against the seat cushion and mother will haul every eligible female for leagues about in on visits and father will go crosseyed trying to see if i m attempting to seduce any of the young men on the estate and dear father leren will thunder sermons about fornication and perversity every holy day and glare jervis will snipe at me try to get me angry and glare and mothers maid melenna will chase me all over the property and on and on he made mournful eyes at her if i hadnt promised id be greatly tempted to take my chances with randale finding another emergency and stay here i thought lissa was stationed right near forst reach she always used to be able to protect you savil gave him a half smile she was a very good little protector when you were a child i dont think shes going to feel she can leave her assigned post he said it seems that border is heating up just what we need another situation exactly you could have dealt with this earlier i suppose he snorted not likely that whole monstrous mess of tangled emotions and misconception is why i never have spent more than a day at home if i can help it if it isnt mother flinging women at me its father watching me out of the corner of his eye he throttled down savagely on the wave of bitterness that crawled up his throat but some of it emerged despite his good intentions gods savil i am so damned tired of the whole dance i really need to take a couple of weeks to rest and where else can i go you know i darent stay here if i do randale will recruit me he wont want to he wont mean to but something will come up and hell have toand i wont be able to say no if i went to lissassuming she has someplace to put me shed end up doing the same thing im a tool and neither of them dares let a tool stand idle even when it might break easy lad savil cautioned her face clouded and troubled he grimaced did it again sorry i wont break im not sure i can break the fact is i still look all right and i really dont want randi to guess how drained out i am if he knows hell feel guilty and theres nothing he can do he has to do what he does to me so vanyel shrugged the strain doesnt show it wont take long to put right im as much to blame for the overload as randi i could say no but i never have the heart to maybe you should choose somewhere to go besides forst reach or only stay there for a day or two then go off visiting friends or by yourself i dont want to go off somewhere alone ill just brood and i havent anyone to go to ktreva is too far away you at least have had andy for longer than ive known you he sighed im sorry im whining again i cant seem to help it which might be a symptom of how on edge i am that is the only thing that really worries me im hair triggered and dangerous and i need some peace to get balanced again all i can hope is that mother and father decide that i look as bad as you and jays think and leave me alone for a bit long enough to get some reserves back anyway it was the closest hed come to admitting that he wasnt really certain how much or how little reserves he still had and he quelled the rest of what he almost said you dont look good even they should see that kechara she toyed with a bit of his hair and worried at her lower lip with her teeth you know i havent been back in ye gods not since i checked you all for magegift my familial visitation is more than overdue but youre a guardian hope rose in him if only savil would be there hed have one kindred soul in the lions den he had no doubt she was more than up to the trip he could feel her strength even as he leaned on it wont take me but a day to set my focus in the web and then i can guard from forst reach as easily as from here its only a matter of sensing threat and sending the alert you know its not as if i actually had to fight anything and its only because i need to keep that little corner of my mind tuned to the web waking and sleeping that i dont have a protege ten years ago i could have done what jays is doing guard and teach three she nodded this is no bad notion provided you dont mind having me there mind he seized her hand and kissed it then expect me in about oh two weeks after you arrive itll take kellan a little longer to make the trip than you youngsters savil if you only knew how grateful i am pish im selfish is what i am a smile started to twitch at the corners of her mouth we can guard each others backs this way im counting on you to save me from withen as much as you are counting on me to save you he rose and kissed her forehead i dont care what you say its the most generous unselfish thing anyones done for me in a year and you just may save this visit from becoming the legend of how herald vanyel went berserk and left his entire family tied to trees with rags stuffed in their mouths about what time is it im all turned round about from being so far south she checked the angle of the sun coming in her window id guess just after court good i have to catch randale and shavri and say goodbye he promised if i didnt come when he was being official he wouldnt find something for me to do then off with you kechara and ill see you at forst reachand thank you for thinking of me she finished touching the stone on the table beside her because you think of me love he kissed her cheek then her forehead again and left her suite he stopped first at his room to change back into a set of trans whites and put on the soft low boots heralds wore indoors not as comfortable as going barefoot but they beat the riding boots hands down and if he didnt change he might not be let into the kings quarters every time he came back it seemed fewer folk knew his face that accomplished and now every inch his usual neat self he headed down to the oldest part of the palace the extensive set of rooms shared by king randale his lifebonded and kings own shavri and their daughter he had scarcely crossed the threshold of the sparsely furnished audience chamberhis unfamiliar face giving a moments apprehension to the two guards posted at the doorwhen a sixyearold curlyheaded miniature whirlwind burst through the farther door and flung herself across the audience chamber at him evidently blithely certain he would catch her before she fell which he did and swung her around up and over his head while she squealed with excitement and delight uncle van she crowed at the top of her lungs unclevanunclevanunclevan he started to put her down but she demanded a hug and a kiss with the same infectious charm her father randale could display whenever he chose vanyel hoisted her into a comfortable carrying position and complied without an argument thinking as he did so that it was a good thing that she was still so tiny now how did you know i was coming he asked her as her bright brown eyes looked solemnly down into his felt you she said giving him another hug felt you in my head all blue glowy and swirly he nearly dropped her in shock that was surely the most vividand accuratedescription of his aura hed ever heard out of anyone but another high ranking heraldmage or a healer said shavri coming up beside him as he gaped at the child and jisa giggled at the face he was making healers see you that way too van and no i wasnt eavesdropping on your thoughtsthey were plain enough from that poleaxed look on your face there was strain and fear under shavris light tone as if she walked a narrow bridge above a bottomless chasm besides you arent the only one shes felt in her head during the last three months lets start this greeting over hello van have you a hug for me always he was already bracing himself for trouble with that look on her face there was something seriously wrong and that meant hed have to be the strong one he included shavri in his arms while jisa flung her arms around both their necks and cuddled jisa sweet can i put you down long enough for presents presents jisa was no different from any other sixyearold when that word came up she squirmed a little and he set her down then extracted the little companionfigure from his pouch and handed it to her she shrieked with delight and ran outside to show it to the two guards shavri watched her go her gypsydark eyes darker with unconcealed love and something else something secret and profoundly unhappy his first reaction was to want to hold her protect her make that unhappiness go away randis lifebonded thats quite a little impling youre raising shavri he said instead incredibly unspoiled given that id lay odds shes the pet of the circle you say that every time you see her beast she replied flashing an uncertain smile startlingly bright in her sober dark face well its true vanyel looked quickly around ascertained that they were going to be alone for a few moments and asked quickly how is he the smile vanished and the fear and unhappiness were plain for anyone who knew her to read oh godsvan hes sick i cant make it go away and i think hes dying and i dont know why what he gathered his scant resources to support herand to hide the fact that her fear was making him tremble inside hes well enough she said lightly but mindspoke him with a vastly different tone theres something wrong it isnt affecting him much at the moment other than steady weakness and a dizzy spell now and again but it keeps getting worse with each spell and oh van im so afraid he tightened his arm around her shoulders easy flowerlet then it sounds like theres no problem with my taking this leave how long has this been going on her unshed tears knotted both their throats eight months its something i cant heal the gods know ive tried he felt chill creep over him forgive me shavri but i have to ask this given worst case if it is something lifethreatening and it keeps getting worse how long do you think he has if he keeps weakening at the same rate fifteen yearsmaybe less certainly not more gods van he wont even see fifty he wont even see his grandchildren elspeth was seventysix when she was called there was another thought unspokenbut vanyel felt it since it touched so nearly on his own private loneliness iii have to go on alone he held her close to his chest with her face pressed into his shoulder as she struggled not to cry and clamped down a tight shield to prevent any stray thought from reaching her and frightening her savil supported you you support shavri the same way he told himself below the threshold of her ability to mindhear let her know she wont be alone gods gods theyre both so young not even twentyfive and so sheltered all their lives oh shavri your pain hurts me easy love he murmured into her hair does he know no not yet healers collegium does theyre working on it we dont want him to know until its certain now you know why i wont marry him van i couldnt im not strong enough i cant rule not alone and when he dies and i wont have jisa forced onto the throne too young either her mindvoice strengthened with stubbornness so long as were unwedded it cant be forced on me nor on jisa until all the collateral lines are exhausted i he felt the surge of terror and grief and tried to project strength to her not allowing her to see how fragile that strength was at the moment with grim certainty he knew that she would not be able to cope if the worst came unless someone she trusted was there to help and the only one she trusted to that extent the only one randi trusted was him gods they really think i can do anything and im no more ready for this than she is he pushed the thought away concentrated on trying to ease some of that fear gently sweet dont borrow trouble dont assume anything you may cure him yet this may turn out to be something ridiculous and you both may get run over by a beerwagon tomorrow that startled a weak chuckle out of her and she blinked up at him through tears she was doing her best not to release worry about tomorrow when it comes enjoy now now whats all this with jisa feeling people in her head footsteps made both of them look up are you seducing my lady herald vanyel asked randale king of valdemar holding out his arms to embrace both of them id rather seduce you you charmer vanyel replied coyly batting his eyelashes at the king but there was an edge of bitterness there in his banter and despite his best intentions it must have crept into his voice he saw a hint of startlement then of worry creep into both their expressions lighten up dammit he told himself angrily theyve got their own problems they dont need yours he grinned and winked and both of them relaxed again randale laughed heartily and hugged him hard taking shavri away from vanyel as he did so and vanyel felt a strange twinge another flash of uneasiness gods whats wrong with me he didnt stop to think about it the hug wasnt as hard as it had been a year ago and there was a transparency about randale that made vanyels heart lurch randale had grown a neat brown beard was it to hide the fact that his cheeks were a little hollower was that tidytoafault brown hair a little lackluster there were shadows under his dark eyes were they there from lack of sleep or some more sinister reason within a few breaths vanyel had noted a dozen small signs of something wrong all of them little things things that someone who saw him day in dayout might not have noticed but vanyel had been away for a year and the things he saw shook him gods gods my king my friend shavri is right youre ill at the very least randale was not a heraldmage his gift was farsight and his mindspeech was not as sure a thing as vanyels and shavris for once vanyel was grateful for that lack he changed the subject before randale could note his unease it seems your little shadow is developing precocious gifts he said at least she said she felt me coming in her mind jisa ran back in and attached herself to vanyels leg didnt you imp he looked down at her surprised by the surge of love he felt for the child she nodded very well pleased with herself we thought about taking her to savil but shes been so busy randale replied shrugging i dont suppose youd test her would you thats a major spell for anyone else but you and savil now i see the reason for all the concern that i stop by vanyel teased not that youve missed me van shavri said indignantly i never randale chortled and she hit his shoulder you can just stop that you beast jisa giggled and vanyel looked down at her hold still for a minute impling he said im about to make your head feel funny like mama did when you had the measles all right jisa said calmly and vanyel had the sudden unsettling feeling that she would permit her totallytrusted uncle van to chop off her hand if he wanted to he rested his palm on the top of her brown curls and focused out and down and came out again blinking well well what shavri and randale demanded in the same breath she wont be a heraldmage not unless she gets blasted open the way i did which i do not recommend he added lightly trying to catch his breath even that little magic had been more of a strain than he had thought it would but shes carrying the potential in a double dose shell certainly pass it to her children she will be a mindhealer she is an active empath and her mindspeech center is opening early too with that combination randale shell very likely be kings own after shavri gods she is so like me right down to the magepotential jisa sweetling i swear i will do anything to keep you safe shavri trembled and randales arm tightened around her shoulder is she likely to be chosen anytime soon vanyel did not answer immediately fandes he called softly are you awake and following the conversation yes provided its needful for her to get the training and she stays as sweet as she is id say by age ten maybe sooner two years from now yfandes guesses that if she needs the training between age eight and ten remember for the presumptive kings own that wont be a bonded choosing she wont bond until until she gets the office then shell bond with taver vanyel ignored both shavris frightened face and randales elation so given that theres a little something she and i ought to do he focused himself down again pulling on yfandes strength to assist his own and thanking the gods he could do so because jisa should not remain as open as she was now this time he did not close his eyes but locked them with the childs and showed her without words for she did not yet have sufficient mindspeech to use words how to shield herself from unwanted thoughts and emotions and unshield again at will he was he feared the only person who could have taught her at this stage empathy not being a normal heraldic gift and most healers not using it in the way a heraldmage could he showed her how to find her center she knew with an instant of studying him how to ground the fundamentals it had taken him so long and so painfully to learn came to her with the ease of breathing perhaps because learning was as easy as breathing at her age and perhaps because his learning had come at the cost of so much loss and pain that had nothing to do with his gifts there that should hold her until shes got enough to be taught formally teach her yourself shavri you wont find anyone in the heralds with empathy as strong as hers when shes got it at full power shell be able to control a mob in full cry shavri had herself back under control again and the smile she gave vanyel was genuine thank you love he shrugged no thanks needed before i forget it i brought you two some pretties also shavri took the pendant with an exclamation of genuine delight as he handed the matching cloakbrooch to randale van you shouldnt have she began of course i should have he said who else have i got to bring things to it came out bleaker than he intended oh van her eyes softened and randale cleared his throat and blinked they reached out in the same moment and each took one of his hands he closed his eyes and for an instant allowed himself to feel a part of their closeness but it was their closeness not his and i have no right mama i have lessons said a small voice still at i vanyels knee bright havens so you do shavri exclaimed van go he said wrinkling his nose at her ill be back in a few weeks and maybe this tyrant of a king will let me stick around for a while this time she shooed jisa out and followed her with the light step of a young girl randales gaze followed both of them you sire wonderful children van he said softly you raise better ones vanyel replied uneasily you are jisas papa dont you ever forget it i was nothing more than the convenient means to a rather attractive little end the king relaxed visibly i keep thinking youre going to want her backespecially now that shes showing gifts shes more like you than you know vanyel laughed whatever would i do with her great i good gods what kind of a parent would i make i cant even train the palace cats to stay off my pillow no randi shes all yours in everything that counts i would rather be uncle van who gets to spoil her randale reached out without looking and snagged a chair with one hand he swung it around and put it in front of vanyel shed make a good queen shed make a very bad queen vanyel replied draping himself over it as randale took another the things that make a good monarchs own are weakness in the monarch like empathy shed be vulnerable to everyone with a petition and the passion to back it shed be tempted to use projective empathy on her council to make them vote her way mindhealer are drawn to the unbalanced but a monarch cant waste time dealing with every herald in trauma she encounters vanyel shook his head no absolutely not jisa is going to be a lovely young woman and a good monarchs own be satisfied with that randale gave him a wry look you sound very sure of yourself shouldnt i be vanyel folded his arms over the back of the chair and rested his chin on them forgive me if i sound arrogant but other than savil i am the expert in these things ask my aunt when im not around and ill bet money shell tell you the same thing randale shrugged and scratched the back of his head i guess youre right i was hoping youd back me though why vanyel interrupted so you can have something else to pressure shavri into marrying you randale winced at his bluntness and protested weakly but thats i meandammit van i need her gods so young so uncertain of himself of her so afraid that without bonds he wont hold her you think she doesnt need you randi shes your lifebonded do you really need any further hold on her than that shed rather die than lose you randale studied the back of his hand its just i want something a little more ordinary vanyel finished wryly randi heralds are never ordinary if you wanted ordinary you should have become a blacksmith randale shook his head vanyel gritted his teeth and prepared to say to randale what no one else could or would now you listen to me youre making her miserable with the pressure youve been putting on her shes doing exactly what she should shes putting valdemar and valdemars king ahead of her own wishes mostly she knows the situation we have just as well as you do but shes willing to face it things went to pieces when your grandmother elspeth died and theyve been getting worse sincesteadily im not blind van randale interrupted i quiet randi im making a speech and i dont often i want you to think theres a very real probability that youll have to buy us peace on one of our borders with an alliance marriage exactly how your grandmother bought us peace with iftel and why do you think she never married bard kyran after your grandfather died hmm she knew her duty and so should you you have to stay free for that randale was flushing vanyel didnt need empathy to know he was getting angry so what business is it of yours he burst out i thought you were a friend i am but im a herald first and my first duty is to valdemar not to you vanyel sat straight up and let his face grow very cold knowing what he was doing and hating himself for it randi wanted his friend and at some levels needed his friend he was going to get heraldmage vanyel ashkevron you heraldking randale cannot permit your personal feelings to interfere with the wellbeing of this kingdom you are as much herald as i if you cannot reconcile yourself to that give up the crown randale slumped defeated no one knew better than he that there was no heir or even heirpresumptive yet the crown was his like it or not i i wish i theres no one else van no one old enough then you cant resign your crown can you vanyel made it a statement rather than a question no damn vanyou know i never wanted this memory balmy spring breezes played over the lawn randi laughing at something some joke he had just made shavri playing with the baby in a patch of sun bucolic pastoral scene shattered by the arrival on a lathered horse of a queens messenger in black randi jumped to his feet his face going white the man handed randale a sealed package wrapped in silk but randi didnt open it herald randale your grandmother the queen sends me to tell you that your father the package fell from randales fingers the blue silk wrappings unwound from the contents the silver coronet of the heir an accident a stupid accident a misstep on a slippery staircase in full view of everyoneand the heir heraldmage darvi was dead of a broken neck and randale was heir vanyels heart ached for him and he dared not show it pity would be wrong at this moment but he softened his voice and his expression i told you jisa would make a bad queen i meant every word shavri knows all this too you can bet on it and im telling you youre tearing her in pieces putting her between love for you and what she knows is her duty randale looked at him as if he wanted to interrupt no hear me out youve sympathized often enough with me and my matchmaking mother how in havens do you think shavri feels with you putting that same kind of pressure on her not good randale admitted after a long moment then stop it before you put her under more pressure than she can take leave her alone let it lie for another ten years if things havent come to a conclusion one way or another then bring it up all right no randale said slowly its not all right but youre absolutely correct about there being no choice not for any of us vanyel rose and swung the chair hed been slouched over out of the way randale did the same dont spoil what you have with what you only think you want randale he said softly taking his friend and kings arm this is experience talking the one thing about the brief time i shared with my love that i have never regretted is that i never consciously did anything to make him unhappy had our time been longer maybe i would have i cant ever know but at least i have no memories of quarrels or hard words to shadow the good memories randale took his hand youre right im wrong ill stop plaguing her good man rand i oh randi close randale was coming too close it was beginning to hurt then randales servant entered behind him the kings formal uniform draped over one arm the royal circlet in the other hand and a harried expression on his face vanyel forced a laugh and took the welcome opportunity to escape now unless i haul myself out of here im going to make your man there very unhappy what randale turned startled oh oh hellfire i have got that damned formal audience before dinner dont i yes sire the servant replied as expressionless as a stone then id better get changed vanyel vanyel put his arm around the younger mans shoulders and gave him an affectionate embrace just go do your duty and make her happy thats what counts im off ill see you by midwinter certainly right van be well randale looked at him really looked at him for the first time he started to reach for vanyels arm with an expression of concern vanyel ducked his head to conceal the signs of weariness im never ill go go gobefore your man kills me with a look randale managed a grin and followed the servant back into the private rooms of the suite vanyel spent a moment with his eyes closed in unvoiced prayer for him then took himself back to his own room and his longed for reunion with his bed three morning vanyel woke slowly surrounded by unfamiliar warmth and softness and put bits of memory together as they drifted within reach he vaguely remembered getting to his room surrounded by fatigue that increasingly fogged everything recalled noting a brief message from tran and getting partially undressed he did not remember lying down at all he didnt even remember sitting on the bed by the amount of light leaking around the bedcurtains it was probably midmorning and what had wakened him was hunger his soft bedclean sheets a real featherbed and those wonderful dark curtains to block out the lightfelt so good good enough to ignore the demands of his stomach and give preference to the demands of his weary body hed had a fair amount of practice in shutting off inconvenient things like hunger and thirst thered been plenty of times lately when hed had no other choice he almost did just exactly that almost went back to sleep but his conscience told him that if he didnt get up hed probably sleep for another day and he couldnt afford that clothing clothing good gods what am i going to do about clothing there was no way his uniforms would be cleaned and mended and he was going to need to take a few with him even if he didnt plan to wear them and he had to have uniforms to travel in anyway technically a herald traveling was on duty wait a moment wasnt there something in that note from tran about uniforms he pushed off the blankets with a pang of regret pulled the bed curtains aside winced away from the daylight flooding his room and sat on the edge of the bed waiting for leftovers from half recollected dreams to clear out of his brain his shoulders hurt have to do something about that muscle strain before i start favoring that arm remember to put liniment on it and do some of those exercises birds chirped news at each other right outside his win dow it had been a very long time since hed paid any attention to birdcalls except as signals of the presence or absence of danger the musical chatter was quite wonderful precisely because it was so sanely ordinary ordinary peaceful gods i am so tempted just to fall back onto the mattress and to hell with starting for forst reach today but a promise was a promise and if he delayed going one day it would be easy to rationalize another delay and another all of which would only lead to randales recruiting him which was what the trip was supposed to prevent he pulled himself up out of bed with the aid of the bedpost and reached for one of tantras uniforms clean lord and lady clean and smelling of nothing worse than soap and fresh air once he managed to get himself started habit took over he reached with one hand for one of yesterdays leftover apples in their bowl on the table and tantras note with the other go ahead and take my stuff with you i dont need these theyre spares that were made before i put on all that muscle across the shoulders a bit tight on me they should be just a little big on you tell me what you want done and get out of here i dont mind taking care of some of your paperwork for you ill see that your new uniforms are ready by the time you get back supply told me theres no chance of salvaging your old ones tran more than a little big vanyel thought wryly standing up and surveying himself in the rather expensive glass mirror a present from savil on the back of the door hed had to tie the breeches with an improvised drawstring just so theyd stay up and the tunic bagged untidily over his belt he looked except for the silver in his hair rather like an adolescent given clothing to grow into theyd have been all right a year ago but oh well nobodys going to see me except the family i certainly dont have anyone to impress but trans volunteering gave him a notion about some other things he needed he rummaged out the pen and paper hed used yesterday by now he reckoned those notes were well on the way to the border and forst reach another reason to hail out of here if i dont arrive soon after the letter theyii worry his letters should beat him to the holding by a few days at least he wrote swiftly but neatly neat as a clerk tran was wont to tease order me new cloaks would you and new boots i need them badly id be ashamed to stand duty the way they are now and since youre being so kind as to keep track of this ask supply to work me up a set of spare uniforms to leave here and have them keep a set here at all times next time there might not be anyone my size with extras for me to borrow thanks van he packed quickly without having to think about what he was doing now that hed finally gotten his momentum after the last four years he could pack fatigue drunk pain fogged drugged to his eyebrows or asleepand he had at one time or another he swung his cloak it was more gray than white and a little shabby but there was nothing to be done about that over his shoulder picked up his packs plucked his lute off the chair and headed out in the dark and echoing hall on his way to companions field and the stable he intercepted a page gave the child the note for tantras and asked for some kind of breakfast to be brought to him while he saddled yfandes she was already waiting calmly for him at the entrance to the tackshed theyve cleaned all my tack she told him but the saddle needs mending and the rest isnt what it should be i wouldnt trust the chestband to take any strain at all frankly swordcuts and bums arent fixed with saddlesoap he reminded her well just have to wait a moment what about your formal gear thats next thing to brand new gods know weve used it what once twice her ears went up her sapphire eyes fixed on him and he had that curious and disorienting doubled image of her that hed gotten sometimes in the past the image of a dark wise eyed woman weary but smiling with newly kindled anticipation flickering in and out with the graceful white horse gods if i needed a sign of how draggedout i am thats it hallucinating again dreaming awake got to be because i never really think of her as a horse even when im riding her he blinked his eyes and forced himself to focus properly as she replied as excited as a girl being told she could wear her holiday best chosen could we use it please he chuckled you like being dressed up and belled like a gypsy dont you she tossed her head and arched her neck dont you i ve heard you preening at yourself in the mirror of a morning especially when there was someone to impress you fight dirty he said aloud and went in search of her formal tack grinning one of the kitchen wenches a brighteyed little brunette barely adolescent brought him hot bread and butter cider and more apples about the time he managed to find where yfandes formal panoply had been stored the saddle was considerably lighter than the field saddle and fancier it was tooled and worked with silver and dyed a deep blue the chest and rump bands had silver bells on them as did the reins of what was essentially an elaborate hackamore the reins were there more for his benefit than his companions and more for show than either there was light barding that went along with the outfit but after regarding it wistfully for a moment yfandes agreed that the barding would be far more trouble than it was worth and vanyel bundled it away he paused a moment and bit into the bread it was dripping with melted butter and he closed his eyes at the unexpected pleasure the flavor gave him oh gods fresh bread the taste was better than the manna that the priests said gods ate bread for the past year had meant rockhard journeybread at best moldy crusts at worst and anything in between and it was never fresh much less hot from the oven there had been butter sometimes rancid in summer as rockhard as the journeybread in winter its the little things we miss the most i swear it is ordinary things things that spell peace and prosperity he thought briefly of the swordcomrades hed left on the border and sent up a brief prayer brightest gods grant both but especially peace soon before more blood is shed after that he alternated between bites of food and adjusting of harness the kitchen wench lingered to watch him saddle yfandes draped over the open half door of the stable squinting into the sunlight there was something between heroworship and starryeyed romance in her gaze finally vanyel couldnt stand it any longer and gently shooed her back to her duties he noted out of the corner of his eye with more than a little alarmthat she was clutching the mug hed drunk from to her budding bosom as though it had been transformed into a holy chalice looks like youve got another one chosen yfandes commented sardonically as he fastened his packs behind her saddle thank you for that startling information thats just what i needed to hear its not my fault you have a face that breaks hearts but why oh never mind he gave the girth a last tug and swung up into the saddle lets get out of here before someone else decides shes fallen in love with me they got through the city as quickly as they could and out onto the open road where it was possible to breathe without choking on the thick cloud of dust and other odors of the crowded city it was a little strange to ride with the soft chime of the bells marking every pace yfandes took it made him nervous for the first few leagues until he managed to convince his gut that they were in friendly territory and in no danger of alerting enemy scouts with the sound after that the sound began to soothe him like muted rhythmic windchimes ive always adored windchimes and i never get to meditate to them anymore he slowly began to relax yfandes was in no great hurry although her traveling pace would have run a real horse into the ground after half a day this had been a gentle summer turning into a warm and even gentler fall just enough frost to ensure that the harvests ripened not enough yet to turn the leaves once out of haven exiles road wound lazily through rustling golden grain fields and fields of sweetly ripening hay the morning air was slightly cool but the sun was warm enough that vanyel soon rolled his cloak and bundled it behind his saddle it was very hard to stay awake in fact his muscles relaxed into the familiar configurations of riding memory flicker the ktreva vale savil schooling him on yfandes you think youre a rider now lad when im done with you youll be able to do anything ahorse that you can do on the ground himself slyly anything she threw a saddlebag at him from here to the border the land was the next thing to flat long rolling hills covered with cultivated fields interrupted by fragrant oak groves that occasionally amounted to small forests you really could sleep you know yfandes chided him im not going to let you fall off it wont be the first time youve taken a nap that way im hardly going to be company for you like that she shook her head and the bells on her halter laughed for her your presence is company enough chosen i ran lone for ten years before you bonded to me just having you with me whole and healthy is pleasure you neednt think i need entertaining when we arent working with a brief flash of pain and pleasure he remembered how he had never needed anything but tylendels presence either yes she agreed following the thought exactly so he hooked his leg around the saddle pommel crossed his arms and tucked the ends of his fingers into his belt then sagged into a comfortable slouch chin on chest it didnt take long he came awake all at once his hand reaching automatically for the sword he wasnt wearing there was an instant of panic before he remembered where he was going and why he was going there why did you stop he asked yfandes who had come to an unmoving haltwhich was what had waked himin the middle of the completely deserted road there was nothing but open meadow on either side of him dotted with sheep though there was no sign of the shepherd crows cawed overhead and the sheep bleated in their pastures otherwise silence prevailed the sun was low enough ahead of them to force him to squint it must be late afternoon early evening theres an inn just beyond the next curve sleepy one yfandes said a hint of amusement tingeing her thought its later than lunch and earlier than dinner but im tired and id really like to stop before i go any farther havens love you should have no i shouldnt have this is the first time youve really relaxed in i dont know how long have you thought about the way we resonate he saw instantly what she meant so you were relaxing with me in very deed and reveling in it first journey ive been able to enjoy in a while but i would like to stop now then so would i he unwrapped his leg from the pommel and stretched it she waited until his foot was back in the stirrup then resumed her easy amble not quite a walk not quite a canter is this a temporary halt or are we stopping for the night the night she asked wistfully there was a hint of something more there than she was sending youre not telling me everything he accused why this inn wellyou wont be the only herald there heraldcourier sofya is there chosen by he had a shrewd hunch where this was leading she curved her neck coquettishly and looked up and sideways at him out of one huge blue eye gavis he shook his head at her ah yesthe one that has been setting all the courierrecords lately why this penchant for overmuscled couriertypes all legs and no brains he is not overmuscled she replied indignantly breaking into a teethrattling trot to punish him but brainless he taunted feeling unusually mischievous he just doesnt speak up unless he has something to say unlike certain heraldmages i know she kicked once jarring every vertebra in his spine before settling all four feet braced in the dust of the road and plainly going nowhere he reached forward before she could stop him and tweaked her ear well since you want to arrange a little assignation dont you think youd better get the cooperation of your chosen i cant imagine why she replied we could move out of the center of the road and i could groom you so that you looked your usual lovely self when we rode into that inn yard instead of being all covered with road dust i could even braid your tail up with some of the blue and silver cord that was with the barding if i felt like it vanyeli she floundered and i do feel like it you ridiculously vain creature he said leaning down and putting both arms around her neck resting his cheek on her crest and to think that they call me a peacock has it been so long since i teased you that youve forgotten what it sounds like oh vanyel it has been a long time then well have to remedy that he dismounted still a bit stiff from his long doze and opened the pack with the currycomb in it something else occurred to him as he wormed his hand down inside the pack justdo me a very big favor sweetling hmm she turned her head and blinked back at him he fished out the comb and the cords please please remember to shield me out of your trysting all right you forgot to the last time here lets get out of the road he stifled a sigh as they moved under the shade of tree beside the roadway i dont grudge you any pleasure at all but its been a very long time since i did any number of things and teasing you is only one of them yfandes twitched the closest to blushing a companion could come vanyel allowed no hand to tend yfandes but his own no more than he would have permitted a stranger to see to the comfort of his sister the cloistered priestess fandes frequently protested this wasnt necessary but this afternoon she wasnt complaining especially not when young gavis pranced up to the fence of the inns open wagon field with a proud curve to his neck and a certain light of anticipation in his eye vanyel kept his amused thoughts to himself as yfandes flirted coyly with the handsome companion and wished her nothing more risque than a pleasant evening when he opened the gate into the meadow for her she gave him a long look over her shoulder vanyel you arent made of stone i wish you would find a comrade you would be much happier he winced away from the idea ive been over this with savil and you until i can stop trying to replace lendel im not going to cheat myself and my wouldbe partner i dont see that if youre friends it wouldnt be cheating never mind go and enjoy yourself oh i think i can manage that she said with deliberate innocence gave him a slow wink then frisked off with gavis in close attendance the tack he did entrust to the stableboy though the lads wide eyed awe in his presence left him feeling just a bit uneasy awe was not something he wanted aimed in his direction it felt too close to fear he stepped into the open door of the inns common room with his packs over one shoulder and stood blinking in the sawdust scented gloom waiting for his eyes to adjust the lean and nervous innkeeper was at his elbow in a breath long before vanyel could see anything other than shadows more shadows and a dim white form in one corner that was probably herald sofya it seemed as if he and the other herald were the only guests this early in the afternoon but this was harvestseason the locals were undoubtedly making the maximum use of every moment of daylight milord herald an honor a pleasure how may this humble inn serve you milord please vanyel flushed at his effusiveness just dinner a room if youve one to spare use of your bathhouse food for my companion i took the liberty of turning her loose with companion gavis now his eyes had adjusted enough that he could see what he was doing he fumbled in his beltpouch and pressed coins into the innkeepers hand here im on leave not on duty this should cover everything actually it was too much and he knew it but what else did he have to spend it on the man gaped at the money and began babbling about the room royalty slept there indeed they did king randale himself before his coronation vanyel bore with it as patiently as he could and when the man finally wound down thanked him in a diffident voice and entrusted everything but the lute to the hands of one of the servants to be carried away to the rented room now he could make out herald sofya in the corner a dark pretty woman quite young quite lean and not anyone he recognized she was paying studious courteous attention to her jack of ale vanyel drifted over to her table when the innkeeper finally fled to the kitchen vowing to bring forth a dinner instantly which from the description would have satisfied both the worst gourmand and the fussiest gourmet in the kingdom herald sofya he said quietly and she looked at him in startlement he surmised the cause and smiled in all probability her companion had been so taken up with yfandes that hed neglected to tell his chosen vanyels identity or else she wasnt much of a mindspeaker which meant gavis wouldnt be able to give her more than images she had probably assumed the same was true for him your gavis mindspoke my yfandes on the road and she told me both your names before we arrived might i join you certainly she replied after swallowing quickly he sat on the side of the table opposite her and saw the very faint frown as she took in the state of his whites i apologize for my appearance he smiled feeling a little shy i know it wont do much for the heraldic reputation but i only just got leave and i didnt want to wait for replacement uniforms i was afraid that if i did theyd find some reason to cancel my leave sofya laughed heartily showing a fine set of strong white teeth i know what you mean she replied it seems like all weve done is wear out saddle leather for the past three months therere four of us on this route and the farmers are beginning to count on us like a calendar one every three days out to the border and back to captain lissa ashkevron the same and let us hope the linean border doesnt heat up the way the karsite border did vanyel closed his eyes as a chill crawled up his backbone and shivered itself along all of his limbs gods spare us that he said finally when he opened his eyes again she was staring at him very oddly but he was saved from having to say anything by the appearance of the innkeeper with his dinner vanyel started in on the smokedpork pie with an appetite he didnt realize hed had until the savory aroma of the gravy hit him sofya leaned back against the wall and continued to nurse her drink giving him an odd and unreadable glance from time to time hed been too numb from the long grueling ride to appreciate his meal yesterday hed stowed it away without tasting it as if it had been the iron rations or makedo of the combat zone but this morning and now the home fare seemed finer than anything likely to be set before randale i hope you dont mind my staring sofya said at last as he literally cleaned the plate of the last drop of gravy but youre going after that pie as if you hadnt seen food in a week and youre rather starvedlooking and that seems very odd in a heraldunless youve been standing duty somewhere extraordinary he noticed then the blank spot in the back of his mind that meant fandes was keeping her promise and shielding him out he grinned a little to himself that probably meant that gavis was doing the same so sofyas curiosity about him must be eating her alive ive seen nearly no food for a week he replied quietly and paused for a moment when the serving girl took the plate away and replenished his mug of cider i dont know if youd call my duty extraordinary but it was harder than i expected ive been on the karsite border for the last year meals werent exactly regular and the food was pretty awful there were times i shared fandes oats because i couldnt even attempt eating what they gave me halfrotten meat and moldy bread arent precisely to my taste all too often there wasnt much to go around and to tell you the truth sometimes i just forgot to eat you know how it is things start happening and the next thing you know its two days later thats why he gestured at his too large uniform and grinned wryly the situation was harder on clothing than on stomachs her sable eyes widened and softened you were on the karsite duty i dont blame you for running off she replied with a hint of a chuckle i think i would too herald you never did give me your name vanyel he said vanyel ashkevron lissas brother i know we dont look at all alike but her reaction was not at all what he had expected her eyes widened even farther and she sat straight up heraldmage vanyel she exclaimed loud enough that the farmers and traders whod begun trickling in while vanyel was eating stopped talking and turned to look with their mouths dropping open youre vanyel her voice carried embarrassingly well and rose with every word vanyel demonsbane the shadow stalker the hero of please vanyel cut her off pleadingly please it yes im vanyel but honestly it wasnt like you think he groped for the words that would make the nearworship he saw on her face go back to ordinary friendliness it wasnt like that it really wasnt just things had to get done and i was the only one to do them so i did im not a hero or im just im just another herald he finished lamely he looked around the common room and to his dismay saw the same worship in the expressions of the farmfolk around him and something more fear an echo of that fear was in sofyas eyes as well before she looked down at her ale he closed his eyes settling his face into a calm and expressionless mask that belied the ache that their fear called up in him hed wanted acceptance only that tran tran you were right i was wrong be careful what you ask for you may get it gods i asked for signs that tran was right and now i have them dont i he opened his eyes again but the reverence and adulation hadnt vanished there was a palpably clear space around him where the common folk had moved a little away as if afraid to intrude too closely on him even sofya and the room had taken on the silence of a chapel im about to ruin their evening as well as mine unfair unfair there must be something i can do to salvage this situation at least for them you know he said with forced lightness if there was one thing i missed more than anything it was a chance for a little music he reached blindly down beside him for the lute hed left leaning against the wall stripped the case off it and tuned it with frantic speed and i hate to sing alone ill bet you all know the crafty maid dont you without waiting for an answer he launched into the song he sang alone on the first verse but gradually other voices joined his on the chorus sofya first with a kind of toohearty determination then a burly peddler then three stout farmers the local folk sang timidly to begin with but the song was an old and lively one and the chorus was infectious by his third song the whole room was echoing and they were no longer paying much more attention to him than they would have to a common minstrel except between songs and except for sofya who worshiped him with eyes that sent a lump of cold to live in the bottom of his throat she waited on him herself as if he was some kind of angel to be adored but not touched he slipped out of the room early when she was getting something another musician had joined the crowd a local and he used the lads talent as a screen to get out during a particularly rowdy song he thought hed gotten away without anyone noticing but the innkeeper intercepted him in the hallway milord vanyel the tallow candles lighting the hall smoked and flickered and made the shadows move like the shadows hed once hunted the memory knotted his stomach he concentrated on the innkeeper but the man gulped and would not meet his eyes a breath of cooked onions drifted up the hall from the common room milord if id known who it was i was serving id have made you special fare and id not have accepted your coin please vanyel interrupted trying to conceal his hurt the innkeeper jumped back a pace please he said softly this time i told you im not on duty im on leave im just another traveler you fed me the best meal ive had in months truly you did youve earned every copper i paid you and honestly but milord vanyel it was nothing it was common plowmans pie surely youd have preferred wine to cider venison or a stuffed pheasant and you paid me far too much vanyel felt a headache coming on actually no innkeeper the truth is ive been on ironrations for so long anything rich would likely have made me ill and venison if i never have to see another halfraw deer your good solid fare was feast enough for me ill tell you what he decided on the lie quickly ive been too long within walls i have a fancy for trees and sky tomorrow if youll have your excellent cook make me up a packet for breakfast and lunch ill consider us more than even will that serve your honor good sir the innkeeper stared chewing his mustache ends nervously as if he thought vanyel might be testing him for some reason and then nodded agreement now i im just a little more tired than i thought if i could use the bathhouse and get some sleep do you think to the mans credit he supplied vanyel with soap and towels and left him alone in the steamy quiet of the bathhouse vanyel managed to relax again but the cheer of this morning was gone he sought release in sleep finally in what must have been the finest room in the inn a huge bed wide enough for an entire family two featherbeds and a down comforter and sheets so fresh they almost crackled all of it scented with orris and lavender far below he could still hear the laughter and singing as he climbed into the enormous bed he blew out the candle then feeling as lonely as he had ever been in his life and prayed that sleep would come quickly for once his prayers were answered i wish i dared gate he mused aloud carefully examining then peeling a hardboiled egg yfandes had not said anything about his earlymorning departure from the inn or the fact that he had not waited for breakfast it was chilly enough that he needed his cloak and there was a delicate furring of frost on some of the tall weeds beside the roadway gating would shorten this trip considerably you try and ill kick you from here to haven yfandes replied sharply the first time shed spoken to him this morning that is absolutely the stupidest thing youve said in months he bit into the egg and looked at her backward pointing ears with interest havens ladylove didnt your tryst go well my tryst went just fine thank you she replied her mindvoice softening i just get sick every time i think about what happened the last time oh fandes it wasnt that bad not that bad when you were unconscious before you crossed the threshold and hurting so badly i nearly screamed all right it was bad he admitted popping the rest of the egg into his mouth and reaching into the breakfast packet and im not stupid enough to gate without urgent need he studied a roll weighing it in his hand it seemed awfully heavy as good as the food had been so far it didnt seem likely that it was underbaked but he was not in the mood to choke down raw dough he nibbled it dubiously then bit into it with a great deal more enthusiasm when it proved to have sausage baked into the middle of it it would just be very convenient to not have to stop at inns dont tell them your real name she interrupted what if reactions like last night bother you you dont have to tell them your real name tell them youre tantras tran wont mind fandes thats not the point never mind he finished the last of his breakfast and dusted his hands off a skein of geese flew overhead honking the farmers already out in the fields beside the road scything down the grain and making it into sheaves paused a moment and pointed at the v of birds tran was right and im going to have to get used to it i guess and i cant do that hiding behind someone elses name he managed a wan smile it could be worse they could be treating me like a leper because im shayachern instead of treating me like a godlet because im heraldmage vanyel demonsbane he grimaced gods that sounds pretentious she slowed her pace a trifle it isnt that important is it its that important im a very fallible mortal not an avatar magic is a force a force i control no more wonderful than a mindspeakers ability or a healers but they dont see it that way to them its something beyond anything they understand and theyre not sure it can be controlled he sighed or worse they think magic can solve every problem you thought that once i know i did when i was younger magic seemed to offer solutions to everything when i was nineteen he shook his head and stared out at the horizon for a while for a little while i thought i held the world even jays respected me came to be a friend but magic couldnt force my father to tell me id done well in his eyes or rather it could force him when i wanted the words to come freely from him it couldnt make being shayachern any easier it couldnt bring back my tylendel it was just power its dividing me from ordinary people worse than that it seems to be doing the same between me and other heralds and fandes that scares the hell out of me you wont be getting any of the godlet treatment from your kin i can promise you that i suppose not it was getting warmer by the moment he bundled his cloak and wondered if he should get out his hat gods change the subjectbefore you brood yourself into depression again do you think father will be able to keep mother off my back not to put too fine a point upon it no i didnt think so his shoulders were beginning to hurt again he clasped his arms behind him and arched his back looking up at the blue cloudless sky which means shell keep trying to cure me by throwing every female above the age of consent within leagues at me i could almost feel sorrier for the girls than i do for myself you ought to van he looked down at yfandes ears in surprise did it ever occur to you that you could well have broken a fair number of susceptible young hearts he raised an eyebrow skeptically arent you exaggerating think what about the way you charmed that poor little kitchen girl back at the palace he winced a little recalling the romance in her eyes but then irritation set in fandes ive never done anything other than be polite to any of them she snorted exactly think about it youre polite to them gallant occasionally even attentive think about the difference in your station and that kitchen maids what in havens do you think she was expecting when you were polite to her what does any young man of rank want when he notices a servant or a farmers daughter now he was something more than irritated i dont suppose its occurred to you that it might just be the simple fact that im a herald a safe sort of romance object great good gods fandes i doubt she had any notion of my rank well what about all those young women your mother parades before you telling them theyre prospective brides what do they think that gallantry is i would imagine that mother tells them plenty he replied with heat beginning to flush and very glad there was no one about to overhear this conversation well you imagine wrong talking to servants is beneath her as for the others all she ever tells them is that you and i quote lost your first love tragically now what in the ladys name do you think that makes them want to do gods fandes is that somehow my fault was i supposed to interrogate them while they were chasing me you she said ice dripping from every word never asked or bothered to ask or wanted to ask it never occurred to you that withen might not want it spread about the neighborhood that his firstborn son prefers men fandes he replied after a long bitter moment of silence i dont see where its any of your business it has nothing to do with my duties as a herald silence on her part then youre right im sorry i overstepped myself i i just wanted you to think about what was going on is that what ive been doing he asked quietly well yes then i should apologize i cant afford to react automatically to things not even in my personal life and gods not when im hurting people a wash of relief then a tinge of sarcasm youre thinking and about time too now are you going to enjoy a long wallow in selfaccusation something about the tone of her mindvoice and the exact wording shed used made him pause for a moment wait a minute let me look at this from another angle he made a mental checklist of all the young women lady treesa had pushed off on him and what theyd done when hed failed to succumb to their various charms and the more he thought about i t you are exaggerating arent you he accused well yes but the situation exists what are you going to do about it be careful i suppose but ill have to watch what i say good youre still thinking the ones mother keeps flinging at me are the hardest if i tell them the truth ill hurt father ill shame him at the least even if i pledge them to silence itll get out so i dont know but ill think about it now that is the vanyel i chose her mindvoice was warm with approval youre not just reacting anymore havens ive been going numb between the ears for the past year havent i well yes you had reason but he nodded slowly this last year ive gotten into a lot of habits exactly you cant let your heart or your habits control you not when youre who you are and wield the power you do think about reacting emotionally in a battle situation think about even reacting reflexively instead of tactically he did and shuddered he always stopped at halfway inn the name hed learned since was a conscious pun the hostelry that sat in the middle of the forest that cut forst reach off from the rest of the kingdom in a way what he had become had started here the inn had certainly marked his passage into a different world though young vanyel ashkevron more than half a prisoner of his escort had not gotten the attention that heraldmage vanyel got now it was an enormous place and in the normal run of things very few travelers even saw the innkeeper a herald was an exception the innkeeper himself saw to vanyels every whim not that there were very many of those the inn was quite comfortable even for those who were less noteworthy than vanyel there was less of the hero worship here than there had been in other inns along the road vanyel was local everyone attached to the inn and most of those staying there knew his family his holding they seemed to regard him with proprietary pride rather than awe as if the things he had done were somehow reflections on them as if his fame brought them fame and as if they had something to do with what he had become in a way perhaps they had if events that occurred here had not made him feel so utterly alienated from the rest of the world he might not have responded as strongly as he had to tylendel he left halfway inn just after dawn hoping to reach forst reach by early afternoon at the very latest he had always made excellent time on this last leg of his journey every other time hed made his trips home though he always left much faster than he arrived but he stopped yfandes before they had traveled more than a candlemark while fog still wreathed the undergrowth and it was dark beneath the silent trees the air was dampsmelling with the tang of rotting leaves and a hint of muskiness no birds sang and nothing rustled the fallen leaves underfoot or the branches overhead this forest was always quiet but this morning it was too quiet somethings wrong he said straightening in his saddle and pulling his cloak a little tighter around his shoulders i can feel it too yfandes agreed but its very subtle this forestunnamed so far as he knew had frightened him to the point of nearhysteria the first time hed traveled this road now he knew why there was magic here old magic of the kind that the tayledras used that they frequently drained off in order to weaken it and open the lands to more normal human settlements the kind of magic that made the pelagir hills the changelinghaunted places they were anyone with so much as the potential for the magegift could feel enough to make them unhappy and uncomfortable but this magic had been dormant for a very long time im going to probe he said and closed his eyes going in then opening out the magic was still there but it lay even deeper below the fabric of the forest than it had the last time he had passed this way now that his gift was fully trained he could even see the traces that told him it had been drained by the tayledras at least twice which meant it should be safe the hawkbrothers never left wild magic behind when they abandoned an area but that draining and abandonment had been long ago very long ago yes the magic still slept deeper than the taproots or the trees and harder to reach but it slept uneasily all magic was akin and all magic touched all other magic an affinity that made the gatespell possible but close proximity meant stronger ties to magics that neighbored one another disturbance to one site frequently disturbed another vanyel could feel that disturbance in the magics here a resonance with another pole of power at a distance probably across the border and most probably in baires given that the ruling family was composed of mages something somewhere was powerfully warping kindred magic fields and this field housed in the forest was resonating to that disturbance like a lute string resonating to a touch on the one beside it but it was too far away and the resonances too tenuous for vanyel to determine who was causing it or where it originated or even what was being done although vanyel brought himself up out of his scanningtrance and bit his lip in thought fandes did you get anything no more than you she replied uneasily resuming her pace without his prompting except the root of all this is evil and i know better than to ask you to probe anything i cant reach but i dont like it either i like it even less now with the border uneasy it makes me wonder if someone is forcing an issue and if so what and to what end tell lissa thats all you can do for now he glanced uneasily to either side of him im afraid youre right ladylove he agreed i am afraid youre only too right four despite everything hed told himself despite being adult and with experiences behind him withen could not even imagine vanyel felt his shoulders beginning to knot with anxiety the moment he crossed the gate marking the edge of the forst reach lands by the time he rode through the gate in the wall that surrounded the great house of the estate he was fighting to keep himself from hunching down in the saddle like a sullen frightened child it never changes outside these walls i may be a heraldmage who can admonish the king himself inside im vanyel prodigal son with habits we dont talk about and tastes best politely ignored gods when are they ever going to accept me for who i am perhaps never perhaps when you accept yourself chosen the unsolicited reply nettled him a little perhaps she continued when you know who you are and know it well enough that you cant be reduced to an adolescent just by riding through the gates he glanced down at yfandes ears and then ahead down the road to the destination that was causing him such discomfort are you saying i dont know who i am she didnt reply but picked her pace up to a trot the easy kindand rounded the final curve and hill that brought them within sight of forst reach itself bulking heavy and gray against the brilliant autumn sky the building had once been a defensive keep and still had something of that blocky no nonsense look about it it had long since been renovated and converted into a dwelling far more comfortable though even at this distance vanyel could see the faint outline of the moat under the lush grass surrounding it surrounded as it was by newer smaller outbuildings of whitewashed stucco it resembled a vast and rather illnatured gray granite hen squatting among a flock of paler chicks someone had been watching for him vanyel saw a small fairly androgynous figure leave a position on a little rise beside the road and run toward the main building it vanished somewhere in the vicinity of one of the old postern gates which were now doors and vanyel assumed he or she though it was probably a page had gone to tell the rest of the household that he had arrived heralds were distinctive enough to be spotted at any distance and few enough that it would be safe to assume that any herald coming to forst reach was going to be vanyel sure enough people began emerging from doors all over the building and by the time vanyel and yfandes reached the main doors impressive black oaken monstrosities that had been set into a frame in what had once been the gateway to the center court there was a sizable group waiting for him there was the usual babble of greetings treesa wept all over him withen gingerly clapped him on the shoulder his brothers all followed withens example there was the usual little dance when withen told a page to take vanyels horse and vanagainhad to explain that yfandes wasnt a horse she was a companion and his partner and that he would see to her and as usual withen looked puzzled and skeptical as if he was wondering if his son wasnt a bit daft but vanyel was firm as usual and got his way because if he hadnt insisted and the first visit home he hadnt yfandes would be stripped of tack and given a good rubdown then locked into a stall like the valuable animal she seemed to withen to be van hadnt known what had happened that time until she wistfully mindspoke him at dinner asking if hed come let her out since she couldnt reach the lock on the door of the stall that night he had gone immediately down to the stable leaving his dinner halfeaten and with profligate use of magic created a new split door to the outside in one of the big loose boxes withen used for mares in foal whenever he came home now that stall was yfandes no matter if he had to move a mare out and scour it down to the wooden floor with his own two hands first and no matter what sort of contrivance withen had installed on the new door to keep it locked vanyel magicked it so that yfandes could come and go as she pleased maybe withen wondered why the box never had to be cleaned certainly the stablehands did but withen never seemed to grasp that yfandes was exactly what his son said she was a brilliant thinking creative lady with all of a great ladys manners and daintiness who just happened to be living in a horses body yfandes was still moderately amused but vanyel frequently thought that it was a good thing hed never mentioned withens proposition on that first visit to breed her to the best of his palfreystuds or hed have been using his magic to repair the gaping holes in the stable instead of adding a door this time at least withen had learned enough through repetition that the loose box had been vacated scoured and bleached and then filled with straw but he still had left the outer door latched and doublelocked vanyel just sighed magicked the locks in the open position and pulled the top half of the door wide he moved the latchstring for the lower half back through the hole to where yfandes could get at it then rummaged through his own packs for a longer bit of string so that she could pull it closed if she chose needless to say the strap hed attached there last time was gone how hungry are you he asked her stripping her tack and hanging it over the edge of the stall for the stablehands to clean then beginning to rub her down straw dust tickled his nose and made him want to sneeze very she replied testing the depth of the straw with a forehoof and nodding approval just take the sweat off and get the knots out of my tail im going to roll when i get out and maybe swim in the pond he heard withens footsteps on the path to the stable and switched to mindspeech fine love just have your swim when nobodys watching or theyii send half the stablehands to pull you out now watch i will bet you money that father says are you sure you should leave her that much food so soon after a long ride she might founder he finished currying her took the bucket off its hook and went after grain for her are you sure you should leave her that much food so soon after a long ride withen said dubiously from the stable door proper his square bulk blocking nearly all the light she might founder father she isnt a horse she knows better than to stuff herself silly she told me shes very hungry its been a hard tour of duty for both of us and both of us need to get back a little weight vanyel hung the bucket of mixed grains where yfandes could get at it easily now hell say i suppose you know best son but i suppose you know best son but withen moved cautiously up to the loose box as vanyel forked in hay father would you stuff yourself sick after a long day at the harvest at harvest time withen made it a point of spending one day with each of his tenants and several days with his own fieldhands working beside them it was one of the many things he did that endeared him to his people well withens heavy brows creased and for once he looked uncertain no so neither will she he rinsed her waterbucket until it squeaked filled it with absolutely clear cold water and hung it beside the grain bucket withen stepped forward as if he couldnt help himself son shell foul the water would mother drop food into the wine in her goblet vanyel sighed well no so yfandes wouldnt since she has better manners than mother he mindtouched yfandes gently all set ladylove quite beloved yfandes mindvoice was yellow and effervescent with amusement does he do that to you every time we come vanyel rubbed her forehead between her eyes and she closed them with pleasure just about normally he doesnt follow me into the stable but i get it when he hears from the stablehands what i did with you watch out for that so called shinain stallion i think hes sometimes allowed to run loose in this field he might try and bully you he might decide youre one of his mares and give you a little excitement she bared her front teeth delicately id rather like to see him try anything on me i could use a good fight he nearly choked now love you ii scare him impotent and how will i explain that to meke cleverly of course go on with you im fine and your father is fretting all right father she says shes comfortable he said aloud forcing himself not to grin lets go are you sure she should be left like that what if she gets out father vanyel sighed sending the gods a silent plea for patience i want her to be able to come and go as she pleases but vanyel wondered if his father ever really heard anything he said shes not he repeated for the hundredth time a horse vanyel was in time for dinner a pleasure he would just as soon have done without but once bathed settled into the best guest room and dressed in clean clothing not uniform he wasnt on duty now not even technically his good sense prevailed over his reluctance when the summons for dinner came he followed the page and took his place at the high table withen tried to put him at his right between himself and vanyels mother vanyel managed to convince him to let him take the usual seat guests took on the end displacing radevel who didnt look at all unhappy to be sitting down at the low table sitting at the end he was spared having to make conversation with two people at once his seat mate proved to be mekeals thin little redhaired wife roshya who took all the burden of conversation from him she chattered nonstop sparrowlike without ever seeming to pause for breath all he had to do was nod and make vague noises of agreement or disagreement from time to time and he actually didnt mind roshyas gossip was cheerful and never malicious if she had a fault it was that she seemed to assume he must know every highborn and family member for leagues around after all she did the dark highceilinged hall seemed far more cramped than vanyel remembered until he counted heads and realized that there were twice the number of folk dining than there had been when he was fifteen he blinked but the number didnt change the low table had been lengthened and a second table set at right angles to it at the other end making an h shape with the high table and the high table had been lengthened too when van had been sent to haven and his aunt savil only withen treesa jervis father leren and any guests they might have had been seated therewhich had then included vanyels aunt serina and her healer now besides the original four the table included the unmarried children all three married sons and their wives great good gods this isnt a family its a tribe the only one missing since his last visit seemed to be his youngest sister charis it looked like the only ones still home were the boys after a moment of thought it seemed to him that he recalled getting word of charis wedding to somebodyo other just after elspeths death did i send a present i mustve or id have heard about it five breaths after being greeted thats right i remember now i sent that hideously pious tapestry of the lady of fertility aunt savil took care of meke and roshya for me and i sent deleran those awful silverandcrystal candlesticks but gods did i do anything about raster and whateverhernameis that was just seven or eight months ago i was so tangled up in the borderfight i dont remember he continued to fret about that until roshyas dropped comment about the delightful bedcurtains kaster and ria were so pleased told him that if he hadnt savil must have sent something in his name at that point he relaxed a little from roshyas chatter vanyel learned that she and mekeal had six children thus far deleran and his wife had two and rasters rather plump new bride looks ready to spawn at any moment lord and lady they certainly didnt waste any time it made his head swim to think about it forst reach was hardly a small holding but it must be near to bursting at the seams he must have looked as if he were marginally interested in the new bride roshya waved her beringed hands in an artful imitation of treesa and launched into a dissertation on lady ria that was partly fact and mostly fancy vanyel was in a position to know shed been one of the young women his mother had thrown into his path the last time hed been home she looked content enough now with kaster which was something of a relief to his conscience he looked back down at the low table in one of roshyas infrequent pauses for breath no wonder shes thin she never stops talking to eat radevel was the only face he recognized down there although a good half the youngsters had the ashkevron build and look radevel was stolidly munching his way through a heaping plateful of bread and roast when he caught vanyel looking at him and gave the herald a shrug of the shoulders aimed at the mob of children then a slow and quite deliberate wink vanyel stifled a laugh so father is still fostering dozens of cousins and radevel is still stuck here poor rad what is he fifth son nowhere else to go i guess i bet fathers put him in charge of the younglings good choice he ii keep them moderately in line better him than jervis he looked back up in time to catch crag faced jervis the forst reach armsmaster giving him an ugly glare he met the glare impassively but with an inward feeling of foreboding hes going to try something i feel it in my bones great that means ill get to play catandmouse with him through the whole visit he looked away when the armsmasters eyes fell only to find that saturnine father leren was giving him a look of ice and calculation too from beneath hooded lids delightful so i have both of them to deal with just what i needed what a wonderful friendly visit this is going to be he continued to make the appropriate noises at roshya and ignored the further stares of jervis and leren mekeal had become so like withen that vanyel had to blink seeing them together broad shoulders brown beards trimmed identically brown hair held back in identical tails with identical silver rings dark brown eyes as open and readable as a dogsdissimilar clothing was about all that differentiated them that and a few wrinkles in withens face a few gray streaks in his hair and beard meke was perhaps a touch less muscular not surprising since withens muscles had been built up in actual fighting during his career as a guard officer and meke had never seen any righting outside of an occasional skirmish with bandits but otherwise withen did not look his age with all the silver in his hair and the stresslines around his eyes vanyel could be taken for older than his father treesa on the other hand had not aged gracefully she was still affecting the light diaphanous gowns and pale colors appropriate to a young girl even if he had not been aware of the various cosmetic artifices employed by the ladies of randales court vanyel would have known the coloring of her hair and cheeks to be false shes holding onto youth with teeth and nails and its still getting away from her he thought sadly poor mother all she ever had to make her feel like she had some worth was being pretty and me and shes losing both every year i become more of a stranger to her every year her looks fade a little more he glanced over at roshya who seemed to be doing her best to imitate lady treesa and was relieved to see a gleam of lively good humor in her green eyes and to hear a little of that sense of humor reflected in what she was saying treesa would likely become a bitter unpleasant old woman on her own but not with roshya around the rest of vanyels brothers had become thinner more reckless copies of meke they ate heavily and drank copiously and roared jokes at each other across the length of table emphasizing points with a brandished fork theyre probably terrors on the hunt and i bet they hunt every other day and probably fighting when they arent hunting they need something to keep them occupied cant father see that the more vanyel saw the uneasier he became there was a restlessness in withens offspring that demanded an outlet but there wasnt any no wonder meke is hoping for a borderwar he realized as the meal drew to a close this place is like a geyser just about to blow and when it does if there isnt any place for that energy to go someone is going to get hurt or worse servants began clearing the tables and the adults rose and began to drift out on errands of their own by forst reach tradition the great hall belonged to the youngsters after dinner vanyel lingered until most of the others had gone out the double doors to the hallway he was not in the mood to argue with anyone right now or truly even in the mood to make polite conversation what he wanted was a quiet room a little time to read and more sleep it didnt seem as if the gods were paying much attention to his wants lately withen was waiting for him just beyond the doors son about that horse father i keep telling you yfandes is not withen shook his head an expression of marked impatience on his square face not your companion mekeals horse that damned stud he bought oh vanyel smiled sheepishly sorry lately my mind stays in the same path unless you jerk its leash sideways tired i guess for the first time withen actually looked at him and his thick eyebrows rose in alarm son you look like hell i know vanyel replied ive been told bad withen gave him the same kind of sober attention he gave to his own contemporaries vanyel was obscurely flattered take all the horror stories coming north from the karsite border and double them thats what its been like for once withens martial background was a blessing he knew what borderfighting was like and his expression darkened for a moment gods son that is not good to hear so youll be needing your rest well i wont keep you too long then listen lets take this out to the walk the walk withen referred to was a stone porch rather like a low balcony and equipped with a balustrade that ran the length of the north side of the building why grandfather joserlin had put it there no one knew it overlooked the gardens but not usefully most of the view being screened off by the row of cypresses hed had planted just beneath the railing it could be accessed by one door through the linen storeroom not many people used it unless they wanted to be alone which actually made it a fine choice for a private discussion blue hazy dusk scented with woodsmoke was all that met them there vanyel went over to the balustrade and sat on the top of it and withen began again about that horse have you seen it im afraid so vanyel replied his window overlooked the meadows where the horses were turned loose to graze and hed seen the shinain stud kicking up his heels and attempting to impress yfandes who was in the next field over she had been ignoring him i hate to say this father but meke was robbed ive seen a shinain warsteed theyre ugly but not like that beast theyre smaller than that stud theyre not made to carry men in armor theyre bred to carry nomad horsearchers they have very strong hindquarters but their forequarters are just as strong and theyre a little short in the spine bunchy i guess youd say and their heads are large all out of proportion to the rest of them the only thing a shinain warsteed has in common with mekes nag is color and besides the only way an outsider could get a warsteed would be to steal a young untrained one and then kill the entire clan he stole it fromand then kill the other clans that came after him no chance maybe somewhere theres shinain blood in that one but its cull blood if so withen nodded i thought it might be something like that ive seen their ridingbeasts the ones they will sell us beautiful creaturesso i knew that stud wasnt one of those either the animal is stupid even for a horse and thats going some its vicious tooeven with other horses cut up the one mare meke put it to before they could stop it its never been broken to ride and im not sure it can beand you know how i feel about that vanyel halfsmiled one thing that withen knew was his horses and it was an ironclad rule with him that all studs had to be broken for riding the same as his geldings and exercised regularly under saddle no stud in his stable was allowed to laze about when they werent standing they were working it made them that much easier to handle at breedingtime most of withens own favorite mounts were his studs a mockerbird shrilled in one of the cypresses and vanyel jumped at the unexpected sound as he willed his heart to stop racing withen continued it hasnt taken a piece out of any of the stablehands yet but i wonder if that isnt just lack of opportunity and this is what meke wants to breed half the huntermares to vanyel shook his head damn i hope this jumpingatshadows starts fading out if i cant calm myself down im going to hurt someone i dont know what to tell you father id have that beast gelded and put in front of a plow frankly i think thats likely all hes good for either that or use the damned thing to train your more experienced young riders how to handle an unmanageable horse but im a herald not a landholder i have no experience with horsebreeding and meke is likely to point that out as soon as i open my mouth but you have seen a real shinain warsteed withen persisted once with a real shinain on itsherback the nomad in question told me they dont allow the studs anywhere near the edge of the dhorisha plains only the mares go into the world as he put it even in the near dark and without using any gift vanyel could tell his father was alive with curiosity valdemar saw the fabled shinain riding horses once in perhaps a generation and very few citizens of valdemar had even seen the shinain themselves probably no one from valdemar had ever seen a nomad on his warsteed until he had bodyguard father he said answering the unspoken question the nomad was a bodyguard for one of their shamans and i met them both in the ktreva vale i doubt the shaman would have needed one except that he must have been nearly eighty i tell you he was the toughest eightyyearold id ever seen hed come to ask help from the tayledras to get rid of some monster that had decided the plains looked good and the horses tasty and moved in withen shivered a little talk of magic bothered him and the fact that his son had actually been taught by the ghostly legendary hawkbrothers made him almost as uneasy as vanyels sexual inclinations the mockerbird shrieked again but this time vanyel was able to keep from leaping out of his skin at any rate i dont promise anything more except to try but i want to warn you im going to go at this the same way id handle a delicate negotiation you wont see results at once assuming i get any meke is as stubborn as that stud of his and its going to take some careful handling and a lot of carrots to get him to come around withen nodded well thats all i can ask i certainly havent gotten anywhere with him and thats why i asked you to stick your nose into this im no diplomat vanyel got up off the railing and headed for the door the fact is father you and meke are too damned much alike withen actually chuckled the fact is son youre too damned right vanyel slept until noon the guest room was at the front of the building well away from all the activity of the stables and yards the bed curtains were as thick and dark as he could have wished and someone had evidently given the servants orders to stay out of his room until he called for them which was just as well since van was trusting his reflexes not at all so he slept in peace and rose in peace and stood at the window overlooking the narrow road to the keep feeling as if he might actually succeed in putting himself back together if he could get a few more nights like the last one a mere breath of breeze came in the window and mocker birds were singingpleasantly this time all along the guttering above his head he could easily believe it to be still summer he couldnt recall a gentler warmer autumn he sent out a testing thought tendril fandes bright the day sleepy one she responded the hawkbrother greeting he laughed silently and took a deep breath of air that tasted only faintly of falling leaves and leafsmoke and wind to thy wings sweeting would you rather laze about or go somewhere today need you ask laze about frankly i think im going to spend the rest of the day the way i did this morning napping in the sun doing slow stretches that pulled tendon needs favoring yet he nodded turning away from the window i dont doubt makes me glad i was running lighter than normal after you pulled it she laughed and moved farther out into her field so that he could see her from the window i wont say it didnt help well go play gallant to your mother and get it over with with any luck she hasnt had a chance to bring in one of the local fillies he grimaced rang for a servant one appeared with a promptness that suggested hed been waiting right outside the door vanyel felt a pang of conscience wondering how long hed been out there id like something to eat he said and wash water please andlisten there is no reason to expect me to wake before midmoming and noon is likelier i surely wont want anyone or anything before noon so pass that on would you no use in having one of you cool his heels for hours the swarthy manservant looked surprised then grinned and nodded before hurrying off after vanyels requests vanyel hunted up his clothing deciding on an almost new dark blue outfit about the time the wash water arrived it felt rather strange not to be wearing whites but at the same time he was reveling in the feel of silk and velvet against his skin the field uniforms were strictly utilitarian leather and raime wool and linen and he hadnt had many occasions to wear formal richer whites no wonder they call me a peacock sensualist that i am i like soft clothing well why not the manservant showed up with food as vanyel finished lacing up his tunic he considered his reflection in the polished steel mirror and ended up belting the tunic it had fit perfectly when hed last worn it but now it looked ridiculously baggy without a belt he sighed and applied himself to his breakfast it was always far easier to gain weight than to lose it anyway that was one consolation after that he felt ready to face his mother and whatever ladytraps she had baited and ready she always asked him to play whenever he stayed long enough so he stripped the case from his lute and tuned it then slung it on his back and headed for her bower maybe he could distract her with music hello mother vanyel said leaning down to kiss treesas gracefully extended perfumed fingertips you look younger every time i see you the other ladies giggled pretended to sew fluttered fans treesa colored prettily at the compliment and her silver eyes sparkled for that moment the compliment wasnt a polite lie vanyel you have been away far too long she let her hand linger in his for a moment and he gently squeezed it she fluttered her eyelashes happily flirtation was treesas favorite game courtly love her choice of pastime it didnt matter that the courtier was her son she had no intention of taking the game past the graceful and empty movements of the dance of words and gesture and he knew it and she knew he knew it so everyone was happy she was never so alive as when there was someone with her willing to play her game he fell in with the pretense quite pleased that she hadnt immediately introduced anyone to him that might mean she didnt have any girls she planned to fling at him and she hadnt pouted at him either so he was still in her good graces he had much rather play courtier than have her rain tears and reproaches on his head for not spending more time with his family in the gauzebedecked bower full of fluttering femininity in pale colors and lace he was quite aware that he looked all the more striking in his midnight blue he hoped it would give him enough distinctionand draw enough attention to the silver in his hair so that treesa would remember he wasnt fifteen anymore alas first lady of my heart he said with a quirk of one eyebrow i fear i had very little choice in the matter a heralds duty lies at the kings behest she dimpled and patted the rose velvet cushion of the stool placed beside her chair weve been hearing so many stories about you vanyel this spring there was a minstrel here who sang songs about you she fussed with the folds of her saffron gown as he took his seat at her side her maids those few who werent at work at the three looms placed against the wall and her fosterlings all gathered up their sewing and spinning at this unspoken signal and gathered closer the sunbright room glowed with the muted rainbow colors of their gowns and vanyel had to work to keep himself from smiling as faces young and notsoyoung pretty and plain turned toward him like so many flowers toward the sun hed not gotten this kind of attention even when he was the petted favorite of this very bower but then when hed been the bower pet hed only been a handsome fifteenyearold with a bit of talent at playing and singing now he was heraldmage vanyel the hero of songs and all too likely to have his foot stepped on if he comes near me with a swelled head said yfandes he bent his head over the lute and pretended to tune it until he could keep his face straight then turned back to his mother i know better songs than those and far more suited to a lovely lady than tales of war and darkness there was disappointment in some faces but treesas eyes glowed would you play a love song van she asked coquettishly would you play my ladys eyes forme probably the most inane piece of drivel ever written he thought but it has a lovely tune why not he bowed his head slightly my ladys wish is ever my decree he replied and began the intricate introduction at once he couldnt help noticing melenna sitting just behind a knot of three adolescents her hands still her eyes as dreamy as theirs she was actually prettier now than she had been as a girl poor melenna she never gives up almost fourteen years and shes still yearning after me gods what a mess shes made out of her life he wondered somewhere at the back of his mind what had become of the bastard child shed had by mekeal when pique at his refusing her had led her to mekes bed was it a boy or girl was it one of the girls pressed closely around him now or had she lost it loose ends like that worried him loose ends had a habit of tripping you up when you least expected it particularly when the loose ends were human he got the answer to his question a lot sooner than hed guessed he would oh van that was lovely treesa sighed then dimpled again you know we havent been entirely without art and music while youve been gone ive managed to find myself another handsome little minstrel havent i lenna melenna glowed nearly the same fadedrose as her gownone of treesas remade vanyel definitely recollected it hes hardly as good as vanyel was milady she replied softly oh i dont know treesa retorted with just a hint of maliciousness medren why dont you come out and let vanyel judge for himself a tall boy of about twelve with an old battered lute of his own rose slowly from where hed been sitting hidden by melenna and came hesitantly to the center of the group there was no doubt who his father was he had mekes lankiness hair and square chin though he was smaller than mekeal had been at that age and his shoulders werent as broad there was no doubt either who his mother was melennas wide hazel eyes stared at vanyel from two faces the boy bobbed at treesa i cant come close to those fingerings milord milady he said with an honesty that felt painful to vanyel some of thats the fact that ive had near twenty years of practice medren vanyel replied acutely aware that both treesa and melenna were eyeing him peculiarly he was not entirely certain what was going on but theres some of it thats the instrument this one has a very easy action why dont you borrow it they exchanged instruments the boys hands trembled as he took vanyels finely crafted lute he touched the strings lightly and swallowed hard what his voice cracked and he tried again what would you like to hear milord vanyel thought quickly it had to be something that wouldnt be so easy as to be an insult but certainly wouldnt involve the intricate fingerings hed used on my ladys eyes do you know windrider unchained he asked finally the boy nodded made one false start then got the instrumental introduction through and began singing the verse and vanyel nearly dropped the boys lute as the sheer power of medrens singing washed over him his voice wasnt quite true on one or two notes that didnt matter time maturity and practice would take care of those little faults his fingerings were sometimes uncertain that didnt matter either what mattered was that while medren sang vanyel lived the song the boy was bardic gifted with a gift of unusual power and he was singing to a bowerful of emptyheaded sweetlyscented marriagebait wasting a gift that vanyel at fifteen would willingly have sacrificed a leg to gain both legs and counted the cost a small one it was several moments after the boy finished before vanyel could bring himself to speak and he really only managed to do so because he could see the hope in medrens eyes slowly fading to disappointment in fact the boy had handed him back his instrument and started to turn away before he got control of himself medren medren he said insistently enough to make the boy turn back you are better than i was even at fifteen in a few years you are going to be better than i could ever hope to be if i practiced every hour of my life you have the bardicgift lad and thats something no amount of training will give he would have said more he wanted to say more but treesa interrupted with a demand that he sing again and by the time he untangled himself from the concentration the song required the boy was gone the boy was on his mind all through dinner he finally asked roshya about him and roshya delighted at having actually gotten a question out of him burbled on until the last course was removed and the more vanyel heard the more he worried the boy was being given at treesas insistence the same education as the legitimate offspring which meant in essence that he was being educated for exactly nothing except perhaps one day becoming the squire of one of his legitimate cousins meanwhile his real talent was being neglected the problem gnawed at the back of vanyels thoughts all through dinner and accompanied him back to his room he lit a candle and placed it on the small writing desk still pondering it might have kept him sleepless all night except that soon after he flung himself down in a chair still feeling somewhat stunned by the boy and his gift there came a knock on his door come he said absently assuming it was a servant the door opened milord herald said a tentative voice out of the darkness beyond his candle could you spare a little time vanyel sat bolt upright medren is that you the boy shuffled into the candlelight shutting the door behind him he had the neck of his lute clutched in both hands i his voice cracked again milord you said i was good i taught myself milord they when they opened up the back of the library they found where you used to hide things nobody wanted the music and instruments but me id been watching minstrels and i figured out how to play them then lady treesa heard me she got me this lute the boy shuffled forward a few more steps then stood uncertainly beside the table vanyel was trying to get his mind and mouth to work that the boy was this good was amazing but that he was entirely selftaught was miraculous medren he said at last to say that you astonish me would be an understatement what can i do for you if its in my power its yours medren flushed but looked directly into vanyels eyes milord herald medren vanyel interrupted gently i am not milord herald not to you youre my nephew call me by my given name medren colored even more iv vanyel if you could if you would teach me please ill he coughed and lowered his eyes now turning a red so bright it was painful to look at ill do anything you like just teach me vanyel had no doubt whatsoever what the boy thought he was offering in return for music lessons the painful and very potently sexual embarrassment was all too plain to his empathy gods the poor child medren wasnt even a temptation i may be shaych but not children the thoughts revolting medren he said very softly they warned you to stay away from me didnt they and they told you why the boy shrugged they said you were shaych made all kinds of noises but hell youre a herald heralds dont hurt people im shaych yes vanyel replied steadily but you you arent no the boy said but hell like i said i wasnt worried what you could teach me thats worth anything and i havent got much else to repay you with he finally looked back up into vanyels eyes besides there isnt anything you could do to me thatd be worse than jervis beating on me once a day and they all seem to think thats all right vanyel started jervis what what do you mean jervis beating on you sit medren please what i said the boy replied gingerly pulling a straightbacked chair to him and taking a seat i get treated just like the rest of them same lessons only theres this little problem im not trueborn his tone became bitter with eight trueborn heirs and more on the way where does that leave me nowhere thats where and theres no use in currying favor with me or being a little easy on me cause i dont have a thing to offer anybody so when time comes for an example who gets picked medren when we want a live set of pells to prove a point who gets beat on medren and what the hell do i have to expect at the end of it when im of age squire to one of the trueborn boys if im lucky the door if im not unless i can somehow get good enough to be a minstrel vanyels insides hurt as badly as if medren had punched him there gods his thoughts roiled with incoherent emotions gods hes like i was hes just like i was only he doesnt have those thin little protections of rank and birth that i had he doesnt have a lissa watching out for him and he has the gift the precious gift my gods course my mother figures theres another way out medren continued cynically lady treesa she figures youve turned down so many girls she figures shes got about one chance left to cure you so she told my mother you were all hers she could do whatever it took to get you and if my mother could get you so far as to marry her lady treesa swore shed get lord withen to allow it so my mother figures on getting into your breeches then getting you to marry her then to adopt me she says she figures the last part is the easiest cause she watched you watching me and she knows how you feel about music and bards and all so she wanted me to help poor melenna she just cant seem to realize what shes laying herself open for so why are you telling me this vanyel found his own voice sounding incredibly calm considering the pain of past memories and the ache for this unchildlike child i dont like traps medren said defiantly i dont like seeing them being laid i dont like seeing things in them and i dont much like being part of the bait and besides all that youre special i dont want anything out of you that youve been tricked into giving vanyel rose and held out his hand medren looked at it for a moment and went a little pale despite his brave words he looked up at vanyel with his eyes wide you you want to see my side of the bargain he asked tremulously vanyel smiled no little nephew he replied im going to take you to my father and were going to discuss your future withen had a room he called his study though it was bare of anything like a book a small stonewalled room windowless furnished with comfortable wornout old chairs treesa wouldnt allow in the rest of the keep it was where he brought old cronies to sit beside the fire drink and trade tall tales it was where he went after dinner to stare at the flames and nurse a last mug of ale thats where vanyel had expected to find him and when vanyel ushered medren into the stuffy little room he could tell by his fathers stricken expression that withen was assuming the absolute worst father he said before withen could even open his mouth do you know who this boy is candlelight flickered in his fathers eyes as withen looked at him as if hed gone insane but he answered the question thats uh medren melennas boy melenna and mekeals father vanyel said forcibly hes ashkevron blood and by that blood we owe him now just how are we paying him what future does he have withen started to answer but vanyel cut him off ill tell you father none there are how many wedlockborn heirs here and how much property forst reach is big but it isnt that big where does that leave the little tagalong bastard when there may not be enough places for the legitimate offspring whats he going to do eke out the rest of his life as somebodys squire what if he falls in love and wants to marry what if he doesnt want to be somebodys squire all his life youve given him the same education and the same wants as the rest of the boys father the same expectations the same needs how do you plan on making him content to take a servants place after being raised like one of the heirs i uh now ill tell you something else vanyel continued without giving him a chance to answer this young man is bardicgifted that gift is as rare and as valued in valdemar as the one that makes me a herald and we ashkevrons are letting that rare and precious gift rot here now what are we going to do about it withen just stared at him vanyel waited for him to assimilate what hed been told the fire crackled and popped beside him as withen blinked with surprise bardicgifted rare i knew the boy played around with music but are you telling me the boy can make a future out of that ill tell you more than that father medren will be a firstclass bard if he gets the training and gets it now a full bard father royalty will pour treasure at his feet to get him to sing for them he could earn a noble rank higher than yours but only if he gets what he needs now and i mean right now what withens brow wrinkled in puzzlement vanyel could see that he was having a hard time connecting music with earning a noble rank you mean send him to haven to bardic collegium thats exactly what i mean father vanyel said watching medren out of the corner of his eye the boy was in serious danger of losing his jaw or popping his eyes right out of their sockets and i think we should send him as soon as we can spare him an escort when the harvest is over at the very latest i will be happy to write a letter of sponsorship to bard chadran if forst reach wont cover it im sure my stipend will stretch enough to take care of his expenses that last was a wicked blow shrewdly designed to awake his fathers sense of duty and shame that wont be necessary son withen said hastily great good gods its the least we can do if if thats what you want medren what i want the boy replied tears coming to his eyes milord i oh milord its he threw himself kneeling at withens feet never mind withen said hastily profoundly embarrassed i can see it is consider it a fact well send you off to haven with the harvesttax the boy made as if to grab withens hand and kiss it withen waved him off no now go on with you boy get up get up dont grovel like that dammit youre ashkevron and dont thank me im just the old fool that was too blind to see what was going on under my nose save your thanks for vanyel medren got to his feet clumsy in his adolescent awkwardness made clumsier by dazed joy before the boy could repeat the gesture vanyel took him by the shoulders and steered him toward the door why dont you go tell your mother about your good news medren he winked at the boy and managed to get a tremulous grin out of him im certain shell be very surprised that sentence made the grin widen and take on a certain conspiratorial gleam medren nodded and vanyel pushed him out the door shutting it tightly behind him he turned back to face withen and there was no humor in his face or his heart now fatherwe have to talk five what withen asked his brow wrinkling in per plexity i said we have to talk now vanyel walked slowly and carefully toward his father exerting every bit of control he possessed to keep his face impassive about you about me and about some assumptions about me that you keep making he stood just out of arms length of withens chair struggling to maintain his composure when i brought medren in here i knew what you were thinking just looking at your expression the fire flared up lighting withens face perfectly and youre still thinking it vanyel came as close as he ever had in his life to exploding and kept his voice down only by dint of much selfcontrol it took several moments before he could speak dammit father im not like that i dont do things like that im a herald and dammit im a decent man i dont molest little boys gods the idea makes me want to vomit and that you automatically assumed i had he was trembling half in anger half in an anguished frustration that had been held in check for nearly ten years withen squirmed acutely uncomfortable with this confrontation son i vanyel cut him off with an abrupt shake of his head then held both his hands outstretched toward withen in entreaty why father why why cant you believe what i tell you what have i ever done to make you think i have no sense of honor when have i ever been anything other than honest with you withen stared at the floor look vanyel said grasping at anything to get his point across lets turn this around i know damned good and well youve had other bedpartners than mother but do i assume you would try toto seduce that littlegirl chambermaid of hers have i looked sideways at you whenever youve been around one of her ladies so why should you constantly accuse me in your mind assuming that i would obviously be trying to seduce every susceptible young man and vulnerable little boy in sight withen coughed and flushed crimson hed probably be angry vanyel thought in a part of his mind somewhere beyond his anguish except that this frontal assault isnt giving him time to be anything other than embarrassed you could use your reputation as a the kind of person they write those songs about withen flushed even redder a heroworshipping lad would find it hard todeny you might even think it your due and his duty yes father thats only too true yes i could use my reputation dont think im not acutely aware of that but i wont would never cant you understand that im a herald i have a moral obligation that ive pledged myself to by accepting that position by the blankness of withens expression vanyel guessed he had gone beyond withens comprehension of what a herald was he tried again therere more reasons than that im a thoughtsenser father did you ever think what that means the constraints it puts on me the things im open to its a harder school of honor than ever jervis taught there are no compromises mindtomind there are no falsehoods there cant be a relationship for me has to be one of absolute equals freely giving freely sharingor nothing still no flicker of understanding he used blunter language no rape father no unwilling seduction no lies no deception no harm no one who doesnt already know what he is no one who hasnt made peace with what he is and accepted it no innocents who havent learned what they are no children withen looked away fidgeting a little in his chair vanyel moved swiftly to kneel between him and the fire where withen couldnt avoid looking at him father dammit father i care about you i dont want to make you unhappy but i cant help what i am why van withens voice sounded half strangled why what in hell did i do wrong nothing everything i dont know vanyel cried out his words trembling in the air a tragic song tortured from the strings of a broken lute why am i gifted why am i anything maybe its something i was born with maybe the gods willed it maybe its nothing more than the fact that the only person ill ever love happened to be born into the same sex body that i was grief knotted his throat and twisted his voice further all i know is that i am this way and nothing is going to change that and i care for my father and nothing is going to change that and if you cant believe in me in my sense of honor oh gods father he got to his feet somehow and held out his open hands toward withen in a desperate plea for understanding please father im not asking for much im not asking you to do anything only to believe that i am a decent human being believe in herald vanyel if you wont believe in your son only believe believe that no one will ever come to harm at my hands and try to understand please but there still was no understanding in withens eyes only uncertainty and acute discomfort vanyel let his hands fall and turned away defeated the last dregs of his energy had been burned out probably for nothing i im sorry son never mind vanyel said dully bleakly walking slowly toward the door never mind ive lived with it this long i should be used to it listen im going to make you a pledge since you wont believe me without one medren is safe from my advances father your grandsons are safe every damned thing on this holding down to the sheep is safe all right you have my damned oath as a damned herald on it will that be enough for you he didnt wait to hear the answer but opened the door quickly and shut it behind him he leaned against it feeling bitterness and hurt knotting his gut making his chest ache and his head throb and eleven years experience as a herald was all that enabled him to cram that hurt back down into a little corner and slap a lid on it to fiercely tell the lump in his throat that it was not tears and it would go away maybe he would deal with all this laternot now not when he was drained dry and not when he was alone heyla van the voice out of the dark corridor beside him startled him and he whirled in reaction his hands reaching for weapons automatically he forced himself to relax and made out who it was godsjust what i needed evening meke he replied tired and not bothering to hide it what brings you out tonight lady bright that sounds feeble even to me oh mekeal replied vaguely moving into the range of the lantern beside the study door things just things where were you off to bed vanyel knew his reply was brusque even rude but it was either that or let meke watch him fall to pieces im damned tired meke ive got a lot of rest to catch up on mekeal nodded his expression softening a little with honest concern you look like hell van if you dont mind my saying so gods not again the last year hasnt been a good one especially not on the borders thats exactly what i wanted to talk to you about mekeal interrupted eagerly coming so close that vanyel could see the lantern flames reflected in his eyes listen can you spare me a little time before you go off to bed say a candlemark or so vanyel stifled a sigh of exasperation all right stupid you gave him the opening you have only yourself to blame that he took it i suppose so great come on mekeal took vanyels elbow and hauled him down the ill lit corridor practically running in his eagerness youve seen that stud i bought from a distance vanyel replied cautiously well i want you to come have a good look at him and he really doesnt settle down until well after dark i can believe that they walked rapidly down the hollowsounding corridor mekeal chattering on about his acquisition vanyel made a few appropriately conversational sounds but was far more interested in reestablishing his professional calm than in anything meke was saying meke was obviously heading for the corridor that led to one of the doors to the stable yard so vanyel pulled his arm free and picked up his own pace a little might as well get this over with now while im still capable of standing mekeal obviously had this planned for when they emerged into the cool darkness and a sky full of stars vanyel saw the dim glow of a lantern in the stable across the yard they crossed the yard at something less than a run but not for lack of mekeals trying to hurry his steps the famous stud had pride of place first stall by the entrance by the lantern vanyel stared at it if anything it was worse up close than at a distance ugly is not the word for this beast it glared over its shoulder at him as if it had heard his thought and bared huge yellow teeth at him ive never seen a nastier piece of work in my life you couldnt pay me enough to try and saddle break this nag well meke said bursting with pride what do you think vanyel debated breaking the bad news easily then remembered what his little brother was like he not only did not take hints well he never even knew there was such a thing as a subtle hint vanyel braced himself and told the truth meke theres no way to say this tactfully that monster is no more shinain than i am you were robbed mekeals face fell ive seen a shinain warsteed vanyel said pressing his advantage she was under a shinain the nomad told me then that they dont ever sell the warbeasts and that they literally would not permit one to be in the hands of an outsider and they never never let the studs off the dhorisha plains ill give you a full description the mare i saw was three hands shorter than this stud of yours bred to carry a small horsearcher not anyone in heavy plate she was shortbacked deepchested and her hindquarters were a little higher than her forequarters she had a big head in proportion to the rest of her and if anything this studs head is small besides being large her skull had an incredibly broad forehead lots of room for brains need i say more about the only things she had in common with your stud are color and muscles he sighed im sorry meke but a halfbreed couldnt he be a cross mekeal asked desperately if a common stud caught the mare in season and if she didnt kill him first and if the mares owner decided against all tradition to sell the foal instead of destroying it or sending it back to the plains maybe not bloody likely but a very bare possibility it is also a very bare possibility that this stud has shinain cull blood somewhere very far back in his line vanyel rubbed his nose and sneezed in the dust rising as the stud fidgeted in his stall the precious stud laid his ears back squealed and cowkicked the door to the box as hard as he could more dust rose there was a clatter of hooves all through the stable and startled whinnies as the rest of the horses reacted to the studs display of ill temper meke why did you buy this monster forst reach has the best line of hunters from here to haven hunters wont do us a hell of a lot of good when theres an army marching toward us mekeal said turning to look at him soberly and even if this lad isnt shinain crossed into our hunters hell sire foals with the muscle to carry men in armor i just hope to hell we have them before we need them incredulous at those words coming from this sibling vanyel looked across his shoulder at his younger brother thats what this is about meke nodded the flickering lantern making him look cadaverousand much older theres trouble coming up on the west even if it doesnt come from baires and lineas one or both itll come from the changeling lands beyond them its been building since elspeth died every year we get more weird things crossing over into valdemar plenty of them here check the trophy room some time while youre visiting youll get an eyeful liss thinks theyre either being driven here by something worse or theyre being sent to test our defenses neither notion makes me real comfortable hunters are all very well but they cant carry a fighter in full armor and the tourneyhorses ive been seeing lately dont have the stamina for war one thing this lad does have is staying power gods oh gods if the problems are so evident even meke is seeing them vanyels spine went to ice do you want my advice with this beast he asked bluntly mekeal nodded given what youve told me he might be useful after all breed him to the besttempered and largest of the huntermares and see what comes of breeding him to plowhorse mares maybe make a secondgeneration threeway cross if you have time meke nodded again smoothing his closecropped beard i hadnt thought about plowbeasts thats a good notion he is vicious i like the willingness to fight but i can do without viciousness so you agree with me vanyel turned slowly a new respect for his brother coloring his thoughts meke even if this border stays quiet theres karse theres hardorn theres iftelrethwellan seems quiet but their king is old and that could change when he dies theres even the north if those barbarians ever find a leader to weld them into a single fighting force may the gods help us youll have a ready market all too soon if you can breed the kind of horses youre talking about vanyel pondered the worn scrubbed wooden floor of the stable what have you heard about here i mean the mavelans want lineas badly enough to chance a war with us i dont know the lineans dont much like either baires or valdemar but they figure valdemar is marginally better so theyll put up with us enforcing the peace as thirdparty it all comes down to whats going to happen with this mess with tashir being disinherited lady bright more words of political wisdom where i never expected to find them his view may be shortsighted he may not see the larger picture but where his neighbors are concerned my little brother seems to have them well weighed and measured i heard lord vedric is behind the protests vanyel ventured mekeal looked skeptical one thing ive learned watching them anything the mavelans do openly has about fifty motives and is hiding a dozen other moves the protest might be a covering move for something else vedric might have the backing of the family vedric might be operating under orders vedric might be acting on his own vedric might have nothing to do with it and vedric might really be tashirs father and might actually be trying to do something for the boy the gods know he hasnt any trueborn offspring and its not that he hasnt tried vanyel nodded and stowed that tidbit away ill tell you what meke ill do what i can to get father to see why you want to breed this stud and persuade him that since you arent breeding hunters he ought to leave you alone to see what you can come up with but those sheep mekeal coughed and blushed those sheep were a damnfool thing to do theres no market not with whitefell just south of us with furlongs of meadow good for nothing but sheep but dammit the old man goes on and on about it until im about ready to bash him with a damned candlestick i am not going to give in to him we arent losing money we just arent making as much and if i give in to him on the sheep hell expect me to give in to him on the stud vanyel groaned lady bless the two of you are stubborn enough to make an angel swear look if i manage to get him to agree on the stud will you please agree to clear out the damned sheep bright havens cant one of you show a little sense in the interests of peace and compromise mekeal glowered and mekeal grumbled but in the end on the way back to the keep mekeal grudgingly agreed the silken voice stopped vanyel halfway between the keep and the stables dimming the bright autumn sunlight and casting a pall on the sweetness of the late morning sky goodmorning herald vanyel the slight hesitation before the second word called pointed attention to the fact that it lacked little more than a candlemark till noon the cool tone made it clear that father leren did not approve of vanyels implied sloth vanyel paused on the graveled path turned and inclined his head very slightly in the priests direction good afternoon father leren he replied without so much as an eyebrow twitching the priest emerged from the deeply recessed doorway of the keeps miniature temple a faithful graygranite replica of the great temple at haven leren had persuaded withen to build it shortly after his arrival as ashkevron priest on the grounds that the chapel deep within the keep itself couldnt possibly hold the family and all of the relatives on holy days it had been a reasonable request although the old priest had managed by holding services in shifts the way meals were served in the great hall vanyel alone had resented it the little gray temple had always seemed far too confining stifling for all that it was five times the size of the chapel the homely woodpaneled chapel made the gods seem closer somehow forgiving rather than forbidding he had hated the temple from the moment hed first stepped into it at the age of five and from that moment on had refused to enter it again in fact vanyel wasnt entirely certain that leren had ever even set foot in the old chapelwhich was why as a boy he had accomplished his own worship there i have seen very little of you my son came the cool words the priests lean dusky face beneath his slate gray cowl was as expressionless as vanyels own vanyel shrugged shifted his weight to one foot and folded his arms across his chest if he wants to play wordgames im not surprised sir he replied with detached civility i have spent very little time outside of my room ive been using this time alone to catch up on a years worth of lost sleep leren allowed one black eyebrow to rise sardonically indeed alone his expression was not quite a sneer oh what the hell in for a sheep vanyel went into a fullscale imitation of the most languid fop at haven the man in question wasnt inclined to shayachern as it happened rumor had it he played the effeminate to irritate not vanyel but certain of his colleagues and he also happened to be one of the finest swordsmen outside of the circle or the guard following that sterling example vanyel set out to be very irritating quite alone sad to say he pouted but then again i am here for a rest and company would hardly be rested the priest retreated a step surprise flashing across his face before he shuttered his expression indeed and yet i am told young medren spends an inordinate amount of time in your rooms his tone insinuated what he did notquitedare say i wont take that from father you snake im damned if ill take that from you vanyel transformed the snarl he wanted to sport into an even more petulant pout oh medren im teaching him music he is a sweet child dont you think but still a child not company i prefer my companions to be somewhat older he took a single slow step toward the priest and twitched his hip ever so slightly adult and able to hold an adult conversation to have adultinterests he took another step and the priest fell back a vague alarm in his eyes more masterly commanding he tilted his head to one side and regarded the priest thoughtfully for a moment the alarm was turning to shock and panic now someone like you dear leren the priest squawked something inarticulate about vessels needing consecrating and groped behind him for the handle of the open temple door within a heartbeat he was through it and had the graypainted door shut tightly behind him vanyel grinned tucked his head down to hide his expression and continued on toward the stables and yfandes meke is there going to be a harvest fair this year he asked brushing yfandes with vigor as she leaned into the brush strokes and all but purred mekeal did not look up from wrapping the ankles of one of his personal hunters uh huh he grunted should be near twice as big as the ones you knew got merchants already down at fair field already this was more than hed dared hope why liss an her company dolt meke finished wrapping the off hind ankle and straightened with another grunt this time of satisfaction got soldiers out here with pay burnin their pockets oif and nothin to spend it on therere only two ladies down at forst reach village that peddle their assets and three over to greenbriars and its top far to walk except on leavedays anyway so they sit in camp and drink issuebeer and gripe can you see a merchant allowin a situation like that to go unrelieved theres a good girl he said to the mare patting her ample rump well be off in a bit keep brushing you can talk and brush at the same time vanyel resumed the steady strokes of the brush working his way down yfandes flank would there be any instrument makers do you think forst reach collected a peddling fee from every merchant setting his wagon up at the two fairs spring and harvest withen found that particular task rather tedious and vanyel hoped now hed entrusted it to mekeal meke sucked on his lip his hand still on the mares shoulder now that i think of it theres one down there already dont think well likely get more than one why something i have in mind he replied vaguely and to yfandes ladymylove do you think i can interest you in a little trip she sighed so long as its a little trip this soft life is spoiling you mmh she agreed blinking lazily at him i like being spoiled i could get used to it very quickly he chuckled and went to get her gear before vanyel even found someone who knew which end of fair field the luthier was parked in he had picked up half a dozen trifles for shavri and jisa he paused in the act of paying for a jumping jack struck by the fact that they were so uppermost in his mind what has gotten into me he wondered i havent thought about them for a year and now well i havent seen them for a year thats all and if i can give shavri a moment of respite from her worry he pocketed the toy and headed for the grove of trees at the northern end of the field he spotted the faded red wagon at once there was an old man seated on the back steps of it bent over something in his hands shavri bent over a broken doll some child in the house of healing had brought to her looking up at me with a face wet with tears me standing there like an idiot then finally getting the wits to ask her what was wrong cant bear it van i cant van i want a baby he shoved the memory away hastily excuse me vanyel said after waiting for the carver perched on the back steps of his scarlet traveling wagon part workshop part display and part home to finish the wild rose he was carving from a bit of goldenoak he still hesitated to break the old mans concentration in the middle of such a delicate piece of work but there wasnt much left of the afternoon if he was going to find the purported luthier but the snowpated craftsmans concentration had evidently weathered worse than vanyels gentle interruption aye he replied knobby fingers continuing to shape the delicate goldsheened petals im looking for master dawson youre looking at him laddybuck now the oldster put down his knife brushed the shavings from his leather apron and looked up at vanyel his expression was friendly in a shortsighted preoccupied way his face round with cloudy graygreen eyes i understand you have musical instruments for sale the carvers interest sharpened and his eyes grew less vague aye he said standing and pulling his apron over his head there were a few shavings sticking to the linen of his buff shirt and breeches and he picked at them absently but in good conscience i cant offer em before fairtime milord not without ashkevron permission any rate vanyel smiled feeling as shy as a child and tilted his head to one side well im an ashkevron would it be permissible if i made it right with my father the old man looked him over very carefully aye he said after so long a time vanyel felt as if he was being given some kind of test aye i think twould come in the wagon eh half a candlemark later with the afternoon sun shining into the crowded wagon and making every varnished surface glow vanyel sighed with disappointment im sorry master dawson none of these lutes will do he picked one at random off the rack along the wall of the wagon interior and plucked a string gently it resonated but not enough he put it back and locked the clamp that held it in place in the rack please dont mistake my meaning theyre beautiful instruments and the carving is fine but theyre theyre students lutes theyre all alike they have no voice of their own i was hoping for something a little less ordinary he shrugged hoping the man wouldnt become angered strangely enough dawson didnt he looked thoughtful instead his face crossed by a fine net of wrinkles when he knitted his brows huh well you surprise me young milord what did you say your name was vanyel blushed at his own poor manners i didnt im sorry vanyel vanyel that vanyel ashkevron my holy stars the herald the luthier exclaimed his eyes going dark and round herald vanyel the shadow stalker demonsbane the hero of stony tor yes vanyel said wearily sagging against the mans bunk that was on the wall opposite the rack of instruments the instrument makers reaction started a headache right behind his eyes he dropped his head and rubbed his forehead with one hand please i really get tired of that he felt a hard callused hand patting his shoulder and he looked up in surprise into a pair of very sympathetic and kindly eyes i magine you do lad the old man said with gruff understanding sorry to go all goosegirl on you just person dont meet somebody folks sing about every day an he sure dont expect to have a hero come strollin up to him at a border harvest fair now you be vanyel i be rolf and youll have a bit of my beer before i send you on your way hey vanyel found himself smiling gladly rolf he started to pick his way across the wagon to the door at the rear but the man stopped him with a wave of his hand not just yet laddybuck as i was startin to tell you i got a few pieces i dont put out keep em for bards and i got a few more i dont even show to just any bard but bein as you are who you are an since they say you got a right fine hand with an instrument he opened up a hatch in the floor of the crowded wagon and began pulling out instruments packed in beautifully wrought padded leather traveling bags two lutes a harp and three instruments vaguely gitternshaped butmuch larger rolf began stripping the cases from his treasures with swift and practiced hands and vanyel knew that he had found what he was looking for the luteswhich were the first cases he openedbore the same relationship to the instruments on the wall as a printed broadside page bears to an elegant and masterfully calligraphed and ornamented proclamation he took the first of a dark wood that glowed deep red where the light from the open door struck it tightened a string and sounded a note listening to the resonances for you or for someone else someone else he said listening to the note gently die away in the heart of the lute high voice or low high now but i think he may turn out to be a baritone when his voice changes hes my nephew hes gifted and he is going to be a fine bard one day try the other that one is fine for a voice that dont need any help its loud as lutes go and all the harmonics are low the others better for a young voice got harmonics up and down and a nice easy action that one hed have to grow into the otherll grow with him vanyel looked up in surprise at the old man rolf gave him a halfsmile a good craftsman knows how his work fits in the world he said i got no voice but i got the ear truth is the ear is harder to find than the voice though i doubt youd find a bard whod agree vanyel nodded and picked up the second lute this one of wood the gold of raival leaves in autumn he tightened a string and sounded it the note throbbed through the wagon achingly true he tried the action on the neck easy but not mushy you were right he said holding the chosen instrument out to the luthier ill take it no haggling he looked wistfully over at the other and if i didnt already have a lute i love like an old friend rolf waggled his bushy eyebrows and grinned as he took the golden lute from vanyel and began carefully replacing it in its bag care to try a friend of a new breed he nodded at the gitternshaped objects well what are those things something new been trying gitterns with metal strings stead of gut you tell me how it came out he laid the chosen lute carefully down on his bunk and stripped the case from the first of the gitterns i keep em tuned this one is a fair bitch to demonstrate if i dont hoping to get to haven one day show em to the collegium bards great good gods vanyels jaw dropped twelve strings i should say fingers like a gittern that ones like it the other has six use metal harpstrings vanyel took it carefully and struck a chord it rang like a bell sang like an angel in flight and hung in the air forever pulsing to the beat of his heart he closed his eyes as it died away lost in the sound and when he opened them he saw rolf grinning at him like a fiend you he said sternly are a terrible man rolf dawson oh i know the old man chortled it dont hurt that the inside of this wagons tuned too thats one reason why them student lutes sound as good as they do but that ladyll sound good in a privy well i hope youre prepared to work your fingers to the bone vanyel replied snatching up the leather case and carefully encasing his gittern because when i take her back to haven and bard breda hears her she will send packs of dogs out to find you and bring you there rolf chuckled even harder why dyou think i pulled her out and had you try her youre going to do half my work for me herald vanyel with you tspeak for me an that lady i wont spend three four fortnights coolin my heels with the other luthiers waitin my turn to see a collegium bard vanyel had to chuckle himself you are a very terrible man now you might as well tell me the worst which is he felt a twinge for his oncefull purse well what else did he have to spend money on how much i owe you vanyel shut the door to his room behind him and set his back against it breathing the first easy breath hed taken since he left his chamber this morning gods he gasped sanctuary at last hello medren oh you brought winethank you i need it badly the boy looked up from tuning the new strings on his new lute giving it to him had given vanyel one of the few moments of unsullied joy hed had lately a reaction worth ten times what vanyel had paid medren grinned mother that was this morning vanyel replied pushing away from the door heading for the table beside the window seat and the cool flask of wine medren had brought i swear she chased me all over the keep with stars in her eyes and the hunt in her blood poor melenna gods shes driving me insane but i cant bring myself to hurt her ive been the cause of so much hurt i cant bear any more and lust in her medren vanyel interrupted thats your mother youre slandering heart the boy finished smoothly what did you do i took a bath vanyel replied puckishly i took a very long bath when i finally came out shed given up so who was chasing you this time if it wasnt mother lord withen on the great sheep debate meke wants to keep the sheep on long meadow until spring shearing father wants yearling cattle back there immediately if not sooner vanyel groaned and held both hands to his head if it wasnt for the fact that once this door is shut they leave me alonegods the border was more peaceful water droplets beaded the side of the flask and ran down the sides as vanyel picked it up whoever gets you as protege will bless you for your thoughtfulness lad he poured himself a goblet of wine and took it with him to sip while he stood over medren at the window seat no breath of air stirred without or within and even the birds seemed to have gone into sunwarmed naps that instrument still as much to your liking medren nodded emphatically if with a somewhat preoccupied expression he was tuning the last string a frown of concentration making his young face look adult vanyel warmed inside as he picked up his own lute it takes so little to make the child so happy and gods the talent well then he said laying a hand on the boys shoulder ready for your les the boy winced away from the light touch on his shoulder not in emotional reaction but in physical pain vanyel snatched his hand away as if it had been a redhot iron hed inadvertently set on the bare skin of the boys back medren what did i its all right the boy said and shruggedwhich called up another grimace of pain justold jervis reckoned we all ought to see how you could trick somebody into dropping his shield and then come in overhand guess who got to be the victim his tone was so bitter vanyel could taste it in the back of his own mouth like always the blur of the blade coming for him always coming for him the weight of the shield on his arm getting heavier by the moment the shock of each blow that he couldnt dodge shock first and then pain breath burning in lungs side aching with bruises cramps knotting his calves stumbling backward head reeling vision clouding van cold sweat down his back and the taste of blood in his mouth bitter absolute humiliation metallic taste of hate and fear hey vanyelare you all right vanyel shook his head to clear it and locked down his own agitation as best he could but the memories were crowding in on him so vividly he was almost reliving that moment so many years ago when jervis finally got him in a corner he couldnt escape im all right his left arm began to ache and he massaged the arm and wrist reflexively it still aches after all these years i still have numb fingers oh gods not medren we could skip the lesson he began with carefully suppressed emotion no medren exclaimed clutching the lute to his chest and jumping to his feet no its nothing really im fine if youre sure vanyel said wondering how much of that was bravado on the boys part im sure i got some horseliniment id have rubbed it on right after but i didnt want to stink up your room the boy grinned halfheartedly and sat down again his eyes anxious ive got something better than that if you arent afraid ill seduce you the boy made an impudent face at him you had your chance vanyel whats this stuff you got i dont mind telling you my shoulder hurts like blazes willow and wormwood in ointment with mint to make it smell reasonable i always have some he put his lute down and leaned over to rummage in the chest at the foot of his bed im one of those people who bruise just thinking about it get your shirt off would you when he turned around with the little jar in his hand the boy had stripped to the waist revealing a nasty bruise the size of his hand spreading all over the left shoulder it was an ugly thing purple the next thing to black in the center bluegray and red mottled through it crack like lightning striking as the shield split sudden darkness dizziness waking to lissas anxious face and a pain in his left arm that sent the blackness to take him again good gods medren shrugged with one shoulder i bruise that way looks worse than it is i guess young mekeal took one just as hard and you cant hardly see a mark on him he looked longingly at the pot of salve vanyel you going to stand there and stare all day or use that stuff im sorry medren he shook off his shock got several fingersful of the ointment and began to massage it as gently as possible into the bruised area working his way from the edges inward the boy hissed with pain at first then gradually relaxed vanyel on the other hand was profoundly disturbed and growing tenser by the moment his own shoulder muscles knotting up like snarled harpstrings gods what can i do damned if ill let jervis ruin medren the way he ruined me but how if i force a confrontation hell only take it out on medren if i take him on myself gods i do not trust my temper not with that old bastard not with the hairtrigger ive got right now hed make one wrong move or say something at the wrong time and id kill him before i could stop myself what can i do what can i do lady bright the boy sighed i feel like i got a shoulder again instead of a piece of pounded meat medren is there any way you can avoid practices until youre safely out of here vanyel asked medren considered a moment now and again he said slowly not on a regular basis are you sure vanyel pursued urgently isnt there any place you can hide not since they opened up the back of the library anyplace i go theyll find me eventually isnt there anything you can do vanyel shook his head with bitter regret i wish there were i cant think of anything at the moment ill work on it if theres a way out for you ill find it look avoid him as much as you can try and stay out of his lineofsight when you cant avoid the practices if he doesnt actually see you in front of him sometimes you can manage to keep from becoming his target for the day medren sighed and shrugged his shirt back on all right if thats all i can do thats all i can do he twisted his head around and gave vanyel a slightly pained grin at least you believe me you even sound like you know what im going through vanyel stared at the wall but what he was seeing was not wood panels but a thin undersized boy being used as an object upon which a surly ex mercenary could vent his spleen i do medren he replied slowly a cold lump settling just under his heart believe me i do vanyel was more than happy to see his aunt savils serene beaky face again and was glad hed decided to ride out and meet her it was a lot easier to tell her what had been going on without wondering who was going to overhear so thats the state of things vanyel concluded yfandes matching her pace to savils taller companion the only real problemsother than the fact that lineas and baires could go for each others throats any day is medren melenna i can avoid the great sheep debate is going to go on until the sheep are gone from long meadow father seems to have accepted mekes breeding program although hes got his agent out looking for an alternative to that awful stud meke bought but medren savil i know what youre thinking youre thinking im overreacting to seeing another lad in the same position i was in you didnt see that monster bruise he showed up with hes not getting lovepats that bruise was the size of my spread hand fingertip to thumbtip easily huh savil replied frowning in thought and to make it worse meke told me jervis wants to i quotego a few rounds with me to spar vanyel snorted spar indeed itll be a cold day she nodded probably a damned good idea to avoid him hell push you van hell push you all he can and ive just spent the last year on the border exactly if he pushed you too far well you know that better than me kellan can you and fandes kindly wait until youre loose for the chatter and gossip were trying to have a serious briefing here vanyel chuckled trading stories about the muscular young courier types shut up and ride vanyel caught savils eye and they exchanged a look full of irony i can see she said aloud that this is going to be a verylivelyvisit six the argument had been in full flower since vanyel had arrived at the stable and from all that he could tell it had evidently begun well fertilized with invective long before then the stable was a good fifty paces from the keep itself but the voices reached with unmistakable clarity well beyond the stable the stablehands were doing their best to pretend they werent listening but vanyel could all but see their ears stretching to catch the next interchange havens savil has a strong set of lungs now listen you stubborn old goat stubborn the indignation in withens voice was thick enough to plow youre calling me stubborn savil thats pot calling kettle if i ever and provincial hidebound and muddle headed to boot vanyel smothered a grin and kept the movement of the brush steady along yfandes glossy flank she sighed with contentment and leaned into each stroke feel good wonderful all companions should choose musicians you have such talented hands speaking of which she flicked an ear at the open window through which savil and withens argument was coming so very clearly music to my ears if hes yelling at aunt savil he cant be yelling at me youre looking better those hollows behind your withers are gone and your coat is much healthier he paused for a moment to admire the shine im recovering faster than you are she swung her head around to fix him with a critical blue eye are you getting enough sleep if i slept any longer id wake up with headaches he turned his mental focus up toward that open window avoiding any more of yfandes questions the fact was he didnt know why he was still sleeping so long and tiring so easily he always felt hollow somehow as if there were an enormous empty place inside him that he couldnt fill but he had recovered enough that all the problems major and minor were starting to make him feel restless because he couldnt do anything about them other problems were starting to eat at him too shavri i like hertoo much gods i must think about her and jisa every night i loved lendel i know i loved him but have i let shavri get into me deeper than id thought gods shes randis lifebonded he must be my best friend in the world next to savil shes one of my best friends how can i even be thinking this gods gods am i really even shaych or am i something else the question ate at him more than he cared to admit am i avoiding melenna because im shaych or because i hate to be hunted he shied away from the uncomfortable thoughts and sent out a thin questing thoughttendril toward savil what can i do for you demonchild came her prompt reply just wondering if you needed rescuing the answer came back laughtertinged havens no im enjoying this one im opening your fathers eyes to politics and policies under randale elspeth was always conservative and got more so as she grew older randale is her opposite this is coming as quite a shock to withen vanyel fought down another grin whats he up in arms about now the mandatory education law randale and the council just passed remind me im behind every child in valdemar is to be taught simple reading writing and arithmetic in the temples from now on every child not just the highborn or the few the priests single out as having vocations or being exceptional morning classes in the winter from harvest end to first planting and its the duty of the lord holders to see that they get it vanyel blinked oh my i can see where he wouldnt be pleased i know where randales coming from on this one though he talked it over with me often enough i just didn t know hed managed to get it past the council intact enlighten me i need ammunition he believes that an informed populace is more apt to trust its leaders than an ignorant populace assuming that they feel the leaders are worthy of trust that isnt much of a problem in valdemar savil replied thanks be to the gods well the only way to have an informed populace is to educate them so they dont have to rely on rumors so theyre willing to wait for the official written word it was the nearpanic when elspeth died that decided him i didnt know that good points kechara young as he is our randale can be brilliant at times as soon as your father pauses for breath now see here you old boneheaded windbag do you want those farmers of yours to be the prey of every scoundrel with a likely rumor under his hat savil had the bit in her teeth and she was off again vanyel gave up trying to control himself and leaned all his weight against yfandes laughing silently until his eyes teared this is ridiculous vanyel thought irritably pausing for a moment on the narrow staircase absolutely ridiculous why should i have to act as though i was sneaking through enemyheld territory just to get to my own bed every night he took the last flight of back stairs to the fourth floor poorly lit as they were with not so much as the betraying squeak of a stair tread he flattened himself against the wall at the top and probed cautiously ahead no melenna so far so good his right eye stung and watered and he rubbed at it with one knuckle his eyelids were sore and felt puffy i should have gotten to bed candlemarks ago except every time i tried melenna was lurking around a corner to waylay me i hope shes given up by now he peered down the dark corridor one more time before venturing out into it this was the servants floor and if she were still awake and hoping to ambush him melenna wouldnt think to look for him up here he counted the doorsthe fifth on the right opened not into a room but into a tiny spiral staircase that only went as far as the third floor he probed again delicately nothing in the staircase or at the foot of it the stair was of cast iron and in none too good repair he clung to the railing gritted his teeth and moved a fingerlength at a time to keep it from rattling the journey through the stuffy darkness seemed to take all night then his foot encountered wood instead of metal and he slipped off the staircase and groped for the door he put one hand flat against the wooden panel and concentrated on what lay beyond it this stair let out only two doors from his own room and if melenna were waiting shed be in the corridor politeness and heraldic constraints forebade mindsearching for her even if he had the energy to spare which he didnt he had been chagrined to discover and anyway the nongifted were always harder to locate by mindsearch than the gifted im getting very tired of this i dont want to set mother off and i dont really want to hurt melenna but if this catandmouse game keeps on much longer i may have to do just that i tell her no politely and she doesnt believe it i avoid her and she just gets more persistent i almost killed her two days ago when she popped out of hiding at me he leaned his forehead against the door for a moment and closed his aching eyes im about at my wits end with that woman damn it all shes old enough to know better i dont want to hurt her i dont even want to embarrass her well there was no sign of her in the corridor he relaxed a little and stepped out onto the highly polished wood of the hall of the guest rooms where the brighter lighting made his smarting eyes blink and water for a moment he opened the door to his own room and froze hand still on the icy metal of the doorhandle candles burned in the sconces built into the headboard melenna smiled coyly at him from the middle of his bed she allowed the sheet to slide from her shoulders as she sat up proving that she hadnt so much as a single thread to grace her body vanyel counted to ten then ten again melennas smile faltered and faded she tossed her hair over one shoulder and began to pout vanyel snatched his cloak from the peg beside the door turned on his heel without a single word and left slamming the door behind him hard enough to send echoes bouncing up and down the corridor fandes beloved he mindsent so angry he was having trouble staying coherent i hope you dont mind sharing sleepingspace straw was not the most comfortable of beds although hed had worse and hed spent nights with his head pillowed on yfandes shoulder before this but day for the occupants of the stable began long before hed been getting up the stablehands had no reason to be quiet and neither did the horses mekes famous stud was the worst offender he began cowkicking the side of his stall monotonously from the moment color touched the east stupid brute thinks that if he keeps kicking somebody will come to let him out came yfandes sleepy thought i usually move out under a tree about now vanyel raised his head and yawned hed gotten some sleep but not nearly as much as he would have liked you move i think ill go back to my room if melenna hasnt taken herself off to her own room by now i swear ill throw her out maybe a dose of humiliation will convince her to leave me alone sounds as good a plan as any yfandes waited for him to move out of the way then got herself to her feet and nudged open the outside door vanyel stood up shoulders aching from the strange position hed slept in and brushed bits of straw off his clothing he ignored the startled glances of the stablehands picked up his cloak and shook it out as yfandes ambled out into her meadow go get some more sleep dearheart she mindsent back toward him iii try he replied smoldering maybe ill bring my sleeping roll down here maybe when word gets around that im sleeping with horses shell stop this nonsense and if shes stupid enough to try and waylay you down here ill chase her around the meadow a few times to teach her better manners yfandes sent irritation of her own coloring her thoughts a sullen red this is getting exasperating i dont care if she thinks shes in love with you that doesnt excuse imbecilic behavior vanyel didnt reply he was too close to temper that could do the woman serious damage he folded his cloak tidily over his arm pretending he didnt notice the whispers of the stablehands as he let himself out of the stall and shut the door behind him there was a problem with my bed last night he told tarn the chief stableman and withens most trusted trainer tarn was no fool and hed been quietly on vanyels side since van was old enough to ride he was one of the few at forst reach who hadnt changed his behavior toward vanyel when the nature of vanyels relationship with tylendel became known at the holding since his wife was one of the cooks he was quite conversant with house gossip he smiled slowly showing the gap where hed had three teeth kicked out aye milord van i ken theres some invites a body wish t give hisself van winced inwardly a little knowing that this was going to do melennas reputation no good at all once this tale got around the keep the stablehands went back to their chores and he wound his way past them out into the yard between the outbuildings and the keep he blinked at the sunlight seeing just one other person a vague unidentifiable shadow in the door of the armory vanyel called a raspy fartoofamiliar voice a word with you jervis the armsmaster moved out past the door of the armory to stand directly in his path and vanyel felt his stomach start to churn in no way could he successfully avoid a confrontation this time jervis was between him and the keep yes armsmaster he said i left you messages meke told me hed passed them on jervis moved closer a frown making his seamed and craggy face more forbidding than usual vanyel kept his own feelings behind an expressionless mask that you wanted to spar yes i know he did tell me id rather not thank you why not frankly because i dont feel up to it vanyel replied with cool neutrality though his back was clammy with nervous sweat because i know damned well it wont stay polite exercise for long because i know youre going to push me just as far as you can armsmaster im going to have to hurt you and dammit i dont want to let you do that to me whats that supposed to mean jervis growled his face darkening you think this old man isnt good enough for you im worn out for one thing i just spent the night in the stable because there was an unwelcome visitor in my room thats not my bed of choice and mekes damned stud makes more noise than a herd of mules for another jervis ive been on a battleline for the last year youwere a mercenary what does that tell you i dont want to inflict more pain when i dont have to and im on a hairtrigger gods think about this you old bastard remember what it was like how some things became reflex no matter how hard you tried to control them jervis narrowed his eyes you look in good enough shape to me theres nothing you can do young vanyel that i cant handle unless youre really no better than say young medren no matter what all those songs say about you the reminder of the treatment medren was receiving at jervis hands was the spark to the tinder vanyels temper finally snapped on your head be it he growled i take no responsibility you want to spar so badly all right lets get it over with he stalked off toward the armory a sturdy wooden building between the stables and the keep with jervis at his heels he had a set of practice gear here made up soon after he returned from ktreva gear put together at withens insistence and unused until now it was gear unlike any other set at forst reach light padded leather gambeson arm thigh and shin guards main gauche and heavy rapier and a very light helm all suited to his light frame and strikeandrun style the armory was not dark there were clerestory windows glazed with bubbly thick thirdrate glass stuff that wouldnt admit a view just light vanyel found the storage chest with his name on it he pulled his gear out and stripped off yesterdays tunic pulling on the soft thick linen practice tunic strapping on the gambeson and guards and gathering up his helm and weighted wooden practice blades this armory was new built since vanyel had left home there was enough room for sparring inside most of the interior had been set up as a salle vanyel was just as pleased to see that the older building had been so small that all practices had to be held outside so far as vanyel was concerned the fewer eyes there were to witness the confrontation the better hed like it he was shaking and sick inside he was going to give jervis a lesson the old man would never forget and the very idea made his gut knot he was not proud of what he was going to do but the old man asked for it he wouldnt take no and he wouldnt back down dammit its going to be his fault not mine van dwelled on that while he armed up a sullen anger making him feel justified and burning the knots out of his gut with selfrighteousness and a growing elation that he was finally going to pay jervis back for every bruise and broken bone until he realized where that train of thought was leading him im rationalizing the fact that i want to beat him bloody that i want revenge on him oh gods the realization made him sick again he went to the center of the practice area crossing the unvarnished wooden floor with no more noise than a cat jervis looked around after donning his own gear much heavier than vanyels as if he had actually expected van to have slipped out while he was arming he seemed surprised to see vanyel standing on the challengers side waiting for him iii let him make the first move van thought keeping himself under tight control hes probably going to give me a full rush and i wouldnt be surprised if he tried to hurt me damned bully but i will not lose my temper i cant stop my reflexes but i can keep my temper i will not let him do that to me but jervis astonished him by simply walking up to his side of the line giving a curt salute that vanyel returned and waiting in a deceptively lazy guard position dust tickled vanyels nose and somewhere in the building a cricket was chirping well do something damn you he thought in frustration as the moments continued to pass and jervis did nothing but stand in the guard position finally the waiting was too much for his nerves he rushed jervis but he pulled up short at the last second so that the armsmaster was tricked into overextending there was a brief flurry of blows and with a neat twist of his wrists vanyel bound jerviss blade and sent it flying out of his hands to land with a noisy clatter on the floor to vanyels left now it comes vanyel braced himself for an explosion of temper but it didnt no growl of rage no snatching off of helm and spitting of curses jervis just stood shield balanced easily on left arm glaring vanyel could feel his eyes scorching him from within the dark slit of his helm for several heartbeats while vanyels uneasiness grew and his blood pounded in his ears with the effort of holding himself in check finally the armsmaster moved only to fetch the blade return to his former position and wait for vanyel to make another attack vanyel circled to jervis right bouncing a little on his toes waiting for a moment when he could get past that shield or around it sweat began running down his back and sides and only the scarf around his head under his helm kept it out of his eyes he licked his lips and tasted salt his concentration narrowed until all he was aware of was the sound of his own breathing and the opponent in front of him jervis returned his feints his blows sometimes successfully sometimes not vanyel scored on him far more often than vice versa but every time he made a successful pass jervis would back out of reach for a moment it was maddening and inexplicable hed just fall completely out of fighting stance shuffle and glare and mutter to himself before returning to the line and mixing in again this little series of performances began to wear on vanyels nerves it was far too like the stalking he used to get when jervis wanted to beat him to a pulp and didnt quite dare and at the same time it was totally unlike anything in the old mans usual pattern whats he doing whats he waiting for those arent any lovetaps hes been giving me but it isnt what i know hes capable of either finally when he was completely unnerved jervis made the move hed been expecting all along an allout rush at fullstrength and fullforce the kind that had bowled him over time after time as a youngster the kind that had ended with his broken arm blade a blur beside jervis shield and the shield itself coming at him with the speed of a charging bull the horrible crack as his shield split the pain as the arm beneath it snapped like a green branch but he wasnt an adolescent he was a battle seasoned veteran his bootsoles scuffed on the sanded wood as he bounced himself out of range and back in again he engaged and used the speed of jervis second rush to spin himself out of the way and delivered a good hard stab to jervis side with the main gauche as the man passed him or meant to deliver it for all his bulk jervis could move as quickly as a striking snake he somehow got his shield around in time to deflect the blow and then continued into a strike with the shieldedge at vanyels face vanyel spun out of the way and let the movement carry him out of sword range but now his temper was gone completely shattered damn you you bullying bastard preach about honor and then turn a shield bash on me will you his voice cracked with nerves come on try again try and take me im not a child armsmaster jervis im not as easy to knock down and beat up anymore you cant make a fool and a target of me the way you do with medren i know what im doing damn you and my style is a match for yours on any damned field jervis pulled off his battered helm with his shield hand and sweat darkened tendrils of gray blond hair fell into his eyes thats enough he said ive seen what i wanted t see seems those songs got a grain of truth in em vanyel choked his temper down i trust you wont require any more sparring sessions armsmaster jervis gave him another long measuring look i didnt say that ill be wantin t practice with you again master vanyel and he turned on his heel and left vanyel standing in the middle of the salle entirely uncertain of who had won what have we got a truce have we or is this another kind of war my shadowlover bear me into light vanyel sang softly as the odd minor chords blended one into another each leaving a ghost of itself hanging in the air for the next to build from this new gittern did things to this particular song that carried it beyond the poignant into the unearthly he paused a moment brushed the last chording in a slow arpeggio and finally opened his eyes medren sat on the edge of the bed his mouth open in a soundless o vanyel shook off the melancholy of the song with an effort how long have you been there he asked racking the gittern on its stand and uncoiling from his window seat most of the song medren shivered thats the weirdest love song i ever heard how come i never heard it before because treesa doesnt like it vanyel replied wryly stretching his fingers carefully it reminds her that shes mortal he saw the incomprehension on medrens face and elaborated the lover in the song is death medren death as the boy gulped a lover the stricken look on the boys face recalled him to the present and he chuckled oh dont look that way lad im in no danger of throwing myself off a cliff i have too much to do to go courting the shadowlover the boys face aged thirty years for a moment but if he came courting you id take his kiss of peace only too readily vanyel thought sometimes im so damned tired he thought that but smiled and said he courts me every day im a herald nephew but he hasnt won me yet what brings you here oh medren looked down at his hands jervis some of the other kids they told me hes got something special going today for me vanyel thought of the sparring session and went cold and a seed of an idea finally sprouted and flowered he stood and walked slowly to the bed to put his hand lightly on medrens shoulder medren would you rather deal with jervis or be sick what the boy looked up at him with the same incomprehension in his eyes hed shown when vanyel had spoken of the shadowlover i have just enough of the healinggift that i can make you sick that wasnt exactly what he would do but it was close enough then i can keep you sick too sick to go to practice anyway there was measles in the nursery that would keep the boy down for a good long time will i lose my voice the boy looked up at him with the same complete trust jisa had and that shook him he grinned to cover it no youll just come out in spots like brendan in fact i want you to sneak into the nursery and spend a candlemark with brendan when i m done with you as much as im going to depress his body if he isnt fevered by nightfall ill eat my lute make sure nobody sees you and go straight to your mother after and tell her you have a headache as long as i wont lose my voice medren said grinning i think i can take spots and itching it wont be fun its better than being beat on all right vanyel put his hand on medrens shoulders and focused down and out funny about medren radevel said coming down with spots so suddenlike i wouldve sworn he had em once already vanyel just shrugged he was in radevels room following another sparring session this time one in which he sparred with rad under jervis eye it had been easier to deal with than the last one but jervis was still acting out of character we have a truce of sorts i dont know why but i wont take the chance that it will extend to cover medren i darent radevel had invited him here afterward in a burst of hearty comradeship and vanyel had decided to take him up on it over the past hour hed come to discover he liked this good natured cousin more than hed ever dreamed mother funny thing i cant figure radevel continued feet propped up on a battered old table mug of watered wine in hand old leren saw him watching you an jervis an me at practice this afternoon an if looks were arrows youd be a damned pincushion what in hell did you ever do to him vanyel shrugged took a long drink of the cool wine and turned his attention back to repairing his torn leather gambeson with needle and fine waxed thread in a neat precise row of carefully placed stitches the past four years had seen him out more often than not beyond the reach of the havenbred comforts and the servants that saw to the needs of heralds hed gotten into the habit of repairing things himself and around radevel that habit which radevel shared made itself evident at the smallest excuse dont know he said shortly never did i would almost be willing to pledge to you that hes hated me from the moment he came here mother swears its because i asked too many questions but i thought priests were supposed to encourage questions our old priest did i may have been only four when he died but i remember that radevel nodded agreement aye i remember that too jervis always said that osen was a good man made you feel like taking things to him somehow the gods gave you a brain boy hed say if you want to honor them use it never made you feel like you were beneath him he brooded over his mug his plain face quiet with thought this leren now huh i dunno van you know i stopped going to holydays here a long time ago hike down into the village with jervis when we feel like we need a dose of priesttalk tell you something else young father heward down in the village dont care much for leren either he did his best not to let on but he was downright gleeful to see us come marching down to the village temple an i know he dont care much for fighters being a peacepreacher figure that i cant vanyel replied he felt savils distinct presence coming up to the door of radevels room so he didnt jump when she spoke is this a roosters only discussion or can an old hen join vanyel did not bother to turn around radevel grinned past vanyels shoulder at savil and reached without needing to look into the cupboard over his head for another mug i dunno he mused old hens welcome but old bats give me that you shameless reprobate she mocksnarled snatching the clean mug out of his hand and pouring herself wine from the jug she tasted it and made a face gods whats that made of old socks standard mere ration milady herald maam an watered down too grows on you though got into liking it cause of jervis huh grows on you like footrot vanyel stuck the needle under a line of stitches and moved over to make room for her she sat down beside him careful to avoid unbalancing the bench she sipped again youre right second taste has merit unless its just that the first swallow ate the skin off my tongue what was all this about leren radevel said he was watching me and rad spar with jervis this afternoon vanyel supplied frowning at his work the leather was scraped thin here and likely to tear again if he wasnt careful where he placed his stitches to be precise he was watching herald van here like he was hoping me or jervis would slip up like and break his neck for him radevel said ill tell you again i do not like that man priest or no priest makes my skin fair crawl with some of those looks he gives ive noticed savil said soberly i dont like him either and damned if i know why radevel held up one hand in a gesture of helplessness i spent more time around him than either of you and i just cant put a finger on it treesa doesnt like him either only reason she goes to holyday services is cause she reckons herself right pious and facing hims bettern not going but if she had her druthers hed be away and gone its about the one thing i agree with that featherhead on pardon van mother is a featherhead i wont argue there but savil did you realize that shes very slightly sensitive not thoughtsensing not empathy but like to it something else some kind of sensitivity we havent identified yet the gods only know what it is i havent got it nor have you but its a sensitivity she shares with yfandes treesa sensitive like a companion savil gave him a look of complete incredulity be damned i never thought to test her he nodded the channels in fandes wide open the same channel treesa has only hers is to fandes the way a melting icicle is to a waterfall i dont know what it is but id say we shouldnt discount feelings of unease just because treesa shares them she could very truly be feeling something huh radevel said after a moment then he grinned i got a homely plain mans notion that mare of yours ever dropped a foal why yes now that you mention it two a colt and a fillyboth before she chose me dancer and megwyn why just that about every mother i ever saw human to hound knew damned well when somebody had bad feelings toward her children no matter how much that somebody tried to make out like it wasnt true even milady treesa he grinned as vanyels jaw fell and savils expression mirrored his now savil you never had children and itd take a miracle from the twain themselves to make van a momma so no what you call channel make sense damned good sense cousin vanyel managed to get out around his astonishment for somebody who has no magic of his own you have an uncanny grasp of principles savil nodded you know this enmity could also be partially that the man was pushed into the priesthood by his family and hates it a priest with no vocation is worse than no priest at all could be radevel replied one thing for sure it wasnt this bad fore van came home its like something about van brings out the worst in the old crow thought id say something he shrugged i dont like him jervis dont like him jerviss got a feel for things like enemies sneakin up on your back you might want to keep an eye on leren oh yes cousin vanyel thought quietly if you are seeing the hint of trouble stolid as you are i will surely keep an eye on him things in your bed again yfandes asked sweetly vanyel snarled hung the lantern he was carrying on a hook climbed up on the railings of the box and hauled his bedroll down from the rafters above her stall this is not my idea of a good time he replied i didnt come home with the intention of sleeping in the stable the bedroll landed on the floor and he jumped down off the top rail to land beside it here i thought id get past her by getting dinner with the babies and sneaking up to my room at sunset and there she is waiting for me bold as a bad penny not nude this time but in my bed fandes this is the third night in a row has the woman no shame and i locked the damned door why didnt you just put her out the door he glared at her and heaved the bedding into the stall i do not he said between clenched teeth feel like engaging in a wrestling match with the woman dammit theres going to be frost on the ground in the morning its getting chilly at night poor abused baby i know somebody who ii gladly keep you warm he glared at her again poised halfway over the railings of the box stall one foot on either side fandes youre pushing my patience me oh fandes his tone cooled a little and he swung his leg over the top rail of the stall and hopped down beside her to hug her neck im sorry i shouldnt take the fact that im ready to kill her out on you she rubbed her cheek against his her smooth coat softer than any satin and nibbled at his hair her breath puffed warm against his ear sweet and hayscented farther down in the stable beyond the light of vanyels lantern one of the horses whickered sleepily and another stamped im rather selfishly glad to have you with me she said watching him heap up straw and spread his sleeping roll on it i like having you here with no danger to keep us wakeful a quiet night nothing to really disturb us remember how you used to spend nights out in the vale with me watching the stars and waiting for starwind to take a header out of his treehouse vanyel laughed with her rich chuckle bubbling in his mind youre right that was a good time even if i did spend the first few months of it in various states of hurting gods of light fandes i miss them its been far too long since i last saw them brightstar must bewhatnearly ten i wish we had time to go back there they dont shake me to my shoes the way shavri and randi do is it only because i dont see them too often or yfandes interrupted his thought you d have to gate or else spend months on the road she replied sadly we darent take the time and i wont let you gate yet not unless its an emergency youre still drained her tone cheered him a little yes little mother vanyel chuckled climbing into his crude bed good humor fully restored and to prove that he wasnt quite so drained as yfandes seemed to think he snuffed the lamp with a thought showoff she teased settling down carefully next to him so that he could curl up beside her for all the world like a strange sort of gangly foal he wriggled himself and blankets in against her warm silken side and slipped one hand out to rest on her foreleg he yawned with his anger gone his energy seemed to be gone too night dearheart he mumbled suddenly unable to keep his eyes open she nuzzled his cheek goodnight beloved they howled around him trying to crawl inside his mind horrible vile they made him retch to look at them but he couldnt look away from their distorted faces and maimed bodies they drove fear before them and raised terror about them making a whirlwind with himself in the center they had knives for teeth and scythes for claws red eyes full of madness and an insatiable hunger he could feel beating at his frail shell of protection in waves of heat they were shadows deadly kitting shadows and they couldnt get at him but they could and would find other prey they howled off and away on the wind and he screamed or tried to and hid his head and made himself as small as he could while the killing and dying began and he wept with terror and shrieked vanyel shook off the grip of the nightmare and came up out of it with a rush choking against the black bile of fear in his throat he clawed his way out of his blankets and lay panting and unthinking against yfandes side in the aftermath of allconsuming horror while his heart pounded in his ears the night about him was quiet peaceful undisturbed on the surface but beneath the surface automatically he reached out with his othersenses to touch the energy currents that lay beneath the material night no it hadnt been a nightmare his othersenses showed him the new churning eddies in the currents of power all about him something had happened tonight somewhere out there something had used power used it freely and to a terrible end his nightmare had only been the faroff echo of something much much worse there was evil on the otherwindsand the world beneath shivered to feel it if id been in my room id never have felt this he realized coming fully awake my room is shielded and so is savils but i never shield when im with yfandes that means savil hasnt felt this im the only one who knows theres something wrong fandes he reached out for her shoulder the muscles were bunched with tension and her head was up sniffing the crisp breeze hush listen faint and far off a mindcry for help or just a mind crying in despair it wavered maddeningly in and out of his sensingrange thats because hes bonded its a companion a young one hes chosen and his chosen is emperiled i can hardly hear him she stretched her neck out as if simply trying harder could make what she sensed clearer thats he s caught in his chosen s fear and hes nearly hysterical which companion or chosen vanyel scrambled completely out of his bedroll and flared the lamp to life with a blink of thought wed better deal with this we may be the only ones close enough to hear them both the companion at least she lurched to her feet her eyes black with distress moonlight poured in through the open upper half of the door to the paddock silvering her vanyel please we must go to them whats it look like im doing he demanded throwing her blanket over her then pulling down the saddle itself ill have you saddled in half a moment where is this lineas highjorune the linean throneseat he made a quick check of his mental maps thats relatively near our border can we be there by dawn before all her attention was back on the west good because i have the feeling what were about to do isnt legal at least by linean standards and id rather not break laws while people are awake to catch me kellan a stamp and a whicker told him that savils companion had heard him get savil awake and tell her what we know and where were going and why snort of agreement fandes wait a minute id better change he began stripping his clothing off cursing the laces that wouldnt come undone and snapping them when he realized how much time this was taking she swung her head around to stare at him frantically we cant afford the time we cant afford not to take the time he said reasonably think about it love i had damn well better be in uniform even the lineans will think twice about stopping a valdemar herald but a man on a white horse wont rate that second thought i am something less than fond of being a target even a moving one he rummaged in the saddlebags coming up with a slightly crumpled set of whites thought i left those here thank the gods for battleline habits he shrugged on the breeches and tunic and belted them tight pulled on the boots hed pulled off when hed wormed into his blankets good thing ive only got the one pair of boots damn i wish id thought to leave a sword here meke left one in the tack bin by the stud bless you he vaulted the railings to fetch it it was not a good blade but it was serviceable he strapped it and his long dagger on inserted the short ones into their pockets in his boots his cloakhe looked for it quickly hed need it out there there it was half tangled with the blankets he pulled it out of the tangle shook it out flung it over his shoulders fastened the throatlatch and returned to the task of harnessing yfandes he swung the saddle onto her back gave a quick pull of the cinch got chest and rumpbands buckled and snugged in she was ready he snatched her hackamore off its peg and tossed it over her head he mounted while she shook it into place as the bells on it jangled madly she booted the bottom of the door into the paddock open with her nose while he grabbed for the reins and brought them over her neck and then with a leap a wild deer would envy she was off into the darkness seven gods its like another borderalert though yfandes was frantic with the call in her mind vanyel kept his wits about him and reached out with a finger of power to snuff the lantern as they cleared the stabledoor yfandes raced across the blackvelvet of the paddock hooves pounding dully on the turf uncannily surefooted in all the mooncast dancing shadows hed forgotten for a moment that their path out was going to be blocked he glanced ahead barely in time to see the fence at the far end coming at them and set himself instinctively when he felt her gather under him they flew over the bars and landed with a jar that drove his teeth together and threw him against the pommel of the saddle he fought himself back into balance and felt her begin to hesitate in midstride van he clenched his teeth and wrenched himself into place just go im fine she stretched out flat to the ground and ran with all the heart that was in her vanyel pulled himself down as close to the level of her outstretched neck as he could kept his silhouette low and clean and balanced his weight just behind her shoulders where she could carry it easiest and fed her with his power no one except another herald could know how exhausting just riding could be especially on a ride like this he was constantly moving altering his balance to help her without thinking about it it was work and involved tiny muscle adjustments to complement her exertions he kept his cloak tucked in all around but it didnt help much the wind cut right through it and chilled him terribly his hands and face were like ice before a candlemark had passed the wind whipped his hair into snarls and numbed his ears and there was nothing he could do except endure it all and keep his othersenses alert for trouble ill have to do something about the border guards when we get there something that isnt intrusive the border friendly in name only neutral in truth was guarded by sentries and watchtowers they reached it at just about midnight and vanyel blinked in amazement when the first of those towers loomed up above the trees on the horizon a black column against moon whitened clouds hed had no way to judge yfandes speed in the dark only the wind in his face and the thin steady pull of power from him power that he in turn drew from the nodes and powerstreams they passed as they came into sensing range her speed wasnt natural and required magic to sustain over any distance the watchtowers that was the first time shed mindspoken him since theyd leapt the paddock fence and her mindvoice though preoccupied was dark with apprehension the border guards ive got it figured he told her got a wash of relief and then felt her turn her attention back to the race and her footing secure in the belief that he would handle the rest he closed his eyes against distractions and looked out ahead he found and identified each mind that could possibly see them passing those who were awake and those who were not he left nothing to chance anymore not after hed once been detected on a crawl through the enemy camp by a cook who happened to head for the privytrench at just the wrong time so calling on more of that nodeenergy hed garnered on the run he built a seeming that touched all those minds there is nothing on the road his mind whispered to theirs only shadows under the moon the drumming of a partridge the hooves of startled deer you see nothing you hear only sounds you have heard before there is nothing on the road there were plenty of circumstances that could break this seeming it was too delicate to hold against a counterspell and it would certainly break if they had the misfortune to run into someone physically but anyone touched by the spell would see only shadows hear only sounds that could easily be explained away more importantly they would feel a subtle aversion to investigating those sounds a bored lassitude that would keep them in the shelter of their posts they passed the border guard station vaulting the twin gates that barred the road valdemar and lineas sides as lightly as leaves on the wind the linean guard was actually leaning on the gatepost lounging beneath a lantern his face a startlingly pale blur above his dark uniform he looked directly at them and vanyel felt him yawn as they leaped the gate then he was lost in the dark behind as they raced on vanyel did not look back but set the spell to break the moment they were out of sight he would cloak his own passing he would not leave the border to spellmazed guardians he spent no more magical energies in such spells he didnt particularly care if the common folk of lineas saw them they were familiar enough with the uniform of the heralds if any lineans saw him they would assume reasonably enough that hed been properly dealt with at the border and belonged here yfandes raced on through pocketsized villages in tiny sheltered riverhollows even through a larger town or two all were as dark as places long abandoned finally in the dead hours of the night the time when death and birth lie closest they came to highjorune most of the city was as dead and dark as the villages but not all no city slept the night through more and stronger magic would be required to get them to their goal whatever it waswithout being stopped vanyel reached seeking nodeenergy to use to pass the city gates as they had the border and recoiled a little in surprise for a place so adamantly against mages and their gifts highjorune was crawling with mageenergy it lay on the intersection of three five seven lines of force none of them trivial all flowing to meet at a node beneath it liquid rainbows humming the random songs of power strong enough for even newmade adepts to use provided they had the sensitivity to detect themthough the node where they met would be too wild too strong for any but an experienced adept yfandes stop a bit yfandes obeyed he raised his hands preparing to spin out a true spell of illusion and sound dampening taking the power directly from the closest stream bracing himself for the shock as his mind met the flow of energy the city gate was too wellguarded and welllit and the city itself too crowded with people to chance the kind of spell hed worked on the border guards he wanted to hurry the spell but knew he didnt dare careful he told himself this is savils area of expertise not yours rush it and you could lose it yfandes fidgeted her bridle bells chiming her hooves making a deeper ringing on the hard paving of the road hurry she urged her own mindvoice dense with fear please hell die theyll die theres another companion shes nearly gone mad she cant speak fandes dont interrupt im working as fast as i can but if i dont pull power now i wont have anything when we need it the raw power was beginning to fill him fill all the echoing emptiness natural slow recovery had not been able to do this he was going to have to wait until the achingly empty reservoirs of power within him were full again before he could spin a shield this complicated though at this rate it wasnt going to take long besides he was all too likely to need power if everything went to hell and he had to gate out of here gods its like eating sunlight breathing rainbows drinking wind force poured into him wild and untamed and for the first time in months he felt complete and revived there was nothing this strong anywhere near forst reach no mystery now why the mavelans wanted lineas not with this kind of power running through highjorune going untapped and unused he could almost pity the magelords it must be like living next to people who mined up precious gems with their copper and threw the gems out with the tailings but wouldnt let you in to glean them got to hurry this were running out of time cautiously he pulled at the power until it responded flowing faster into him thats it now i make it mine he tapped into the wild power hed taken learned it tamed it to his hand he was sweating now both with effort and impatience gods this takes too much time but i cant afford any surprises slowly carefully he began to spin the energy out into threads visible only to his othersight making a cocoon of the threads that would absorb sound within it and send the eyes that lit upon it to looking elsewhere layer on layer thread on delicate thread this was a spell that required absolute concentration and attention for the slightest defect would mean a place where the eye could catch and hold where sound could leak out yfandes stood like a statue of ice in the moonlight no longer fidgeting finally with a sigh of relief he completedthe web he replaced what he had spent then cut off his connection to the motherstream his arms hurt but he had the feeling that more was going to hurt than his arms before this was over go he told yfandes who leaped off into the dark heading for the open city gates ahead of them he grabbed for the reins and pommel as she shot forward a white arrow speeding toward a target only she knew fandes where are we going the palace the streets wound crazily round about with no sense and no pattern some were illuminated by torches and lanterns some only by the moon they sped from dark to light to dark again yfandes hooves sliding on the slippery cobbles they splashed through puddles of water and less pleasant liquids he could hear her hooves oddly muffled beneath him and both intriguing scents and noisome foul stenches that met his nose only to be snatched away before he could recognize them there were people about street cleaners beggars whores drunks others he couldnt identify the spell held the eyes of the townsfolk they passed slid past the two of them with no interest whatsoever the first companion the young one i cant even reach him now hes too crazed van hes so frightened yfandes was not particularly coherent herself stress was distorting her mindvoice into a wash of emotion through which it was hard to pick up words the second one shes her chosen she cant bear what hes doing shes shutting everything out vanyel clung to the pommel and balanced out sideways a bit as yfandes rounded a corner hindquarters skewing as her hooves slipped a little this second oneshe was probably the companion with randales envoy but what could a herald be doing that would stress his companion to the point of breakdown vanyel didnt have long to wait to discover the answer they entered a zone of wider streets and enormous residences homes of the noble and rich the streets were near daylight bright with cressets and lanterns of scentless oils the palace cant be far he thought and just as he finished the thought they pounded around a corner and into a huge square then down a broad avenue at the end of that processional avenue was a huge structure half fortress half fantasy looming above the city a black eagle mantling above her nest against the setting moon and at the eagles feet an egg of lightthe main courtyard brightly lit vanyel banished the spell of unsight as they thundered in the gilded gates the darkcharcoal palace walls cupped the courtyard on three sides the wall theyd just passed beneath forming the fourth there must have been a hundred lanterns burning he only got a glimpse of confusion to his right half a dozen armed and armored men and a companion down and moaning on the black cobbles to his lefta younger companion blood streaked shockingly red on his white coat teeth bared and screaming with rage and battle fury a blond boy clinging dazedly to his back and it was like something out of his worst nightmares a herald with a heavy carters whip beating the stallion until his skin came away in strips and blood striped bright on the snowy hide trying to separate him from the boy yfandes literally rode the herald down swerving at the last moment to shoulder him aside instead of trampling him vanyel leaped from her saddle as he had so many times before in border fights hit the cobbles and tumbled to kill his momentum and sprang to his feet with sword drawn he didnt give the other herald a breath to react whatever insanity was going on here had to be stopped without thinking van reversed the grip on the sword in his hand and lashed up to catch the stranger squarely on the chin with a handful of metal the other herald went flying backward and landed in an untidy heap damn hes still moving vanyel put himself in righting stance between the young stallion and his abuser he touched the young ones minds just long enough to try and get some sense out of either the boy or the stallion but from the first picked up only shock and from the second fear that drowned everything else out vanyel pulled on the power within him feeling it leap wild and undisciplined as the other herald staggered to his feet bleeding from a split lip and prepared to lash out with the whip again flinging out his left hand van sent a lash of his own a lash of lightning from his outstretched finger to the whipstock the spark arced across the space between them with a crackle and the pungent smell of burning leather and the dark sallowfaced herald dropped the whip with an exclamation of pain behind him yfandes was holding off the armsmen with squeals lashing hooves and bared teeth faced with her anger they were not inclined to come to the heralds rescue what in hell do you think youre doing vanyel thundered letting the other feel his outrage a wave of red anger the older man backed up an involuntary pace what in the name of the gods themselves is going on here vanyel sheathed his sword then the other herald drew himself up nursing his injured hand against his chest rubbing the blood off his bruised chin with the other who are you to interfere he began his face a caricature of thwarted authority vanyel tried to mindspeak but the others channel was weak and he was blocking it besides and the personality was not one for much hope of compromise stolid and methodical and affronted by the strangers intervention in his jurisdiction the young stranger too young surely to have any authority gods bless im going to have to pull rank on this thickheaded idiot and hes never going to forgive me for that and the only reason i didnt put him out is because hes so damn thick headed heraldmage vanyel ashkevron vanyel cut him off called demonsbane called shadowstalker first heraldmage in valdemar i outrank you herald and your damn fool actions tonight called me out of my bed and across the border youve exceeded your authority and im ordering you to let this boy be who in hell are you vanyel could feel the older mans resentment and smoldering anger heavy and hot a ponderous weight of molten emotional metal herald lores he said sullenly rubbing his hand king randales envoy to the court of lineas over his shoulder vanyel watched yfandes backing away from the armsmen she cautiously nudged the downed companions shoulderstill keeping one eye on them after a couple of false tries the other mare managed to get back to her feet but stood with her head down and her legs splayed and shaking fandes she s hearing again and speaking a little when you got her chosen to stop it resolved the conflict inside her but she is not well she is still in turmoil and her heart bleeds take care of her he turned his attention back to lores tell me slowly just what you thought you were doing taking a whip to a companion trying to drive him away from his chosen lores snarled that boy is a bloodyhanded murderer and that thing you call a companion is his demon shape changed he called it up and was trying to escape on it what vanyel backed up a step inadvertently bumping into the young stallion who snorted in alarm but stood rock steady ready to protect his chosen against anything be it man beast or creature of magic vanyel reached out still keeping his eyes on lores and laid his hand along the stallions neck if anyone in the wide world would know what a demon felt like he did after having them close enough to score his chest with their claws and after turning them back against karse he extended his mind toward the young stallions and touched again gently no demonic aura met his mind only the pure bright blue white pulsing that was the signature of a companion an aura that only a companion of all the creatures he had ever mindtouched possessed anger rose in him as his hand came away bloody and the young stallion shivered in fear and pain he clenched his fist and stared at the older herald you he groped for words if i didnt know randale and know that neither he nor shavri would send anyone at all unbalanced out here as an envoy id say you were insane the man gaped at him taken completely aback as it is im forced to say ive never encountered anyone so incredibly stupid in my life he relaxed his clenched fist and patted the stallions neck without looking around then advanced on lores with such anger filling him that he was having trouble keeping his voice controlled what in hell makes you think this youngster is a demon you could be fooled spelltouched not bloody likely and a demon could never fool my companion nor yours gods man if they wouldnt know after she chose and after her chosen was pressed past all sanity it has no bearing on what happened here you would not listen to your own companion try to tell you the truth he took a step toward the other bloody finger pointed in accusation you blocked her out with your anger and your fear you allowed your emotions to interfere with your ability to see the truth you blocked her so you couldnt hear what you didnt want to hear lores resentment smoldered in his eyes but he could not deny vanyels accusations van the boy vanyel spun just in time to see the young man losing his death grip on his companions mane sliding to the ground he sprinted to the boys side startling the young stallion so that he threw up his head and rolled his eyes and caught the boy in mid collapse draping the boys arm over his own neck and shoulder supporting him and looked around for an open door any door your left yfandes prompted one of the double doors into the main entranceway was cracked open he halfcarried halfdragged the boy there with lores following sullenly behind and kicked the door open enough to squeeze through it was pitchy dark in the palace which was damned odd for the throneseat even at a few hours till dawn even odder all that commotion in the main courtyard had brought no one out to see what the ruckus was about van couldnt see a thing past the little light coming in the doorway the building might just as well have been deserted first things first they needed light so be damned to local prejudice he thought and set a globe of blue magelight to spinning above his head behind him he heard a stifled gasp as lores watched it appear out of nowhere they were in a bare entryway that was all he had time to notice in his brief glance someplace to put this boy a seat was what he was looking for and he spotted one a highlypolished wooden bench bare of cushions and bolted to the floor over against the wall just clear of the door presumably it was for the use of lowrank servants waiting for something or someone at the main entrance whatever it was a seat he supported the boy over to it and got him seated shoved his head down between his legs and worked the little healing he knew to clear the shock out and get him conscious again the boy was aware enough to interpret that as some kind of coercion or confinement he tried to fight and raised his head into the light and vanyel saw his face for the first time it was tylendels face dazed with shock and vacanteyed that looked up at him in confusion beneath the blue magelight vanyel choked and the floor seemed to heave beneath him only one hand on the wall saved him for a moment he thought that his heart had stopped or that his mind had snapped his eyes cleared again and he took a closer look reached out to tip the boys face into the light and almost mindtouched but he stopped himself as he began to see the little differences the boy couldnt be more than sixteen and looked it lendel had always looked older than he really was the boys nose was snubbed or more than lendels had been the eyes were farther apart and larger the chin rounded and not squared the hair wavy not curly and darker than the goldenbrown of tylendels subtle differences but enough to let him shake off his ghosts enough to tell him that this was not tylendel whatever the boy in turn saw or sensed in his eyes it reassured him enough that he stopped fighting and obeyed vanyels halfaudible order to keep his head down not now he told himself deal with your ghosts later not now for the first time since entering the gilded door he looked around to see if there was finally anyone coming he looked past the barren entryway and froze at the sight of the wreckage in the magelight hed seen less destruction after the sacking of a keep no wonder no one came he thought dumbly nobody human could have survived this vanyel stood at the edge of the staircase and stared this entry was hardly more than twenty feet long and made of the same black stone as the exterior but polished to a reflective shine it led to a short stone stair that in turn led down into the woodpaneled great hall this hall had been a reception area lit by chandeliers and wall sconces hung with tapestries lined with dark wood tables and chairs polished to mirrorbrightness it was demolished the chandeliers had been torn from the beams tapestries ripped from the walls the walls the floor the ceiling beams themselves were scored and gouged as though with the marks of terrible claws the tapestries had been shredded the furniture reduced to splinters the wreckage scattered across the floor as though a whirlwind had played here vanyel remembered his dream and felt his hair rise and a chill creep up his backbone what his voice cracked and he tried again what happened lores lip lifted a little but he answered civilly enough that boy thats tashir you know who he is vanyel nodded tashir remoerdis deveran of lineas oldest child you know deveran figured him for a bastard the worst kind fathered on ylyna by her own brother so they say is that really germane van looked back at the wreckage damn right its germane lores lifted his lip scornfully its why the brat did all this lores youd better tell me everything you know vanyel requested simply still trying to take in the implications of the wrecked palace lores snorted and rambled on ylyna was no virgin though in honesty the mavelans never claimed she was still fourteens a bit young to have been as lets say experienced as she was tashir was born eight months after the wedding thats suspicious enough boy looks like his uncle vedric and nothing like ylyna or deveran did thats the second reason another is that hes known to have gifts fetching for onethings have been flying around when he got upset ever since he was thirteen no gifts manifested in ylyna and theres never been any in deverans line the locals called it wizardry and pressured deveran to disinherit tashir id heard about the gift vanyel said looking back at the boy to see if hed overheard them they were only twenty paces away and lores was making no effort to keep his voice down tashir was still sitting where theyd left him head and hands dangling between his knees how did the boy take being disinherited the boy for a moment lores seemed puzzled that was the odd part boy seemed relieved it was vedric mavelan that made all the fuss but tonight something happened at dinner and im not sure exactly what lores wrapped his arms around his chest and his expression turned introspective and a little fearful were you there vanyel asked lores nodded always as the valdemar envoy tonight he looked into the distance frowning i remember i was chatting with deverans armsmaster and the boy came up to the high table to say something to deveran next thing i knew theyre at it hammer and tongs screaming at each other the boy going white and deveran going red then deveran backhanded the boy knocked him to the floor vanyel chewed his lip was that unusual lores shrugged well it had never happened in public before deveran asked us all to leave in the kind of voice that makes an order out of a request we left dont look at me like that what else could we do i dont know vanyel replied soberly i wasnt there but i dont think i would have left a situation that volatile well i left its not valdemar and it wasnt my business i went out to the stable and jenna was outside with her for a while he shook his head theyd moved the fight up to deverans study toward the back of the palace i could hear em both shouting at each other through the window then it got real quiet for a bit and then all hell broke loose he gestured at the wreckage in the great hall and his expression became strained you can figure what that sounded like enough screaming for a war nobody wanted to break in on that and anyway we found out that the doors were all like they were welded shut his voice was casual but he was trembling and sweating and his skin was dead white it didnt last long then it was quiet again sudden like everything had been cut off me the outside servants and deverans armsmen from the palace and the town guard and a couple of the town council with some courage in them we all broke the doors open and you found thats what we found the boy knocked out under that bench and when we went to look for bodies gods everyone inside these walls was dead the boys sibs the servants everybody torn to pieces just like that stuff nothing bigger than palmsized pieces of everybody else he was shaking now his teeth chattering and his pupils dilated nothing he repeated youre not saying tashir did all that vanyel said incredulously thats impossible its insane the magelight flared a little setting shadows shrinking and growing again flickering as he whirled to look at the boy and his attention wavered lores turned away from the wreckage clutching his arms against his chest and gradually stopped trembling his eyes fell on tashir again just the sight of the boy seemed to reawaken his anger whats insane about it he demanded fetching can wreck or even kill i should know that better than you its my gift its one of my gifts too you damned fool vanyel growled and at one point i almost got out of control but my gift was blasted open and i was in pain enough to drive a strong man mad nothing like that happened here this boy never showed a hint of anything on this scale and he was untrained not bloody likely how do we know he was untrained lores demanded his eyes reflecting blue glints from the mage light over vanyels head he was the only one left alive he had to have done it vanyel had a dozen retorts on the tip of his tongue but none of them seemed wise so how did you come to be such an expert on gifts and magic you idiot and did you search to find someone who might have hidden himself or herself until you d found and dealt with tashir or did you identify everyone or at least count all the bodies and come up with the same number as those known to be in the palace he kept his teeth shut on all those questions it was obvious that this had been bungled from the start and dressing down this fool wasnt going to undo the bungling we couldnt really believe it not at first lores admitted reluctantly we thought it must have been oh something out of the pelagir wilderlands or even something cooked up by the mavelans we really didnt know what it could have been especially not the lineans but there wasnt anyone or anything else and when we tried to question tashir the boy wouldnt answer at first he was dazedlike then he just refused to speak except to say he didnt remember lores shook his head not remember how could he not remember something that did that unless he was lying or hed done it in anger and had blanked it out of his mind lores clasped his folded arms still tighter against his chest as if he was trying to protect himself what could we do the guards were spooked nobody wanted something like that on their hands in the end we just threw him in the guardhouse at the front gate there since the townsfolk didnt want him in their jail and nobody wanted to have to go down to the cells under the palace we sent off a messenger for vedric since he was the one making all the fuss about the boy in the first place he may be a mavelan but hes not going to be able to talk the boy out of this mess hell have to deal with him and he is a mage we reckoned it was better for one mage to deal with another especially a murderer thats not proved lores glared at him vanyel repeated his words stubbornly thats not proved nothing is proved and furthermore id like to know how the hell a herald could come to attack a companion lores began pacing four steps away from vanyel four steps back we shoved him in there picked up the bodies what was left of them things quieted down then less than a candlemark ago that demon showed up companion lores wheeled to glare again but the look in vanyels eyes cowed him that companion showed up he began breaking down the door the guard got me i sent for reinforcements i thought it was a demon more men showed up about the time the de companion got the door smashed in and started to run off with the boy that whip was in the guardhouse and i grabbed it figuring demon or not it was horseshaped he shrugged you know the rest didnt you even try the boy under truth spell vanyel snarled out of patience with the lack of thought the complete bullheaded stupidity of the man lores looked baffled truth spell why whats that got to do with me goddess incarnate any herald can work firststage truth spell didnt your mentor ever vanyel paused at the dumbfounded look on lores face your mentor never told you lores shook his head gods vanyel strode over to the adolescent who was still slumped over his own knees tashir he said gently kneeling beside him he braced himself when the young man looked up it still made his heart lurch to see those eyes that face and that dazed lost and pleading expression tashir do you remember anything that happened tonight anything at all tashirs eyes were still not focusing well he shook his head dumbly vanyel shook him gently think dinner do you remember your father calling you up at dinner i the boys voice was quite low almost a match for vanyels baritone i think so yes he wanted me to go somewhere where tashir vanyel prompted i dont remember do you remember arguing with him a hesitant nod there were shadows under tashirs eyes that had nothing to do with the way the light was falling on him i didnt want to go he wanted to send me somewhere i dont remember where i just remember that i didnt want to go i told him i wouldnt he hit me did he hit you very often the eyes cleared for a moment bright with fear often enough the boy confessed cautiously when i was around too much i tried not to get in his way sometimes hed get mad about something and take it out on me but not in front of people not before tonight so he hit you then he sent everyone else away what then he came around the table he grabbed me before i could get away twisted my arm up behind my back and made me go with him to his study and the eyes clouded again and i dont remember tashir wailed softly please i dont remember vanyel set in motion the spell that called the vrondi the mindless air elemental that could not abide the emotional emanations associated with falsehood in his hands because he could give it energy beyond its own the vrondi would be able to settle within the youngsters mind he would be incapable of lying so long as it was there vanyel watched the vrondi settle into place a glowing blue mist like a visible aura about tashirs head and shoulders he would not see it but vanyel and lores certainly could he glanced over at lores and saw the older mans lips compress his face grow speculative are you sure tashir he urged think your father took you up to his study what happened in the study i dont remember tashir whimpered i dont vanyel sighed and dismissed the vrondi with a word the mist dissolved faded away but slowly not all at once as it would have if it had met with a lie there was only one other thing he could try he reached out tentatively with a mindtouch tashir should not have been able to detect it but suddenly he jerked away his eyes wild and unreasoning and a shield snapped up so quickly vanyel barely had time to pull back his touch look out lores cried diving for die floor as half a vase rose from the wreckage flung itself across the room and smashed against the door more fragments followed it all rising from the wreckage to smash against the door creating a rain of flying shards that pelted them both like fine hail vanyel didnt move so much as a hair he clenched his jaw and reached out with his own power to damp tashirs gift with an external shield sudden silence tashir he reached out for the youngster with his hand this time not his mind tashir i want to help you i believe you i will not allow anyone to harm you or to imprison you for something you didnt do the adolescents eyes slowly calmed grew saner he stared at vanyel for a long moment then buried his face in his hands and began sobbing trembling on the jagged edge of hysteria idontremember he choked oh please i dont i really dont before he could do anything to comfort or calm the youngster vanyel heard a noise in the distance muffled by the door that made his hair stand on end the sullen angry roaring of a mob lores head snapped up and a look of grim satisfaction spread over his face the armsmen he said smugly they must have spread the word thats the people of highjorune out there milord heraldmage you dont rank them and they arent likely to listen to you whats your plan now theyre going to want the boy i think you should let them have him tashir gave a kind of choking gasp and looked straight into vanyels eyes his whole body pleading for rescue his eyes were swollen tears smeared across his face and hair tumbled into one eye his expression was tragic and hopeless vanyel could no more have resisted a boy who looked like that than he could have given up yfandes i still outrank you lores he said coldly you are still under my orders get out there and do what you can to keep them off keep them off youre madder than he is move vanyel snapped rising to his feet as the flickering of torches lit the gap in the open door lores made no further protest he snorted and stalked across the entryway to the door his backbone stiff with unspoken resentment vanyel followed him as far as the door and once he had barely cleared it slammed it shut practically on his heels he heard a muffled exclamation and the muttering of the mob grew louder and nearer vanyel threw the bolt into place across the door it was metal but it was not going to hold up against a concerted attack that isnt going to hold them for long tashir said fearfully brushing the hair out of his eyes with the back of one hand it wont have to vanyel answered absently moving his othersenses out and down and hoping that it was no coincidence there was that node the most powerful node hed ever encountered outside tayledras lands given that highjorune was situated on top of the convergence of those energy streams given that the node had to be around here somewhere had the palace been built where hed have put it it was no coincidence the palace was situated directly over the node a node so strong it roared in vanyels mind now that pompous peabrain is going to find out why i outrank him he growled to himself and reached the currentpower had been wild it was nothing to this he had compared channels in his mother and yfandes to a dripping icicle and a waterfall this was to those streams what a raging firestorm was to a campfire but vanyel knew its secrets and how to control it and it raged to his will he set his mind in the spellcycle he murmured a few words gathered his will and cupped his hands unconsciously mirroring the shape he wanted to create then he snapped his hands open crying out a single word of command a flash of light made his closed eyelids burn red for a moment tashir cried out fearfully absolute and complete silence descended on them like sudden deafness he opened his eyes a steady yellow glow on the outer walls was just barely visible to his othersight he had erected a mage barrier about the palace that would keep out anything he didnt want in including such intangibles as thought or other magic he could pass through so could anything he brought with him no one and nothing else with effort his thoughts passed it yfandes how are you and the stranger they are ignoring us she said you have frightened the young one and angered lores the mob has not made up its mind even if they do it wont get them anywhere give me a moment to make up my mind vanyel severed the connection between himself and the node he could control it yes but at a price hed just earned himself another scattering of silver hairs among other things he opened his eyes and saw tashir huddled up against the wall shaking so hard his teeth rattled he walked stiffly to the bench and touched the young mans shoulder he got no response he turned tashirs face into the light and saw his eyes glazed over in withdrawal damn vanyel sat down heavily beside him now what he thought hard for a moment made up his mind quickly and reached for the node again the shock as he touched it the second time was a little less when he could catch his breath again he used the nodeenergy to boost his own mindspeech far beyond what he could have reached alone sending his mind out questing for a mindpresence so dear and familiar it could almost have drawn him on its own touch startlement who savil recognition and relief gods kechara what has been bloody going on where are you he told her everything that had happened from the time hed been awakened by the nightmare he compressed as much of it as he could warned her in advance before he mindsent her an image of tashir and even so the close resemblance to tylendel came as a shock to her that mirrored his own he had been tylendels lover but savil had been mentor friend confidant and nearmother to tylendel the role she filled now for vanyel so she sent after she regained her mental balance plans im taking him into protective custody and getting him out of here how with a mob oh gods realization and fear flatlyyoure going to gate do you see any other choice he asked even if the mob werent therei tried to remember what little ive heard about investigative procedures preserve the evidence if i break the shieldspell to get out anybody can get in and i dont have the power to set a second spell not this solid not from the outside from the inside i can tap the node but the interference id create with the shield would keep me effectively out of the node you know that shields are permeable to the creator but they still resist penetration we have to find out what happened here and we wont if anyone can get in and muddle things up her mindvoice was gritty and gray with grim concern far too logical to make me happy love but you rank me these days and theres reasons enough for that for me to follow your lead where are you coming in hed thought about that very carefully the door to the old chapel its on sanctified ground its one of the few doors inside forst reach big enough to use as a gateterminus but its not under constant use and i know it as well as i will ever know any place so be ready for me because im not going to be worth much when i come through as if i didnt know be careful please ill try he cut the connection to the node which dropped him out of the link with savil and turned his mind to one nearer at hand brightlove chosen im gating myself and tashir out of here you and the young one make a run for it if that damned fool calling himself a herald cant take the hint its not my fault ive got too many balls in the air as it is she trembled with concern i will warn jenna if she can get him to mount she can carry him off whether he likes it or not i wont tell you not to use that means of escape only take care he touched her with a mental caress i shall he opened his eyes and considered the possibilities finally deciding on the open archway onto the stairs as his best bet putting a gateterminus on the outer door where the shield was would be risking more magically than he cared to at full powers maybe not now but first he shoved outward a little chuckling nastily as the expanding shield shoved lores down the stairs and into the courtyard there that should keep them quiet for a bit he walked to the center of the hallway raised his hands and began he spun bits of himself his stored powers into the structure he could not tap the node for this the only possible way to use external mageenergy for a gate would be at least as far as he had learned if two mages were lifebonded for at some deep level two lifebonded were one and as always as soon as he had formed the portal around the edge of the archway his uniquely sensitized channels began to burn painfully as he resonated to gateenergy when the gate was complete hed be in torment but that was something he had learned to accept and work around the weaving he spun himself his own substance out into threads that quested for the unique place he sought the place where he would build the other end of the gate at some point he was no longer having to send those searching filaments they were pulling on him and it was all he could do to keep them from spinning away from him and taking everything that was him with them then finally one of them found the chapel door another a third there was a flare of light not so bright as the one when hed built the shield and his knees gave oh hell he thought dazedly i wasnt as ready as i thought i was he crouched on the filthy shardcovered floor panting in pain for a long long moment before he had the strength to look up but when he did he saw not the wreckage of the highjorune great hall but the welcoming familiar corridor that led to the old forst reach chapel and thriceblessed savil tunic on backward waiting the pain i think im in trouble ive never been this drained before he thought somewhere under the red wash of burning oh gods if id known it was going to be like this id never have had the courage he got to his feet somehow he staggered like a mortally wounded drunk trying to get to tashir he was so dizzy he could hardly see and only concentrating on each step one at a time enabled him to cross the hallway to the young man tashir he croaked and prayed for a little intelligence in those eyes his prayers were answered this time the young man stared at him with a kind of foggy awareness though he still trembled in every limb go get up his feeble tugs on tashirs arm were answered the young man stumbled to his feet go there he pushed tashir toward the gate every step bought with black red waves of pain maddeningly tashir stopped right on the edge vanyel screamed in frustration and torment and shoved sending the young man stumbling through and unable to keep his balance fell right through after him fell from torment into agony strength gone control gone sight sound all senses there was only the pain and then there was nothing eight you look like hell said a rough voice just above i his head what an amazing coincidence savil vanyel thought without opening his eyes i feel like hell i seem his aunt continued dryly to spend an inordinate amount of time at your bedside and dont try to pretend youre not awake i wouldnt think of it he whispered cracking his right eye open savil was lounging in the chair shed pulled up next to his bed feet on his bed mother will have a cat he observed prying his left eye open as well you know how she feels about boots on the bedcovers your mother isnt here at the moment how are you feeling he took a quick inventory other than some assorted jointaches about the same as when i got back to haven which is to say as you pointed out like hell whats been going on how long was i out this time your outside matches your inside were not in a war with lineas quite yet and three days she quirked one corner of her mouth as he groaned and continued i took the liberty of deepscanning you while you were witwandering and i got in touch with a couple of merchantcontacts in highjorune useful birds pigeons particularly when one can tell their little heads exactly where you want them to go you want your briefing in sequence or by specifics he had been inching into a sitting position while she was talking she poured a goblet of cider from a pitcher next to her and handed it to him when he was secure in sequence he said after a sip to help moisten his throat and youd better start with how father is taking the new houseguest your father doesnt know about him thank the gods the other corner of her mouth twitched up to make a real smile your old aunt is no fool kechara he was due to make his harvesttide inspection round of the freeholders the same morning you gated back and fell on your nose i simply installed tashir in the guest room next to yours and didnt bother to tell anyone until after withen was gone she hesitated a moment before continuing i have to tell you having that boy around is unnerving he acts like a ghost whisking out of sight when he sees me coming hes given me chills more than once hes too like our lost one well he is not wellwrapped even i can tell that and im no mindhealer vanyel nodded thoughtfully ive got too many questions and nowhere near enough answers so tashir is here and father doesnt know about it a not insignificant blessing keep going yfandes and the new companion got back about noon by nightfall id gotten a pigeon or two back with news lores is going back to haven to protest your actions to randale and hes carrying a demand from whats left of deverans council that tashir be turned over to them vedric finally stuck his nose in he showed up the next day he seems to be on the side of the lineans but he wants tashir turned over to the mavelans for trial and sentencing she paused for breath thats the bad news the good news is that since that fathead lores yes dear i know him hes a fathead and always has been one isnt a heraldmage he cant gate back to haven its going to take him a good long while to get there especially since the companions are in on our little conspiracy the how jenna is going to be an invalid all the way home if he makes the same time hed make on a spavined horse hell be lucky he coughed on a swallow of cider savil patted his back a gleam of amusement in her eye i got that from fandes through kellan jenna is not happy with her chosen and intends to make him pay for it so lores is going to be delayed so far as i know nobody knows where you and the lad are lores assumed youd gone to haven thats more good news so youre safe for a bit maybe long enough to find out what really happened even when people do find out where we are vanyel pointed out i cant be countermanded by anyone other than randale randi is going to stall i know him he knows that if there werent something damned odd going on id have gated to haven with tashir so what about our guest well i told you hes been acting like a ghost hes been hovering over you whenever there wasnt someone in here but he seems to know when someone is coming and slips back into his own room just before they get here fortunately i scanned you before i tried to read his mind someone or something certainly made him sensitive to that i judged we didnt need any broken vases exactly vanyel sat up a little straighter feeling better by the moment i wish i dared mindtouch him long enough to figure out what his gifts are fetching for certain probably mindspeech that would account for knowing when someone was coming has anybody been seeing that hes fed oh he comes to meals but not with the family he slips down to the kitchen at first call for the servants and the armsmen gets himself something portable and pelts back up here i guess he returns whatever dishes he takes after the kitchen shuts down for the night nobodys complained to me about missing plates your mother is alive with curiosity about him and he wont get any nearer to her than he will to me why is he so i dont know what to call it battleshy maybe vanyel chewed at a fingernail i never heard that deveran was all that bad a man rumor and the truth are sometimes fairly different things kechara savil reminded him and deveran was a man wellbeset by problems saddled with a wife he didnt care for an enemy on one of his borders which forced him to make his little kingdom into a clientstate of valdemar his eldest was a problematical bastard and he was unsteady enough on his throne that his people could pressure him into disinheriting the boy she shrugged eloquently this doesnt make for happy times in lineas men under pressure have been known to take their unhappiness out on the defenseless tashir vanyel sighed so we have a new presumptive herald with major problems not good savil what do we tell father when he gets back good question no more than that youve retrieved tashir newlychosen and damaged the less he knows of this mess the better i cant remember if hes ever seen vedric or tashir if he hasnt it might be best not to fearfearfeartrapped away get away dont touch me fear what in hell savil exclaimed tashir vanyel croaked throwing himself out of bed staggering across the room van he ignored savil and pulled open the door to his room hes in the bower treesa must have cornered him somehow and frightened him he stumbled down the hall at an unsteady run bare feet slapping on the wooden floor weaving a little from side to side but not slowing he was halfway down the hallway before savil caught up with him and threw a robe over him treesa would not appreciate a naked man breaking into her solar she rasped at him as he wrestled it on then outraced his aunt again it was a damned good thing that treesas bower wasnt far from the guest quarters because he was winded when he got there and holding his aching side feminine shrieks met him halfway there the pain that was tashirs and that was all emotional so whatever was happening it wasnt a repetition of the slaughter at highjorune he yanked open the door on chaos heavy furniture was dancing all over the room lighter things like embroidery frames and stools circled the ceiling like demented bats now and again pausing to throw themselves at the wall before circling again piles of shards showed where a few fragile ornaments had performed the same maneuvers to a more fatal end tashir was cowering in the corner nearest the doorframe head buried in his arms the women were cowering against the far wall screaming at the tops of their lungs vanyel and savil acted in concert he clamped down on tashir the furniture froze in middance and the flying pieces began gently lowering themselves to the floor savil took the women collectively paralyzing their throats so they couldnt scream it was a fragile solution at best vanyel sensed that the moment he or savil loosed control the young man would continue to panic the clatter of boots on the staircase heralded the unlikely answer to his prayers withen and jervis stormed into the mess with drawn swords probably expecting looting and rapine from all the screams they stopped cold on the threshold vanyel would remember the looks on their faces for a long time then tashir looked up at the intruders vanyel got ready to tighten down on the youngster if another surge of fear broke him out of control but instead he felt the first flickers of hope and something very like trust when tashir focused on jervis jervis lady have mercy but i am not looking sideways at a gift horse the women clearly saw withen and jervis as deliverers they relaxed immediately and savil let them go one at a time sorry about this withen weve got a presumptive herald here with a problem savil said slowly and carefully van rescued him hes very jumpy his gift is fetching ladies and he was just trying to get you to leave him alone he panicked when you started screaming its all right withen nobodys hurt and it looks like the only damage is a couple of ornaments treesa white and shaking actually managed a tremulous smile ththey were those horrible chcherubs thorinna insisted on gggiving me she stammered i shant mmmiss them vanyel meanwhile managed to snag jervis elbow and draw him away from withen ive got a very frightened lad here jervis he whispered ill tell you everything i can later for now he seems to see you as somebody he can depend on do you think you can handle him get him calmed down jervis didnt waste any time with questions or arguments he took one look at tashirs strained white face sheathed his sword and nodded vanyel with jervis at his elbow moved toward tashir as quietly and unthreateningly as he could the youngster looked up at them with a measure of both hope and fear im going to take the shields off you tashir vanyel said as if none of this had happened projecting calm with all his power empathy was not one of his strong gifts but he did have it and he used it to the limit i want you to go back to your room with jervis jervis this is tashir lad jervis is our armsmaster again that flash of hope and truststronger this time in response to the identification of jervis i want you to get yourself calmed down i know you can once you do all these strange things will stop happening what you have is something we call a gift and its no more unnatural than being able to paint well or fight well and the proof of that is that youre going to feel exhausted in a minute just like youd been fighting you have only with your mind well help you figure out how to keep it under control so that things like this wont happen again no one is angry at you you heard lady treesa and no one is going to punish you for any of this these things happen to some people and we understand that here in valdemar we look for people like you tashir and we train them to use what they have this little mess wasnt your fault and i wont allow anyone to blame you for it vanyels all right jervis said gruffly clapping vanyel on the shoulder and making him stagger a little if he says youre going to be fine you will be he wont lie and he keeps his promises without daring to mindtouch vanyel couldnt tell what the youngster was thinking he was forced to rely on what tashir was projecting that he was picking up empathically there was doubt there but a trust in jervis that was increasing by the moment clearly tashir would trust jervis where he wouldnt trust anyone else there was a glimmering a hint of something else for a moment then it was gone slithering away before vanyel could read it that was frustrating in the extreme but he certainly didnt want to set tashir off again so he slowly let his control over the youngster fade little by little until it was gone tashir slumped against the wall in total exhaustion closing his eyes here lad jervis stepped forward and took him by the elbow the boy transferred his weight from the wall to jervis a sign vanyel read with relief come on lets get you back to your room hey if what young van here says is true youre probably feeling like youve just gone through a roundrobin tourney in weighted armor tashir nodded and let jervis lead him out stumbling a little with fatigue with tashir gone the tension left the solar and everyone in it reacted to the relief differently treesa and her ladies were twittering in their corner like a flock of flustered sparrows vanyel found a chair and sat in it before his knees gave out on him withen suddenly seemed to remember the sword in his hand and sheathed it fine weve got tashir taken care of now can any of you tell us what happened vanyel asked wearily the women started and stared at him with fear even his mother everyone except melenna their fear hit him like a blow to the heart making him feel sick that fear gods they never saw me work magic before the stories were juststories now ive conjured myself from highjorune in a night brought a wizardling with me dispelled his magic with a look now im vanyel demonsbane im not anyone they know anymore im not anyone they could know im someone with powers they dont understand someone to fear he could deal with this now or let the situation worsen he chose for the heralds chose to withdraw himself vanyel inside a kind of mental shell and let heraldmage vanyel come to the fore ladies please the heraldmage said gently and with a winning smile exerting all the charm he had this is important to all of you if im to understand what set the lad off the idea is to keep him from doing it again after all one or two tittered nervously the rest looked at him with wide frightened eyes then after a moment during which his smile remained steady they relaxed a little his heart sank when melenna worked her way to the front of the group he wasnt hoping for much coherency out of her but she was surprisingly calm lady treesa found the young man with medren she said quietly her eyes downcast shes been terribly curious about him well we all were really so she ordered him to come with her to the solar and present himself properly right then he didnt want to well thats what medren said but she ordered him so he followed her he was very polite but even i could see that he was very unhappy and the more treesa asked about his family because he told us who he was right off the unhappier he got as soon as treesa noticed it that was when she did like she does with you milord van you know she gets sortof flirty but at the same time she starts getting very mothering she got up and started to go to him to put him at ease and he sort of jumped back and one of the couches jumped right between him and treesa it just jumped like a trained dog or something lady treesa nearly had heart failure and she screamed she was so surprised that was when tashir went absolutely white and everything in the room began flying around she paused then looked up very shyly with none of her usual coquettishness we were terribly frightened milord van i mean i know you and milady savil are magicians and im sure it all seems very tame to you butweve never seen magic like that furniture just shouldnt do that im going to feel funny sitting on a chair for the next week wondering if its going to take it into its head to fly vanyel almost felt himself liking her for the first time in years i cant say i blame you i keep forgetting most of you have never even seen me do oh this he made a tiny magelight in the center of the palm of his outstretched hand it was about all he had the energy for and it impressed the ladies out of all proportion to its size they oohd and ahd but they did not come any nearer milord van melenna said recapturing his attention theres something you really need to know nothing hit anyone nothing even came close even when those horrid cherubs hit the wall and shattered no one was cut no one was hurt and do you know that almost made the whole thing scarier vanyel nodded this incident only confirmed his feeling that the youngster couldnt have been guilty of that wholesale slaughter in lineas if he didnt remember what had happened it could have been sheer terror that made his mind hide the memory but he found himself seeing the other possibilities that works both ways he could have done it just as lores pointed out and because hes basically a good lad the sheer horror of what he did made his mind hide the memory so deeply there was no sign of it he shivered in a preoccupied way and drifted out of the bower ignoring the following gazes of treesa her ladies and melenna he dressed and ate all in a fog comprised of weariness and preoccupation it was hours later when he finally faced the obviousthat hed put a very vulnerable young man in the hands of someone who had abused him he wouldnt would he oh gods he went looking for jervis in a state of increasing alarm and found him in the salle working out against the pells and by the time he found the armsmaster he was ready to kill the man himself if jervis had even thought of bullying the boy bluff him he doesnt know how worn out i am if i go on the offensive right away he wont have time to think planting both feet firmly on the sanded wooden floor he took an aggressive stance arms crossed over his chest jervis he called loudly enough to be heard over the racket of practice blade against pells the armsmaster pivoted and pulled off his helm he must have been at the exercise for some time sweat beaded his brow and dripped oif the ends of his hair aye vanyel did not move one word for you i dont know what this game youve been playing with me means and at this point i dont dare take any chances im warning you now harm medren harm tashir youll be dealing with me not herald vanyel plain vanyel ashkevron and you know now i can take you any time any place with magic or without and i wont hesitate to use any weapon ive got jervis flushed looked dumbfounded harm em me what dyou take me for the man who broke my arm jervis the man whos been trying to intimidate me on this very floor for the past week the man that was too damned inflexible to suit the style to the boy so he tried to break the boy jervis flung his helm down going scarlet with anger the helm dented the floor and rolled off dammit you fool dont you see that was what i was tryin tdo i was tryin tlearn your damned style and for medren hellfire a fool could see that poor little sprout medren was no more suited t my way then puttin armor on a palfrey vanyel felt as if someone had just dropped him into a vat of cold water he blinked relaxed his stance and blinked again feeling poleaxed is getting to become a regular occurrence he thought trying to get his jaw hinged again his knees were trembling so much with reaction that he wasnt certain theyd hold him jervis saved him the trouble he threw his gear over into his chest at the side of the practice area stalked over to vanyels side and took his elbow look he said gruffly im tired and weve got a lot between us that needs talking about lets go get a damned drink and settle it i shouldnt be drinking unwatered wine this tired vanyel thought regarding the plain clay mug jervis was filling with unease it seemed jervis had already thought of that here he said taking a loaf of coarse bread a round of cheese and a knife out of the same cupboard that had held the mugs and wine bottle and shoving them across the trestle table at vanyel eat something first or youll be sorry not a good idea t be guzzling this stuff if you aint used t it but theres some pain between us boy and i need the wine t get it out even if you dont they were still in the armory in a little back room that was part office part repair shop and part infirmary vanyel was sitting on a cot with his back braced against the wall jervis was on the rooms only chair with the table between and a little to one side of them a table hed cleaned of bits of harness and an arm brace and tools by the simple expedient of sweeping it all into a box and shoving the box under the table with his foot the armsmaster followed his own advice by hacking off a chunk of bread and cheese and bolting it before taking a long swallow of his wine vanyel did the same a little more slowly jervis sat hunched over for a long moment his elbows on his knees contemplating the contents of the mug held between his callused hands do you begin van asked awkwardly or should i me your father jervis began and coughed you know i owe him owe him for takin me on permanent oh he owed me some a little matter of watchin his back once but not what i figured would put me here as armsmaster so i figure that put me on the debit side of the ledger eh well that was all right for a while though it werent no easy thing makin fighters out of a bunch of plowboys an second an third sons what couldnt find the right end of a spear with both hands an a map your grantherhe reckoned it best thire what he needed your fatherhe figured best t train his own an that was why he kept me gods plowboys kids it was a damn mess no it werent easy but i did it i did it an then along comes you firstborn an withen calls in the real debt the former mercenary sighed and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand he gave vanyel a measuring look before taking another drink and continuing i spect by now it aint gonna come as a surprise t hear your old man figured you for whatre they sayin now shaych yeah figured you for that from the time you came outa the nursery times were you looked more girl than boy gah that stuck in his craw for sure hangin about with liss fightin shy of th fosterboys then you took up with music an gods he was sure of it figured he could cure you if he made sure you never knew there was such a thing and he got somebody t beat you into shape that somebody was spposed t be me he stabbed a gnarled thumb toward his chest and snorted me kernos horns make the boy a man he says i dont care what you have to do just make im a man an every day just about askin me how you was shapin up i been under pressure before but damn this was enough t make an angel sweat i owed that man an what the hell was i supposed t do tell him i never saw no beatins turn no kids from fey if that was how they was bent tell him there were no few of the meres his fatherd hired was shieldmates an looked about as fey as me an fought like hells own demons you could have tried jervis snarled a little and lose my place you think theres jobs for old meres round any corner i was flat desperate boy what in hell was i supposed to do vanyel bit back his resentment i didnt know he said finally i didnt guess jervis grimaced you werent supposed to boy well hell my style suited you you poor little scrap bout as well as teats on a bull bout the same as medren if you knew that vanyel bit back his protest yeah i knew it i just couldnt face it then you went all stubborn on me you damned well wouldnt even try an i didnt know what the hell t do i was bout ready t bust out you made me so damned mad an your old da on me every time i turned around an if that werent enough gods i useta get nightmares bout you nightmares vanyel asked he knew he sounded skeptical mostly because he was yeah nightmares jervis said defensively shit you cant live on the damn border without seein fightin sooner or later an you likely t get shoved out there with no more sense of what t do t keep yourself alive than a butterfly look smart boy you was firstborn you bet i figured you for bein right in th front line some day an i figured you for dead when that happened an i dont send childer outa my damned hands t get killed dammit his face twisted and his shoulders shook for a moment and he finished off the wine in his mug at a single gulp vanyel could sense more pain than hed ever dreamed the old man could feel behind that carvedgranite face somewhere some time jervis had sent illprepared childer out of his hands to fight and die and the wounds were with him still his own anger began to fade well thats what you were headin straight for boy an i just plain didnt know how t keep it from happening you made me so damned mad an then your old man just gave me too much leash told me i had a free hand with you an i lost it i went an took the whole mess out of your hide he shook his head staring at the floor and his hands trembled a little where he was clutching the empty mug i lost my damned temper boy im not proud of that im not proud of myself should have known better but every time you whined it just made me madder an i was wrong dead wrong in what i was trying t force into you i knew it an that made me mad too then you pulled that last little stunt that was it you ever thought about what you did i never stopped thinking about it vanyel replied after first swallowing nearly half the contents of his own mug the wine could not numb the memories recollections that were more acid on the back of his tongue than the cheap red wine he looked fiercely into jerviss eyes i hated you he admitted angrily if id had a real knife in my hands that day i think id have gone for your throat all the bitterness hed felt then and after rose in his gullet tasting of bile he struggled against his closing throat to ask the question that had never been answered and had plagued him for more than a decade why jervis why he got past his clenched jaw if you knew what i was doing why did you lie and tell father i was cheating silence jervis stared at him with anger mixed with shame but it was the shame that won out because i couldnt admit i was wrong jervis replied subdued and flushing a dark red because i couldnt admit it to myself or anybody else couldnt believe a kid had come up with the answer i couldnt find so i told withen youd cheated half believed it myself couldnt see how youdve touched me otherwise but i ive had a lot of time t think about it years since you left an you turnin out the way you did a herald an all shit anybody turned out like that wouldnt cheat came to me after a while i never caught you in a lie neither came to me that the only lies bein told were the ones i was tellin then when i started t tell myself the truth began t figure out how close i came t breakin moren your arm he hung his head and he wouldnt look at vanyel and vanyel found his anger and bitterness flowing away from him like water from melting ice boy i was wrong and i am sorry for it he said quietly i told withen the truth a while back when they sent you out on the karsite border told him everything i just told you he didnt know what they was sendin you to but i did damn i if anythin had happened an i hadnt told him he shuddered i told him more things best i could told him that hes got a damned fine son an that there have been plenty of shieldmated fighters ida been glad t have at mback an id ye trusted with m last coin and firstborn kid an just as many lads whose tastes ran t wenchin that idve just as soon set up against a tree an shot told him if he let that stand between him an you he was a bigger fool than me did m best for you boy gonna keep on with it too figure if i tell him enough he might start believin me an van im damned sorry it took me so long t figure out how wrong i was there was profound silence then while vanyel waited for his thoughts and emotions to settle into coherency jervis was as silent as a man of rock eyes fixed on the floor the cricket in the salle broke off its singing and vanyel could hear the thud of hooves and sharp commands faint and muffled as tarn took one of the young stallions around on the lunge just outside finally everything within him crystallized into a new pattern vanyel took jervis mug from limp fingers and refilled it but instead of giving it back he offered the armsmaster his own outstretched hand the former mercenary looked up at him in surprise one of the first times vanyel had ever seen the man register surprise and began to smile tentatively at first then with real feeling he took vanyels hand in both of his and swallowed hard thank you boy he said hoarsely i wasnt sure youd youre a better man than oh hell vanyel shrugged and handed him his refilled mug lets call it truce i was a brat and if you hadnt done what you did i wouldnt be a herald and i wouldnt have had lendel listen jervis said after first clearing his throat about medren that boy has no future here a blind man could see that what with all the rightborn boys an i couldnt see that one bein happy as anybodys dogsbody squire you know figured the only chance for him was the way i came up mere armsman lord kernos knows hes got all the brains t make officer right quick so thats what i was tryin to work him to there was music yeah his other shot was maybe music id heard him boy sounded all right but what the hell do i know about music not a damn thing but i figured i figured i could make a damned fine armsman out of him what with his reactions an his brains an speed an all if i could just figure out what theyd taught you over to haven been tryin damn if i havent been tryin could not seem tget it worked out an shit van hate t use th boy like a set of pells but it seemed like th only way t work it out was to work it out usin him but jervis held up a knotted finger just on th chance th boy was good at the plunkin i been damned careful of his hands damned careful vanyels arm began to ache and he put his mug down to rub it i never did get all the feeling back he said still resentful still feeling the last burn of the anger hed nursed all these years if things hadnt turned out the way they did even being careful you could have hurt him and ruined his chance at music jervis visibly stifled an angry retort but in the face of vanyels own anger winced and looked away cant undo what i did boy he said after an uncomfortable silence nobody can but the least i can do is keep from makin the same mistake twice an i was tryin i swear it vanyel sat on his anger jervis gulped his wine truth now between you an me were you any good did i no vanyel said honestly i didnt have the gift and its taken a while but i learned how to make up for the lost feeling you didnt take anything away from me not really jervis shoulders sagged a little how about the bastard medren i mean im sponsoring him into the bardic collegium hes better than i was at fifteen and hes got the bardic gift vanyel nodded at jervis swift intake of breath exactly hell make a full bard the memory suddenly sprang up unprompted of medren and his succession of bruises just bruises nasty ones some of them but not broken bones not even sprains no worse than vanyel had seen his brothers and cousins sport back in the long ago and vanyel began to look a little closer at those memories while jervis stared at him askance finally he began to smile it just occurred to me medren with a full gift he has been manipulating me the little demon using that gift of his doing it just fine too and with no bardic training given that id say hes going to be outstanding and i think id better have a little word with him on the subject of ethics jervis chuckled i dont think its a purpose at least i dont think he knows he shouldnt hes another one thats good at bottom an let me tell you even without havin a decent style hes no slouch with a blade vanyel cut them both more bread and cheese and reached for the wine to refill both mugs he leaned back against the wall with a feeling that something that had been festering for a long time had begun to heal he didnt like jervis quite not yet anyway but he was beginning to see why jervis had done what hed done and beginning to respect the courage that made the armsmaster admit if belatedly that he was wrong you know vanyel said slowly hell be taught blade right along with music bards end up finding themselves in some fairly unpleasant places from time to time theyre in valdemars service no less than heralds are so being handy with a sword surely cant hurt hellfire you should have seen bard chadran in his prime hed have been a match for both of us together jervis looked up with interest chadran that the one that was spposed t have got picked up by bandits got em t trust im then fought himself an a handful of prisoners loose thats the one only he went in on elspeths request when he finished that story jervis managed to coax the shadow stalker tale out of him after half the bottle was gone most people never heard the real story it took half a bottle before he was ready to face those memories before that tale was over and the bottle was empty vanyel had decided he had an ally he could count on he was certain of it after jervis final words when vanyel got up to leave never understood heralds before the armsmaster admitted never could figure out what all the fuss and feathers was about didnt really have any notion of what you people did until them stories about you started up never paid much attention t who the hero was before then i started noticin that in the valdemar songs most of the heroes turn out t be heralds somethin else i started noticin most of the heralds ended up comin down with a serious case of dead in them stories you come pretty close to it a time or two eh vanyel nodded ruefully stretching sore muscles stupidity mostly jervis snorted my ass wasnt stupidity so muchs puttin yourself in harms way right so tell me this a mere like me he puts himself on the line for money knows what he bought himself into knows what hell get out of it if he lives an he only gives so much what he was paid for but not past it but you you heralds whats in it for you i mean look at you right now youve about wore yourself down to a thread somethin no mere would do and you showed up here in th same state what for vanyel shook his head its hard to tell you its a feeling more than anything something like a priestly vocation i would guess he looked inside himself for the answer an answer he hadnt really looked for since he first realized what it was that had made tylendel need to be a herald i do it because i have to because im needed there isnt anybody im not boasting jervis you can ask savil there isnt anybody else in the whole kingdom that can do what i can do i cant give up i cant just shrug things off and tell myself somebody else will take up the slack because there isnt anybody else there are too many people out there who need my protection because im this powerful i have an obligation to use that power im the lone guard at the gate i darent give up because theres nobody behind me to take up what i lay down jervis face went absolutely still vanyel wished he knew what the old man was thinking nobody he asked vanyel shook his hair out of his eyes nobody he echoed staring into space i have no choice its that or know my inaction dooms others sometimes lots of others too many times others i know and care for jerviss eyes grew deep and thoughtful and vanyel could feel them on his back as he left headed for the bathhouse there was a light tap at vanyels door that woke him from the nap he was trying to take in part to make up for the sleep he had been losing to melenna it hadnt been a very successful attempt he was still too on edge his mind was too active he yawned and then grinned identifying medren by a stray thoughtwisp so weve recovered from the measles hmm and about to have a little moment of truth with uncle vanyel or rather though he doesnt know it herald vanyel come he said sitting up and stretching then swinging his legs off the bed vanyel medren plodded into the room and sagged down into the window seat can i hide up here i just found out from young meke that old jervis is gonna have some special demonstration this afternoon and you know what that means the boy shuddered good old medren for pells actually no not this time vanyel grinned it means good old radevel for pells ive been teaching rad my style and the pells plan on giving jervis as good as he gets then you and radevel will have at each other while i coach so jervis can watch he says he wants to know my style because sooner or later hes going to get another puny un and some time this week my young friend you will have another sparring partner once i recover you and i are going to pair off and ill run you around the field for a while and meanwhile well find out what tashir is good for the boys mouth dropped open and vanyel continued mercilessly this is for your benefit bardic collegium includes bladework for bards right along with the music lessons and i wanted you to have as much of a head start as possible a bards duty has been known to carry him into some dangerous places and the bardic circle cant spare guards to tag along behind you to keep you out of trouble the boys mouth worked but for a long moment no sound emerged oh he said weakly i ah medren i have a very serious question to ask you vanyel let the smile drop from his mouth and eyes and moved to stand over the boy when you were fishing for my sympathy what else were you doing and dont tell me that you werent doing anything we both know better than that i the boy gulped and dropped his eyes i was trying to make you feel sorry for me thats why i was kind of playing while i was talking to you singing but not singing you know putting music behind what i was doing i it feels sort of like when i really get taken up by a song like im pushing something only with the inside of my head did you ever think about whether that was a good idea vanyel asked with no inflection in his voice no not really a long pause then medren hung his head it isnt is it he asked in a very small and very subdued voice i was doing something i shouldnt have i i guess its something like being a bully because youre bigger than somebody isnt it vanyel nodded relief relaxing his shoulders good he knows now he saw it for himself hell be all right but he spoke sternly it is and if you do it at bardic theyll have the heralds block your gift and theyll turn you out that is your gift this ability to make people feel what you want them to feel through music and there are only three times its permissible for you to use that gift when youre performing when youre helping someone who needs help and at the kings orders yessir medren whispered head sunk between his shoulders where hed pulled it when vanyel spoke of having his gift blocked and being turned out of the collegium nossir ill remember youd better on this you get one chance now come on lad vanyel said with a renewal of cheerfulness urging medren up out of his chair and propelling him out the door with a hand behind his shoulders time for you to show those plowhorse cousins of yours how a real fighter does things nine they returned to his room after practice vanyel had thought to give medren another music lesson but even though he hadnt done any fighting he realized as he directed medrens movements that he was drained and that was long before the practice was over medren was no fool he could see how exhausted vanyel was he suggested that the lesson be put off he even offered to have servants bring vanyels dinner to his room vanyel accepted both offers he bolted the food as soon as the servant brought it and threw himself facedown on his bed again with a groan the bed had somehow been made up in his absence despite all the hurlyburly in treesas bower baby heralds wrecking rooms adult heralds making magic gates and then falling through them halfdead a possible war on the border and still somehow the beds get made what a world he tried to think of what he would have done if tashir hadnt run berserk and realized he hadnt yet spoken with yfandes she probably knew what was going on of course since the moment he had first accepted the notion of becoming a herald she had made a habit which he encouraged of eavesdropping on just about everything as a kind of silent observer in the back of his mind he didnt in the least mind her using his eyes and ears it saved a lot of explaining and if there was something he didnt want her present for hed tell her but it was very rude of him not to have said something at least in greeting before this he rolled over on his back and closed his eyes fandes he called tentatively im sorry i got tangled and then i fell on my nose for a while and then i had a visit to make and then i had a visitor myself she chuckled so i saw youre forgiven have you got anything for me im sorry i made you run all the way home instead of taking the shortcut youre forgiven and oddly enough she replied promptly i have got something for you brightest gods let me tell you it hasnt been the easiest information to obtain and i am not sorry i was apart from you for a bit i am very glad you were far away by the time you completed the gate i felt your pain quite enough as it was the love in her mind voice softened her words the young one i have taken to calling him ghost for he has been haunting this place like the veriest spirit never coming near enough to touch and only rarely to be seen and frightening the farmers no end he is quite closely locked into his chosens mind i can speak with him but only distantly most of his attention and his concentration are with tashir but i can mindtouch with him as you cannot his chosen mindtouch does not frighten him and so because of the close bond between him and the youngling i can sometimes pick up things as if i was in mindtouch with tashir overtones of deep uneasiness the youngling is something less than steady his mind is fragile and unbalanced there are terrible things which haunt him and which he fears to tell and which he even blocks from his thoughts still ghost may yet balance him if he can regain balance the stallion is something of a mindhealer vanyel sat bolt upright a mindhealer a companion but it happens from time to time she interrupted the overtones of her mindvoice telling him clearly that she was very reluctant to speak of it it happens when it is needed listen i was in mindtouch when the boy was making such a ruin of treesas bower and i remained in touch i saw what you only glimpsed here it was a feeling she sent as well as an image a feeling of profound trust and the image of an older man much like jervis in practice armor looks like jervis may be our key vanyel mused lying back down again and putting his hands behind his head could that man have been deverans armsmaster i cannot tell you that is all i could obtain she replied tashir is much too traumatized for any questioning i would say he she slipped out of the link for a moment then slipped back in again he is better steadier and jervis is with him again they are taking supper in the great hall though with the servants not the family but i would not disturb him he winced at the thought even if i wanted to im not up to dealing with him beloved he confessed feeling every joint in his body ache im not entirely certain i could contain him again i am about down to my last dregs this is getting to be a habit id rather not have then rest this wont be solved in a day he grimaced silently i know i told savil that i have more questions than answers like why are highjorune and that palace built where they are i cant believe that its accident why are the people of lineas so against magic and yet have no laws forbidding its use where did deveran want to send tashir and why did the prospect frighten him enough to defy his father in public and why is the boy so afraid of women that a bowerful could send him skirting the edges of hysteria he made a mental shrug i know some of those questions seem trivial yet it all ties together somehow but how rest yfandes repeated then mischievously there is at least one thing you will not need to beware of which is visitors in your bed i do believe you have frightened melenna enough that she is thinking about things you might choose to do with her such as flying her out the window in the nude he laughed aloud and decided to stay in his room right now what he wanted was some quiet and solitude three days of unconsciousness seems to make for insomnia he thought after trying to fall asleep for what seemed like half the night he gave up finally and moved to the window seat he lit the candle beside it the ordinary way from the coals in the fireplace and found a book it was a volume of history he would have found perfectly fascinating under normal circumstances but he found himself rereading pages two and three times and still not getting the sense of them he abandoned it in favor of the new gittern letting his fingers wander across the strings as he tried to relax it was earlier than hed thought this evening was very much like the one three nights ago cool and crisp with a light breeze the moon was waning now into her last quarter so there was less light but the same kind of clouds raced across her face gods how life can change in one night this afternoon had been hard hard on emotions dealing with jervis purging that old hate and before that tashir seeing tashir in daylight looking so much like tylendel only a younger more vulnerable tylendel had reawakened all the old hurt and loss he was trying to deal with the young man as himself but it was not easy not with his insides in knots every time tashir turned those eloquent eyes on him all he wanted to do was take the young man in his arms and never mind and is that because he looks like lendel or is it because of me he picked out the refrain of shadowlover as he tried to sort himself out i dont know what i am anymore shavri and randi theyre more to me than friends and shavri more than randi a lot more i dont know what that means i just dont now tashir hellfire but the reason is it because hes attractive or because he reminds me of lendel he tried to think if hed ever been the least bit attracted to any other women but shavri and couldnt think of any but how much of that is because they kept throwing themselves at me gods i hate being pursued i especially hate being pursued in public and the idea of going to bed with somebody i dont care for his stomach knotted gods gods where does friendship end and love start how much of my being shaych was being shaych and how much was just because of lendel his unhappy thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door and he started hed already dealt with medren melenna was not likely to show up according to yfandes he wasnt expecting anyone not even savil he turned away from the window with the gittern cradled against his chest and racked the instrument carefully he walked soundlessly across the room and answered the door just as the wouldbe visitor made a second more tentative knock it was tashir pale as bleached linen with the eyes of a lost soul as vanyel stood there stupidly the young man slipped inside and closed the door behind him putting his back to it and facing vanyel with a fearfilled and haunted expression a strange expression vanyel could not interpret and in the dim light the young man looked even more like tylendel vanyels heart seemed to be squeezed up into an area just below his throat and his chest hurt i heard you playing the youngster said hoarsely i wouldnt have troubled you if you hadnt been awake can i bother you please sit vanyel managed finding it very hard to get his breath certainly youre welcome here and it isnt bothering me how can i help you the young man walked hesitantly toward the table and paused with his hands on the back of one of the chairs he looked back over his shoulder at vanyel his face thank the gods was in shadow vanyel succeeded in getting two full breaths in a row jervis says youre shaych tashir whispered are you vanyel moved over to the other chair and motioned him to sit he did so but on the very edge of the chair vanyel had a flash of image a young stag at the edge of a bright meadow in the midst of hunting season which was also mating season wanting needing looking for something not knowing what he needed and full of fear and less definable emotions its no secret vanyel replied cautiously unable to predict what was coming yes yes i am would you be my lover tashir blurted desperately vanyel found he needed to sit down he did just before his legs refused to hold him he stared at tashir quite unable to speak for a moment do you have any idea what youre doing to me lad no you cant poor boy poor confused child he gathered his emotions and put a tight rein on them the youngster did not have the feel of shayachern not in any way this was the last question vanyel would ever have expected from him and his initial reaction was to tell him no and yet and yet he looked so like tylendel and ive enough experience i could be certain hed enjoy it was the unbidden thought i could convince him he was it would be so easy and im so lonely oh gods oh gods the temptation instead of answering he stood slowly and moved to stand before the boy gently reaching out and placing the fingers of his right hand just beneath the line of tashirs jaw ostensibly this was to make the youngster look up into his eyesbut vanyel wanted to know something of what was going on in the young mans mind and if he could not mindtouch well physical contact made his empathy much sharper as the dark eyes met his silver he could feel the youngsters pulse racing beneath the tip of his middle finger and the feel he received was of fear and unhappiness not attraction not in the slightest that was both relief and disappointment why vanyel asked much more calmly than he felt striving with all his might for impartiality why do you want me as a lover tashir flushed and his fear deepened and there was something new shame it this afternoon he stammered lady treesa i was so i i she vanyel she his voice dropped to a humiliated whisper she scares me ladies scare me i oh vanyel made the one word speak volumes not of contempt but understanding and compassion now i think i see what the problem is and why youre here my mother frightened you and women in general frighten you so you think you must be shayachern right tashir nodded a little and paled again vanyel sternly told his insides to leave him alone they didnt listen they ached he ignored them grateful that training had made it possible for him to control his voice and his face if not his emotions well lets really analyze this before we go making assumptions shall we do you know my aunt herald savil have you met her formally yet the o the lady who was with you now vanyel picked up only respect mixed with the goodnatured contempt of the young for the old does she frighten you he halfsmiled stiffly she should you know shes a terrible tyrant tashir shook his head how about kylla shes the baby whos always getting out of the nursery usually without a stitch on i expect shes done it at least once while i was sleeping does she bother you bewilderment shes kind of cute why should i be afraid of her vanyel worked his way up and down the age scale of all the women at forst reach that he thought the youngster might have seen only when he neared women between twenty and treesas age did he get any negative responses and when he mentioned a particularly pretty fourteenyearold niece there was definite interest and real attraction from time to time vanyel dropped in questions about his feelings toward men not just himself but jervis medren some of the servants the youngster had encountered and at no time even as he began to relax did tashir evidence any attraction to men in general or vanyel in particular except perhaps as a protector certainly not as a potential lover whenever that topic came up the fear came back finally vanyel sighed and took his hand away it ached ached as badly as the injured left did when it rained he rubbed it wishing he could massage away the ache in his own heart tashir let me say that im very flattered but no i will not oblige you because youve come to me for all the wrong reasons you arent here because you know youre shayachern you arent even here because youre attracted to me youre here because women of a certain age frighten you thats not enough to base a relationship on not the kind youre asking me for you dont know what you want you only know what you dont want but the youngster said his eyes all pupil but you when you were younger than me jervis said vanyel had to look away he couldnt bear that gaze any more when i was younger than you i knew what i was and i knew what i wanted and who i wanted it with youre looking for for someone to like you for someone to be close to youre just grasping at something that looks like a solution and youre hoping ill make up your mind for you and i could do that you know even without using magic i could probably convince you that you were shayachern at least for a little while i could do things say things to you that would make you very infatuated with me he paused and forced a breath into his tight chest looking back down at tashir s bewildered eyes but that wouldnt solve your problems it would only let you postpone finding a solution for a while and i truly dont think that would help you in the least any answers you find tashir are going to have to be answers you decide on for yourself here he offered the youngster his hand tashir looked at it in surprise then tentatively put his own hand in vanyels he looked even more surprised when vanyel hauled him to his feet put his palm between his shoulderblades and shoved him gently toward and out the door go to bed tashir vanyel said trying to make his tones as kindly as he could you go have another chat with jervis go riding with nerya try making some friends around the reach well talk about this later and he shut the door on him softly but firmly he began to shake then and clung to the doorframe to keep himself standing erect he leaned his forehead against the doorpanel for a long time before he stopped trembling when he thought he could walk without stumbling he turned and went back to his chair and sat down in it heavily he hurt oh gods he hurt he felt so empty and twice as alone as before he stared at the candleflame while it burned down at least half an inch trying to thaw the adamantine lump of frozen misery in his stomach and having a resounding lack of success you did the right thing chosen the bright voice in his mind was shaded with sympathy and approval both i know i did he replied around the ache what else could i do just tell me beloved why cant i feel happy about it why does doing the right thing have to hurt so damned much she had no answer for him but then he hadnt really expected one if i were just a little less ethical and how much of that is because he looks like lendel gods it isnt just my heart that hurts and im so damned lonely eventually he slept it took a week before he felt anything like normal challenging jervis when he had been straight out of his bed had been pure bluff he wouldnt have been able to stand against the armsmaster for more than a few breaths at most he wondered if jervis had guessed that arms practice was interesting he and jervis circled around each other equally careful with words and blows there was so much between them that was only halfhealed at best that it was taking all his skill at diplomacy to keep the wounds from reopening and no little of that was because it sometimes seemed that jervis might be regretting his little confession but they were civil to each other and working with each other which was a damn sight more comfortable than being at war with each other that boys got moren a few problems van jervis said leaning on his sword and watching tashir work out with medren the young man was being painstakingly careful with the younger boy and he was wearing the first untroubled expression vanyel had seen on his face and for once there was no fear in him for once he was just another young man a little more considerate of the smaller younger boy than most but still just another young man i know vanyel replied shifting his weight from his right foot to his left and i know you arent talking about fighting style he chewed his lip a little and decided to ask the one question that would decide whether or not he was going to be able to carry out the plan hed made in the sleepless hours of the last several nights tell me do you feel up to handling him by yourself for a bit youll have savil in case he does anything magical again though i dont think he will but i dont think hell open up to savil the way he will to you jervis gave him a long look out of the corner of his eye and just where are you going to be vanyel looked straight ahead but spoke in a low voice that was just loud enough for jervis to hear him the fewer who knew about this the better across the border all the answers to our questions are over there including the biggest question of all if tashir didnt rip a castle full of people to palmsized pieces who did and why and away from him maybe i can get my thinking straight jervis considered his words as the clack and thwack of wooden practice blades echoed up and down the salle how long do you think youll be out over there youre not going as yourself i hope no he smiled wanly a herald was not going to be a popular person in highjorune right now ive got a disguise thats been very useful in the past herald vanyel is still going to be resting in the bosom of his family the gentleman whos going to cross the border is a rather scruffy minstrel named valdir nobody notices a minstrel asking questions theyre supposed to and since the only person who saw my face clearly is now on his way to haven with a rock in his craw i should be safe i expect to take a fortnight at most get that guard up medren huh sounds good to me gods know we arent getting any answers out of the boy at the moment whats savil say vanyel winced as medren got in a particularly good score on tashir that she never could stand clandestine work so shes not about to venture an opinion fathers not to know savil is going to tell him im visiting with liss yfandes is in favor since shes going to be with me most of the time and within reach when shes not actually with me jervis shoulders relaxed a trifle that had me worried a bit but if youre taking the white lady i got no objections if she cant get you out of a mess nobody can i got a lot of respect for that pretty little thing tell him thank you chosen vanyel grinned jervis unlike withen had no problem remembering that yfandes was not a horse hed always offered her respect since he and vanyel had made their uneasy peace hed offered her the same kind of treatment shed have gotten from another herald yfandes was a person to jervis a little oddly shaped but a person jervis actually got along with her better than he did with vanyel she says to tell you thank you i think she likes you shes a lovely lady and i like her right back jervis grinned at him theres been a couple of times ive wished i could talk to her straight out i kind of wanted her to know im real pleased that shes on my side these days tashir the boy wont break put some back in that swing hes supposed to learn how to get out of the way dammit jervis stalked onto the floor of the salle and vanyel took the opportunity to get back to his room and pack up there was one other person who needed to know where vanyel was going to be medren this was in part because vanyel needed to borrow his old lute disreputable minstrel valdir could never afford herald vanyels lute or the twelve stringed gittern and going in clandestine like this vanyel knew hed better have no discrepancies in his persona vanyel had a battered old instrument hed picked up in a pawn shop that he carried as valdir but hed left it at haven not thinking hed need it but there was a further reason tashir was relaxed and open with the boy in a way he was not with either jervis or vanyel vanyel had come to the conclusion that his nephew was older than his years in a great many ways and vanyel had confidence in his inherent good sense and last of all the boy had the bardic gift that could be very useful in dealing with an unbalanced youngster that no one dared to mindtouch in a kind of bizarre coincidence theyd given medren vanyels old room up and under the eaves and across from the library vanyel stared out the window and wondered if he was still up to the climb across the face of the keep to get to that little casement that let into the library how long do you reckon youll be over there medren asked sitting on his bed and detuning his old instrument carefully not long about a fortnight altogether anything i cant find out in that time is going to be too deep to learn as a vagabond minstrel anyway vanyel turned away from the window you arent planning on going into that palace are you no why medren shook his head i dunno i just got a bad feeling about it like you shouldnt go in there alone as long as i think of you going in with somebody the bad feeling goes away that sound dumb no that sounds eminently sensible vanyel sat down beside him on the bed medren picked up the patched and worn canvas lute case and slid the instrument into it i want you to keep an eye on tashir for me a bardic eye if you will the boy contemplated that statement for a moment whistling between his teeth a little you mean keep him calmed down hes as jumpy as a deer hearing dogs i been trying to do a little of that i he blushed i remembered what you told me about misusing the gift i thought this might be what you meant about using it right he likes music well enough so i just sort of make it soothing vanyel ruffled his hair approvingly and medren gave him an urchinlike grin good lad that is exactly what i meant about using it properly when you arent enhancing a performance proper use is to the benefit of your audience or to the kings orders and poor tashir could certainly benefit by a little soothing so keep him soothed hmm theres one other thing and this is a bit more delicate he may tell you things things about himself i hesitate to ask you to betray confidences but we just dont know anything about him medren thought that over seems to me that the awfuller the thing hed tell me and the less hed want it known the more youd want to know it he chewed his lip thats a hard one thats awful close to telling secrets ive been asked to keep and if ive been making him feel like he could trust me it doesnt seem fair i know but i remind you that hes been accused of murdering fifty or sixty people what he tells you might be a clue to whether or not he actually did it vanyel forestalled medrens protests with an uplifted hand i know what youre going to say and if he did it i dont believe he did it on purpose but if say you found out where it was that his father wanted to send him and why it frightened him so we could have mitigating circumstances i doubt the lineans would totally accept it but we would and he could make a very pleasant home here with the valdemar heralds even if he could never return to lineas thats not exactly a handicap medren nodded so vigorously that his forelock fell into his eyes makes sense fine then if he tells me stuff ill tell it to you the boy stuffed a handful of the little coils of spare lute strings into a pocket on the back of the case and handed the whole to vanyel vanyel stood and pulled the carry strap over his shoulder do i look the proper scruffy minstrel he asked grinning medren snorted youre never going to look scruffy van you do look underfed which is good and if you didnt shave for a couple of days that would be better then again he contemplated vanyel with his head tilted to one side if you didnt shave youd look like a bandit and people dont tell things to bandits better just stick to looking clean starving and pathetic that way womenll feed you and tell you everything while theyre feeding you hey dont worry about that lute if you gotta leave it leave it if you feel bad about leaving it replace it vanyel placed his right hand over his heart and bowed slightly i defer to your judgment clean and starving it is and if speed requires i leave the instrument i shall and i shall replace it its a good thing to have one old instrument that you neednt worry about you never know when youll want to take one oh on a picnic or something thank you medren for everything he glanced out the window i want to get to highjorune by nightfall so wed better get on it remember im supposed to be on a side trip to see liss i sent her a message by one of savils birds so liss knows to cover for me medren nodded right and ill keep a tight eye on tashir for you best i can thats all i can ask of anyone sunset was a thing of subdued colors muted under a pall of gray clouds vanyel slipped off yfandes back and uncinched the strap holding the folded blanket hed used as a makeshift riding pad bareback for most of a day would not have been comfortable for either of them but he had no place to hide her harness no problem theyd solved this little quandary the first time he became minstrel valdir she wore no halter at all and only the blanket that he would use if he had to sleep in stables or on the floor of some inn nothing to hide and nothing to explain yfandes would keep herself fed by filching from farms and freegrazing if she got too hungry hed buy or steal some grain and toss it out over the wall to her at night be careful she said nuzzling his cheek i love you ill be staying with you as much as i can but this is awfully settled land i may have to pull off quite a ways to keep from getting caught i have all that currentenergy to pull on if i have to call you he reminded her its not the node but it wouldnt surprise me to find out i could boost most of the way back to forst reach with it im planning on recharging while im here anyway if vedric is still here that could be dangerous only if he detects it he cupped his hand under her chin and gazed into those bottomless blue eyes ill be careful i promise this isnt karse but im going to behave as if it was enemy territory and full drill then im satisfied she tossed her head flicking her forelock out of her eyes call me if you need me i will he watched her fade into the underbrush of the woodlot beside him with a feeling of wonderment how something that big and that white could justvanish like that it never ceased to amaze him he rolled the cinchbelt folded the blanket and stuffed both into the straps of his pack with a sigh for his poor feet he hitched the lute strap a little higher on his shoulder and headed toward the city gates of highjorune the road was dusty and before he reached the gates he looked as if hed been afoot all day he joined the slow shuffling line of travelers and workers returning from the farms warehouses and some of the dirtier manufactories that lay outside the city walls farmworkers mostly most folk owning farms within easy walking distance of highjorune lived within the city walls as did their hirelings a cautious holdover from the days when mavelan attacks out of baires penetrated as far as the throne city the eyes of the guard at the gate flickered over him noted the lute the threadbare starveling aspect and the lack of weaponry and dismissed him all in a breath minstrel valdir was not worth noting which made minstrel valdir very happy indeed well the first thing a hungry minstrel looks for is work and valdir was no exception to that rule he found himself a sheltered corner out of the traffic and began to assess his surroundings the good corners were all taken by a couple of beggars a juggler and a man with a dancing dog he shook his head as if to himself nothing for him here so close to the gates he was going to need a native guide he loitered about the gate waiting patiently for the guard to change he put his hat out got the lute in tune and played a little but he really didnt expect much patronage in this outoftheway nook he actually drew a few loiterers much to his own amazement to his further amazement some loiterers had money by the time the reliefguard arrived with torches to install in the holders on either side of the gate hed actually collected enough coppers for a meager supper he had something more than a turnip and stale breadcrust on his mind however it was getting chilly his nose was cold and his patched cloak was doing very little to keep out the bite in the air he chose one of the guards to follow a man who looked as if he ate and drank well and had money in his pocket he slung the lute back over his shoulder and sauntered along after him at a discreet distance it was possible of course that the man was married but he was unranked and young and that made it unlikely there was an old saying to the effect that while higherranked officers had to be married anyone beneath the rank of sergeant was asking for trouble if he chose matrimonial bonds privates cant marry sergeants may marry captains must marry valdir had noticed that no matter the place or the structure of the armed force that old saying tended to hold true so that being the case an unranked man was likely to find himself a nice little inn or taphouse to haunt and establishments of the sort he would frequent would tend to cater to his kind they would have other entertainments as well and they were frequently run by women valdir had traded off his looks to get himself a corner in more than one such establishment the man he was following turned a corner ahead of him and when valdir turned the same corner he knew hed come to the right street every third building seemed to be an alehouse of one sort or another it was brightly lit and women of problematical age and negotiable virtue had set up shop as it were beneath each and every one of the brightly burning torches and lanterns valdir grinned and proceeded to see what he could do about giving those coppers in his purse some company the first inn he stuck his nose into was not what he was looking for it was all too clearly a place that catered to appetites other than hunger and thirst the second was perfect but it had a musician of its own an older man who glared at him over the neck of his gittern in such a way as left no doubt in valdir mind that he intended to keep his cozy little berth the third had dancers and plainly had no need of him not given the abandon with which the young ladies were shedding the scarves that were their principle items of clothing the fourth and fifth were run by men valdir approached them anyway but the owner of the fourth was a minstrel himself and the owner of the fifth preferred his customers with cash to spare to spend it in the dice and card games in the back room the sixth was regrettable the smell drove him out faster than hed gone in but the seventh the seventh had possibilities the inn of the green man it was called it was shabby but relatively clean the common stew in a pot over the fire smelled edible and as if it had more than a passing acquaintance with meat though it was probably best not to ask what species it was populated but not overcrowded and brightly lit with tallow dips and oil lamps which would discourage pickpockets and cutpurses the serving wenches whose other properties were also evidently for sale were also relatively clean they werent fabulous beauties and most of them werent in the first bloom of youth but they were clean there was a good crowd though the place wasnt exactly full and valdir spotted his guide here as well which was a good omen valdir stuck a little more than his nose in the door and managed to get the attention of one of the serving wenches might i have a word with the owner he asked diffidently kitchen said the hardfaced girl and gave him a second look he contrived to appear starving and helpless and she softened just a little back door she ordered best warn you bel dont much like your kind last songbird we had run off with her best girl thank you lady valdir said humbly she snorted and went back to tabletending valdir had to make his way halfway down the block before he could find an accessway to the alley he caught a couple of young toughs eyeing him with speculation but his threadbare state evidently convinced them that he didnt have much to steal that and the insidious little voice in their heads that said not worth bothering with he doesnt have anything worth the scuffle the alley reeked and not just of garbage and he was just as glad that he hadnt eaten since morning he risked a magelight so that he could avoid stepping in anything and when it became evident that there were places he couldnt do that he risked a little more magic to give him a clean spot or two to use as stepping stones kind of funny he thought stretching carefully over a puddle of stale urine it was because i couldnt face situations like this that i never ran away to become a minstrel and now here i am enacting one of my own nightmares funny he finally found the back door of the green man and pushed it open the kitchen also was relatively clean but he didnt get to see much of it because a giantess blocked his view almost immediately if she was less than six feet tall valdir would have been surprised the sleeves of her sweatstained linen shirt were rolled up almost to the shoulder leaving bare arms of corded muscle jervis would have envied she wore breeches rather than skirts which may have been a practical consideration since enough materials to make her a skirt would have made a considerable dent in a lean clothing budget her graying brown hair was cut shorter than valdirs and no one would ever notice her face not when confronted with the scar that ran from left temple to right jawbone an what dyou want she asked her voice a dangeroussounding growl the the usual faltered valdir a place milady a place for a poor songster a place food and drink and a place to sleep in return for some share of whatever paltry coppers ye manage to garner the woman rumbled disgustedly aye and a chance t run off with one o me girls when me backs turned not likely boy and yed better find yerself somewhere else t caterwaul there aint an inn on th row that needs a rhymester valdir made his eyes large and sad and plucked at the womans sleeve as she turned away my lady please he begged shamelessly im newcome with scarce enough coppers to buy a crust i pledge you lady i would treat your other ladies as sisters she rounded on him oh ye would would you gull someone else if yere new come then get ye newgone lady he whimpered ducking her threatened blow lady i swear lady im he let his voice sink to a low halfshamed whisper lady your maids are safe with me more than safe im shaych there are few places open for such as i she stared she gaped and then she grinned struth ye could be at that that pretty face an all shaych i like that she propelled him into the kitchen with a hand like a slab of bacon all right i give ye a chance two meals an a place on th floor for half yer takins he knew he had to put up at least the appearance of bargaining but not much or hed cast doubt on his disguise three meals he said desperately and a quarter she glared at him ye try me she said warningly ye try me temper pretty boy three an half three and half he agreed timidly done an dont think t cheat me me girls be checkin ye right regular now list i got armsmen here mostly i want lively stuff things as put em in mind that me girls serve moren ale none of yer longwinded ballads nor sticky love songs nor yet nothin melancholy not lessn they asks for it an if it be melancholy ye make em cry ye hear make em cry sos me girls an me drink can give em a bit o comfort got that aye lady he whispered dont ye go lookin fer a bedmate mongst them lads neither they wants that theres the page an thats where they go we got us agreements on the row i don sell boys an i don let in streetboys the page don sell girls aye lady ye start yer plunkin at sundown when i open an ye finish when i close rest of th times yer own get yer meals in th kitchen sleep in th common room after closin aye lady now stick yer pack over in that corner sos i know ye aint gonna run off an get out there he shed pack and cloak under her critical eye and tucked both away in the chimney corner he took with him only his lute and his hat and hurried off into the common room with her eyes burning holes in his back she was in a slightly better mood when she closed up near dawn certainly she was mollified by the nice stack of copper coins shed earned from his efforts that it was roughly twice the value of the meals shed be feeding him probably contributed to that good humor that no less than three of the prettiest of her girls had propositioned him and been turned down probably didnt hurt she was pleased enough that she had a thin straw pallet brought down out of the attic so that he wouldnt be sleeping on the floor he would be sharing the common room with an ancient gaffer who served as the potboy and the two utterly silent kitchen helpers of indeterminate age and sex her order to all four of them to strip and wash at the kitchen pump relieved him a bit he wasnt looking for comfort but he had hoped to avoid fleas and lice when the washing was over he was fairly certain that the kitchen helpers were girls but their ages were still a mystery when bel left she took the light with her leaving them to arrange themselves in the dark valdir curled up on his lumpy pallet wrapped in his cloak and the blanket that still smelled faintly of yfandes and sighed beloved he sent his thoughttendril questing out into the gray light of early dawn after her here are you established fairly well valdirs seen worse at least i wont be poisoned by the food what about you i have shelter good he yawned this is strictly an afterdark establishment if i go roaming in the late morning and early afternoon i should find out a few things i wish that i could help she replied wistfully so do i good night dearheart i cant keep awake anymore sleep well one thing more though before he slept a subtle and very well camouflaged tap into the nearest current of magepower he needed it the tiny trickle he would take would likely not be noticed by anyone unless they were checking the streams inch by inch it wouldnt replenish his reserves immediately but over a few days it would it was a pity he could only do this while meditating or sleeping it was an even greater pity that he couldnt just tap straight in as he had the night hed rescued tashir hed be at full power in moments if he could do that but that would tell lord vedric mavelan that there was another mage here and if it comes to that id rather surprise him hed intended to try and think out some of his other problems but it had been a full day since hed last slept and the walking hed done had tired him out more than he realized he started to try and pick over his automatic reactions to bels girls had he led them on without intending to had he been flirting with them knowing deep down that he was going to turn them down and enjoying the hold his good looks gave over them it was getting so that nothing was simple anymore but before he could do more than worry around the edges of things his exhaustion caught up with him he slept ten boy the harsh whisper in the dark startled him out of unrestful sleep it jerked him into full awareness drymouthed heart pounding boy be ye awake yes valdir replied i am now anyway hot onionladen breath near his elbow lissen boy ye needs warnin the reason this place don prosper bel drinks up th profit valdir calmed his heart nodded to himself that explained a lot id wondered he whispered back she be at the keg in er room right now come mornin shell be up wi a temper like a spring bear she wont go hittin on th girls not them as makes her profit but me an tay an ri be fair game an now you ye take my meanin i think so don doubt me an don go thinkin ye got anywheres else evry inn on th rows got its singster or dancer bels the only one did wiout that be cause she dont care for ye singsters an no dancin girll stay where the profits be so lean how long ye plan on stayin valdir was profoundly grateful that he was not locked into this life i hadnt thought id be here long i really sort of thought id look for a place at the great houses or the palace he began timidly i used to be with a house they mostly keep at least one minstrel and i figure the palace must use the old man choked with laughter and then broke into a fit of terrible coughing valdir acted as would be expected im not that bad he sputtered indignantly im just out of luck lately the old man convulsed again outa moren luck first off there aint no great houses in the city they all be outside the walls second the remoerdis familys dead aint nobody in th palace but ghosts valdir gasped and let the old gaffer tell the tale as he pleased it was amazingly consistent with what lores had told him save only that the herald whod carried off tashir had been seven feet tall cut down a dozen guards and rode away on a fanged white demon an third thing the rheumy voice continued they wouldnt have anyone next or nigh the palace as wasnt blood kin even the servants be blood kin on the backside so even if theyd been alive an yed been t see theyd not ave took ye why valdir asked bewildered that doesnt make any sense what does being blood relation have to do with serving or talent the old man coughed again damn if i know been that way frever anyway im tellin ye if ye wanta keep that purty face purty save yer coppers an get outa here soon as ye can afore the snow flies be best otherwise ol bel likely to start seein how far she can push ye ive warned ye now im goin t sleep and not another word could valdir get out of him he found out how right the warning was the next day when bel stumbled down the stairs redeyed and touchy smelling like a brewery she started in on the two kitchen girls looking for excuses to punish one of them she found plenty the girls sported a black eye each before she was through with them valdir managed to stay out of her way long enough to get his pack and bed stowed safely and his lute placed beside the door but then then he got an unexpected and altogether unpleasant shock bel tried him first flirting then when that brought no result threatening she disgusted and frightened him and he knew he dared not retaliate in any way instead he had to stand and take her pawing while his skin crawled and his stomach churned trying not to show anything except his very real and growing fear of her she finally convinced herself that she wasnt going to get any pleasure out of him in that way so she chose another in the end he escaped with no worse than a darkening bruise on his cheekbone where shed backhanded him into a wall without his promised breakfast or lunch and not willing to endure either more of her clumsy caresses or her brutality to get it he flew out the door as soon as she unlocked it resolving not to return until nightfall and the time appointed for him to perform he paused long enough in his flight to snatch up his lute he would not leave the means of his livelihood unguarded and anyway there might be the chance of making a few coins on the street as he had last night enough maybe to feed him herald vanyel would not have tolerated that treatment but herald vanyel was far far away there was only poor timid valdir fallen indeed on bad luck scrawny fearful and no little desperate gods help her people if i was what im pretending to be i think id go hunting a sharp knife and im not sure if id use it on her first or myself thought you might end up here drawled a strange welltrained voice as he bolted out the door and into the street he turned blinking in the bright sunlight lounging against a wall across the street was the grizzled minstrel whod been playing the gittern in one of the other taverns the night before he was dressed in dull colors that blended with the wall hed taken up a post right opposite the green man he looked bored and lazy as valdir watched him suspiciously he pushed away from the wall and walked slowly toward him across the cobblestones in the light of day he was clearly much older than valdir hair thinning and mostly gray square face beginning to wrinkle and line but as he approached valdir it was also plain that he had kept his body in relatively good shape beneath the loose homespun shirt leather tunic and breeches he had only the tiniest sign of a paunch and the rest of him looked wiry and strong enough to survive just about any tavern brawl to someone like valdir this stranger meant danger of another sort the man could be looking to eliminate a rival or intending to bully him or worse talk about luck being out have i leaped out of the pan into the fire valdir backed up a pace letting his uncertainty show on his face a tired horse pulled a slopswagon down the center of the street and the stranger stepped deliberately toward him once it had passed ah ease up boy im not about to pummel you the minstrel said a faint hint of disgust twisting his lips valdir continued to step back until the minstrel had him trapped in a corner where a fence met the inn wall valdir froze his hands pressed against the unsanded wood behind him and the minstrel reached for his face grabbing his chin in a hand rough with chordingcalluses he turned valdirs cheek into the light and examined the slowly purpling bruise got you a good one did she he touched the edge of the bruise without hurting his captive huhn not as bad as it could be the minstrel let him go and backed up a few steps valdir huddled where he was watching him fearfully the stranger scratched his chin thoughtfully heard you last night when i went on break you arent bad thank you valdir replied timidly youre also going to get your hands broken if you stay with bel for very long the other continued thats what she did to the one before the one that ran off with her girl valdir did not reply well arent you going to say anything why are you telling me all this valdir asked letting his suspicion show he stood up a little straighter and rubbed his sweaty palms on his patched and faded linen tunic in a conscious echoing of an unconscious gesture of nervousness because the one before the one that ran off with her girl was a good lad the older man said impatience getting the better of him he was pretty like you and he was fey like i bet you are and i dont want it happening to another one all right he turned on his heel and started to walk away dont turn away a possible ally wait valdir cried after him please i i didnt mean a bit of breeze blew dry leaves up the street the minstrel halted turned slowly valdir walked toward him holding out his hand im valdir he said shyly ive been north baires the other showed his surprise with a hissing intake of breath i made a bit of a mistake and i had to make a run for it he looked down at his feet then back up again it hasnt been easy not while i was there and not getting across the border to here they got me out of the habit of looking for friends up there and into the habit of looking for enemies renfry said the older minstrel clasping his hand with a slow smile that showed a good set of even white teeth not many real musicians on the row i sppose i should be treating you as a rival but hell a man gets tired of hearing and singing the same damn things over and over bel had jonny for a long while before she ruined him and he trained here what happened to him after i mean we clubbed together and sent him off to a healer the very next day ended up having to send him across the border uppity palace healer didnt want to waste his time on tavern scum never heard anything after that he shrugged if the poor lad ended up not being able to play again i dont imagine hed want anyone to know valdir shuddered genuinely ol bel dont believe in letting the help sample the goods she got drunk and thought jonny had his eye on one of the girls he snorted in contempt not bloody likely she must have slipped up once valdir ventured i mean the one that romanced her girl like you said renfry laughed and started up the dusty nearempty street with valdir following the thin autumn sunlight stretched their shadows out ahead of them she did because she was bedding the fellow herself she never figured him for having the stamina to be doubledipping truth to tell i hope he was good in bed because he surely had a voice like a crow in mating season and maybe four whole chords to his name valdir thought about the way bel had tried to come on to him and could actually feel a shred of sympathy for the unknown minstrel were you waiting out here for me valdir asked as they approached the closed door of the pig and stick the tavern renfry had been playing in last night renfry nodded holding the door to his inn open why to warn you like i said let you know youd better make tracks valdir shook his head and his hair fell over one eye i cant i i havent got a choice he confessed sadly i havent anywhere else to go renfry paused in surprise half in half out of the doorway that lean in the pocket he asked lad you arent that bad youre a good enough musician for true unless you really made more than just a mistake valdir nodded unhappily made a bad enemy sang the wrong song at the wrong time used to be with a house now ive got the clothes on my back my lute and thats mostly it save your coppers and head over the border into valdemar the other advised tell you what ill stand you a drink and a little better breakfast than youd get from old bel then ill steer you over to a decent corner not the best but with the palace a wreck theres a lot of guards standing about with nothing to do but make sure our high and mighty lord visitor doesnt get himself in the way of a stray knife round about the town elders house you ought to collect a bit there hmm he grinned besides i got an underhanded motive youre about as good as me and you know some stuff new to our folk im going to bribe you with food to learn it and then im going to get you out of town so you arent competition anymore valdir smiled back hesitantly at least as far as his sore cheek permitted now that i understand by nightfall bel was sober and when valdir crept in at the open door she waved him to his place on the hearth with nothing more threatening than a scowl he sat down on the raised brick hearth with his bruised cheek to the fire and began tuning the lute there were one or two customers nothing much valdir was just as glad it gave him a chance to think over what hed picked up it had been a very profitable day the town elders servants were entertainmentstarved and loosetongued once valdir had gotten them started they generally ran on quite informatively and at some length before demanding something in return ylyna had been a childbride that made tashirs arrival eightandahalf months after the wedding so much more surprising several of the mavelan girls had been offered as prospective treatyspouse but of them all only ylyna had lacked magepowers so only ylyna had been acceptable to deveran remoerdis or his people it was generally agreed that she was odd even for a mavelan and strangely enough it was also generally agreed that up until the night of the massacre tashir had been a fairly decent if slightly peculiar young man a bit like you lad one of the guards had said jumpin at shadows like nervy if it had not been for his magepowers there likely would have been no objection to his eventual inheritance of the throne of lineas but once those powers manifested it became out of the question no linean would stand by and see a mage take the seat of power we seen what comes o that yonder an aged porter had told him a bit angrily pointing with his chin at the north put a mage in power next thing ye know hes usin magic t get any damn thing e want out o ye no no mages here so as soon as it had become evident that several of tashirs younger brothers all of whom markedly resembled deveran were going to live into adulthood the council demanded that deveran disinherit the boy they didnt have to pressure him according to the lord elders first chambermaid he gave in at once so quickly that the ink wasnt even dry on the copies of the proclamation when his heralds cried the news and strangely enough tashir didnt seem the least unhappy about it didnxactly jump for joy but didn seem t care neither a fruitseller had observed lord vedric that was who valdir assumed was the lord visitor though he was never referred to as anything but that mavelan lord had come as something of a surprise to the folk of highjorune theyd expected him to attempt to defend tashir instead hed listened to the witnesses with calm and sympathy and had expressed his horrified opinion that the boy had gone rogue hed kept displays of magery to a minimum and had made himself available to the council as a kind of advisor until someone figured out how to get tashir back to be punished and until they determined who the new ruler of lineas would be as for the startling resemblance between lord vedric and tashir e said th boy could be is e didnt know one of the chambermaids a pretty one that valdir suspected of getting gossip fodder via pillow talk had whispered sniggering to valdir e said th girl couldn keep er skirts down an that shed bribed er way inta lots o beds takin the place o th girls as was spposed t be there said ed found er in is bed moren once an that e didnt know it were is own alfsister an not the wench ed called fer till mornin that was why e were tryin t keep th boy heir so e says tryin t do right by im like just in case she sniggered again i card nough frm m cousin bout er ighness aner lightskirt ways i believeim and the cousin it seemed had been one of ylynas personal maids more importantly she had been out of the palace the night everyone else had been killed the chambermaid had promised an introduction in a day or two you gonna sit there all night diddlin that thing or you gonna play bel growled breaking into his thoughts with a start and a cowed look he began playing the young girl scampered back to her duties leaving valdir alone with the last surviving member of the palace staff her cousin the woman pondered him for a moment then a trifle reluctantly invited him into her tiny parlor the cousin was old that surprised valdir and the odd look she gave him as he took the seat she indicated surprised him more why are ye askin lad she queried as she settled into her own chair if its just morbid curiosity he rubbed the bruise bel had gifted him with this morning it matched the first and tried to get her measure she was a bit younger than savil and small but proudly erect there was something very dignified about her and out of keeping with her purported position she didnt hold herself with the air of a servant she was plainly clothed in dark wool dress and white linen undertunic but the wool was fine lambswool tightly woven and costly and the linen as fine as he had ever seen on his mother she watched him from under halfclosed lids her eyes seemed full of secrets she had been out of the palace that fatal evening the girl had told him because she had been here in the home of her aged mother who had fallen and could not be left alone at night there was a great deal about her that prompted valdir to trust in her honesty enough that he decided to tell her a certain measure of the truth i want to find out what really happened he said as sincerely as he could manage the stories ive heard so far dont make a lot of sense if theres something that needs to be told perhaps im the one to tell it a minstrel can tell an unpleasant truth with more success sometimes than anyone else im a stranger with no interests to protect it might be id be believed more readily than a linean she looked away from him and her face was troubled i dont know she said finally this she looked down at her hands and her attention seemed to be caught by a ring she wore it was an unusual ring in the fact that it was so very plain burnished unornamented silver centered with a dull white stone the stone was nothing valdir recognized it looked like an ordinary waterworn quartz pebble then her attention was more than caught the stone flared with an internal white flame for a moment and it seemed that she could not look away from it the womans face took on a blankness of expression hed only seen in the spellbound valdir felt the back of his neck chill there was a power moving somewhere one he didnt recognize he longed to be able to unshield and probe and maddeningly knew he dared not this felt almost like someone was working a truth spell only the feel of this was old old lady ylyna she said in a strangely abstracted voice at the bottom of this it all comes down to lady ylyna tashirs mother valdir asked biting his lip in vexation when it occurred to him that his words might break whatever spell it was that held her but her expression remained rapt and he ventured more but how she was hardly more than a child when she came here the woman said still gazing into the stone of her ring but ive never seen a more terrified girl in my life shed been the ignored one until deveran refused to take any girl to wife that had magepowers then she was valuable and you can believe her family kept the strings on her she was terrified of them she was so happy when she was first pregnant deveran made a great deal of her you see but then tashir came early there was no telling him that it was just accident the boy looked like his uncle so he only came to her to get her pregnant and once pregnant he ignored her until the children were born but she didnt seem to hear him he ignored the boy too she was scarcely old enough to have left off with dolls she hadnt a clue what to do with a child then the letters started coming letters from baires with the royal seal on them from the mavelan she never let us see them but they terrified her and she took it all out on the boy the other children the ones that took after deveran they had nursemaids and careful watching but not tashir he was left to her poor child half the time she petted and cosseted him like a lapdog that was when her letters seemed to be good the other half of the time shed take a riding crop to him till the poor boy was bruised all over that was when the letters frightened her then the boy started showing wizardpower and it got worse i watched her watching him one day ive never seen such jealousy in my life on a human face why would she be jealous of him valdir wondered aloud the old woman shook herself and gave him a sharp look ive said more than i intended she told him almost accusingly he tried to look innocent and trustworthy but what youve said is important she rose and walked slowly across the tiny sitting room to the door and opened it come back in two days she said in tones that brooked no argument i may decide to tell you more then nearly ready to burst with frustration valdir left doing his best to show none of it she shut the door behind him and he wandered back down to the row looking for a good place to set out his hat for a few more hours he still had to eat after all how much of this can you trust yfandes asked well im hardly going to be able to run truth spell on her he replied staring up into the darkness and listening to old petar snoring loud enough to shake the chimney down althoughgods help me it seems as if something was doing that for me and you have to admit this report of alternate petting and abuse certainly explains some of his reaction toward women mothers in particular but it doesnt explain what happened that night one of the two girls murmured in her sleep vanyel shivered and pulled his blanket a little closer the cold of the dirt floor was seeping through his thin straw pallet theres more i know theres more i think she or whatever it was that made her talk is testing me and i dont know why gods and the questions i have why allow only blood relations to serve the remoerdis family and why does it feel as if the old lady is gifted or geased bespelled or both i dont know and i dont dare test her to find out with vedric in the city mm she agreed wise whats he up to being utterly charming valdir replied hes got the locals coming more and more over to his side and hes agreeing with them on every point its hard to believe that this is the same man my sister called a viper interesting and these lineans are a hardheaded lot it would just about take an angel to change their minds about the mavelans vanyel told her but vedric seems to be doing just that petar snorted coughed and turned over there was silence for a moment then he snorted again and the snores did not resume take the chance to get to sleep while you can yfandes advised dryly but sleep refused to come tonight had been particularly bad not only had bel made another try but valdir had fended off the attentions of someone else as well even if he hadnt taken bels glare as warning that she meant what shed said about not taking up with her customers hed have avoided this one shaych yes but in a way that made valdirs skin crawl as much as bel did the man hadnt been physically repulsive but there was something twisted about him something unhealthy like a fine velvet glove over a taloned hand the man had looked at him with a hunger that made him shiver with reaction even now he had reminded vanyel not valdir of the mage that had called himself krebain i dont know what to think anymore if im not shaych then why cant i just do what bel wants and get it over with if i am then why did that hunter revolt me he turned onto his side curling into a ball against the cold the ache of his empty stomach the misery his own uncertainty was causing and today gods that sick little game i was playing on the serving girls leading them on knowing i was leading them right down a dead end yes i got information but i was actually enjoying deluding them having a little power over them gods that was sick and i would have gone right on playing little sexflirtation games if fandes hadn t threatened to kick me into next week im turning into something i dont much like he curled up a little tighter i dont even know my own feelings any more he tightened his lips in exasperation look van youre supposed to have been trained in logic so why dont you try putting things into some kind of category you goose maybe you dont know what you feel but you certainly know what you dont feel you ve been agonizing over that enough lately then figure out what it is that everything you dont care for has in common its about time came yfandes sardonic comment he was startled and then angry he very nearly made some kind of nasty retort back to her but she was blocking and he wasnt so angry that hed try to breach her shields just to tell her off for one thing he wasnt sure he could for another the attempt might give him away to vedric but he certainly wanted to the next several days were some of the worst valdir had ever spent he played his fingers to the bone every night until the last customer left he dodged bel not always successfully by day he took her beatings with teethgritting meekness avoided her increasingly heavyhanded attempts to trap him and did his best to minimize the damage she inflicted he was cold at night and starved by day bels idea of meals being scarcely enough to keep a mouse alive and his own unhappy thoughts kept him awake more often than not he went back to the former maid retas tiny house faithfully every two days only to be turned away with nothing then finally after close to a fortnight an endless series of attempts to see the old woman and being turned away from her door reta finally agreed to speak with him again i wasnt sure youd be back reta held the door open for him and he slipped past her into the tiny painfully neat sitting room she closed the door carefully and sat down on her settle beside the hearth valdir took the only other seat a stool the old woman regarded him thoughtfully while he curbed his impatience and hoped that this time some more information would be forthcoming no i wasnt certain youd be back she repeated why wouldnt i he asked just as quietly as he ignored the hollow feeling in his stomach hed been here long enough that the meager rations and short sleep were beginning to affect him and while hed recharged his mage energies fully his physical energies were becoming exhausted he woke up five and six times a night cramping with cold and even with the supplementary food he was spending his pittance of earnings on he was beginning to have spells of lightheadedness most of his money was going to buy yfandes grain anyway but reta held the key he was sure of it if only he could persuade her to part with the information her or whatever power had controlled her the first time he came to her door this isnt a tale of high adventure she pointed out dryly and it isnt a bedroom farce its not terribly interesting its not good songfodder and its sad sad he raised an eyebrow why sad she examined the hands she held folded in her lap as if they were of great interest that poor child ylyna she never really had a chance to grow up oh she was grown in body but they kept her a child a frightened child they could manipulate i find that sad they meaning the mavelans why didnt you say something he asked trying to understand what could have led her to stand by and watch and not act she shrugged who would have listened i was her highness personal maid as i was deverans mothers deveran would have thought me either besotted or bewitched he wasnt known for thinking much of women in the first place she shook her head and stared at the ring on her finger the peculiar dull white stone seemed to brighten for a moment and her voice and expression became abstracted as it had the first time shed spoken openly its happening again valdir held his breath all his exhaustion his personal concerns forgotten hoping against hope no deveran had no faith in the good sense or the honesty of women after all his own mother had betrayed him by dying when he most needed her or so his own father kept claiming and ylyna not a virgin possibly mad and surely little better than a trollop certainly didnt help matters valdir could not stay silent he protested such inexcusable willful blindness but the way she treated tashir was likely the way shed been treated the old woman shook her head again continuing to stare at the stone of her ring when you reach my age you have generally seen a great deal adults who have been beaten as children beat their own children and other things i sometimes wonder if that isnt what holy lerence meant when he said the sins of the fathers shall be taken up by the sons her eyes grew even more thoughtful or entranced she didnt seem to be paying any attention to him there was something stirring here again he felt some power moving under the powers he could detect easily gods i dont dare try to probe for it the frustration maddened him he could feel it something deep and powerful it vibrated so that he felt it rather than detected it the way he could sometimes feel the vibrations of a note too low to actually hear but it was stronger this time much stronger and it seemed to be stirring to his good for the old chambermaid was saying things she hadnt more than hinted at before what other things was she doing valdir prompted in a whisper hands clenched together so tightly they ached this was it this was what he was looking for the secret no one knew the key to it all she sounded as if she was talking to herself when tashir grew older and handsomer she started looking at him differently the gods know deveran hadnt come to her bed for four years and wouldnt allow any male servants near her only women she had never had any pleasure except in bed i think i wonder if that wasnt the only thing she thought she could do well the old woman was gazing deeply into her stone and not at all at him now and her voice was very low so that he had to strain to hear it she shifted just a little and he caught the sharp smell of lavender from the folds of her dress tashir began looking more and more like his uncle and he was still terrified of her of her who never frightened anyone and couldnt even command respect from her servants it must have been too seductive to resist that combination fear and the handsome young face and body she set out to seduce her own son into her bed valdir froze no thats my gods she continued on still speaking in that same dreamy voice as if she was speaking only to herself that frightened him even more i think once he realized what was going on poor child i hardly believed it at first i just thought the petting was getting a little overwarm shed use any excuse to get her hands on him any excuse at all valdir licked his dry lips but couldnt make his voice work reta sighed and deveran either didnt know or didnt care i tend to think the latter he had what he wanted three sons indisputably his and likely to reach maturity what happened to tashir didnt matter the only person who cared what was happening to him was the old armsmaster the one deveran had retired karis he had taken to teaching the boy when he saw no one else would he protected him as much as he could which wasnt much but it was something he gave the boy a place to hide and a person to look up to who was stable sane and fond of him a good man and possibly another way to get tashir to open up a very good man a pity he was in the palace with the rest of them valdir wanted to curse and restrained himself only by a strong effort of will finally it got to the point that tashir couldnt keep her away and that wizardpower of his intervened he had a kind of fit smashed half the bower before it was over that was when deveran decided decided what valdir asked at that moment the power faded abruptly one breath it was there then it was gone her eyes finally came back to their normal sharp focus what she asked him looking up at him suddenly gods the spells broken oh lady of light help me persuade her would she finish the sentence could he convince her on his own you were going to tell me what deveran had decided to do about tashir he prompted that night oh she shrugged indifferently that i thought everyone knew about that i dont he pointed out and nobody wants to talk about it much its simple enough since vedric was making such a big todo over the boy deveran decided to let him deal with the problem deveran was going to send the boy to his mavelan relatives permanently that was what he told ylyna after they cleared the boy and the mess out of her bower that he intended to tell the boy at dinner she sighed and i can only assume given that tashir was even more frightened of that den of madmen than he was of his mother that this was exactly what happened and what brought everythingdown he hadnt realized how much time hed spent in the little sitting room when he took his leave of reta he was appalled one candlemark to sundown panic stole thought he could only think of one thing home he had to get home before it was too late he didnt dare try to mindtouch savil from here that would be as stupid with vedric so near as riding through the gates in full whites on yfandes he ran across town dodging through foot and beast traffic trying to reach the east gate before they closed it for the night once closedhe wouldnt get out until morning he didnt dare cast any kind of spell to get him by no more than he dared mindtouch savil vedric would detect spellcasting even faster than the use of a mindgift and every moment he stayed here was another moment the same disaster that wiped out tashirs family could move to harm his the sun was dropping inexorably toward the horizon he had a pain in his side and he was gasping for breath and still he wasnt more than halfway to his goal he stumbled against a marketstall recovered ran on he realized with despair that he was not going to make it in time and candlemarks could count could be fatal given what he knew now it was only too possible that tashir had done exactly what hed been accused of that he had been pushed too far by his fathers ultimatum and he had lost his hold temporarily on his gift and his sanity it was only too likely that he had unleashed power gone rogue and had destroyed his own home and everything and everyone in it valdir stopped unable to run any farther clung to the corner of a building at a cross street and watched the sun turn to blood and sink below the horizon taking with it his hope valdir slipped into the pig and stick keeping to the wall and the shadows as much as he could he managed to get within touching distance of renfry and froze there unmoving in the shadows behind him he prayed that renfry was about to finish a set and that he had not just begun one the tavern was hot and he was sweating from his run his side still hurt and he wanted to cough so badly his chest ached with the effort of holding it back sweat ran down his back and into his eyes odor of bread and stew and spilled ale made his stomach cramp up with hunger and his eyes watered the lamps flickered and he gripped the wall behind him as the room swam before his eyes too long on too little oh gods keep me going finally renfry finished and waved aside requests for more not now lads he said genially not until i wet my throat a bit he turned and saw valdir behind him he started to say something then took a second closer look at him and his eyes grew alarmed he picked up the gittern by the neck and grabbed valdirs elbow with his free hand without a single word he propelled the unresisting valdir before him through the door leading to the kitchen it was light enough in here though twice as hot as the tavern common room what with two fires and the brick bakeoven all roaring at once a huge table dominated the center of the room an enormously fat man in a floury stained apron was pulling fresh loaves out of the oven with a long wooden paddle and putting them to cool on the table there were two boys at each of the fireplaces one turning a spit one watching a kettle a fifth boy was sitting on a stool right by the door peeling roots renfry pushed the boy peeling roots off his perch and shoved valdir down onto it whats wrong he said and dont tell me its nothing you look like somebody seeing a death sentence valdir just nodded hed already concocted a story for renfry and one that fit in with what hed already told the man ive he finally coughed rackingly swallowed ive got to get out of here now tonight renfry looked at him narrowly wouldnt be that little matter of a song would it valdir just looked at him pleadingly if vedric finds out im here he whispered truthfully hell probably kill me you didnt tell me it was vedric here vedric renfry exploded great good gods boy you sure dont pick your enemies too carefully oh hell he folded his arms and gazed up at the ceiling brows knitted together so that they came close to meeting lets see first off we got to get your things away from bel huh got it he slipped out into the taproom and returned within a few moments i just paid that little sneak brat of the cooks to pinch your things if he cant nip em nobody can now how much coin you got valdir turned out his purse there wasnt much renfry counted it carefully tel he shouted into the chaos of the kitchen how much dayold bread and stuff can i get you to part with for twenty coppers be generous the boy has to run for it the massive cook blundered over to their side of the big central worktable peered at valdir and then at the tiny heap of coin huh apples is cheap right now got some with bad spots all right fer the road no good t store bread uh got some i was gonna use fer stuffin let ye have it all got some cheese w mold all through mold won hurt ye just looks like hell an tastes mighty sharp people round about here dont care for sharp cheese skinny runt like you hold ye least a fortnight renfry gave valdir a look brimming with satisfaction thatll get you across the border easy and theres a harvestfest going on over there right now boy with a voice like yours that cant get coin at a harvestfest dont deserve t call himself a minstrel hey fry an insolent urchin slid in under renfrys elbow valdirs pack and blanket in one hand his lute in the other these whatcha lookin fer valdir snatched the lute out of the childs hand and held it to his chest his eyes going moist oh gods renfry i i never dared hope for this much help from him never even prayed for it dont you cry on me renfry growled cuffing his ear just getting my competition out of town i told you tel here pack up the boys food he scraped everything but two small silver pieces off the table and poured them into the cooks hand the handful of copper bits vanished into a pocket of the stained apron and a hand rivaling bels for size and strength took the pack now listen careful because im only going to tell you this once you go down to the west gate i know its the wrong way just circle around the city walls once you get outside you ask for asra you got that asra valdir repeated nodding west gate you tell him renfry sent you and you give him one silver thats his standard bribe to let folks out after dark and dont let him tell you different then when you get to the border you give the other to our lads thatll get you past them valdemar folk dont give a hang about who crosses to their side so long as you dont look like a fighter or a trader fighter theyd question trader theyd tax you got that one silver to asra at the west gate one to the border guards good lad renfry nodded approvingly now belt that blanket around you under your cloak youre going to need it its cold out there when you get round the walls you take the east road as far as the second farm on the right tonight you stop there theres a haybarn right on the road and the old boy that owns it dont give a hang if people sleep there so long as they dont build fires after that youre on your own valdir was pulling his threadbare cloak on over the blanket when the cook returned with his pack bursting at the seams he tucked the two tiny coins into his nowempty purse slung pack over one shoulder and lute over the other and turned to renfry trying to think of some way to thank him renfry took one look at his eyes and softened damn wish you could have stayed a while he said gruffly and suddenly pulled valdir into a quick rough embrace now get out of here before bel comes looking for you vanyel made the best meal hed had in a fortnight of half a loaf the cheese and a couple of apples yfandes got the rest funny how you seem to be able to find friends in the most unexpected places she mused sometimes i wonder friends what are you talking about he asked her cinching the blanket pad in place and pulling himself up on her back gods he clung there for a moment as another wave of disorientation washed over him never mind are you all right ill be fine just low on resources and worn out anxiety cramped his stomach a moment he wouldnt have stopped long enough to eat if he hadnt found his legs giving out as he circled around the city to his meeting place with yfandes the shadows under the trees seemed sinister the wind in the nearnaked branches moaned as if in pain he had to get back but the old man was one of those that died the thought kept nagging at him he must have loved that old man given his reaction to jervis that wasnt feigned i cant believe that he would have killed the only person he trusted even in a fit of uncontrolled rage and fear never mind the important thing was to take this knowledge back now before it was too late before the same thing could happen at forst reach it still might not have been tashir who killed the remoerdis family but he dared not take that chance all right fandes he said aloud lets get out of here and she leaped out onto the moon flooded road eleven if vanyel had dared to gate so close to vedric mavelan he would have but he didnt he didnt dare alert him to the fact that a mage powerful enough to gate had been within the city if the mavelans were somehow behind the disaster after all he would be a fool to alert his quarry so he and yfandes pounded into forst reach just after dawn to find everything as peaceful as when theyd left i told you yfandes said in a maddeningly reasonable tone of mindvoice as she pulled into a tired walk i told you if anything had gone wrong wed have felt it the way we felt the first surge didnt i tell you visions of slaughter and mayhem melted taking with them the fear that had strengthened and supported him when they got to the stable vanyel just slid wearily off her back vowing not to say a word because if he did hed take her head off he hated it when she said i told you so and he did not want to get into a fight with her didnt even want to have words with her she didnt deserve it much he hurt he ached all over and he was half numb with cold his legs trembled a little as he walked beside her into the stable his boots and her hooves echoing hollowly on the wooden floor he managed to get her stall open and he spent as much time as he could leaning against something while he groomed her there was thank the gods hay and water already waiting get some rest he told her fatigue dulling his mind and slurring his words im going to do the same he didnt remember how he got to his room all he really remembered was leaving medrens lute by the door stripping his filthy rags off and dropping them on the floor as he staggered to his bed and falling into the bed literally falling his legs gave out at that point he held onto consciousness just long enough to pull off the patched breeches and his boots drag the blankets over himself and wrap them around his chilled numb body as soon as he stopped shivering he was asleep and oblivious to the world at that point tashir could have replicated the massacre in highjorune and hed have slept right through it he woke about midafternoon still tired but no worse than when hed first arrived home the filthy rags hed worn were gone evidently one of the servants had come in and picked up after him and it was a measure of his exhaustion that he not only hadnt woken he hadnt even heard the intruder he was not pleased with himself carelessness like that could get him killed all too easily under other circumstances on the other hand it means im obviously nowhere near as jumpy as i was which is all to the good the first order of business was food and a bath and stopping by the kitchen on the way to the bathhouse solved both at the same time but the next order of business and one that made him wolf down the first decent meal hed had in a fortnight practically untasted and while he bathed was a long talk with jervis and savil the boys staying so close to jervis youd think hed been grafted there savil said vanyel followed her out to the salle as the late afternoon sunlight gilded everything with a mellowing glow its been entirely quiet kechara not so much as a murmur out of the boy or a single plate gone skyward she looked at him quizzically with a touch of worry to see you practically flying back and in this state i wish youd tell me whats going on vanyel shook his head and his hair fell annoyingly into his eyes again he hadnt had a chance to get it cut it was a lot longer than he was used to wearing it and he wasnt sure if he ought to find the time to do something about it or not he raked it back with his fingers and suppressed his flash of annoyance at it i will as soon as i have both you and jervis together i dont want to have to repeat myself and i want to hear both of your opinions at the same time its some of what i found out is terrifying and none of it is pretty and i dont know what to make of it savil brooded on that i thought you were going to find answers over there i did he replied deeply troubled but the answers i found only gave me more questions jervis was alone in the workroom of the salle which might be the first piece of good luck ive had in a while vanyel thought with reluctance jervis eyebrows went up when he saw the expression on vanyels face but he didnt move from his chair he only put down the vambrace hed been repairing and waited for them to settle themselves youre back hmm the armsmaster said quietly from the look of you i dont know as im going to like what youre going to tell me vanyel shut the door carefully behind savil he would have preferred to stand but he was just too tired he compromised by perching on a tall stool and then looked from jervis to his aunt and back again at a real loss as to how to broach the whole subject did you find out who put fear in the boy jervis prompted thats about as good a place to start as any vanyel took a deep breath yes he said and began his tale jervis and savil heard him out in complete silence hardly even breathing savils face was expressionless jervis though looked ready to call somebody out vanyel for starters thats it vanyel finished starting to slump with weariness his shoulders aching with tension thats what i found out and you have to admit the answers i got certainly fit the symptoms dammit van jervis said tightly plainly holding his temper in check i am bloody well tempted to call you a damned liar to your face why vanyel asked bluntly too weary for diplomacy jervis colored and growled because thats nothing like the things tashirs been telling me the way he tells it wait a minute do you mean tashirs been talking about his family to you he trusts me cant the boy trust somebody other than you vanyel told himself that jervis was only reacting much the way he would if the boy were in his protection and managed to cool his rising temper why dont you begin at the beginning and tell me what you heard what emerged was nothing less than a fantasy if what vanyel had learned was true in his long talks with jervis and it seemed that there had been several tashir had painted a perfect idyllic family for himself one in which the members were forced by circumstance and enemies to present a very different face to the outside world than the one they showed each other his mother for instance tashir depicted her as the longsuffering plaything of her mavelan relatives according to him once she discovered deverans kindness she took a stand firmly by the side of her wedded lord but played the part of the discarded unwanted spouse so as to give the mavelans no reason to think she could be used against lineas and its ruler and according to tashirs tale deveran was not the bitter halfimpotent dancer on the line between baires threat and lineas politics he was supposedly a stern but kindly patriarch of the linean throne deveran so tashir had told jervis had only disinherited him under pressure from his people no there was never any question in deverans mind as to who tashirs father was no there had never been a fight never been anything other than a small misunderstanding that they had settled that very night fiction first to last that doesnt even square with what the boy told me vanyel retorted disgusted with the game the youngster seemed to be playing he told me that his father hated him that knocking him to the ground that night was only out of the ordinary because deveran hadnt knocked him about much in public before hell jervis replied his face flushing the boy was half crazed an scared outa his wits all the more reason that he should have told me the truth he didnt have time to make up some tale jervis started to protest and vanyel raised his voice to interrupt him and the part about the fight wasnt just from tashir it was from herald lores a fathead savil put in reluctantly but an honest fathead jervis lunged to his feet an how much of this is cause you want that boys tail he snarled hands knotting into fists at his sides vanyel went hot then cold if thats what you think i see no point in any further discussion think what you like do what you like but obstruct me and ill haul you off to lissa in manacles jervis froze before i am anything else armsmaster i am herald vanyel and my first priority is to my king and land if i judge this boy is a danger to either i will give him into randales custody not mine armsmaster but i must and will have answers and i will not permit anyone to even attempt preventing me from finding those answers vanyel rose stiffly from his stool pivoted and stalked towards the door he hadnt taken more than a few steps when jervis strangled halfsmothered wait stopped him in his tracks why he asked not turning because i we gotta figger out this thing jervis cleared his throat all of us vanyel turned back still angry but suppressing it very well if were going to figure this mess out youll have to take my word as being at least as good as the boys jervis plainly didnt like that but only protested how in hell can we take two stories thatre that different look at the one that fits the symptoms vanyels voice was grim and his face felt tight hes afraid to let women between the ages of eighteen and forty even touch him assume the story he told you is true ylyna alternately beating him and loving him and then trying to seduce him he wiped his forehead and his hand came away wet with nervous sweat gods think about how treesa treats every attractive male including me she comes on to every man like a flirt its only a game to her but think how that must have looked to tashir the way hed react given my version is true you could predict hed do just what he did panic and let his gift act up and frighten her off just as i was told he did with his mother think about how he hides from withen and think about the way he clings to you jervis everything makes sense jervis faltered well yes but and everything points straight at tashir as the unconscious murderer vanyel continued heartsick now that i will not believe jervis shouted surging to his feet that boy is no kind of a killer hell he damn near castrated himself in practice yesterday pulling a cut when medren lost his helm who else could it be vanyel shouted back overriding jervis protests by sheer volume he had the power he was at the scene and he had the motive theres nobody nobody with any kind of a motive except tashir no jervis insisted eyes going black with anger no i wont accept that look how he kept from hurting anybody in treesas bower but crazed with fear wild with anger can you speak for that even crazed how could he kill that karis he loved that old man he must have to trust me so much just because i look like him vanyel sat heavily back down onto the stool i dont know he admitted in a low voice thats only one of the things thats been bothering me in all of the cases of gifts gone rogue that ive ever heard of the rogue never hurts anyone but the ones directly in his way everybody was killed in this case and that doesnt make sense it might make sense if he panicked completely and thought he was killing witnesses but he didnt have enough time to reason something like that out not from all i learned and from what i know of his personality no i cant see him killing in cold blood even to save himself he rubbed his pounding temples with his fists fits of anger always gave him a headache the first half of the story fits but the second doesnt i just cant reconcile the two therere other questions savil pointed out from her seat on the cot vanyel looked at her in surprise hed forgotten she was there lots of other questions some of them may tie in others may not but the fact is theres too many of them lord vedrics behavior is certainly peculiar it doesnt in the least match what ive heard of him either the man has reformed or hes up to something then theres the puzzle of the remoerdises the linean royal family why did deveran insist that only those related to his family serve in the palace why is the place built on top of a damned magenode why are the lineans so completely against magecraft vanyel shook his head you think those questions are crucial dont you she stood and smoothed down the front of her tunic you know damned well they are or you wouldnt have brought them up i tend to agree with jervis tashir is no killer i agree with you that your tale of how the boy was treated fits his behavior a lot better than the one he told jervis and there is something were missing something important i think we ought to all think about it what about that tale hes been feeding jervis vanyel asked i think whoever runs into him next ought to call him on it no let me amend that whichever of the two of us van jervis im sorry but if it comes to magic youre defenseless im pretty certain van and i could contain the worst of anything he could do the boy wouldnt hurt anybody and especially not me he insisted stubbornly i know it damn it i just know it forgive me but id rather not take the chance savil said dryly i hate picking up my acquaintances in palmsized pieces weve eaten this particular bird down to bones lets let things simmer for a bit and lets do something about dinner gods vanyel slid off the stool held out his hands and watched them shake with a certain bemusement i just ate and after this todo my stomach should be in knots instead i could eat a cow dont fill up savil cautioned him as they left jervis mulling over the unpleasant things hed heard theres harvestfest tonight what he looked at her bewildered harvest cant be oh gods he counted up the passing days in his mind and when he arrived at today he could feel the blood draining out of his face oh gods its sovvan i lost track of time he stopped dead in the path legs gone leaden mind gone numb sovvannight years turning the night tylendel had died coming on top of all the rest of it exhaustion confusion the verbal fight with jervis it was too much what little emotional balance he had left evaporated so quickly that he felt dizzy as if he was dangling over a precipice his internal turmoil must have been mirrored clearly on his face savil moved closer to him brows knitting in concern vanke charalet it go you arent helping yourself by brooding she put her arm around his shoulders go down to the barns with the others im going to he scarcely felt it all he could see was a crumpled lifeless shape he clamped an iron control down over his face thats not something i can do he replied stiffly i cant forget especially not tonight i wont ever forget then for the gods sake for your own sake find something to distract youmusic dancing no savil he pulled away from her and forced himself to walk steadily toward the keep you deal with grief your way and leave me to deal with it in mine but he shook his head stubbornly unwilling to say more and not sure that he could forget lendel how can i forgethow can i ever forget oh lendel there was only one place where he could escape the sounds of celebration the stone porch on the north side of the keep all other interests had vanished when he realized what night it was now all he wanted was solitude the lingering warmth of this fall had fooled him usually sovvantide was marked by iceedged rains and bitter winds like the storm that night usually he tried to find something useful to do like stand guardduty or spell someone at courier or even take the place of one of the guardians watching the web anything so long as it was work and didnt involve interacting with people only serving them hed completely forgotten that hed be spending sovvan here in presumed idleness leisure that would only give him the opportunity to remember how utterly alone he was it hadnt been this bad the first few years in the first two in fact there had been moments when he thought hed felt that treasured and familiar presence waiting watching but as the years passed and it became clear that he was and would always be alone sovvannight had become an occasion for profound depression unless he was very careful not to give in to it this sovvannight bid fair to be an ordeal he was too exhausted and too shaken to put up any kind of fight against himself he watched the sun die in glory watched the stars come out flowering against the velvet sky he closed his eyes when the sparks of white began to waver in his vision and struggled anyway in a losing battle against selfpity and heartache ive wept enough tears wont ease this theyii only make it worse i wish i was being valdir i wish i was back at haven he thought briefly of yfandes and rejected the notion of going to her she couldnt help him much as he loved her her presence would only serve as a reminder of how much he had lost to gain her i need something to keep me occupied savil was right about that something that will take concentration there was only one task he knew that could possibly fill all his thoughts take all his attention magic ill build some illusions good tight ones i can use the practice i need the practice he perched on the edge of one of the stone benches the gritty granite warm from the sun it had absorbed this afternoon and concentrated on a point just in front of him people theyre hardest starwind hes vivid enough he closed his eyes and centered it took very little to cast an illusion just a wisp of power and he didnt even need to take it from his reserves the ambient energy around him was enough he visualized a vibrant column of light growing in the air in front of him then began forming the shapeless energy into an image building it carefully from the feet up green leather boots silky green breeches and sleeveless tunic all molding to a tall slender wiry body implicit strength not blatant waistlength silver hair four braids in the front the rest falling free down his back a cascade of icethreads golden skin then the face pointed chin high cheekbones silver blue eyes with a wisdom and humor lurking in them that could not be denied and a smile just hovering at the edge of the thin lips he opened his eyes and before him stood the tayledras healeradept starwind ktreva for one moment he had it perfect in every detail then the hair shortened and darkened to curly blond the face squared and the eyes began warming and darkening to a soft and gentle brown his heart contracted and he banished the illusion and began another quickly savil this one started to go wrong from the very beginning and with a gasp of pain he wiped it out and started on a third not even a human this time one of the little lizards that served the tayledras the hertasi but the hertasi began growing taller and developed blond hair oh gods he banished the third illusion and buried his face in his hands shaking in every limb and battling against grief this this is the worst sovvan ive ever had he thought feeling sorrow tearing at his chest until it hurt to breathe its the worst since you died oh lendel ashke i cant bear it and i have no choice im so tired so very tiredmy balance is gone and to know its going to go on like this year after year alone i dont know how to cope anymore i dont know how anyone can be this lonely and still be sane i dont even know how sure i am of myself i thought you were the only person i could ever love but this business with shavri has me all turned round about and tashir i came so close to giving in to temptation with him all i am certain of is that i need you as much as i ever did and id give anything to have you back he bit his lip and tasted the sweetsalt of blood took his hands away from his face and willed his eyes open nightshadows of leafless trees moved ebony against charcoal the last frost had killed the insects and the birds had mostly flown south by now there was no sign of anything alive out there just barren shadows dark as his soul as empty as his heart a wisp of glow drifted in the air in front of him and he gave in to his anguish to the perverse need to probe at his heartache to hell with it how can i hurt any more than i do now and everything i try turns to lendel not shavri which ought to have told me who i love more once again he closed his eyes and began to build a new illusion one formed with passionate care and at a level of detail only love could have discerned in the original the way that one lock of goldbrown sunstreaked hair used to fall just touching the eyebrow the depth of the clear brown eyes sometimes sable sometimes golden but so bottomless you could lose yourself in them the square chin so high cheekbones so the generous mouth so ready to smile or laugh the strong pillar of the neck shoulders ready to take the weight of the worlds troubles body of a fighter or a dancer gentle hands of a healer it didnt take long now that he was no longer fighting with himself oh tylendel vanyel looked up to see his handiwork and sobbed once reaching out involuntarily to touch empty air the illusion was nothing less than heartbreakingly perfect the tylendel of the joyous days of their one summer together stood before him so alive vanyel fancied he could see him breathing that in a moment he would speak and i could do that too i could make him breathe and talk to me no i couldnt bear that its hollow enough as it is oh gods why lendel someone gasped behind him and as he started and lost control of it the illusion shattered exploded outward into a hundred thousand glittering little bits that rained down and vanished melting away before they touched the pale stone of the porch vanyel whipped around to see a dark and indistinct shape beside the black hole of the door whos there he snapped hastily wiping his eyes with the back of his hand what do you want iits tashir the young man came toward him hesitantly medren told me you were back i wondered where you were where youve been depression abruptly became anger at being disturbed and the desire to hurt fountained in him he wanted someone anyone any creature at all to suffer inside as much as he did at this moment he knew it was base knew that tashir would be an easy target and that he could hurt him he hated the desire even as he felt it and it sickened him as much as he wanted it he fought it down but the anger remained red and sullen this young man for whom vanyel had been risking his life had been undermining everything hed built here it wasnt just that tashir had been lying it was that what he had told jervis had come close to destroying the fragile beginnings of friendship that had cost both of them so much pain and soulsearching to create had set them at each others throats like enemies and had left them once again uneasy and grudging allies at best ive been finding out the truth he said softly while you seem to have been busy trying to hide it the anger blossomed and he briefly lost control over it just long enough that he growled a single sentence why did you lie to jervis i didnt tashirs voice cracked as vanyel rose and walked toward him one hand flaring with magelight the blue light reflected off tashirs face revealing the youngsters surprise and growing fear the young mans eyes widened his expression froze and he backed away from the herald step by forced step he didnt stop until his thighs hit the stone railing and vanyel had him backed into a corner with nowhere to go you did vanyel whispered all those stories you told him about your perfect loving family thats all they were stories lies ive been in highjorune tashir i spent the last fortnight there talking to people one of them was your mothers maid reta the branches of the bushes nearest tashir began to thrash as if tossed by a wind though not a breath of air stirred anywhere else vanyel didnt have to see them to know that the young man had unleashed his gift in panic he let it go for a moment waiting to see how violent tashir would become fallen leaves whirled up in a mad dance to engulf both of them beating at vanyel ineffectually but with nothing more at hand to work with than leaves the attack wasnt even a distraction vanyel savagely clamped down on the young man with a shield not even an adept could have cracked and the leaves drifted back down to the ground and the porch tashir cowered against the stone railing averting his eyes as the magelight on vanyels hand flared perversely the display of subservience only made him angrier he fought down his temper and got himself back under control managing at last to gaze down upon the youngster with his anger held in check well tashir vanyel whispered tonelessly are we ready to hear a little truth now aabout whwhat tashir croaked vanyel formed the light into a ball and sent it to hover just over his head with a flick of his wrist he folded his arms and compressed his lips forcing his anger to cool a little more ill invoke truth spell on him then at least ill bloody well know when hes lying i think he said finally that we can start with your father he called up the vrondi and when it surrounded him with faint blue light tashirs pale face stood out with sharpedged distinctness against the nightdark shadows behind him word by agonized word he dragged a story out of tashir that was virtually identical to the one that reta had told him three times more whenever vanyel dealt with the subject of his mother the boy unconsciously attempted to evoke his gift he failed to break the shield vanyel still held on him each time vanyel noted with a smoldering sullen calm that while tashir did freeze physically when this happened he was quite conscious if not in conscious control of what he was doing finally vanyel decided to force the issue to deliberately evoke the same state of mind the younger man must have been in on that fatal night the night i found you he said your father told you something and you refused him and he hit you do you remember what that was tashir shook his head a breath away from hysterical breakdown the blue aura of the truth spell continued to glow he told you that he was going to send you to your mavelan relatives to stay that he was washing his hands of you it was hard to tell in the blue glows of magelight and truth spell but tashir seemed to become paler vanyel shook his head regretfully and deliberately turned his back on the youngster i dont know what to do about you he said expressionlessly youve brought me nothing but trouble and youre about to cause a major diplomatic incident between valdemar and lineas you could even start a war im sorry tashir but your uncle vedric is petitioning that you be put into his custody king randale is likely to order just that given the circumstances i think it would be the wisest thing if i admitted where you are and my part in this mess and turned you over to vedric in the morning he waited for an attack he waited for the shield to break under the stress of tashirs gift at the kind of level of manifestation that was indicated by the slaughter at highjorune instead he heard a peculiar little whimper and felt the pressure within the shield go null vanyel pivoted in surprise just in time to catch the youngster as he fell over in a dead faint it took him the better part of a candlemark to revive tashir it took longer to convince him that although it might be the wisest thing to do it was not the course of action vanyel intended to take the youngster was totally terrified of being sent into mavelan hands yet even under the stress of this absolute terror his gift manifested at no higher level than before eventually tashir believed him when he told the youngster that he would continue to shelter him to try to find out what had really happened and then when the young man had settled a little he began the questioning again with a cool and calculated assessment of the stress he was putting tashir under vanyel brought him to the breaking point over and over until he was certain that nothing was going to evoke the killstorm finally the boy was too exhausted to be pressed further and vanyel wasnt too far behind him at least emotionally why tashir he asked looking for any clue as to the truth of that night why did you make up that fantasy for jervis because because i wanted him to like me the young man blurted desperately how could he like me if my own father hated me how could he like me if he knew what my mother wanted to vanyel interrupted trying not to show the frustration he was feeling tashir karis tried to protect you why did you think jervis would be any different but karis was there he saw what was happening if i told anybody else theyd think i was lying mother said so tashir paled again but vanyel assumed it was only the stress of having to face that unnatural relationship squarely karis he whispered was there tashir from what ive been told she was the one who lied why would you think shed have told you the truth about vvanyel the young man interrupted karis they never told me who besides was karis one of was he then vanyel saw what tashir had finally realized saw the plea in tashirs eyes to be told that karis was still alive and couldnt answer it he looked away which was answer enough the youngster crumpled holding the stone balustrade for support his entire body shaking with harsh racking sobs vanyel remembered as he banished the shield and uncast the truth spell that one of the most telling pieces of evidence against the youngster in the eyes of herald lores at any rate was tashirs lack of emotion when hed been told what had happened lores should see him now he thought grimly putting his arm around tashirs shoulders and letting him weep himself out with vanyel supporting him his own anger was quite gone and he was recalling his desire to make tashir hurt as much as he did with a sick shamed feeling in the pit of his stomach then tashir turned to cry on vanyels shoulder and it was all vanyel could do to keep from losing control again this time for a very different reason finally the youngster pulled away and vanyel let him go he walked back to his former seat or the bench at the farther side of the porch and slumped there his head in his hands not really thinking only aching because tashir was so like tylendel holding him while he wept had been like reliving the past the dead past hesitant footsteps behind him and a shy sniffle vanyel wished with all his heart that the boy would go find jervis go back to his room or seek solace at the festivities anything but stay here with that fartoofamiliar face providing a ready made knife to the heart and not even knowing that he was doing so vanyel came the halting whisper vanyel who was that man the one that disappeared when i startled you i thought it was me at first but he was different it was just an illusion vanyel replied rubbing his temples staring at the dark blot of his own feet against the gray stone i was practicing the youngster hovered just beside him but who is it he persisted it wasnt me and it wasnt uncle vedric and why were you casting a seeming of him tylendel vanyel replied shortly his name was tylendel hes dead hewasmy lover and half of my soul and all of my heart tashir started back at that out of touching distance projecting clear revulsion and fear so clearly that vanyel felt it like a blow vanyels temper snapped dammit he snarled rounding on the youngster will you not act like im going to pounce on you and rape you i dont make a habit of hitting attractive young men over the head and dragging them off to my bed no matter who they look like tashir put out a hand as if to keep him away vanyel could not longer control his temper or his words you came to me not all that long ago he snarled and ill thank you to remember that i didnt take advantage of the situation so youve changed your mind about being shaych fine i have no quarrel with you or with that that is your decision and yours alone to make i have no intention of making you change your mind but kindly remember that im a human being and i lost somebody he fought the words past the grief lost somebody i loved more than anyone else on earth he was my lifebonded and i will be without him for the rest of my life youre not the only one in the world whos alone youre not the only one whos suffered he turned away abruptly got up and stalked stiffly to the stone railing staring out into the lattice of bare tree branches and trying to keep from breaking down completely behind him he could hear tashir shuffling his feet the sound betraying uncertainty go away boy leave me alone leave me to mourn my dead my beloved and go chase my niece just leave me but the footsteps shuffled nearer hesitated then came nearer still until tashir stood at his right elbow vanyel stared out ahead of him at the branches and the stars that seemed to be caught there was he a herald the voice was timid no a trainee stop driving knives in me go away how long ago twelve years tonight twelve years forsaken twelve long lonely years knowing ill never be whole again what happened the youngster persisted sounding very young indeed he killed himself there are you happy now will you go away but no condemnation just bewilderment why how could he when he had a companion so you know that already do you how if we die they die but you dont know everything laddyboy she repudiated him thats why he did it he couldnt bear the he couldnt finish silence a silence marked only by the occasional rustle of leaves vanyel hung his head and wrestled with his grief and hoped the youngster would take the hint and finally go away tashir moved a little closer i dont understand he said humbly i cant imagine what could have happened please vanyel took a deep shuddering breath obviously the boy wasnt going to leave until he had his curiosity satisfied so tell him and get it over with he looked back up at the remote and uncaring stars lendel was savils trainee when my father sent me to her because i wasnt the kind of man he thought i should be he began trying to recite the words as if they described someone else what i didnt know then was that he was afraid i was fey and he was trying to keep me from being shaych he kept me amazingly sheltered really i had no idea that well i suppose anyway i knew i was different but i didnt know why his chest ached when he took a breath i was disliked at home the fosterlings my brothers they all figured me for mothers darling and i just couldnt seern to fit in with them granted i didnt make much effort to be liked after a while but well it was all coming back with the impact of something that had happened only yesterday so withen sent me off to haven where i was even more a stranger he tried to laugh it sounded like a croak i was put with savil and her proteges and savil was supposed to make a man out of me turn me into something like meke i suppose what father didnt know was that her favorite protege lendel was shaych openly shaych exactly what hed tried to keep me from i was lonely and desperately unhappy and lendel was kind to me even when i was rotten to him then i found out certain things about him from other sources and suddenly a lot of inexplicable things about myself had answers i watched you and wanted more from you than friendship for days weeks and at the same time i was so afraid not like this young fool is afraid i was afraid that once i broke my isolation you d hurt me like everyone else had but you didnt lendel at least not in the way id feared and in the end it wasnt you who hurt me it was losing you things happened lendel and i became lovers then lifebonded i know that now i didnt know that then all i knew then was that id have done anything for him committed any crime to avoid losing him you werent a herald no not even a trainee his eyes blurred and burned vanyel blinked and tears splashed down onto the balustrade beside his hand tylendel had a twin his twin was murdered in a feud murdered by magic no one seemed willing to do anything about it lendel and staven had been mindlinked losing staven drove him more than a little mad he decided to take matters into his own hands and i helped him by stealing the proscribed books of magic i couldnt believe i was outraged that no one had done anything about stavens murder i didnt know what i should have done and i didnt see anything wrong with going out for revenge especially not when lendel was hurting so much we slipped away on sovvannight dark and cold it was and wind blowing fit to tear the clothes from your body but not so dark and cold as the place inside lendel that only revenge would heal i thought i only wanted him satisfied so i could have the tylendel i knew back again i never thought further than that we gated to where the other family was celebrating since we were lifebonded and i had magepotential lendel could use my energy to make the gate and his own to call up his vengeance which he did he called up a pack of wyrsa and turned them loose he felt the young man beside him shudder but he was too caught in his memories to pay much attention he could still see it the image was burned into his mind for all time lendel his face twisted with grief and rage his eyes no longer gentle and holding a black gleam of madness the cowering people seeing no escape and evil made flesh in the form of the four wyrsa unholy meldings of snake and ferret with their daggerteeth and their burning sulfur eyes and their insatiable hunger that he could feel beating against his mind even now and then the thunder of hooves behind him and the equine shriek of defiance and loss gala came through the gate when the wyrsa had made only one kill she challenged the whole pack she repudiated lendel sweet blue eyes gone dead and empty mind voice reverberating coldly down the link that bound him and lendel i do not know you you are not my chosen then the internal snap of something breaking and the utter desolation where love had been she attacked the pack they pulled her down and killed her tylendels eyes with all of hell in them tylendels heart a churning storm of loss and agony tylendels soul a shattered thing past all repairing tylendels mind holding no sane thoughts at all savil and two other heralds came through the gate and destroyed the wyrsa too late oh gods lendels heart his mind his soul were broken he got away from them when we reached haven they backlashed the gate energy through me by accident and my collapse distracted them just long enough for him to break free of them he couldnt bear it the pain of losing gala then having her die before his eyesso he threw himself off the belltower i wish theyd let me die with you i wish they hadnt saved me when i tried to kill myself oh lendel tylendel it wasnt supposed to end that way he couldnt look at tashir couldnt tears fell silently and splashed onto his hands he gripped the railing until his knuckles ached there was nothing inside him but the same throbbing emptiness that had been left twelve years ago twelve years lendel twelve years and it hurts more not less twelve years and all i really look forward to is the moment its all over tashir was very quiet vanyel couldnt even hear him breathing and only the sense of presence still at his side told him that the young man was still there im sorry tashir said awkwardly thats a stupid thing to say but its all i can think of i wish it had never happened i wish i could bring him back for you herald vanyel karis always told me people could feel that way about each other could really love each other and not just pretend to but i never i never knew anybody who did im sorry i made you unhappy i apologize for reacting like i did if id known what you just told me id have realized how stupid i was its all right vanyel answered him huskily after a pause to get the lump out of his throat you couldnt know lifebonds dont happen very often when they do well its like companionbond when one partner dies the other dies with him usually the only thing that kept me alive was that i bonded to yfandes that night it doesnt hit me like this very often its just sovvannight and im bloody damned tired and you gods tashir you could have been him it hurts every time i see you because half the time i dont see you i see him the young man was silent again but it was a silence that implied he was going to speak and he did im probably saying things i shouldnt but you said it yourself vanyel its been twelve years dont you think thats an awful long time to be holding onto a memory so tightly that it strangles you he stepped away a little as vanyel finally turned to look at the dark shape of him in shock and astonishment people need you and you cant help them when youre like this jervis told me that you said thats important and you arent the only one in the world whos suffering either you arent the only one whos ever lost his love he backed up a little then broke and ran for the door leaving vanyel standing stiffly beside the railing trying to collect his wits have i been that selfish he wondered is it selfish to grieve for someone like this i dont know but hes right im not the only one in the world whos lost someone they loved he lost karis and karis was the only person he ever knew who loved him i have savil i have fandes i have friends gods he blinked as answers finally put themselves together in his mind i said it myself it wasnt shavri everything turned into it was lendel i do love shavri but not like that its just that ive been so long without caring for anyone that deeply that i couldnt untangle what it meant i want to protect her care for her but because shes a friend who needs me more than anyone has ever needed me except lendel and because she cares for me it was only lendel who gave me love without asking for anything good gods thats it isnt it thats where the sticking point is everybody wants something from me or seems to mother first of all melenna randi they all want me to be something for them only lendel wanted me to be myself only lendel gave without asking what he was going to get and now shavri and jisa who just loves like only a child can love without any questions at all but thats not wrong either i cant blame the ones who need things from me but that may be something of the difference between friends and lovers interesting but how is it that i can go to bed with a friend ah i cant go to bed with someone whos not a friend how could i have lost what i knew when i was fifteen that was what i knew when krebain tried to seduce me sex and love arent the same thing but love and friendship are so close that you cant have love without having friendship i could have continued to love lendel even without sex thats what had me confused we became friends and lovers and beloved all at the same instant there was something about him i would always have liked even if id never loved him the stars werent any brighter for having just found some of his answers but they seemed that way poor tashir he doesnt have anyone i had a true love not too many people can say that he contemplated that for a moment ive been thinking awfully hard about how i lost him maybe it would be better to remember how i had him once again he set himself to build the illusion that had shattered with tashirs gasp just as carefully just as lovingly but this time remembering the good times once again tylendel stood before him frozen in a moment of gentle joy he remembered that moment well you gave me a gift i never expected to have you gave me my music back beloved you told me that it was more important to you to hear music played for itself than to hear it enhanced by the strongest of bardic gifts he found himself smiling a smile with tears on the edge of it but smiling then i sang you a love song the first one i ever sang for you it was the first time id ever sung one with my heart in it tylendel had given himself up completely to the music hed woven for him it had been a moment completely free of any shadows because lendel had chased the only one that haunted him beloved you knew how much i needed that back and you gave it to me with open hands memory could be sweet even if it held an edge of sorrow i wont ever forget you ashke but i can choose how i remember you and i promise ill try to remember with love not tears he allowed the image to fade so its time i started doing something about people who need me hmm just like you told me and the most urgent of those is tashir he yawned suddenly then laughed a little at himself and im not going to do anyone any good falling asleep on my feet so best i seek my virtuously empty bed morning is going to come far too soon he looked once more into the sky or beyond it even he wasnt certain which good night ashke wherever you are wind to thy wings twelve news sped by herald mind and magegifts and heraldguided messenger birds moved quickly in valdemar when the king and circle chose but when they didnt they had not chosen to speed either edicts or news in the matter of tashir and the mysterious slaughter of the linean royal family that news moved with the same plodding slowness as it did outkingdom and that gave vanyel and the youngster a respite but it was a short respite only vanyel had known that from the beginning vanyel wasnt much surprised when a messenger arrived the day after sovvan from captain lissa he had a fair notion of just what the sealed messagetubes the courier carried contained and he wasnt at all surprised to be summoned to lord withens study when the messenger had departed the door stood open vanyel tapped on the frame then entered when his father looked up withen wore a troubled expression the look of a man who is uneasy about things over which he had little or no control he motioned to vanyel to take a chair but van only shook his head preferring to stand if withen meant to take him to task let him do so with vanyel in some kind of formal stance this withen settled back into his own chair and lifted a corner of one of the papers lying on his desk i had the messenger read it for me i wasnt sure i wanted radevel to know what was going on until i talked to you its a politely worded request from lissa for permission to move her company of the guard to the ashkevron personal estates and an explanation of why shes been ordered to move vanyel nodded given what he had seen on his way home the way the linean side of the border had been fortified in just under a fortnight he had realized it would be only a matter of time before liss got orders to move from the bordersection facing baires to that facing lineas and the ashkevron family land sat squarely on the only road suitable for troop movements withen coughed uncomfortably van son the boy you brought here hes that tashir isnt he tashir remoerdis the linean he is vanyel replied levelly and the fact that he was chosen after the remoerdis family died is reason enough to presume him innocent he straightened a little father you know i wouldnt have brought anyone dangerous here but he needed a sanctuary and this was the only place i could think of where no one would look for him withen interrupted him with a wave of his hand thats not what im worried about that boy wouldnt hurt a fly id swear to it myself its what do i do if liss or somebody else comes looking for you you could give us up vanyel sighed his muscles going to knots in fact you should like hell i will withen rumbled you brought him here for sanctuary and by the gods hes going to get it vanyel relaxed and grinned the expression startled his father father mine he said warmly you have just eased my last worry i was not going to foist this walking diplomatic incident on you unwilling but if you have no qualms about continuing to shelter him withen snorted ill pick up blade and defend him mself if i have to i hope you wont have to i hope ill be able to find out who really did this and clear tashir entirely if you dont mind ill take that chair you offered withen nodded and vanyel lowered himself into its support gratefully randales playing a very tricky game here liss troop is mostly made up of men from forst reach and the holdings in fealty to us he knows damned well that no matter what the official word is theyll protect me with silence if nothing else unless you or liss indicate differently randale trusts my judgment and hes giving me time to get this sorted out withen nodded one eyebrow raised in tribute to randales cleverness dont worry father ill have word and time to get us out of forst reach and into hiding in the forest long before anyone dangerous could actually arrive here that was all i was worried about except withen tugged his short beard unhappily is there a chance the lineans would make a borderwar out of this vanyel weighed all the factors in his mind including vedrics apparent unwillingness to force the issue he ruminated a long time for the most part ignoring his fathers increasingly gloomy countenance before he was able to make a tentative conclusion he stood then hoping he looked more confident than he felt i dont think so but i pledge you father he said steadily holding withens eyes with his own before it comes to that ill turn both of us over to them myself and i hope to havens i never have to make good on that pledge the reaction to the news contained in the missive was mixed on the whole vanyels younger brothers seemed to welcome the prospect of a little excitement with cheerful bloodthirstiness mekeal alone of all of them seemed of two minds about the whole thing first joining in the boasting and enthusiastic weaponry practices then taking to pacing about the keep muttering about lineofsight and defensibility with a worried frown creasing his forehead withen made it very plain when the youngsters identity became generally known that he shared jervis conviction of tashirs innocence and tashir reacted to his show of faith with disbelief at first but when withen himself assured him of his sanctuary tashir reacted with a pitiful gratitude that would have softened harder hearts than withens it was because of this that withen actually got embroiled in a shouting match with father leren over tashir and the question of his disposition guilt or innocence the first time withen had ever disagreed with the cleric to vanyels knowledge tashirs companion had finally come in to take up nervous residence with yfandes this was something of a relief to vanyel since ghost had been frightening the whey out of most of the workers on the holding theyd see only a flash of something white usually by night and then it would be gone and the rumors of a demonhorse were spreading vanyel was trying to coax both the young man and the companion into a calmer state of mind in which deeper bonding and mindspeech between the two would be possible but neither of them were at all willing to be calmed ghost in fact showed a marked tendency to panic if even the lower half of the outer door to yfandes stall was closed while he was in it vanyel was about ready to give it up as a hopeless task when jervis came looking for him a startling grin transforming his craggy face into a mask of unholy glee relations between the two of them were improving again slowly vanyel suspected tashir may have had a hand in that though whether or not that was on purpose he had no idea but although they were speaking without daggers behind the words vanyel had not expected to see that kind of expression on the armsmasters face ever van jervis whispered while tashir communicated with ghost in his own way with brush and murmured words vanyel couldnt catch if youre done here theres somethin you have to hear vanyel shrugged and vaulted over the stall railings tashir he called over his shoulder why dont you two work off some of that nerve in a good long ride youre too edgy to trance and i dont blame you tashir looked relieved ghost lowered his head in a clear gesture of agreement the young companion stood steadily for tashir while his chosen pulled himself up onto his back then nosed the stall door open and trotted out into the paddock all right vanyel said turning back to jervis what is all this about just come with me jervis said gleefully and led vanyel out of the stable to stand just under one of the windows in the tiny temple possessed at the best a redhanded murderer at the worst father leren was shouting his voice muffled by all the intervening stone that boys no more a murderer than i am withen shouted back you were dead wrong about vanyel and by the gods youre even more wrong about this boy van asked me for sanctuary for him i pledged it and im not taking back my sworn word youre putting your soul in jeopardy lord withen the priest thundered the gods the gods my ass withen roared in full and magnificent outrage there isnt an evil hair on that poor boys head who made you the spokesman for the gods last i was taught if the gods want something done they dont bother with a damned mouthpiece they do it themselves or they choose a vessel and make their power plain i havent seen you glowing with holy light old man leren sputtered incoherent obviously taken aback by this revolt of his erstwhile supporter and ill tell you one thing more i judge whos to be forst reach priest i put you in and i can throw you out just as easy if you want to stay forst reach priest youll keep your mouth off tashir aye and while were at it off vanyel as well when youve done as much for valdemar as he has you can call him pervert and catamite to your hearts content but till you do you keep a respectful tongue in that head of yours hes herald vanyel firstrank heraldmage of valdemar and confidant of the king and furthermore hes my son and youd better damned well remember that fact leren tried to say something else but withens roar drowned him out vanyel signaled that they probably ought to move on jervis nodded as he stifled snickers with his hand biting the edge of it to keep from laughing out loud as they slipped away vanyel was too surprised to laugh it felt as if his eyebrows were about to make a permanent home in his hair it was certainly the last argument hed ever expected to overhear the fallingout found leren taking his meals with the hirelings instead of with the family a circumstance that vanyel tried not to rejoice in but couldnt help enjoying it certainly made mealtime easier for him to face the quarrel also gave jervis ascendancy and as a result of that vanyel thought he might be detecting a certain softening of withens attitude toward his firstborn although what with everything and everyone stirred up it was impossible to be sure that was the state of things when captain lissa ashkevron rode in through the gates of forst reach at the head of her company lord withen said the solemn hatchetfaced woman in dress blues bowing slightly over her horsess neck in the salute of equals she waited his response with her helm tucked at a precise angle under her left arm her bays reins held at an equally precise angle in her right the bluedyed rooster feathers mounted in a socket at the top of the light dress helm fluttered across her arm in the light breeze her brown hair had been braided and coiled atop her head with the same military precision that characterized the rest of her equipage this was the first time vanyel had seen his sister on duty or in any kind of official capacity she was certainly a far diiferent creature from the careless untidy hoyden he remembered her being as a child or even the wild rogue she could become offduty captain ashkevron withen returned her salute visibly torn between worry and pride permission to bivouac the troops sir granted pride won out and withen beamed the south home pastures been vacated its all yours captain thank you my lord she replied formally sergeant grayse front and center a guardsman with a brown round face that seemed vaguely familiar to vanyel marched crisply from the front rank to lissas right stirrup and waited south home pasture lead the troops there and bivouac ill join you shortly the sergeant saluted and pivoted heel and toe and vanyel realized why he seemed familiar grayse was one of the holding families and this solid young man must be one of the sons he barked out a series of orders as lissa moved her horse off the road turned again and stepped out with the rest of the troop following as promptly as if they hadnt just spent all day on their feet lissa stayed on her horse at semiattention until the last of her troop was out of sight then grinned and tossed vanyel her helm she dropped her horses reins as she vaulted out of her saddle groundtethering him as soon as her feet hit the ground she made straight for withen vanyel caught the tumbling helm as she flung her arms around her fathers neck and kissed him soundly and then he held it out of the way as she made it his turn for an enthusiastic embrace an embrace which he returned onehanded weil father she said after kissing vanyel just as thoroughly what do you think of my youngsters fine withen glowed damn fine gods i hardly knew my little daughter up there on her warhorse and in her uniform and all ive never seen you on duty either liss vanyel reminded her i think you look wonderful she hugged him again then stood beside him with her arm around his waist im just sorry it has to be under alertconditions she said soberly im sorry father the last thing i ever wanted to do was dont worry about it withen interrupted now is there anybody you want to quarter at the keep my healer i want him to have an infirmary set up i bivouac with the troops withen looked a little disappointed but vanyel found himself grinning with approval good he said i didnt think it was my place to say anything but it seemed to me down at the karsite border that all the best officers stayed with their troopers so im told lissa replied dont worry father youll see more of me than you think she hugged vanyel hard come on little brother help me get this nag in a stall hmm he let her go and handed back her helm she caught up the bays reins and walked beside him to the stable lord marshal doesnt like the way things are shaping up she said in a quiet voice as soon as they got out of earshot vedric has been making himself into the linean patron saint what with supporting their protests to randale and all i wish i knew what he was up to this doesnt square with any of the intelligence ive had on him up until now as for you my impetuous little brother ive got official orders that if i find tashir im to take him in but ive also got this she reached into her beltpouch and took out a muchcreased note with randales private seal on it and handed it to him vanyel noticed that it was addressed only to her and opened it captain ashkevron it read show this to your brother you know which one i mean this is an order it overrides any other orders you may receive until you hear differently under my hand and seal you havent seen either vanyel or the boy tashir remoerdis you wont see them until i tell you that you have randale vanyel handed it back to her with no other comment than a slightly raised eyebrow hes covering for you van she said worriedly but he cant do that for much longer have you got any idea of what you can do not at the moment he told her but i soon will his generous room seemed very crowded with both savil and jervis sprawled across the window seat and a chair respectively ideas vanyel asked looking from savil to jervis and back again ive got one but i want to hear yours first savil wedged herself in the window seat back flat against one wall feet braced against the opposite wall fingers laced together across her knees you said you went across the border to get answers she said as if she was thinking out loud and i found them some of them he agreed eyes halfclosed staring at the patterns that firelight and shadows made on her whites but you also found more questions im wondering if you just werent there long enough and i wonder if we all really ought to go back there with two adeptclass mages it ought to be ridiculously simple to come up with illusiondisguises for four of us hide the boy in plain sight you mean jervis was sitting backwards on one of the straightback chairs with his chin resting on his arms he blinked sleepily while savil spoke now he raised his head and looked alert i like that last place theyre going to look for the boy is back where he came from vanyel nodded that was something of the same idea i had we could further confuse the issue go across the border as say four heralds making up a peace envoy to vedric once outside highjorune we could switch to magic disguises and come into the city by pairs jervis and me tashir and savil one thing they wont be expecting and thats tashir with a woman we meet up at an inn say on the better side of town i could be a bard this time instead of a minstrel you lot could be my entourage nose around see what we can find out van i think you and i need to actually get into the palace savil put in staring up at the ceiling i think we ought to try and find out exactly what happened and what that attack was if it was magic that alone would rule tashir out hmm moisture beaded the outside of his goblet he ran his finger down the side collecting the droplets and traced little patterns on the table in front of him with a wet forefinger do you think getting tashir back into the palace might trigger his memory as well it might savil said moving her gaze down until she caught his eyes its worth a try then lets do it i never thought id see this nag cowed jervis chuckled the rising sun at his back throwing their shadows far ahead of them on the darkpaved road three of the four shadows were as longlimbed and graceful as the companions that threw them the fourth crowhopped from time to time as the rawboned ugly stud jervis sat made his displeasure as obvious as he could savil laughed he doesnt look too cowed to me compared to what he was like before your two ladies chased him up and down the paddock all night hes an angel jervis chuckled reaching out and hitting the stud between the ears with his fist when he bucked a little too hard the gray stud squealed and laid his ears back an answering squeal from kellan and a showing of her formidable teeth settled him back down i hate to think what meke is going to do to me when he finds out what weve done vanyel murmured he was still feeling guilty about borrowing the stud without a by your leave what else were we going to use savil asked in a sweetly reasonable tone of voice as yfandes snorted that blasted stud of mekes was the closest thing to white on the holding besides being the only beast with the endurance to keep up with three companions she chortled come to that hes a good match for jervis as a herald provided youre seeing the real jervis and not the glamour you put on him jervis did make a very unlikely looking herald tashir fit a set of vanyels castoff whites left from when he was seventeen fairly well vanyel and savil had their uniforms of course but for jervis it had been a case of hasty makedo he wore one of his own shirts and had squeezed himself into a pair of vanyels white breeches but theyd had to sacrifice a sleeveless leather tunic of savils opening the seams on both sides and punching holes then lacing it onto him he wore his own boots brown but they hoped no one would notice that so long as we arent dealing with anyone who can see through the glamour well be all right are you sure any spy vedric might have on the border wont pick this up savil asked well heralds are supposed to feel a little of magic a full illusion would radiate for too much but an enhancement should pass without any trouble but wont vedric pick up the illusiondisguises once were in town jervis said suddenly the stud took advantage of his distraction to try to buck him off yfandes nipped the studs flank kellan kicked him and jervis bashed him between the ears all simultaneously vanyel choked down a laugh the stud shrilled his indignation but settled again he would if the ambient magic in highjorune wasnt going to mask my relatively weak spells the illusion is only going to be on the companions to make them something else hardly a whisper on the wind the stud tried to rid himself of the bit you fixed his outside jervis said wistfully if you could only do something about the inside of his ugly head held to the pace of the stud it took them three days to reach highjorune to pass the gates kellan and ghost became donkeys led by an old peasant woman and her son vanyel became a bard on a showy gold palfrey and jervis his manatarms and general servant if attention was to be drawn vanyel wanted it drawn to him and indeed he drew enough attention coming through the gates to more than distract the guards from the old woman and her offspring behind them vanyel and yfandes pranced and preened sidled and danced and in general made a thoroughgoing nuisance of themselves jervis grunted looked longsuffering and earned the sympathy of the gate guards the stud tried to take off someones hand and got a fist in his teeth for his trouble no row taverns for vanyel not this time he lodged in the best inn in highjorune right across from the residency of the master of the weavers guild not so incidentally that put the palace and all its mageenergies and shieldspells between him and the house where lord vedric was staying hopefully any disturbances the illusions were creating would be lost in the greater wash of the shields and the node beneath the shields somebodys tried to break the shields vanyel observed staring fixedly put the window you can tell that from here jervis asked surprised looking up from sharpening his dagger uhm hmm vanyel probed deeper and let his eyes unfocus i can even tell what spells he used and that it was a he and not a her nobody i recognize but id bet it was vedric couldnt you i dont know get a look at vedric so youd know for certain vanyel turned restlessly away from the window and shook his head no probing him to get his signature would tell him i was here having the palace between us wouldnt hide me long if he started looking for another mage i dont like it though i wish i knew for certain and i wish i knew why whoever it was tried to breach the shields it cant be pure curiosity not with spells that powerful being used oh i can guess that its vedric and that he wants to get in there to destroy some kind of evidence but id much rather know for certain if my guess is wrong or right well i wish savil and the boy would get here jervis growled i dont like the notion of us bein split up like this i agree vanyel began when a tap at the door interrupted him he whirled but it was jervis who answered it and with a grimace of relief let in savil and tashir where in havens have you been he demanded you were spposed to be here long before sundown detained she replied smugly and what i got was worth the delay what would you two say to a motive for the mavelans to destroy the entire remoerdis royal house what jervis and vanyel exclaimed simultaneously we were playing peasants seeing the sights tashir said tiredly one of the sights is the great hall of justice they keep important documents in there under glass so that anybody who can read can see them i remembered one of them was the treaty between baires and lineas and told savil so thats why we went there it took a fair amount of tashir playing gawker to give me time to read it by then it was dinnertime and they shooed us all out savil threw herself down in a chair beside the table picked up the knife jervis had been sharpening and examined it critically what it all comes down to is this if one of the two royal houses dies out and there are provisions about it being through misadventure pestilence or acts of the gods in other words it cant be because of proven assassination by the other house the surviving house gets the thrones of both and thats all in ink and parchment under the signature and seal of elspeth remember valdemar oversaw the treaty in the first place and valdemar is responsible for administering the provisions of it if i ever knew that id forgotten it tashir confessed into the silence in other words if tashir is declared guilty of murder the linean throne gets handed over to the mavelans and valdemar has to enforce this vanyel said incredulously in a nutshell savil replied great good gods that aint real likely to make valdemar popular around here jervis observed not that theyre real popular after van runnin off with the boy and if that aint a pretty good reason for the mavelans to kill off the linean house and slap the blame on tashir whos linean even if he was disinherited i dont know what would be nor i savil agreed grimly very tidy little plot well van you wanted a motive i certainly got one he returned to the window and stared out of it and i have an excellent reason for vedric making himself so popular with the lineans there was still some lingering sunset afterglow to make the sky a pearly light blueand against it the palace loomed ominously dark exactly when everyone finally gets around to checking that treaty vedric will be the only mavelan the lineans will accept and they might even do it with good grace if hes done his job right savil he said slowly i think our very first order of business is going to be the palace she supplied these seals were definitely tampered with vanyel observed a little more power behind the attacks and the shields might well have come down yfandes paced up beside him and extended her nose to the door closing her eyes bloodmagic she judged faint but there most of the energy traces are ordinary sorcery but whoever set the spells is used to using bloodmagic and that will taint everything he does which means its not heraldic which we figured and probably not a local working magecraft around here would get you into trouble with your neighbors quickly but working bloodmagic would get you caught and hung vanyel licked his lips and glanced around at the darkened courtyard acting on a hunch from savil theyd cleaned out their belongings from the inn and brought everything with them now he was glad they had he raised his voice just a little conference he called softly four humans and three companions made a huddle mekeals stud was tethered as far away as possible whoever tried to break the shields used something tainted with bloodmagic he said yfandes smelled it out now i have a problem of defense here jervis tashir every time we pass the threshold were going to weaken those shields further i think maybe wed better change our plans because i dont think those shields are going to take much more weakening and the only way for me to reinforce them will be from inside that wont necessarily work either savil observed youll just be patching the weak spot will still be there exactly vanyel nodded it isnt going to be pleasant but what id like to do is to just cross once to keep the strain to a minimum his immediate answer was a silence in which the sound of dead leaves skittering across the cobbles was enough to set his nerves jumping set up in residence until we figure out what happened you mean savil asked he nodded she pursed her lips and gave a reluctant assent im inclined to agree bloodmagic will break shields the way nothing else can and id rather this place wasnt left open to tampering but what about the companions they leave vanyel said unhappily yfandes sent a wordless burst of protest im sorry but i cant think of any place thats safe for them inside the city walls the west gate stays open at night but its guarded if i put a nosee nohear spell on them theyll make it out all right and if vedric detects it it wont matter the stir im going to make by opening the shield ought to keep him thoroughly occupied jervis cleared his throat mother thing we run into trouble that way theyre free t run for help vanyel bit his lip thoughtfully good point fandes i dont like it either but i see no other recourse she answered pawing the cobbles and radiating unwillingness and youll have to look after that damned stud may i kick him if he wont behave she asked raising her head and ears hopefully vanyel grinned to himself other than jervis yfandes had suffered the most from the studs behavior the beast kept trying to induce her to mate as much as you have to from here to karse if necessary be my guest then this is not altogether an unpleasant prospect kellan leshya she waited for the humans to remove their packs from the saddles then trotted to the tethered stud and freed him with her strong white teeth with heads high and eyes fixed on vanyel with acute interest they waited for him to cast the spell since the four of them already knew that the four mounts were there the spell had very little effect on the onlookers but vanyel could see them surrounded with a distorting shimmer that meant the cloaking was in effect yfandes mindsent him a wordless wave of love and concern and with the studs reins still in her teeth turned toward the open gate to the courtyard then with squeals and nips the three companions drove the stallion out of the gates and into the swiftly darkening streets vanyel focused his inner eye on the place where he meant to set a portal in the fabric of the shields then moved his hands in a complicated mirrorimaged gesture through closed eyelids he saw the energy walls of the shields part just enough to let a tall man through its open he looked with outer eyes again and watched jervis feel his way along the invisible but patently tangible shieldwall until he came to the spot opposite vanyel vanyel wasnt sure which was funnier his expression when he couldnt force his way past the shields or his expression when he found the hole i cant hold this too long he warned the other three snatched up their packs and his and medrens poor battered secondhand lute and hurried up the stone stairs as far as the double door they waited white against the dark bulk of the door while vanyel slipped across the boundary and resealed the shields behind himself he took the stairs slowly and regarded the purely physical barrier tashir he began the boy looked at him in startlement young friend this is where you see how useful that gift of yours is my strong suit is not fetching and ive only seen this door once remember vanyel folded his arms and raised an eyebrow at him i also distinctly recall that i barred the door behind lores you surely remember what the door and bar look like and your gift is fetching lets see you raise that bar but tashir began to protest savil looked as if she might object as well but vanyel silenced her with a look do it tashir youre better at this than i am the young man took a deep breath closed his eyes and took a widelegged stance in what may have been an unconscious imitation of the one vanyel had taken and frowned vanyel had been giving him what rudimentary instruction he could when he could it wasnt much but as vanyel had half suspected away from the disapproval of his family and into an environment in which magic was actually encouraged hed begun practicing probably in an attempt to get his rogue gift under some kind of conscious control all of them could clearly hear the grate of the bar in its sockets on the other side of the closed metalsheathed door jervis clapped tashir on the back startling him as the door creaked open a thumbsbreadth vanyel did the same a bit more gently tashir grinned at both of them teeth flashing whitely in the first of the moonlight good work young man vanyel congratulated him now lets get ourselves under cover before somebody curious comes by savil was already pushing the door open the rest of them followed her into the absolute darkness of the entry hall she waited until vanyel had closed the door and rebarred it before fashioning a magelight and sending it upward to dance and flare above her head gods she hissed shocked at the extent of the wreckage in the next room jervis moved past her to stand at the top of the stairs shaking his head ive seen wars and looters that werent this thorough whatn hell did that vanyel glanced over at tashir who had lost his expression of triumph and had become very pale his eyes were shadowed his expression haunted vanyel put his hand lightly on the youngsters shoulder in encouragement and felt him tremble savil joined jervis oblivious to tashirs distress walking very slowly i can tell you what didnt she said unexpectedly tashir the youngster jerked in startlement youre sure vanyel asked softly feeling a tense core inside him go limp with relief he really hadnt believed it was the boy but still positive you get under the glare of the nodeenergy and this place is dusted all over with magic she closed her eyes and reached out her hand as if to touch something theres a very old spell tied to the node thats rooted somewhere just ahead of us but theres a second spell overlaid on the walls themselves and thats what caused this mess van let me handle that one its a trapspell and id rather you didnt trigger it ill second that youre much better with setspells than i am tashir jervis did you understand that jervis nodded tashir looked both frightened and hopeful she said that there was a magic spell on the palace that did all this but why does that eliminate me because you havent even magepotential your gift isnt magic as we use the term real magic leaves traces of itself behind like the dust a moths wings leave on your hands when you catch it you couldnt have done something that would leave those traces youre not capable of it for you manipulating mageenergies would be like trying to carry water in a bucket with no bottom and thats good enough evidence for valdemar jervis put in trouble is id bet it aint good enough evidence for lineas tashirs face fell thats only too true he said crestfallen so our job is to find good enough evidence for lineas vanyel took on unconscious authority first off lets clean out one of the smaller chambers and set up living quarters then well get some sleep well be better off working by daylight savil dropped out of her halftrance and rejoined them i agree i dont want to tackle anything that tricky without a full nights sleep tashir this was your home what would be the best place for us to set up where we arent likely to be seen or disturbed she shivered in a sudden chilly draft and where we can build a fire i dont fancy freezing to death in my sleep and theres a winter bite to the air at night tashir looked about although he had lost some of his apprehension there was still fear and great unhappiness in him that vanyel could sense without effort small wonder everyone he ever knew died here the kitchen i think tashir replied and there wouldnt have been anybody back there when he shuddered and not from the cold another thing to consider vanyel said gravely were all likely to come on some very grisly relics and of us all tashir is the least used to such things tashir dont go off alone stay with one of us jervis by preference if at any time this gets too much for you just go straight back to the kitchen until you get yourself settled again i do want you to try and remember what happened that night i dont want a repetition of what you did in mothers bower its not that i think youll hurt anybody because i know you wont he managed a little smile of encouragement its that youll be noisy lad theres not supposed to be anybody here im sure vedric has figured it out but he might not dare act on his knowledge just yet we want to keep him from having reasons we dont need someone sending for your uncle vedric to lay the ghosts now do we tashir paled and vanyel was immediately sorry hed mentioned either ghosts or vedric the youngster shook his head wordlessly all right then lets get to the first stage he shouldered his pack the others did the same tashir its up to you find us that kitchen thirteen none of them slept particularly well the first light of dawn saw three of the four lying openeyed and tense on their sleeping mats held prisoner by cold nebulous fears and waiting for someone else to make a sound that indicated rising vanyel was actually the last to claw his way out of uneasy halfdreams which wasnt surprising considering how exhausted he was he felt the wakefulness around him after a confused moment or two and made a magelight without thinking three gasps of startlement answered the first flare of the light three pairs of eyes reflected blue flickers back at him if you were all awake he said still sleepmazed and confused why didnt you just get up he told jervis later that on reflection he was surprised no one killed him for that question there were still usable supplies in the kitchen dried salted or otherwise preserved and the kitchen had its own pump and well which solved the problem of where they were going to get water trying to ignore the nagging thought that they were robbing the dead vanyel helped jervis cobble together a tolerable meal of bacon tea and biscuits they sat on folded blankets beside the hearth to eat it the windowless kitchen was dark and it somehow echoed more than it should even jervis was affected by the somber atmosphere casting surreptitious glances over his shoulder at the shadows behind him i think were going to have to divide our attentions vanyel said quietly as they sipped their tea from an assortment of whatever containers had come to hand does anyone object to my taking charge he waited but no one said anything fine savil id like you to look into the trapspell find out what it does or did if you can and how it was set here in the first place jervis tashir id like you two to start going over the palace room by room jervis youve been in and out of highborn homes for a good part of your life you know what belongs and what doesnt i want you to look for anything that seems odd or out of place tashir youre to try and trigger your memory of that night while youre both at it we need candles down here and a bit more in the way of blankets and bedding would be nice and youll be jervis raised a thick grizzled eyebrow his tone was not accusatory just inquiring once again he and vanyel had achieved a delicately balanced friendship it was beginning to grow into something closer and less tentative something more like a reliable partnership a partnership built on respect and concern for the boy that tashir had confessed his fictions hadnt hurt ill be doing exactly the same but from the bottom up i want you two to work from the top down vanyel grimaced i dont think things are going to be very pretty in the cellars and to be brutal im the one of us most recently off a battleline i dont want tashir to have to deal with the kind of things i may find down below i did learn that your father wasnt holding any prisoners tashir but i doubt the searchers spent much time in the cellars looking for victims tashir blanched and took a large audible gulp of tea eventually theres one more thing ill be doing ive got a hunch that the magicnode beneath the palace plays a major part in the why of all this i want to find out just what the connection is if i can there has to be some kind of a connection i cannot believe that tayledras adepts just left a powerful node like that undrained and unattended that kind of carelessness goes counter to everything i know about them even if they were forced out theyd have come back to release the magelines and drain the node if not the original clan then the descendants or allied clan i think that old spell savil mentioned is very likely to have something to do with that tasks assigned they parted vanyel had taken the cellars for another reason he and savil were the only ones capable of producing their own light without needing to resort to candles or lanterns they had no such physical lights and there obviously were no windows in the cellars he had cause to be grateful for a strong stomach before the morning was over hed been right about searchers not checking below and lores had not exaggerated the violence of the massacre in the least even this old the shredded remains were appalling but he had seen remains as bad or worse over the past year and he began to discover a pattern where there had been no people present the damage to things was minimal or nonexistent the more people the greater the damage he did find candles and the wine cellar the former he took up the stairs and left at the kitchen landing the latter he sealed half the casks had been split and all the bottles shattered and as for what remained intacthe rather doubted anyone would ever want to drink from casks that had been stained and spattered with well it was better not to dwell on it they could drink what they found in the kitchen or water from the look of things four of the servants had been drinking and dicing down there when the disaster had struck at least he thought it was four there were four overturned mugs beside the dice and pile of coins but he couldnt find more than six hands before he gave up searching and the hands were the only parts still recognizably human it was odd though four of those six hands had worn rings exactly like the one the maid reta had worn dull silver with strange deadwhite stones retas ring had plainly been something other than ornament but although he mindtouched one of the rings cautiously van could find nothing out of the ordinary about it and yet he had seen a ring identical to these acting on his behalf they could be just the badge of the household yet in magicfearing highjorune why would the rulers own household wear something spelltouched vanyel wondered it all tied in somewhere somehow he had to find the key but answers were not forthcoming not yet he lost track of time down there and certainly under these circumstances his stomach was not likely to remind him it felt like being on the border again every muscle tensed and waiting for something to leap on him from behind and no yfandes to guard his back hed never been so conscious of being completely alone before he might easily have been the only living being in the entire palace and it was far too easy for his overactive imagination to people the shadows beyond his magelight with pathetic or vengeful spirits when he finally completed his inspection of the cellars and their occasionally grisly contents it was with profound relief that he climbed the kitchen stairs to emerge blinking into brilliant light that was the first welcome surprise in a long while someone had taken it upon himself to remove the bundles of candles that same someone had stuck them on every available surface all over the kitchen and lit them light transformed the look of the place from that of a gloomy cave to a normal island of commonplace a bright and cheerful haven of sanity it was a profligate use of candles but there were hundreds of candles vanyel stepped into the kitchen with a feeling of having left a little hell behind him tashir and jervis were by the hearth sorting through several large bundles wheres savil vanyel asked he squinted into the light what time is it tashir jumped and stared at vanyel with a momentary expression of panic as if he did not recognize him immediately jervis continued with his sorting unperturbed shes tryin to track down where that trap was set up the armsmaster replied and its early evening give us a hand here eh we come up with some likely stuff out of closets and chests if you get it sorted out an made up as beds ill see to dinner jervis was as good as his word by the time savil drifted in still a little unfocused he had another fair meal put together the blankets comforters and sheets that tashir and vanyel had made into tolerably comfortable beds smelled strongly of sendle and lavender proof enough that theyd been laid away in storage vanyel judged by tashirs silence and white lips that the two had probably come across the same appalling signs and stains of slaughter that he had though probably not the actual remains the party that had searched the palace had most likely dealt with the actual bodies which was all to the good if tashir had seen what vanyel had been dealing with the boy might well have snapped vanyel gave jervis high marks for unexpected sensitivity in the state of nerves the young man was in now one bloodstained sheet come upon in a bundle of bedding he was expected to use would likely send him into hysterics safer far to have searched out the linen closets and taken things sealed away for winter use and it was also probable that the pattern below had been continued above rooms that had been occupied at the time of the massacre might not have anything usable in them anymore savil wandered over to the fire and sat down absently on the bed nearest her pack any luck he asked her she shook off her vagueness and finally looked at him instead of through him yes and no i think ive got the site narrowed to the second floor and i think i know how it was set someone brought in a catalyst then using that catalyst enlarged and strengthened the spells compass over a long period of time with no shields on this place it would have been apprentice work once the initial spell had been set she accepted a plate from jervis without looking at it its nasty stuff kechara makes my skin crawl hard to force myself to probe it now that i know its there like some kind of web with something incredibly evil at the heart and im over on the edge of it trying to see into the heart without waking whats there and theres something very very odd about it it reeks of bloodmagic as you might well expect but theres blood involved in it in a much subtler way eat vanyel advised guessing that she hadnt paused for food or drink since this morning jervis did you and tashir find anything the armsmaster chewed and swallowed before answering maybe if youre done below id like your word on it its a room first floor smack square in the center of this building not much bigger nor a closet an has just one thing in it a floortceiling pillar same stone as the outside might just be a kinda kingpost for the palace its bigger around than i can reach but i never seen anything like it you said look for odd well thats odd tashir the young man froze in midbite and stared at him like a cornered rabbit vanyel felt an uncomfortable sympathy for him his own empathy told him tashir was dancing on a hairthin thread of nerve at the moment there was no doubt in vanyels mind that he was trying to jar his memories loose there was also no doubt in his mind that the youngster was literally going through hell but there was no help for it if the mystery was to be solved and tashir cleared of guilt it was likely to take all four of them to do it tashir what do you know about this room jervis found he prompted tashir swallowed and licked his lips nothing he replied faintly they wouldnt ever let me in there everybody else got taken in at least once but not mother and not me tashir thats something vanyel chided gently you said everybody do you mean that literally servants too the young man nodded so hard he started to tip his plate off his knee jervis caught it before it spilled tashir hardly noticed he was so intent on vanyel servants too vanyel everybody thats more than odd thats smacking of a mystery he brooded for a moment staring at the crackling flames in the hearth he was greatly tempted to seek the place out now this instant but then he thought of the empty rooms filled with wreckage and the long haunted halls hed have to traverse to get there he hesitated and shivered strong stomach battletrained or not there was a limit i dont think so im not up to it besides id rather not chance a light being seen from outside itll be there in the morning ddddo you want to go there tonight tashir stuttered patently not relishing the thought at all no tashir not tonight he replied halfsmiling as a rush of relief brought a little more color to the youngsters cheeks not tonight he repeated echoing his own thought weve all had enough for one day its been there all this time itll be there in the morning jervis broke the silence that followed van i was noticin something rooms where there wasnt any folks hardly anythings smashed maybe a curtain torn chair broken that kind of thing rooms where there was people theyre wrecked the more people the worse its the same down below vanyel told him as jervis continued demolishing his dinner thoughtfully savil does that kind of pattern suggest anything to you she scowled with concentration yes but i cant think what damn vanyel followed a stray thought tashir when they broke in and found the mess where were you ththe great hall he faltered i just sort of woke up and i was there and the worst wreckage was in the great hall vanyel turned to jervis for confirmation near as i can tell from what ive seen so far as he tried to trigger his own memory he had a momentary flash of that dream hed had of being surrounded by a whirlwind of devilish creatures he realized with a start that made him sit up straight that that dream actually had an echo in his recent experience the fire flared on the hearth and with it memory hed been playing bait at the beginning of the karsite ampaign sitting all alone in an old keep just behind the border the keep was supposed to be held by nothing more formidable than an old man and a handful of retainers certainly the guard was days away at the best forced march pace though that shouldnt have mattered because no one was supposed to know that the keep was held so weakly and no one was supposed to know that it guarded a very strategic supply route but someone did know someone had been leaking information to the karsites poorlyguarded keeps of strategic importance behind the valdemar lines were being decimated the occupants slaughtered leaving holes the strategists didnt learn about until it was too late or worse w en the strategists checked on their supposed holdings they found keeps somehow occupied by hostile forces vanyel read the signs of magic and had known only magic could counter these attacks so vanyel had ridden yfandes to exhaustion to reach this one a likely target hed cleared out the old man and his following and waited and the attack had come in the form of a gretshkeswarm demidemonic creatures mostly head teeth and appetite that taken individually were inconsequential an ordinary fighter could deal with one or two and they certainly were not immune to cold iron but a swarm that was another matter the swarm contained hundreds if not thousands of the creatures you could kill them by the dozens and still they would overwhelm you like encountering an avalanche of starving rats a mage didnt control a swarm he just unleashed it when the food was gone or when they were sated they would return to their own plane if they were given an exit so a mage using them would customarily lure a swarm to the portal to their plane that he had opened within his target area and cast a shield about the target to keep the swarm from escaping he would wait an appropriate length of time usually no more than a candlemark the swarm was fast and open the portal again to pull whatever of the swarm remained back to their own plane he would take the shield down then and an occupying force could move in all this required someone on the level of adept which made it likely that the mage in question was one of the three adepts the karsites had hired when they began this one of the three had threatened then launched the brutal incineration of an entire town the town had been saved but in stopping him mardic and donni had called the flames on themselves in a desperate attempt to confine them it had worked it had been a brave unselfishand ultimately fatal ploy the best that could be said was that their pain had been mercifully short vanyel had been determined that before he was pulled off the lines he would have that particular mages life by preference given the other things theyd done he would have all three but he wanted that one the only problem was the mages themselves refused confrontation striking time and time again where he wasnt by the time of this ambush hed had enough he had begun hunting them with the patience and stealth that would eventually earn him the name shadowstalker when he tracked down the second adept but that was in the future at that moment the first step on his selfappointed road of revenge he had been waiting in the darkened keep fueling the delicate illusion that made it appear to that unknown enemy that only the old man and his dozen retainers and fighters were within those walls and all were asleep he felt the shields go up he felt the portal open the swarm descended on the hall of the keep where he waited for them beside the firepit in the center and he threw up his own shield abandoning the illusion and watched as the swarm ravened outside it tearing the scant furnishings of the hall to shreds in frustration unable to reach the meat so tantalizingly out of reach while he smiled grimly and set up a second shield between the swarm and the portal when the mage opened the portal again then established a probe to check on the results of his work vanyel would seize on the probe before he could withdraw it and use it to send him an unexpected surprise it was the image of the swarm shredding cushions furnishings and tapestries that interested him now an image he sent swiftly to savil who seized on it with an exclamation jervis raised his eyebrow we think we may have an explanation for all the destruction vanyel explained absently as he and savil conferred in mindspeech its complicated and theres a lot of ifs and buts it may take us a while to unravel them but the explanation fits the current evidence jervis just shook his head if thats magery then its too much for me van he said yawning ill leave that to you ill just show you that room and let you deal with it eh ill do that vanyel replied then turned his mind to looking for the traces that would tell him what kind of things had torn the hall to shredsbecause that would tell him a great deal about how strong the enemy was and importantly might even give a clue as to who but in the end he and savil sought their beds without any answers but one how strong was very adept at least because the traces that would have distinguished what the trapspell had unleashed had been skillfully wiped away all that remained was the heavily camouflaged spell itself which only an adept could have detected under the camouflage and the bare traces of magic that had alerted them in the first place jervis and tashir were already asleep when they gave up sleep he asked savil hoping shed answer in the affirmative we might as well we arent going to get anything more tonight she stretched once and began burrowing into her blankets practically radiating exhaustion vanyel realized then what kind of strain she was under all this complicated involved sorcery and maintaining her position as the webs eastern guardian he resolved to take more of the burden from her as soon as he could this was not fair to her nor was it good for her i wonder if theres a way to tie all the heralds into the web as powersource at least that would take fully half the burden off the guardians want me to put out the candles he asked glancing around at the burning tapers still bedecking corners of the kitchen she opened one eye thoughtfully no just leave them if you would it isnt as if we need to hoard them and i dont think i want to go to sleep in darkness for a while vanyel thought it over a moment and nodded you know what teachermine he said softly neither do i she chuckled wearily and closed her eyes again absurd isnt it here we are two of the ranking heraldmages in valdemar afraid of the dark he wrapped himself up in his own blankets if you promise not to tell anyone i wont either a light snore was his only answer and he fell asleep with the comforting glow of the candles all about them the tiny room vibrated with power it was a round room stonewalled and woodenflooredandceilinged the walls were pale sandstone the rest pale birch the pillar of stone clearly reached higher than the ceiling and lower than the floor and the room with barely enough space to walk around the dark pillar was very clearly set up with permanent shields like those in the communal magic work room at the palace in haven small wonder neither he nor savil had detected this artifact before vanyel set a cautious hand to the pillar of charcoalgray highly polished stone as tashir and jervis watched him curiously it was warm not cool and felt curiously alive and very familiar this was a tayledras heartstone the vale of ktreva had such a stone a place where the physical material valley itself merged and melded with the energynode and intersection of powerflows below it such a stone was the physical manifestation of the energies fueling the tayledras magics and this physical manifestation was peculiarly vulnerable to tampering so the heartstones were guarded jealously and always deactivated when tayledras left a place this one should not be here except perhaps as a dead relic of former inhabitants it should not be alive and more responding to his touch physical and magical upon it this he faltered and pulled his hand away with a wrench jervis you were right this is not something i would expect here im going to have to mindtouch it anything we can do to help the armsmaster asked quietly to tell you the truth id rather you took tashir out to the great hall to see if you can help him remember vanyel said trying to keep the fascination of the heart stone from recapturing him there isnt much you can help me with and you two being here would be a little distracting but if youd poke your nose in here from time to time anything i should watch for well vanyel replied wryly if im turning blue thats probably a sign somethings wrong other than that trust your own judgment jervis answering laugh was gruff and sounded a little like churning gravel but it proved that of the four of them he was the one least affected by their macabre surroundings all right let me take the boy out and well see if we can make some progress thanks and thank you jervis that we can trust each other now i dont think i could be doing this otherwise without waiting to see them go vanyel turned back to the stone pillar and placed both palms and his forehead against it and it took him into itself for a very long time he was conscious only of the incredible seething maelstrom of the energynode itself it was like plunging into the heart of the sun and yet remaining curiously unscathed and untouched it was different from tapping into the node there he was outside separate from the energy he sought to control and he was dealing with a single thin stream of force now he was a part of the force with no intent or chance to control it but control was not what he wanted he wanted only observation and answers but to have an answer one must first ask a question he framed it in his mind carefully inserting all the nuances into it he could in words it would have been a simple who left this here in thought it was infinitely more complex than that asking who specifically and who as a class the heartstone was not an intelligence but it remembered and every question that was balanced by an answer would call that answer out of the stone vanyel got a very clear picture of tayledras adepts several of them all of them radiating great power including one with the peculiar bluegreen aura of the rare healeradept that particular adept was much clearer and lingered longer in the mind and the implication was that it was this healeradept that was responsible for having left both stone and node still in their active state if vanyel could have started with surprise he would have although they could and on occasion did act as ordinary healers tayledras healeradepts concerned themselves with healing not people but environments at restoring the balance nature had intended at healing the hurts that either magic or the hand of man had dealt there that a healeradept would have deemed it necessary to leave this potentially disastrouslydangerous energy source in lands soon to be settled by ordinary humans that seemed to indicate that there was a terrible need that overrode all other considerations why he asked urgently and felt himself being drawn down deeper below the bedrock and into the roots of the earth itself and he realized with a shock that the pillar was that deeply rooted too there was tension here a tension that increased as he went deeper a vast pressure to either side of him that squeezed him until he could scarcely breathe and still the force that had seized him to answer his question drew him deeper and deeper still to a point where the rock began to warm about him then he saw it running from north to south invisible from above yet carrying implied within it such peril that his blood ran cold was a crack in the last layer of rock itself a fault a place of slippage following the river bottom that was natural enough what was not natural was the hole punched through the fault down to the molten core of the planet something probably left from the mage wars that was what the heartstone was planted above and all of highjorune was built directly on that fault more it extended the width of lineas and out into the unsettled lands if it slipped and it was only a matter of time before it slipped and caused a catastrophe that would destroy the city in fire and earthquakeand much of the surrounding country beside vanyel could not imagine why it hadnt happened before this until he saw where the energy of the node was going it was feeding into a complicated spell so convoluted and involved he could never have set it himself it could only be the handiwork of that tayledras healeradept and it looked to be the masterwork of an entire lifetime as a mage and an adept it was holding the wound closed and keeping the fault from slipping more it would given time enough heal the wound and the fault redistributing the strain elsewhere until this was no longer an area of instability but it would take time hundreds of years or more and any great siphoning away of the nodeenergy would deprive the spell of needed power and if that occurred depending on the amount of energy stolen from its proper usage there would come anything from a minor tremor to the major devastating disaster the adept had been trying to prevent the force that had him let him go and he drifted back to the surface more than a little dazed but he still had one more question what was the connection between tashirs family and this artifact at the heart of their palace that answer came immediately and almost as words they were the guardians and with that came a rush of knowledge that rocked him physically away from the stone he opened his eyes to find himself pressed back against the wall staring at the pillar of dark volcanic basalt with his mind seething with information he staggered out of the tiny room carefully closing the door behind him and made his unsteady way into the kitchen bypassing the great hall entirely he wanted to lie down very badly this was not the first time hed queried a heartstone but it was the first time one had responded with such a flood of facts and memories the heartstones hed merged with had been slow old and so peaceful that the answer you wanted might take candlemarks to drift within grasping by contrast this one practically flung responses at you before you finished the question he made the kitchen easily enough and spent some time sticking up new candles and lighting them before wobbling back to his bed and falling facedown into the blankets he must have slept because the next thing he knew the others were clattering about the kitchen there was a smell of frying bacon and his stomach was declaring war on his backbone he rolled over on his back stiffly painfully and savil immediately knelt at his side and peered into his eyes you were in shocksleep she said we couldnt wake you i hope to hell you got something worth it he took a deep breath and discovered that his ribcage was sore that all his muscles ached he must have held them tensed for hours he nodded answers he saidcroaked rather i got answers i got answers savil thats a heartstone in there and its awake her mouth had dropped open the moment hed said the words heartstone she shut it again with a snap eat first and get something to drink then tell us he sat up slowly more than ever grateful for all the soft comforters to cushion his aching body from the stone floor of the kitchen there was a fire in the hearth and the other three seemed warm but he was cold cold jervis shoved a plate into his hand tashir a cup of tea into the other savil and jervis then pretended to deal with the remnants of their dinners tashir made no such pretense hovering at vanyels side and watching every mouthful he took with impatience it was a little embarrassing but vanyel could not find it in his heart to blame him when he put down the empty plate the other two gave up all pretensions and hovered around him ill try to make this short he said feeling a little awkward with all their attention so fixed on him this palace is situated on top of a place where several lines of magical energy meet and collect we call that a node nodes the very powerful ones that is frequently arent natural they can be created artificially by a particular group of adepts called the tayledras the hawkbrothers at jervis and tashirs look of blank nonrecognition he added they live in the pelagirs most people have never heard of them fewer still will ever see them savil and i are among the few savil nodded theyre very secretive and for a good reason they do almost as naturally as breathing something damned few other mages are even capable of imagining they manipulate the energy fields of the world around us vanyel interrupted her gently they do two things really they drain magic left from the old wars away from lands that ordinary people are moving into and they use that magic both to heal those lands and to create sanctuaries for magical creatures that are displaced by the folk moving in when they settle in a place they generally create a node under it to use when they leave that place they always or so i always thought deactivate and drain the node and reroute the powerlines running to it thats what starwind always told me savil agreed shifting her position so that she rested her chin on her knees well they didnt this time vanyel replied the node is still fully active and the heartstone that is the physical link to it is still alive thats what that pillar is tashir the heartstone and that brings me to why he licked his lips and closed his eyes for just a moment to center himself some time when people first moved into this area tashir one of the tayledras remained behind and selected your remote forefather to be the hereditary guardian of the heartstone he charged him to keep it safe and to see that no one in lineas ever dabbled in magic that charge has been passed down to everyone with the blood of the remoerdis family because that blood carries magepotential with it and because that very wise ancestor of yours saw no reason to limit the guardianship to a favored few the more guardians he thought the safer and i think he was right after all this has gone on for generations without any inkling of the power here leaking outside of lineas thats the meaning of those rings everyone except you and your mother wore they link the wearer to the heartstone and the guardianship and the spell that binds wearer to ring and to the guardianship allows the stone to act upon the wearer to keep them safe and to safeguard itself i actually saw that last in action your mothers maid reta was moved by the heartstone to tell me some of what i needed to know it was quite uncanny she acted for all the world as if someone had put a secondstage truth spell on her back to the subject you didnt get one and werent sealed to the stone because your father didnt believe you were of his blood to settle that question the stone says otherwise the stone recognized you as being of the blood the moment you entered the room you are the trueborn son of deveran remoerdis of lineas and if your father had ever conquered his own doubts and suspicions and allowed you into the room even as an infant he would have known that too tashir hung his head and vanyel could see his shoulders shaking he laid his hand on top of one of the youngsters and jervis put his arm around the young mans shoulders for a moment now the reason why the node was left active theres an instability underneath lineas right underneath highjorune the node is literally holding it together if it were to be disturbed especially if it were to be drained as a careless or ignorant mage might manage highjorune would certainly be destroyed by a terrible earthquake and quite probably all of lineas a good section of baires and even some of valdemar that is why the people of lineas have been trained to shun and discourage mages that is what your people have held in trust for centuries and i think that the power of the node is also why the mavelans want lineas unfortunately i suspect they see only the powerful node and have made no effort at discovering why it is there i doubt theyd care savil said dryly i wish i knew differently he put down his mug and rested his forehead on his own knees gods he said his voice muffled well we have part of the puzzle he felt a hand on his shoulder savils tired kechara she asked not tired precisely he replied raising his head and smiling into her eyes just a little divided you know what querying a heartstone is like you become part of it its hard being a rock they have such a strange sense of time and priorities he shook off his feeling of disorientation and patted her hand no matter now that ive got that solved i can help you with that trapspell if you can get me safely inside it i think i can unravel the components enough to tell what triggers it and what it acts on were getting somewhere too jervis put in diffidently tashir raised his head and sniffed once then scrubbed the tears from his cheeks with the back of his hand and nodded you want to tell em tashir or you want me i can he said though his voice quavered a little i remember why those things couldnt get me the way they got the others i was pushing them away with my head i remember doing that i remember them trying to get at me and i remember just shoving like this he screwed up his face with effort and vanyel found himself being pushed across the floor away from the boy bedding and all when he reached out his hand he encountered what was almost a surface as if the air itself had solidified tashir dropped the effort with a gasp it hurts to do that he said but it hurt less when i was scared vanyel nodded and the reason that the others held their attackers off for a little while which was why the rooms with people in them were torn apart was because of the rings the stone told me that theres some limited protections spelled into the rings by the ceremony of binding unfortunately those protections were mainly meant to be used against someone trying to probe a guardians mind not against someone trying to kill him one more day should see us with all the answers savil observed lets just hope they arent answers we dont want to hear jervis replied grimly sensitized by the heartstone to what magically should and should not be associated with the palace itself vanyel took the lead the next morning making a check of every room in the palace once they found the trapspell catalyst they would have a much better chance of unraveling the roots of the spell itself there was nothing on the first floor and nothing in the private quarters not even ylynas but when they reached the guest rooms the taste of evil was in the air of the primary suite so thick that vanyel could hardly believe that savil didnt sense it too this was a set of five rooms reserved for the most important of visitors the suite that the mavelan representatives had undoubtedly occupied during the signing of the treaty and the wedding the effluvium of wrong was strongest in the reception chamber a room of linenpaneled walls hung with weaponry and the heads of many dead animals and furnished with a variety of impractical and uncomfortable unpadded wooden chairs and one large desk he traced it growing more and more nauseated by the moment to of all things an ornamental dagger hung in plain sight on the wall above the hearth he didnt touch it he couldnt bear to but he didnt need to it had been there for years perhaps as long as eighteen or twenty the spell had been given plenty of time to permeate through the physical fabric of the palace like a slow poison in the veins of an unsuspecting victim thats it savil said incredulously i must have passed this room a dozen times vanyel shrugged and found himself a marginally comfortable chair they were likely to be here a long while once savil got started did you test that dagger or were you looking for something hidden he asked something hidden she admitted ruefully walking slowly and reaching for but nor touching the dagger her eyes unfocused thats it she replied after a moment all right ill link to you and you slip me inside the spell vanyel told her bracing himself in the chair get out as soon as you can youve been draining yourself quite enough as it is not as much as you kechara she retorted her lips thinning as she took a seat on the floor at his feet and laid her hands over his wrists but im not a webguardian he pointed out with ruthless logic come on lets get this over with he closed his eyes and evoked a light trancestate centered then reached for a deeper level of savil than he touched in mindspeech like hand taking hand he linked with her followed her blindly through a twisting torturous maze of fire and shadow and confusing shapes in which the slightest misstep would mean things he preferred not to think about savil knew what she was doing if she couldnt weave her way through this thing no one outside of ktreva could brace yourself love im going to toss you in he made himself as compact and small a bundle as he could and felt himself hurled he crawled on hands and knees into consciousness he opened burning eyes his stomach in knots his head pounding and wanting a bath more than hed ever wanted anything in his life he felt filthy inside as well as out savil was still kneeling beside him holding both of his cold hands in hers staring intently into his eyes youre back she said im back he replied swallowing bile you wont like it i dont like it now she released his hands and he rubbed his eyes with his knuckles remember what you said about blood being involved very subtly in this it is and given what i found out about the guardianship of the heartstone its sicken ingly logical when this spell is triggered on someone it not only goes for them but for everyone sharing blood relationship with that person that is also a mage or carries the potential everyone right down to babes in the womb savils face grayed a little so whoever did this ive got that too last person to trigger it was dear uncle vedric mavelan last person targeted was tashir so much for all his protests about wanting to help the lad tashir her voice rose at least half an octave but then that means that vedric knew the boy wasnt his vanyel grimaced and tried to sit up straighter exactly he knew it all along and made no attempt to clear either his sister or the youngster now i have a few guesses as to why there seem to be inconsistencies the biggest is why the maid reta i spoke to survived my guess is that vedric shielded the palace to avoid blood in the streets and the question of why tashir would murder people he didnt even know existed if he hadnt its pretty likely that people would have looked elsewhere for a perpetrator rather than to tashir and that shield would explain why the mavelans werent attacked since they were related to tashir through ylyna and why ylyna was killed with everyone else she must have been carrying magepotential savil mused aloud the thing is this is a trap that resets itself until we destroy the maker anyone that knows how can set it against anyone else he sat bolt upright as the shields on the palace buckled and weakened under a furious attack did you savil exclaimed blanching gods of course you felt that theyre your shields theres somebody out there trying to get in will get in vanyel corrected grimly launching himself out of the chair its vedric he knows were in here hes probably figured out that we know what happenedor soon will he cant afford to let us escape the shields shrieked in his mind as another attack battered at them vanyel started down the hall at a run followed by his aunt yfandes he called snaking the mindtouch around vedric hoping the mage would be too preoccupied with his attack to sense it here grateful that thought took less time to send than words he told her all theyd learned time to run for it love have kellan stay with the stud you and ghost head over the border at top speed vedrics on to us if we lose this i will see that the kingdom knows she replied grimly i will see you avenged then i will come to you she cut him off before he could protest and there was no more time to spare for protests we have he cast over his shoulder at savil maybe a candlemark or two to figure out what were going to do fourteen they skidded into the great hall feet slipping on the debris startling jervis and tashir considerably as they came to a halt beside them savil held her side and panted a little what jervis began vedrics out there vanyel interrupted him hes trying to break through the shields i expect he knows were in here i expect he figures weve learned the truth of what happened hes the one that triggered the trapspell he used tashir for the target and the damned things set to take anyone of the bloodline of the target with magepotential tashir had been sitting on a cleared space on the floor he stood slowly his expression frozen his face drained i remember he said his voice tight and strained i remember now he turned away from them and pointed a shaking hand at the door that led to the secondfloor stairs i was running down those stairs i was going to run away i told father that i told him that id rather dig ditches than go to baires he laughed at me he said he doubted i had the spine and i hit him i didnt mean to but it just happened i was afraid hed do something horrible and i ran i ran through here and out the door and and i couldnt get out it was like hitting a wall i didnt even think i just turned around and started running for the stable door and when i got here he pointed at his feet i it happened like i dont know like a whirlwind only there were all these teeth and eyes and pretty soon it was filling the whole room and tearing everybody and everything around into shreds his voice spiraled up into hysteria and jervis shook his shoulders tashir come on lad weve got troubles now dont you fall apart on me the young man shivered like a trapped rabbit but he nodded and there was still some sense in his eyes i repeat vedrics out there vanyel shuddered as he felt his shields buckle a little more hell be in here soon i sent the companions out of here kellans minding the stud she and ghost and yfandes are going for home one way or another the truth is going to get out but theres only one way out now for us savil ill hold him while you build a gate and get jervis and tashir out of here she nodded face gray and grim where haven by choice no one is going to extract him from randales hands once he hears the whole story he was only giving half his attention to the conversation the other half was busy weaving reinforcements to his disintegrating shields but she protested dammit savil just do it i cant gating that far would probably kill me vanyel she interrupted urgently what happens when he triggers the trap on you he felt himself pale felt his spellcasting falter oh gods let me think you should be all right if i can just hold him off long enough for you to alert somebody to protect you medren is bardgifted with no magepotential he should be safe enough my sibs no potential father is safe she told him how do you think i got half these white hairs i spent a week in the nodes weaving protections for him when i first met starwind when i realized how powerful an adept i was i also realized that very few enemies were going to be able to come at me directly so they might choose to come at me through my brother i made sure there was no chance of that while i had the energy and leisure is there anybody else no he said but his mind was screaming the real truth at her even as his lips formed the lie savil jisa oh gods the children what he grabbed her shoulders so tightly it surely must have hurt enough to leave bruises as his fingertips dug into the flesh i have three children brightstar and his twin are in ktreva under their own shields starwinds and moondances so theyre safe enough but jisa jisa how why his thoughts were not particularly ordered or coherent but he did his best to get the sense across to her savil dont ask shes mine by blood randale and shavri wanted it thats all you need to know shes not under shield he wanted to pound the fear he felt for them into savil and shavris at risk through jisa i dont know if shavris got the potential or not you have to get back there gods i never meant anyone else to know but theres no choice jays trust jays tell him the truth i think hell understand no one else gods if randale was only a mage go savil the battering at his shields grew fiercer just go i cant hold him much longer he released her shoulders and savil turned without another word and faced one of the open doorways she held up her hands and vanyel felt the slight disorientation that always accompanied the moment when someone invoked gateenergy around him he left the little group of three and sprinted across the wreckagestrewn hall and up the staircase to face the door and try to keep vedric in check long enough for them to escape he fought silently fighting as he had never fought before fighting not only for himself but for his friends and for his land for without shavri randale would fall to pieces the last of his shield reinforcements cracked and fell away just as he felt the wave of dizziness that signaled the opening of the gate itself and the outer door exploded open breaking two of its hinges and shattering every window in that wall just as he felt a wash of pain pain that signaled the gate being traversed and then going down again that pain nearly did him in he was barely able to get his own personal shield up in time to deflect the lightnings vedric called down on him hold him boy came an urgent voice behind him he knows we know he doesnt dare let us live jervis vanyel tapped recklessly into the node and flung fire into vedrics face he didnt dare look around but he spat a stream of heartfelt curses in four languages at the armsmaster damn you he screamed deflecting a paralysisdagger and countering with an icestorm get under cover what in the hell do you think youre doing what savil told me came the unperturbed voice from behind and to his right as vanyel tried to shatter vedrics shields with hammering blows of pure force vedric turned them though not easily vanyel could spare no more attention to the armsmaster to deal with vedric would take every scrap of concentration they were equals or so close as made no difference vanyel had the node to draw on but vedric was being fed from somewhere outside himself too the entryway shook the glass of the windows that had been shattered in the first exchange rose up and flew at him he pulverized the flying shards of death with a single blow now flakes of stone and plaster rained down on them and the paving beneath their feet cracked then vedric smiledand triggered the trapspell hastily vanyel extended his shield to cover jervis a whirlwind swarm of creatures as tashir had described seeming mostly teeth and eyes circled them screaming their outrage at not being able to reach them they werent the gretshke beings hed encountered they were at once less hungry and more evil the swarm he knew attacked to feed these things attacked only to rend and tear to maim and destroy for the pleasure of destruction and the pain it caused shrieking in frustration the swarm spiraled up and away passing through the ceiling unhindered and were gone vedric smiled again well herald vanyel i presume that is who you are arent you going to try to rush off to the rescue of your family your kindred vanyel just laughed at him that was not the response vedric had expected and it shook him but what shook him even more was the backlash a moment later as his swarm attempted to find victims and were thwarted again and again and again failed spells recoiled on their caster that was one of the first lessons starwind had taught him and a spell this powerful if backlashed should have knocked vedric to his knees but it didnt it seemed as if the mavelan magelord took the backlash and siphoned it off somewhere that was when vanyel realized exactly where vedric was getting his unprecedented power the entire mavelan family had united for once and was feeding this their chosen representative with all their combined powers vanyel could hammer at him until dark with no effect he deflected another lightningstrike and thought frantically even if he defeated vedric that wouldnt take care of the rest of the family unless he could somehow get at them through the linkage to the magelord then he knew how to manage that raw nodepower only tayledrastrained or an adept with the dearlybought control he and savil shared could handle it he remembered how when he had defeated the changelingmage krebain he had nearly killed himself by flooding it through his system only one thing had saved him the fact that moondance a ktreva healeradept had gotten to him within heartbeats after hed blasted himself if he poured that through vedric and into the meld before they realized what he was doing there would be no saving of any of them without being prepared to handle that kind of power they would be destroyed but to do that he would have to drain the node to a level where he might trigger a quake and he would have to touch vedric he had been very carefully avoiding looking at the magelord now he looked across the space intervening between them and saw tylendel as tylendel would have looked now had he survived into full manhood he froze the momentary pause in the parryriposte of the mageduel broke vedrics rhythm and concentration he looked up and stared at vanyel as if wondering what the other was up to that broke the grip of heartache holding him for nothing could have been less like the tylendel vanyel had loved than the creature that looked at him out of the mask of tylendels face there was craft there and guile and a terrible cruelty the kind of cruelty that would see nothing wrong with setting an innocent boy up to be abused and neglected most of his life a heartlessness that had finally served the helpless boy up as a sacrifice as the expendable tool that gave vedric power and never once felt a twinge of guilt or regret a strengthening surge of anger galvanized him and he reengaged with every resource he had fighting his way through lightning fire forcewalls everything vedric could throw into his path he could see the puzzlement in vedrics eyes as he won each step across the room paying for each fingerlength in pain when vedrics weaponry penetrated his shielding and scored on him but taking those fingerlength gains despite the pain he forgot jervis forgot tashir forgot everything but the fight to win to within armsreach of the magelord multicolored curtains of power danced in front of him barring his way they scorched him as he parted them two steps to go one he reached out and seized vedrics arms and at that moment the mage seemed to figure out what his goal was panic spasmed across his face but it was a realization that came too late vanyel opened himself up to the node completely and let the power use him as a channel as he had when he melded with the heartstone it poured through him meeting no resistance and into the meld that was the mavelan family vedrics spine arced his mouth opened but no sound emerged for one moment he glowed like a young sun vanyels mind rocked under a multivoiced scream of agony that seemed to go on and on forever then it was gone and so was vedric there was nothing left but a pile of white ash at vanyels feet and two handfuls of ash that he dropped onto the pile vanyel stared at the ash dully and when the entryway swayed he thought for a moment that it was his own fatigue that made him stumble and lose his footing but as jervis scrambled toward him to grab his arms and shake him he understood the node hed drained enough power so that the fault had gone unstable the building rocked again as jervis continued to shake him come on you damned fool he shouted right into vanyels face those damned shields that vedric set up t keep us from gettin away are still there gate us outa here before the building comes down on our heads he wrenched himself out of jervis hands and faced the ruined outer door holding up his hands and beginning the gatespell while around him the room bucked and heaved like a boat in a storm the pain was incredible letting the nodeforce use him had left him raw it was only knowing that jervis would perish with him that kept him going he could see the court beyond the door or rather what the quake was leaving of it the palace was disintegrating around them and nothing living was going to stay that way for long here finally the gate was complete the courtyard winked out with a wrench that felt as if someone had torn vanyels guts out and in its place was the corridor just outside the ashkevron family chapel vanyels knees gave out and he collapsed he had just enough energy to wince a little as half the wall collapsed between him and the gate there was nothing but pain now and he lacked even the strength to weep jervis was shaking him he tried to push the mans hands away but it was like a babe trying to push away the hand of an adult go he panted too spent even to moan cant hold it stable theres nothing left i overestimated again he could feel the gate pulsing with the beating of his own heart in a moment it would collapse go now he tried to urge the armsmaster he was so tired hed give anything to be able to rest beyond the pain shadowlover death had long since lost any fear for him he had been courted by the shadowlover for so long that his embrace would be welcome if only it would bring him peace there was nothing left not even his will but jervis had enough will for two im not goin without you the old man growled as the palace walls cried in a hundred agonized voices around them you remember what you said about giving up dammit van dont do it now theres nobody to pick up your load if you give up on me the words reached through the haze of pain and weakness as nothing else could have he struggled to his feet jervis supporting him as the palace bucked around them jervis started for the open gate more than half dragging him over the rubble and finally draped his arm across his own shoulders and carried him through the gate itself hed thought there could be no worse pain than passing that gate he discovered a heartbeat later that he was wrong there was a flash of light on metal as jervis boots clattered onto the stone of the corridor floor it was training a training that refused to admit to having no strength that made him squirm sideways in jervis grip but it wasnt quite enough there was a rush of dark cloth toward them and the hard impact of something driving into his stomach and jerking upward leren jervis roared what in and pain that blacked out everything else sent him bonelessly to the floor as jervis let go of him somewhere in some other world beyond the pain there was a sound of scuffling all he knew was the pain the agony that was the center of him as he lay on his side and clutched his stomach something hot and wet trickling between his fingers heal i have to heal myself he had just enough healinggift to save himself he reached feebly no strength chosen yfandes mindvoice faint and faroff and a brief unsteady surge of energy from her to him all unlookedfor energy that could heal him but something else brushed his mind a sense of dark and evil wings it was with leren a dark force that ruled leren and it was poised to strike at the armsmaster he had a choice save himself or save jervis which was not a choice at all no vanyel took that borrowed strength and hurled it at the unprotected unsuspecting darkness like a spear of light it penetrated but it did not kill the darkness fled wounded but not conquered as vanyel began fading into a darkness of his own gods leren controlled jervis voice bastard got distracted got him with a chair the man said from that other world he wont be going anywhere for a while boy boy did he mark you it was becoming very hard to breathe his frantic gasps after air just made the pain worse and didnt seem to be bringing anything into his lungs someone rolled him onto his back and he cried out ladys tits jervis swore bloody bastard vanyel opened his eyes but he couldnt see anything but a tiny spot of brightness in a sea of black the blackness called him jervis slapped his face lightly and the blackness receded for a moment dont leave on me boy he said urgently supporting vanyel in his lap stay with me vanyel did his best to obey as jervis bellowed somewhere over his head for a healer but he was cold and getting colder and there didnt seem to be any room for anything but agony he tried to open his eyes again when he heard frantically running feet there was a strange herald in whites on his left and a swirl of green robes as a healer dropped down beside him on his right gods he heard the latter swear in an audible panic there were hands pulling his away and a wash of weakening that followed a gush of something warmth that poured out of him and over the hands that replaced his i oh gods were losing him like hell i everything voices vision even the pain began to fade everything except the stranger kneeling at his left side though his face remained oddly shadowed there was a soft argent glow about him like starlight that brightened with each passing moment take my hand herald vanyel vanyel blinked struggled against his fading sight tried to hold to consciousness my hand the strange herald held his right hand out to vanyel and there was entreaty in that mindvoice will you not take it the urgency in the request pulled at him this was important important that he fight past the pain to obey the stranger moved by some deep conviction that he didnt understand he found a tiny crumb of strength just enough to move the fingers of his left hand and place them sticky and warm with his own blood into the strangers outstretched palm the strangers hand closed over his and his lips curved in a smile of triumph he was standing the pain was gone so was the wound the strange herald still held his hand but about them was nothing only a kind of peaceful tranquil gray emptiness the strangers face was still shadowed except for the eyes a blazing glory of sapphires and light a light never seen in vanyels world not in the mortal world that vanyel knew not the natural world therefore this was not the natural world and this was no mere herald vanyel released the strangers hand and sank slowly to one knee unable to look away from those incandescent eyes then the stranger smiled and the smile was as brilliant and overpowering as the gaze that smile was no sight for mortal eyes and vanyel managed to drop his gaze before he was lost to it he bowed his head over his knee in profound obeisance to the power that had chosen to wear the guise of a human and a herald lord he whispered unable to muster enough coherent thought to say anything more vanyel no replied a voice of amber silk and steel he felt hands gentle hands on his shoulders hands that drew him up to his feet he dared a glance at the powers face and was caught again a moth in sapphirine flame no vanyel he said shaking his head denying vanyels assumption not lord only a messenger a servant you mustnt kneel to me the longer he looked into those eyes the easier it became im dead he said steadily feeling nothing at the words except a souldeep relief that it was finally over that he could rest but the other shook his head again no not yet vanyel he hesitated a moment and his eyes were shadowed with pity vanyel because of what you are what you have become and that you stand at the crossroads of many possibilities it is given to you to choose choose he said honestly bewildered choose how life replied the power his eyes dimmed as if with unshed tears life or he touched his hand to his own heart or myself then he understood what stood with him in this timeless nothingness what gazed at him with eyes of sorrow beautiful perfect and serene the shadowlover ask me what you will death said eyes radiant and voice soft with compassion you must choose in full knowledge of what your choice will mean what do i go to vanyel asked marveling at his own steadiness as he ached for the peace those eyes promised him if i choose to live pain death replied bowing his own head so that vanyel could no longer see those eyes loss you will see good friends die one by one until you are alone you will find yourself growing apart from others day by day until there seems to be nothing but loneliness and your duties you will receive hurts and will not die of them though you may long to and the end will be only more pain and the alternative for you peace and an end to pain and loneliness and grieving vanyel felt all the burdens of his existence heavy upon him felt taxed beyond his strength but he had not missed that subtle phrasing and he asked a further question though he knew in his heart that he would hate the answer and what of those i leave behind death looked up again and held his gaze with those brilliant depthless eyes and was it his imagination or did a sad proud smile touch those sculptured lips for a moment they will come to me death said quietly and sooner and in greater numbers than if you choose to live the valdemar you knew will be no more her people will struggle to maintain their freedom in a shrunken land bereft of allies and hemmed about by enemies you are not the only hope vanyel but you are valdemars best hope vanyel closed his eyes in a spasm of despair struggling to maintain his composure he was so tired so very tired so tired of pain of loneliness of a life that seemed harder to endure each day but what he had told jervis was no less than the truth he could no more leave his duties unfulfilled than he could repudiate yfandes especially not now not knowing by the word of a power that would not tell him false that there was no one else to do what he could do but he was so tired what is magics promise vanyel asked the vibrant voice you thought you knew the answer once is it still the answer you would give now he rose out of his own souldeep weariness and realized thatno the promise of magics power to a herald was not what he had thought at seventeen and that was the difference between what he was and what those of vedric and krebains ilk were it isnt a promise made to me he replied slowly opening his eyes and meeting deaths unblinking steadfast gaze its a promise made to those who depend on me on my strength its a promise i havent fulfilled not yet not completely he closed his eyes again and bowed his head feeling tears of weariness slipping from beneath his lashes and not wanting the other to see them and his weakness its a promise that gives me no choice i have to go back no matter how tired i am there was a whisper of sound and a featherlight touch on his jaw he opened his eyes and deaths hand lifted his chin so that his gaze again met those beautiful eyes there were tears in deaths eyes tears that matched his own and a tender sorrowful smile on deaths lips i have never been so grieved and so glad to lose he said and touched his lips to vanyels their tears mingled on his lips as vanyel closed his eyes he tasted them in the kiss his own salt bitter tears and deaths sweet strong arms closed about him supporting him holding him against a comforting shoulder as death held him with all the sensitivity of the lover that he could be vanyel yielded to the greater strength and crumpled in his arms his shoulders shaking with silent sobs gentle hands caressed his hair and gentle words came to his ears not yet beloved death murmured breath moving against his ear lightly stirring his hair there is no time here while i will it so you need not take up your burden until you feel ready to meet your life again so he wept out his weariness his longing for respite he wept and then he rested on deaths shoulder vanyel is it only duty that calls you back no he found another tiny crumb of strength and slowly straightened in the powers arms no its more than that moondance said it a long time ago i lost my own hearthfire but thats no reason why i cant warm myself at the hearths of my friends not when theyve offered that warmth he blinked and realized that he was smiling not so many friends he said half to himself but all of them good friends worth returning for vanyel yes he replied simply death actually laughed softly so long to learn what moondance meant sometimes im a bit dense he wiped his eyes with the back of his hand for some reason i never had any trouble figuring out what death was all about but life thats taken me until now the power held him for a moment longer then let him go he met the compassionate luminous blue eyes for one final time and saw them flare with a strange mixture of pride grief and joy vanyel death whispered one thing more there is one who would make his farewell to you vanyel felt someone behind him a lesser presence than the shadowlover and turned hello vanyel said jaysen holding out his hand or i guess its goodbye jays vanyel took the hand momentarily stunned oh jays no i didnt no you didnt dont go all guilty on me jaysen actually smiled ruefully it was my own stupid fault for being so distracted by the fact that you went and fathered our little pet that i gave those things of vedrics a chance to get at me tears burned his eyes but stop that i knew youd take it that way thats why i asked her lady death to let me see you its not your fault now listen to me neither of us have much more time the web youre the northern guardian exactly youll have to take my place more than that remember what you were thinking earlier about making all the heralds the power source do that van figure out how jaysen squeezed his hand urgently its important figure out how to change the webspell so that it doesnt need guardians anymore just the heralds themselves youre the only one of us that can do that im charging you with that van he nodded and met jaysens eyes evenly i promise i jaysens eyes softened for a moment theres something else she told me i could tell you maybe itll help she said you wont be alone he released vanyels hand and stepped backward already beginning to fade she promised van and i promise then he was falling falling for a confused moment after he opened his eyes he thought that the slumped form in whites in the chair beside his bed was the messenger but his hiss of pain as he tried to move woke the other and he saw that it was a mortal and a friend after all tran he whispered tantras what are you tantras face was lined with exhaustion and his eyes were red with weeping van i have to tell you we lost jays he whispered remembering feeling the emptiness oh gods he was not aware that he was weeping until a sob shook him and made him gasp with pain tantras just handed him a square of linen and moving to sit gingerly on the side of the bed held him until exhaustion left him no more tears to weep we thought you ought to hear it from a friend tantras told him helping him to lie back i should have known you already knew how vanyel whispered he didnt tell me how he couldnt keep the swarm off so he and his companion you know better than me how that works final strike vanyel answered numbly take your last target with you oh gods if id just been there what good would you have done tantras chided no one can be two places at once van not even you lady bright we came within a hair of losing you and thats something id rather not think about lissas healer still doesnt know how he pulled it off he swears he had divine help at the last moment vanyel just stared at him rinding it hard to imagine a world without jaysen in it a gentle tap broke the silence between them and a maid hurried in face blank hiding fear milord heraldmage she faltered holding a pitcher not vanyel or even milord van he thought with a catch in his throat now i terrify even the ones who grew up with me around im a stranger even to my own yes sondri he said as gently as he could i brought ye summat t drink thank you she left the pitcher and glass beside the bed and hurried out fear vanyel felt another wrench inside and there was only one way to deal with the pain of it tantras had enough empathy to feel something of his withdrawal van he touched vanyels shoulder van what are you doing van looked at him bleakly you saw her he whispered its just like you told me i frighten people and now even more than before i wiped out the entire mavelan family or at least all of the ones in the meld i had divine aid in being healed or at least thats what theyre telling each other out there i frightened them before now i terrify them it hurts tran it hurts to feel that fear so youre withdrawing behind walls again tantras shook his head van thats not the answer what is tantras only shook his head dumbly at least my walls give me a little peace and i wont wall my friends out i promise he tried to smile at least a little but you wont look for new friends either or love van youre making a serious mistake its mine to make i cant stay tantras said after a long silence i have to courier messages back i only waited to tell you vanyel nodded grief too profound to be purged with one spate of weeping rising to block his words duty we all have it thats what kept me tran that and finally figuring out what im doing here and thats what jays died for duty and protecting the ones we all love he stared at a spot on the opposite wall while his eyes burned and blurred thanks for waiting to tell me tantras eased off the bed and squeezed his hand rest when theres more to tell well get the word to you thank you he murmured closing his eyes he heard soft footsteps crossing the floor heard the door open and close then knew nothing more for a very long time the healer had done his best but the wound father lerens knife had left was only half healed and still very sore vanyel had just discovered that getting from his bed to the chair beside his table was a sweating and painfilled ordeal the healer had sternly warned him about the consequences of tearing open halfhealed tissues and vanyel was inclined to take him very seriously given the way he was hurting he didnt want to make a bigger mess of his midsection than it already was as it was hed have an lshaped scar for the rest of his life gut wounds were definitely not on his list of favored ways to earn a little rest getting dressed had been an ordeal too but the healer had said he could have visitors and he wasnt going to see them bundled in bed like an invalid he eased himself down into the chair with a hiss as someone knocked on the door to his room come he called wiping the sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand it was not anyone he had expected it was melenna a much subdued sobered melenna i came to see if you were really all right she said shyly and to ask herald vanyel for a favor and some advice herald vanyel not van and the fear is in her too please melenna sit down i cant imagine why youd want my advice but she remained standing vanyel she said softly you and me theres no hope is there he looked up and the honest longing in her eyes made his heart go out to her the anger and frustration of the past few weeks evaporating the gods knew he knew exactly how it felt to long for something youd never have or never have again im sorry melenna but i wont lie to you it was hopeless from the start a woman can never be anything more than my friend i do value you as a friend and the mother of my very young friend medren but i cant offer you any more than that she bent her head and quickly wiped her eyes all coquettishness gone i you know how i feel couldnt you pretend it would make lady treesa and lord withen awfully happy and i wouldnt mind really i wouldnt he looked away from those sad sad eyes the offer was terribly tempting but ultimately a lie i know it would make them happy but im a herald melenna i cant tell lies how could i live one and you would care eventually it would make you very unhappy there are other men shayachern whove talked with me who tried just what youre suggesting in the end instead of two people who were only moderately happy most of the time there were two people who were desperately unhappy all the time the wife was jealous of his lovers and his lovers were jealous of her and it went downhill from there he shook his head no my friend it wont work im sorry she wiped another tear away im sorry too she said but to tell you the truth im mostly sorry for myself and a little bit for treesa she sighed can i ask you a favor and you can say no its about medren if its about medren the answer is probably yes he said your son is a delight to any musician and a charmer all by himself would you sort of be his guardian until hes settled hes never been away from home at all i know he isnt shy but thats the problem he seems a lot older than he really is and thats my fault i guess he could get in with a faster crowd than he can handle he stared at her astounded youd trust me she returned his astonished stare levelly im not very clever sometimes she replied but i listen i listen a lot youre very honorable and in all the stories about you and others theres only been men not boys besides medren told me how he offered to pay for lessons and how you turned him down yes i trust you ill always trust you ive loved you vanyel for a very long time greatly moved vanyel took her hand and kissed the back of it gently then i will be very honored to see medren settled properly he replied and i can only pray that i will always be worthy of your trust she got up before he could say another word and headed for the door only to be run over by the rush of people crowding in as the door slammed open now look you peabrain savil was shouting as vanyels head began to spin look yourself withen shouted back shaking his finger at her the damned lineans wont accept anything but the boy but hes a herald lores wailed over the din vanyels head began to spin and he clutched the edge of his table rescue came from an unexpected source shut up jervis roared in a tone of voice that hearkened back to the parade ground silence descended so suddenly that vanyels ears rang would someone mind explaining what all this is about he whispered into it let me see if i have all this straight he said after everyone had said his or her piece except melenna whod found herself trapped by the influx of people and hadnt had the courage to push past them to escape tashir now holds both thrones according to the treaty now that hes been acquitted the lineans are willing to accept him and the bairens are willing to take about anybody so long as it isnt a mavelan the problems with this are first hes a herald which means he has to be trained and would normally mean hed abdicate lands and titles second he doesnt want to be a king third hes very young which would be a temptation to others to come and attack and would drag valdemar into defending his kingdom for him something like that withen admitted as the others nodded why me he demanded why am i suddenly the arbitrator savil flourished a piece of parchment because according to this little piece of paper i have under randales official seal you understand the problems so youre appointed full and final authority iii get you for this savil you can try he massaged his temples and wished for wine all right lets take this slowly first of all weve waived the rules for heralds before when they were the only heirs it isnt done often but i think its called for in this case lores your gift is fetching right startled the herald nodded fine i hereby appoint you tashirs mentor to stay with him and teach him until you feel hes ready for whites you can serve double duty that way mentor and envoy now tashir would you be willing to take the ruling seat if we arranged for you to make the two lands a vassalstate that means you are holding the lands of randale and it would make them part of valdemar tashir considered that for a moment his face sober ddoes it have to be do i have to be a king i dont want to be a king its pretty stupid anyway to be a king of something you can ride across in a few days provided you can get your people to agree i cant see what difference it makes then ill be a baron tashir replied sitting up very straight lordbaron of the march of lineasbaires if there arent any straightline heirs it all goes back to valdemar vanyel sighed his relief if tashir hadnt been willing to take the damned power seat civil wars were not what valdemar needed on the border now when theres a ruler as young as you he usually has a council of older people to advise him there isnt one tashir interrupted father had one but they all died true have you any objections to my appointing you one tashir shook his head and vanyel plowed on before anyone could stop him first councilor and chamberlain herald lores second councilor and seneschal kaster ashkevron hes mekes right hand father and hes mekes accountant any objections so far withen snapped his mouth shut on whatever he was going to say and shook his head right third councilor have somebody sent over from your local temple pick a scholar fourth councilor the current chief elder of highjorune fifth councilor huh youll need a marshal a good military advisor i would think jervis huh jervis responded i what hell be very good vanyel continued before he could object and radevel is certainly capable of taking over here as armsmaster and since youre a bachelor youll need a castelaine otherwise youre never going to have cooked meals or clean shirts he went blank for a momentuntil his eyes fell on melenna lenna she jumped think youd be able to keep tashir in roasts herbs and clean linen me she squeaked me castelaine of course theres a catch vanyel was beginning to enjoy this youll have to be ennobled but randi did give me full powers he saw with a hidden smile that tashir was beginning to look happier melenna had stood up for him once already and she was the mother of his good friend medren two points already in her favor at least in his eyes but but i but i dont know a thing about bbeanshucks withen rumbled changing his epithet in midsyllable youve been doing castelaine duty here for years treesall have vapors of course savil interrupted him let her have vapors if she doesnt want to mind forst reach let mekes lady deal with it i know young roshya shes a bright little thing and i know shes been properly trained thats one of your worst problems here withen too many trained hands and not enough jobs for them melenna turned anxious eyes toward vanyel herald vanyel do you think that i could i think youll do just fine now does that solve all the problems because im about to run out of brilliant ideas energy and the ability to hold off pain i think so savil replied i think we can start off by collecting kaster and showing tashir something of what hell be dealing with you wont need me will you jervis asked suddenly probably not at least not for a while then i need a word or two with young van here could you send to fetch me when you need me savil raised one eyebrow but nodded the mob left and vanyel sagged as jervis put a pitcher down on the table before him gods that was a hell of a way to spend my first day out of bed he cast a wistful glance at the pitcher i dont suppose thats wine is it the healer used to fighters who would use the infirmary as a good place to hold an impromptu party had forbidden him wine he was getting very tired of cider besides the drugs the healer had given him were too strong he wasnt taking them except to sleep and the paindulling effects of alcohol would have been welcome wellcider jervis said slyly and help he reached inside his jerkin and held up a little bottle of apple brandy couldnt get wine past that snoop but i could this figured you could use it little bird told me you probably werent taking those pills he poured a generous dollop of brandy into each mug before adding the cider vanyel accepted his gratefully what little bird one name of lissa ive been playin her eyes an ears over here she could be right he admitted she knows i hate to be muddleheaded these days jervis grimaced anybody been on frontlines hates t be muddleheaded wish them healersd figure that out have you heard anything out of highjorune like about the palace and the heartstone buried and gonna leave it that way seemed safest van you really think i should do this why dont you jervis chewed his lip i dunno he said after a moment tashir trusts me im getting too old to try and beat sense into more young heads than one at any one time what do you think of the notion too damned foolish to believe i think youd make a good marshal vanyel replied honestly youve certainly proved that you arent too old to change jervis snorted you say that after i nearly ruined your life for you but you saved it vanyel pointed out if you hadnt been there i would either have let the palace bury me or id have gone down under lerens knife id have been dead before anyone found me i think were even huh they drank in silence for a moment the pain of vanyels wound seemed a bit eased about leren you heard anything yet vanyel shook his head i was hoping youd get around to him i have some information for you since youre relaying to liss leren was magecontrolled jervis swore under his breath so he was tryin t take us both out a purpose if he hadnt gotten distracted exactly and im the one that distracted him for you there was i felt something about him but it got away from me jervis shook his head damn we found out he was planted on us by the mavelans and now the priests of astera are sending finders into every damn temple along the border here to see how many more there are like him seems the mavelans bought themselves a templeschool the high prelate is not what youd call pleased but i guess lerens even twistier than we thought vanyel nodded i told savil this morning and she relayed it to haven but liss might as well get it from you he may have been serving the mavelans but he was serving somebody else too and i dont know who or what it was no power i recognized and you wont ever find it from him liss couldnt get it out of him and whoever it was killed him before she could turn him over to heralds vanyel swore creatively and descriptively in tayledras savil didnt tell me that jervis grimaced she didnt know liss sergeant found him dead in his cell just this mornin guts torn out and nobody next or nigh him since theyd brought him dinner but savil an lores an tashir showed up right after that an that kinda got lost in tryin t figger out what to do bout tashir magic seems so vanyel pondered for a moment did you ever find out why he tried to kill me oh aye that was easy enough leren knew what was goin on here that mavelan bastard was keepin him briefed that much liss got outa him afore he got his insides tore out vedric figured you were getting too close to the truth about the boy when he breached the shields he didnt know wed unraveled everything he had it figured that his spell was too good to unravel what he meant to do was send you gating home and the boy with you leren was supposed to knife you both they figured youd use the same place to gate into as last time so leren was waiting once vedric contacted him what they didnt figure on was savil and me bein there nor you and savil splitting up and they didnt figure on me bein with you an not the boy im glad you were vanyel said softly if it hadnt been for you throwing my own words back in my face well i wouldnt be here is that a thing to thank me for jervis asked unexpectedly how much you going to take before you crack as much vanyel replied deliberately as i have to jervis pondered that a moment van are we friends now vanyel closed his eyes were friends and i think i know what your next question is going to be you want to know why im sending you away with tashir somethin like im trying to scatter my targets i had a lot of time to think the past couple of days i figured out something enemies might not be able to get me but they can get at me through the people i care for some of them theyre pretty well protected but ordinary people like you medren he shook his head so im trying to send you all away far away from me the farther away you are the safer you are either youll be too distant to get at or it will look as if i dont care either way youii be all right and youll be alone thats better than knowing you took a magebolt because someone wanted to rock me he retorted and swallowed the contents of the mug at a gulp silence then jervis reached out and refilled his mug vanyel found himself getting a little lightheaded let me ask about something inconsequential hows medren is he going to forgive me for wrecking his old lute lute jervis chortled hed have forgiven you for wrecking forst reach so long as you came back safe funny thing remember you said medrend be safe from the swarm because he was bardicgifted and not mage you was almost right seems like the instant the swarm tried t find a target here evry one of his lute strings snapped hows that for strange vanyel shook his head too close too damned close i was right anyway hes safe at bardic word came back from a bard called breda that if theres any more at home like him theyre staging a raid so hes doing well better than well i think thats the reason melenna decided to take that castelaine position i think shes startin to look at being something other than somebodys lady or somebodys momma i think maybe she wants to take a shot at being somebody herself good vanyel said and meant it you know jervis raised one eyebrow your father still dont half believe but what you were after tashirs tail the whole time aye and medren too vanyel snorted in fact jervis continued to hear him in his cups youve had half the boys in valdemar vanyel put his mug down if thats a question he replied acidly you can tell him from me that its been so damned long that both you and those damned sheep in long meadow are starting to look good jervis gave him a long thoughtful look and vanyel wondered if hed said too much too freely he tried to ready an apologywhen jervis gave him a long slow grin stick to the sheep the armsmaster advised impudently they dont snore
