alexander kent for my countrys freedom bolitho for kim with my love the world is ours yet freedom yet thy banner torn but flying still streams like the thunderstorm against the wind childe harolds pilgrimage lord byron part regrets lady catherine somervell reined in the big mare and patted her neck with a gloved hand not long now tamara well soon be home then she sat very still and upright in the saddle her dark eyes looking out across the sea it was close to noon on this first day of march and a strange misty vapour had already covered the track she had taken to visit john allday and his new wife unis she could not believe that they had all been left alone for so long untroubled by the admiralty in london two and a half months the longest time she and richard bolitho had ever spent together in their own home in cornwall she tossed the furlined hood from her head and the damp air brought more colour to her face when she looked directly south rosemullion head which guarded the mouth of the helford river was also lost in mist and it was only three miles distant she was on the upper coastal track much of the lower one having crumbled into the sea in the january storms and yet there were signs of spring wagtails darting along the bank of the helford river in their quaint diving haphazard flight jackdaws too like companionable clerics on the stone walls the ragged trees that crested the nearest hill were still leafless their stooping branches shining from a sudden fall of rain nevertheless there were tiny brush strokes of yellow to mark the early daffodils that flourished there despite the salt spray from the channel and the western approaches catherine urged the mare forward again her mind lingering on the past clinging to the weeks of freedom they had enjoyed without restraint after the first embrace when bolitho had returned from the mauritius campaign and the destruction of barattes privateers she had worried that he might become restless because he was not involved with his ships and men secretly troubled that the navy for which he had done and given so much was neglecting him but the love they had reawakened upon their reunion was stronger than ever if such things were possible walking and riding together in spite of the inclement weather visiting the families on the estate and when it could not be avoided attending more splendid occasions at the grand house of lewis roxby richards brotherinlaw and aptly nicknamed the king of cornwall the celebrations had marked roxbys unexpected acquisition of a knighthood she smiled there would be no holding him now and what of worldly events she had watched richard for the usual signs of uneasiness but there had been none she thought of the passion and the delicate touches of love they had shared there was nothing she did not know about her man any more and much had changed sir paul sillitoes prediction had come true just a month ago king george iii had been declared insane and separated from all power and authority and the prince of wales had become regent until the day he would be crowned king some people had hinted uncharitably it was because of the prince regents influence that roxby had been knighted although his new title had supposedly been bestowed in recognition of his patriotic work as a magistrate and as the founder of a local militia at the time of a feared french invasion some claimed it was because the regent was also the duke of cornwall and he would be quick to perceive roxbys usefulness as an ally she looked at the sea no longer a rival as she had once feared her shoulder was still burned from the sun in the longboat after the loss of the golden plover on the hundredmile reef could it be two years ago she had suffered alongside the other survivors but she and richard had been together and had shared it even to the threshold of death there was no sun visible in the pale clouds but the sea managed to hold its reflection so that the undulating swell appeared to be lit from below as if by a giant lantern she had left richard in the house to complete some letters for the afternoon mail coach that left from the square in falmouth she knew that one was for the admiralty there were no secrets between them now she had even explained her own visit to whitechapel and the aid she had accepted from sillitoe bolitho had said quietly i never thought i would trust that man she had held him in her arms in their bed and whispered he helped me when there was no one else but a rabbit should never turn its back on a fox of the admiralty letter he had said only someone must have read my report on the mauritius campaign and the need for more frigates but i can scarce believe that a wind of change has blown through those dusty corridors another day he had been standing with her on the headland below pendennis castle his eyes the same colour as the grey waters that moved endlessly even to the horizon she had asked would you never accept high office at the admiralty he had turned to look at her his voice determined and compelling when it is time for me to quit the sea kate it will be time to leave the navy for good he had given his boyish smile and the lines of strain had vanished not that they would ask me of all people she had heard herself say quietly because of me because of usthat is the real truth it is not a price kate my darling but a reward she thought too of young adam bolitho his frigate anemone was lying at plymouth in the dockyard after her long voyage from mauritius by way of the cape and gibraltar she had been so savaged in her final embrace with barattes privateers that her pumps had been worked for every mile she was homeward bound adam was coming to falmouth today she heard the clock chime from the church of king charles the martyr where bolithos had been christened married and laid to rest for generations it would be good for richard to have some time with his nephew she doubted if he would raise the matter of valentine keens wife confrontation was not the way to deal with it she considered allday when she had called at the little inn at fallowfield the old hyperion a local painter had done the inn signthe old lady down to the last gunport as allday had proclaimed proudly after his marriage the week before christmas but his freshfaced little wife unis herself no stranger to the hyperion in which her previous husband had died had confided that allday was deeply troubled and fretting that sir richard might leave him ashore when he accepted his next appointment she had spoken out of great affection for this big shambling sailor not from jealousy that the navy would come between them and she had shown pride too acceptance of the rare bond that held viceadmiral and coxswain firmly together catherine had said i know i must face it as you do it is for our sakes that our men are out there in constant risk from sea and cannon alike for us she was not sure she had convinced her she smiled and tasted salt on her lips or myself either the mare quickened her pace as she reached the new road which had been laid by some of roxbys french prisonersofwar catherine suspected that it was due to their efforts that roxbys own house and gardens were always so immaculate like most other estates in the county the bolitho land was tended mostly by old men and cripples thrown on the beach by the navy they had served without an authorised protection any younger man would be snatched up by the evergreedy pressgangs even the protection might not help on a dark night with a manofwar tugging at her cable and her captain not too eager to question his returning press she saw the roof of the old grey house showing above the last fold in the hillside would adam have any news he would certainly notice how well his uncle looked exercise good food and rest her mouth twitched and love which had left them breathless she had often wondered if adam resembled his father in any way there was no portrait of hugh in the house and she guessed that bolithos father had made certain of that after hugh had disgraced himself and the family name not because of his gambling the resulting debts from which had almost crippled the estate until richards success as a frigate captain had brought prizemoney to clear them hugh had even killed a fellow officer in a duel related to gambling all that their father could possibly have forgiven but to desert the navy and fight on the side of the americans in their war of independence that had been beyond everything she thought of all the graveeyed portraits that lined the walls and the landing they seemed to watch and assess her whenever she climbed the stairs surely they had not all been saints a stablelad took the bridle and catherine said a good rub down eh she saw another horse munching busily in the stables and a blue and gold saddlecloth adam was already here she tossed her head and allowed her long dark hair to fall free on her shoulders as she opened the double doors she saw them standing by the great log fire they could have been brothers black hair and the bolitho features she saw repeated in the portraits the faces she had studied while this house had become a home around her her eyes settled only briefly on the table and the canvas envelope which bore the admiraltys fouledanchor cipher she had somehow known it would be there it was a shock nonetheless she smiled and held out her arms as adam came to greet her richard would have seen her glance and her momentary dismay there was the true enemy lieutenant george avery stood at the window of his room and watched the bustling throngs of people and vehicles it was market day in dorchester haggling over prices country people coming in from the farms and villages to sell and buy the taverns would be full by now he walked to a plain lookingglass and studied his reflection as he might examine a fledgling midshipman he was still surprised that he had decided to accept sir richard bolithos invitation to remain as his flaglieutenant he had sworn often enough that if the offer of a command were made no matter how small or lowly he would snatch it he was old for his rank he would not see thirty again he stared critically at the wellfitting uniform with the twist of gold lace on the left shoulder to denote his appointment as sir richard bolithos aide avery would never forget the day he had first met the famous admiral at his house in falmouth he had not expected bolitho to accept him in the appointment even though he was sir paul sillitoes nephew for he hardly knew his uncle and could not imagine why he had put forth his name for consideration he still had nightmares about the experience which had almost cost him his life as secondincommand of a small schooner jolie formerly a french prize he had been content and excited by the dashing encounters with enemy traders but his youthful captain also a lieutenant had become too confident and taken too many risks he could almost hear himself describing him to bolitho during that first interview i thought him reckless sir richard they had been surprised by a french corvette which had swept around a headland and had raked them before they could stand away the young captain had been cut in half in the first broadside and moments later avery had been struck down badly wounded helplessly he had seen his men hauling down the ensign the fight gone out of them in the overwhelming ferocity of the attack as a prisonerofwar avery had endured agony and despair at the hands of the french surgeons it was not that they had not cared or been indifferent to his suffering their lack of resources had been a direct result of the english blockade an irony he often remembered the brief peace of amiens which had served only to allow the old enemies to lick their wounds and restore their ships and defences had led to averys early discharge an exchange with one of the french prisoners on his return to england there had been no congratulations or rewards for his past bravery instead he had faced a court martial eventually he had been found not guilty of cowardice or of hazarding the ship but the little jolie had struck her colours to the enemy so wounded or not he was reprimanded and would have remained a lieutenant for the rest of his service until that day some eighteen months ago when bolitho had given him the post of flaglieutenant it had been a new door opening for avery a new life which he had learned to share with one of englands heroes a man whose deeds and courage had stirred the heart of a nation he smiled at himself in the glass and saw the younger man appear for only a moment his habitual expression of wariness vanished as did the lines around his mouth but the streaks of grey in his dark brown hair and the stiff way he held his shoulder as the result of his wound and its treatment gave the lie to what he saw he heard someone at the front door and glanced around his room a bare simple place without personality like the house itself the vicarage where his father a strict but kindly man had brought him up averys sister ethel who herself had married a clergyman when their father had been killed by a runaway horse in the street still lived here with her husband he clipped on his sword and reached for his cocked hat the gold lace still as bright as the day eighteen months ago when hed gone to joshua miller the tailor in falmouth for two generations the miller family had been making uniform clothing for the bolitho family although few could remember how it had all begun bolitho had outfitted him on his appointment as flaglieutenant that too had been another kindness characteristic of the man he had come to know so well even if he still did not fully understand him his charisma which he himself did not seem to know that he possessed the way in which those closest to him were ever protective his little crew as he called them his burly coxswain allday his roundshouldered devonian secretary yovell and not least his personal servant ozzard a man without a past he put some money on the table for his sister she would get precious little from her miserly husband avery had heard him leave the vicarage very early on some mission of mercy or to murmur a few words before a local felon was dropped from the gallows he smiled to himself if he was really a man of god the lord should be warned to begin recruiting his own little crew the door opened and his sister stood in the passageway watching him as though unwilling for him to leave she had the same dark hair as avery and her eyes like hebrothers were tawny like a cats apart from that there was little resemblance he found it hard to accept that she was only twentysix her body worn out by childbearing she had four children but had lost two others along the way it was harder still to recall her as a girl she had been lovely then she said the carters here george hell take your chest to the stage at the kings arms she stared at him as he took her and held her closely i know you must go george but its been so lovely to have you here to talk and that when she was distressed her dorset accent was more pronounced downstairs two of the children were screaming but she did not seem to notice she said suddenly i wish id seen lady somervell like you have avery held her more tightly she had often asked him about catherine what she did how she spoke with him how she dressed he stroked the drab clothing his sister had worn throughout his visit once he had mentioned catherine when ethels husband had been in the room he had snapped in his reedy voice a godless woman ill not hear her name in my house avery had retorted i thought this was one of gods houses sir they had not spoken since that was why he had quit the vicarage early he supposed so that they would not have to lie to one another with brotherly farewells all at once avery needed to leave ill tell the carter to go now i shall walk to the stage once he would have avoided walking in the streets although a county town it was usually sprinkled with sea officers dorchester was a popular place for naval families to buy houses being within easy reach of weymouth bay portland and lyme he had seen too many such officers cross the road to avoid him when he had been recovering from his wound and awaiting a court martial being with bolitho had changed all that but it will never change my feelings towards them he embraced her again and felt her tired body against his where had the young girl gone ill send money ethel he felt her nod too choked by tears to speak the war will be over soon ill be on the beach then he thought of bolithos calm acceptance of his situation what allday had told him about his damaged eye what the confidence had cost him at least i could be in no better company down those sofamiliar stairs bareboarded to avoid waste as the vicar had put it avery had noticed however that he kept a very good cellar past the room where his father had begun his education at any other time the reminiscence would have made him smile how yovell had immediately accepted him in their little crew because he could speak and write latin strange how indirectly that ability had saved the life of rearadmiral herrick bolithos friend he said the roads should be better now ill be in falmouth the day after tomorrow she looked up at him and he thought he saw the young girl watching him through the mask im so proud of you george she wiped her face with her apron youll never know how much out on the street the carter took his money and touched his hat to the vicars wife then they kissed afterwards as he walked through the market avery recalled it with distress she had kissed him like a woman perhaps one who had only just remembered how it could have been at the corner of the street he saw the coach with its royal mail insignia standing by the inn its shafts were empty of horses but servants were already making luggage fast on the roof he turned and looked back at the street where he had grown up but she had disappeared two midshipmen on some mission or other passed him doffing their hats in salute avery did not even notice them the knowledge hit him like a blow he was never going to see her again john allday paused in tamping tobacco into one of his long pipes and without lighting it walked to the inn door for a long moment he looked up at the bright new sign swinging now in the breeze although he could not see the channel from here he could picture it without effort the wind had backed a piece since morning and the tide would be on the ebb he could see falmouth too in his thoughts ships shortening their cables waiting to weigh and take advantage of wind and tide menofwar although not too many of them the famous falmouth packets fishermen and lobster boats he would get used to it i must he heard the solitary chime of the tiny parish church his eyes softened where he and unis had been wed just over two months back he had never known such warmth such unexpected love he had always had an eye for a pretty craft as he had put it on occasions but unis had surpassed them all the men would be leaving the fields soon it was still dark too early to work long hours he heard uniss brother another john preparing tankards and moving benches the thud of his wooden leg marking his progress around the parlour a fine man an exsoldier from the old st foot the huntingdonshires it was good to know he had his cottage next door to the inn and would be able to help unis when he was back at sea her ladyship had ridden all the way over to fallowfield and had tried to reassure him but one of the coachmen who had been here for some ale and a pasty or two had told him about the letter for sir richard from the admiralty and allday could think of nothing else he heard uniss light step come in the other door and turned to see her watching him a basket of freshlygathered eggs in her arms you still worrying my dear allday reentered the parlour and tried to laugh it off its all new to me ysee she looked around the room at the fourandahalfgallon pins of ale on their trestles clean cloths fresh today new bread to tempt any hardworking farm labourer on his way home a place that offered a welcome it looked pleased with itself new to me too now that ive got my man with me she smiled gently dont you worry about it youve got my heart and i daresay ill take it badly when you go and go you will i shall be safe enough just you promise to come back to me she turned away towards the kitchen so that he should not see the making of a tear in her eye ill fetch you a wet john her brother straightened his back from putting more logs on the fire and looked at allday gravely soon you reckon allday nodded hell be off to london first i should be with him not this time john youve unis now i was luckyi lost a leg for king an country though i didnt think so at the time a cannon dont care so make the most of what you have allday picked up his unlit pipe and smiled as his new wife entered with a tankard of rum he said you knows what a man needs my love she wagged her finger and chuckled youre a bad lad john allday across the parlour her brother relaxed and allday was glad but how could he really understand he had only been a soldier so why should he lady catherine somervell paused at the turn of the stairway and pulled her gown more tightly about her body after the warmth of the great fourposter bed and the fire in the room the air was cold around her bare feet and ankles she had gone to bed earlier than usual to give richard the opportunity to speak with his nephew alone later they had come upstairs together and she thought she had heard adam stagger when he reached the door of his room throughout the evening meal he had been strained and unusually subdued they had talked of his homeward journey and of anemone docked to replace some of the copper damaged when she had been hulled by crossfire from barattes privateers adam had looked up from his plate and for those few seconds she had seen the familiar animation the pride in his anemone she took a beating but by god beneath the copper her timbers are as sound as a bell he had mentioned that the brig larne was also in plymouth she had brought despatches from good hope but she was to remain in plymouth to undergo an overhaul to spars and rigging it was hardly surprising larne had been continuously at sea for nearly four years in everything from blazing heat to screaming gales watching richard she thought he had somehow expected it another twist of fate perhaps that would bring james tyacke back to england that brave proud man the devil with half a face as the arab slavers had dubbed him how he would loathe plymouth the pitiless and horrified stares each time he showed his terrible scars to the busy world of that naval port adam had confirmed that tyacke had sent his first lieutenant to london with the despatches although a captain would normally be expected to pay homage in person to the admiralty catherine saw a candle flickering on the small table where the stairs turned down into semidarkness she must have fallen asleep again after hearing them come up when she had reached out for her man she had found his place empty she felt herself shiver as though someone were watching her she looked up at the nearest portrait rearadmiral denziel bolitho perhaps more like richard than any of the others he was his grandfather and the likeness was very strong the same eyes and hair as black as a raven denziel was the only other bolitho to have reached flag rank and now richard had risen higher than them all the youngest viceadmiral on the navy list since nelsons death she shivered again but not from the cold night air richard had told her he would give it all awayfor her for them richard had often spoken about his grandfather but had admitted he could not really remember him he had created his impressions from what his father captain james had told him and of course from the portrait with the smoke of battle in the background denziel was depicted at quebec supporting wolfe the painter had caught the other man the man behind the uniform there was humour in his eyes and mouth had he had a mistress as his grandson did now that her eyes had become accustomed to the gloom she could see a faint glow from the great fire then she saw bolitho he was sitting on the rug with one arm supporting himself against a chair the chair where his father had used to sit and read to him as if he could not bear to look beyond the window to be reminded that the sea was out there waiting always waiting for the next bolitho a goblet of brandy stood by the hearth catching the dying embers like a magnifying glass bolitho opened his eyes and stared at her and she imagined he thought he was caught in a dream he made to rise but she slipped down to his side and raked the embers until there was a lively flicker again bolitho dragged off his coat and threw it over her shoulders forgive me kate i fell asleep i had no idea she touched his mouth with her fingers it is nothing im glad i woke catherine watched his profile his emotions clear in spite of the shadows so many times they had sat here like this talking listening needing one another he was never impatient with her even when they had discussed her purchase of the collier brig maria josй another man another sailor might have thought it rash he had merely said we shall have to see when the season begins it is a bold venture but even if we fail the vessel will increase in value always we even when they were parted they were always together he said suddenly adam told me she waited feeling his pain as her own but she said nothing bolitho continued he is in hell because of it and because of what he believes it may do to me will it he held her more tightly around the shoulders who am i to rebuke him i took you from another as i took cheney he looked at her startled at hearing the name again from his own mouth he wanted to leave immediately in his condition he would have killed himself on those damned roads i came to you willingly i loved you i always did if i have one regret it is the waste of years before you found me he looked into the fire it happened after golden plover was reported lost zenoria was here and like you she awakened in the night adam was a boy again crying his heart out because he thought you and i were dead val was thought missing as well he shook his head what a lot that damnable vessel has to answer for we were together dearest of men i know i think of it often she asked did he tell you everything bolitho nodded slowly they were lovers perhaps even in love but when the news broke that we had been rescued by larne the deed was already done i do not know how zenoria feels about itshe has a good husband and a child now it was an act of need not madness or deceit he looked at her squarely and touched her hair with great care but adam is in love with her it is a secret he must keep and so must she i am so glad he told you you of all people mean so much to him there is a letter she tensed as he continued in despair he wrote to her last year sometime that will be the test we must wait and hope catherine picked up the goblet it was quite hot from the fire she felt him watching her as she swallowed some cognac when will you know richard about london he sounded almost relieved to change the subject their lordships seem very considerate about it catherine drank more cognac and felt it burning on her lips there was more to come she asked sir james hamettparker has gone i believe he nodded oblivion there is another in his place admiral sir graham bethune he should do well she turned to face him you have often said that the navy is like a family but you have not mentioned him before it was a long time ago i lost account of him a good deal younger than hamettparker which will be a change for the better she asked softly younger than you richard bolitho replied he was a midshipman when i got my first command in sparrow as a matter of fact he seemed to consider her question yes he is younger about four years i would think he looked at her steadily and she guessed if it were light enough he would have the same expression as adam when he spoke of his anemone the defiance and the pride i was only twentytwo when i took command that was in antigua as well it does not seem right that he should be able to give you orders he smiled my tiger again the navy works in strange ways luck patronage fate determine seniority not always ability remember that our nel was ten years younger than collingwood at trafalgar but they were still good friends he took her hands and they stood up together bolitho said to bed now or my girl will curse me in the morning she glanced down at the rug where it must have happened it was easy to imagine adams feelings when he had been in this room she answered quietly not a girl any more darling richard i am a woman now with all a womans passions hates too when necessary they walked arminarm to the stairs the solitary candle had gone out and the greyeyed rearadmiral was in darkness they paused on the stairs and listened to the house the creaks and tiny sounds which gave it life bolitho said they will offer me a new appointment another flagship i shall meet you in london first i shall need to go to plymouth she watched him it never failed to surprise her that he could think of so many things at once i would not wish to involve you kate or let anybody think he was being manipulated you are going to see james tyacke yes i cannot bear to be parted from you every hour is precious now tyacke came to her mind as vividly as if he were in the room with them he would be an attractive man but for the side of his face which looked as if it had been clawed off by some terrible beast she remembered when they had sighted larne bearing down on them after the suffering and death they had witnessed and the offer of a yellow gown which tyacke had kept hidden in his seachest to cover her sunburned body the gown bought for the girl who had rejected him after his injury he was worth a better woman than she could ever have been bolitho said simply i want him to be my flagcaptain she said he will never accept i am not even certain that he should bolitho guided her to the last stairs then he said that is the cruelty of it kate i need him i cannot manage without him later as they lay in the big fourposter she considered what he had said and what he had not said about his impaired vision and what might happen if the other eye was injured he must have a captain he could trust no wonder richard wanted to meet tyacke alone he must never think that richard was using her presence to persuade him into accepting the promotion and all it stood for and what it would demand of him she pressed her body against his and murmured whatever you do dearest of men i shall be waiting the next sound she heard was a cock crowing and she had not been dreaming more than loyalty the small unmarked carriage its windows and doors streaked with mud from the rutted roads paused only briefly at the gates to plymouth dockyard in order to allow the passengers to be identified as the wheels clanged over the cobbles bolitho guessed that the youthful royal marine lieutenant in charge of the guard was probably staring after them his mouth likely still open his arrival at plymouth was a private one he tried to smile if only for his flaglieutenants benefit but the effort was too much it would not be private for much longer the royal marine was no doubt already on his way to the port admirals house sir richard bolitho is here sir bolitho clung to the windowstrap and peered across the cluttered dockyard unaware of averys curious stare of all the naval ports in england plymouth was most familiar to him here he had been parted from catherine and had left for the mauritius campaign avery had been with him then their first commission together avery had kept his distance had felt his way too hurt by what had happened to him after the court martial to trust even his own judgement how he has changed perhaps they both had we shall walk the rest of the way avery rapped on the roof and the horses stamped to a halt bolitho stepped down and felt the edge of the wind on his face the rolling hills beyond the river tamar were lush green just a river and yet it separated him from cornwall his home it looked dark and muddy hardly surprising after all the heavy rain shes over yonder he wondered if avery had been aware of his withdrawn silences during the uncomfortable journey he might even resent it now that he had returned to be his aide having probably killed all chance of promotion for himself let alone a command bolitho looked at him now at the strong intelligent profile and said in truth i am bad company so much began and ended here avery nodded he had been thinking of that other visit when he had seen bolitho take leave of his lovely catherine over at the golden lion and of his own emotions when the big frigate valkyrie had broken out bolithos flag at the foremast truck it had been like being reborn taken back again by the navy which had been ready to reject him bolitho fell in step beside him and together they walked along the wall their boatcloaks hiding their uniforms and rank from any zealous onlookers aboard the many ships undergoing repair avery recalled very clearly how they had stopped at another dock in this same yard and bolitho had told him about his old hyperion when she had lain here little more than a shattered hulk after surviving the greatest battle of her career up to that time but hyperion had lived again had become a legend and was still remembered in ballads around the taverns songs about her last fight when she had gone down with bolithos flag still flying it was likely flying yet in the depths where she lay her people only shadows now where they had fallen but they lived still in the minds of men like sir richard bolitho and his faithful coxswain john allday they had been there they would never forget bolitho halted and looked down at the brig larne of fourteen guns how small she seemed too small for the great oceans but when tyacke had gone against all reason and experience and had persisted in looking for their tiny longboat after golden plover had gone down larne had burst out of the spray like a giant bolitho saw a marine picket on the jetty to ensure that nobody deserted even men who had been away from home for many months or years it was an insult james tyacke was one captain who would never have to mark run against a seamans name bolitho said you know what to do he spoke more sharply than he intended but avery barely noticed avery could feel the written instructions which bolitho had dictated to his secretary yovell even that was like a secret as if bolitho were not prepared to make up his mind perhaps he was unsure then avery glanced at him not unsure of himself after all that he had done that would be impossible bolitho was saying make arrangements for an early start tomorrow we will stay overnight the golden lion sir richard bolithos eyes were searching the reflected colour of plymouth sound and he imagined that he had offended him ii only meant surprisingly bolitho smiled and seized his arm through his damp cloak i know i am all aback today he looked towards the town but some other place i think he pictured catherine suddenly how they had held one another before he had left for plymouth she would be on her way to london by now to chelsea she had shared her london with him like all she had given him all they would have to relinquish when he sailed again he had rarely felt like this before every day had been like a bright dawn and even though each had known they must soon be separated it was hard even to contemplate he saw avery walking away back to the waiting carriage his uneven shoulder the stiff manner in which he held it moved him deeply what are these men kate if only all england could see her sons and above the fresh breeze which rattled larnes halliards and incompleted rigging he heard her voice in his mind dont leave me there were shouts and bolitho realised that the marine picket was watching him nervously a burly figure in lieutenants uniform but without a hat had appeared on deck pushing seamen and dockyard workers aside as he roared man the side you damned hawbucks why was i not told bolitho put one foot on the brow and raised his hat to the small quarterdeck it is good to see you again mr ozanne and in fine voice too then he tossed a fold of the cloak over one shoulder to reveal an epaulette with its bright pair of silver stars the dockyard workers gaped with amazement but some of the seamen gave a lively cheer like a meeting of old friends ozanne was a channel islander who had originally been a merchant sailor an excellent officer despite his earthy manner he was old for his rank and five years or more older than his captain bolitho shook his hand how was london ozanne beamed but his eyes were wary i was forgettin sir richard captain adam was here anemone is lyin over there he considered the question i didnt take to it much but they seemed pleased to have the despatches he shook his big head do they always rush about like chickens at thadmiralty sir richard bolitho smiled the family its quite usual i understand he became serious is the captain aboard ill call him no mr ozanne i know my way he thought james tyacke will know i am here he glanced along the slender hull with its black gunbarrels their buffpainted carriages at rest beneath canvas to protect them from the indignities of a refit larne tyackes ship at my command he clambered down the companion ladder ducking his head beneath the beams as he walked towards the stern cabin familiar smells here which even the dockyard could not quench paint and tar hemp and close humanity not just another overworked brig tyacke had overcome his terrible disfigurement to weld her into what she was and what she had achieved the devil with half a face would he do it all over again could he even consider asking him tyacke was standing framed against the sloping stern windows his shoulders bowed between the deckhead beams in the small cabin which nevertheless stretched the whole breadth of the stern his face was in shadow he said welcome aboard sir he reached for his coat with the single epaulette on its left shoulder but bolitho said no i am here uninvited he dropped his boatcloak and then hung his heavy dress coat over a chair let us be just two men for a while tyacke reached into a cupboard and produced a bottle and two goblets took this off a smuggler sir seems like good stuff as he turned the reflected glare from the water lit up the left side of his face like averys it was strong with deep crowsfeet around the eye to mark the years at sea on so many oceans the other side of his face had been so burned that it was barely human only the eye had survived there blue like herricks even his unruly hair had not escaped once it had been almost as dark as bolithos but now it was smudged with grey whilst directly above the burns the hair had turned pure white like the lock covering bolithos own scar which he hated so much it had happened aboard the majestic at the battle of the nile as it was now called tyacke had been on the lower gundeck when that burning hell had exploded around him he had never discovered what had caused the explosion as all the gun crews of his division had been killed even brave westcott majestic s captain had died on that terrible day the brandy was strong and fiery they clinked goblets and tyacke said a willing foe and sea room sir its all i ask it was strange to be drinking the familiar toast here in the dockyard feet thudded across the quarterdeck only inches away and great coils of cordage were being dragged over the planking and hoisted aloft to the riggers crew tyacke regarded him steadily then he made up his mind with a determination that was like something physical theyre taking my shipis that it sir so easily said but it was breaking his heart even now he was looking around in the shadows as if to avoid the frail sunshine falling through the skylight so many things must have happened here so many decisions overwhelming to some perhaps with only themselves against a whole ocean but not to this man bolitho said i am instructed that larne will return to the african squadron and the antislavery patrol eventually i have been assured that there are no intentions to remove any of your company for service in other hulls i can obtain it in writing from the port admiral if you wish tyacke was staring at his big seachest bolitho wondered if the gown was still hidden there the one he had offered to catherine after their rescue to cover her nakedness from the staring sailors id like that sir ive had no cause to trust a port admiral he looked up momentarily confused that was a stupid thing to say i beg your pardon sir i was once a frigate captain how strange that it should still hurt after all these years once a frigate captain i can recall only too well the constant poaching of good men and their replacement with gallowsbait tyacke poured some more brandy and waited bolitho said i have no right to ask you but he broke off as something heavy fell on to the deck above followed instantly by ozannes furious outburst and laughter for good measure laughter in a kings ship was too often a rare sound how can i ask him tyacke was an unmoving silhouette against the thick glass but you will sir he leaned forward so that his face hovered in the sunshine rank has no part in this bolitho said no none we have done too much together and when you took us from the sea i was already far too deeply in your debt he thought of her in the tossing longboat her sailors garb plastered to her body while they had fought the ocean and the nearness of death together he heard himself say quietly i want you to take promotion he hesitated it was slipping away and be my flagcaptain there is none other i want need need tell him the words seemed to fill the cabin that is what i came to ask tyacke stared at him there is no one i would rather serve sir but he appeared to shake his head aye that one word but says it all without your trust in me i would have given in to selfpity but without the freedom of this vesselwithout larne i find it too hard a choice bolitho reached for his coat avery would be looking for him his involvement could do nothing but harm he stood up and held out his hand i must see the port admiral he looked at him steadily knowing he would never forget this moment you are my friend lady catherines too and so shall it remain i will request that your ships company be allowed ashore watchbywatch he felt the hard firmness of their handshake was aware of the emotion in tyackes voice then it was over lieutenant george avery climbed from the carriage and felt the fine drizzle falling past the coachlamps and into his face wait hereill only be a moment then you can take us to the boars head it had taken longer than he had expected or else it had got dark earlier than usual he tugged his hat more tightly down on his forehead and turned up the collar of his boatcloak his stomach was making its emptiness felt and he realised that he had not eaten since a hasty breakfast at some inn along the way the water of the hamoaze beyond the dockyard was alive with ridinglights like fireflies above their reflections small craft made dark shadows around them officers coming and going the watchful guardboat the unending life of a busy harbour here along the wall other lanterns shone by brows and entry ports where any novice the unwary or a man who had taken too much to drink could easily trip over a ringbolt or some dockyard material and pitch over the edge he saw the brigs two bare masts higher than before on an incoming tide figures by an entry port a lieutenants whitelapelled coat probably the side party assembled to see the viceadmiral ashore what had they been discussing he wondered old times perhaps the rescue after the shipwreck of which allday had told him poor allday he would be beside himself with worry over this journey not being in his proper place as he would put it avery recognised the thickset officer as paul ozanne larnes secondincommand i was delayed mr ozanne i hope sir richard is not too displeased ozanne took his arm and guided him aft he glanced at the cabin skylight in darkness except for a solitary candle he said bluntly sir richard left long ago he said to tell you he would be at the port admirals house avery tensed something was wrong badly wrong otherwise what has happened ozanne would know better than anyone he would understand his captain and companion and his friend too hes down there now drinking worse than i ever seen him cant make no sense out of him im fair troubled avery thought of bolithos expression when he had gone to board this ship anxious despairing a different man from the one he had known at sea or at the house in falmouth shall i have a word he expected a blunt rebuff instead ozanne said roughly id be obliged but watch your step there might be a squall or two avery nodded in acknowledgement it was something allday had once said to him as a warning it was so dark between decks that he almost fell larne was small and cramped after a frigate especially after the old canopus in which he had been serving when sillitoe had written to him about the possibility of an appointment to flaglieutenant who is that out there lay aft if you must he called avery sir flaglieutenant he saw the flickering candle and tyackes disfigured face turning away as he groped for a bottle send you did he he sounded angry even dangerous avery replied i thought sir richard was aboard sir well you can see that hes bloody well not so you can leave just as suddenly his voice changed not your fault its nobodys damned fault its this bloody war what its done to us he was muttering to himself as he opened the bottle and slopped something into another glass some of it splashed unheeded on to the table avery could smell it and thought of his empty stomach fraid its only geneva ive seen off the cognac he gestured vaguely shift yourself cant see you well enough from here avery stood up ducking to avoid the beams the poor bastard he doesnt want me to see that side of his face tyacke said thickly you limped of course id forgotten you were wounded werent you and then there was the court martial he repeated not your fault anything i can do sir tyacke did not seem to hear what a lot we are eh ive seen his coxswainallday right avery nodded afraid to break the spell ive seen him often enough when he thinks sir richard isnt looking holding his chest sometimes hardly able to draw breath cause of what the dons did to him his voice was louder and avery imagined ozanne by the skylight listening hoping then theres his old friend rearadmiral herrick he spoke with unexpected bitterness now hes lost a bloody arm for his troubles he downed a full glass and almost choked sir richard must enjoy helping lame ducks hes a fine man sir ill not stand by and hear him slandered tyacke was on his feet in a flash he seized averys lapels and dragged him across the table so that they were inches apart of course hes a fine man dont you damned well tell me what to say or think avery did not try to move or release himself he could see tyackes wounded face the blue eye bright in the candlelight isolated by pain but almost worse there were tears running across the melted skin tyacke was shaking him with gentle firmness look at me look at me avery said quietly tell me sir at any moment ozanne would come aft then it would be too late tyacke released his grip and patted his arm then he sat down heavily again in a flat toneless voice he said he asked me to be his flagcaptain he shook with silent laughter can you imagine that man how could i accept you think he asked you out of pity he would never put his people at risk for that even for a dear friends sake he waited anticipating another outburst but tyacke was very still except for the painful breathing and the play of shadows across his face avery remembered what had driven allday to confide so desperately in him about bolithos injured eye and how privileged he had felt to be entrusted with the secret to share it with another now seemed tantamount to a betrayal but the cold grip around his heart would not release him there was so much at stake too much he said you spoke of our misfortunes just now tyacke shook himself i meant no disrespect to you none taken he swallowed the raw gin and said we are not the only ones damn me i know that when avery remained silent he leaned towards him again and for a moment the flaglieutenant believed he had gone too far then he said almost inaudibly not sir richard surely you dont mean him avery stood up very carefully he is losing the sight of one eye tyackes hand went up to his face as it must have done when the bandages had been finally removed it must have seemed a miracle that he had not lost his eye he said nothing to me about it avery wanted to stay but knew he must leave hes very like you sir a proud man above all else so it was not pity you see he heard ozanne breathing heavily in the passageway he needs you now more than ever would you have him beg he could feel ozannes relief as he brushed past him afraid that tyacke would summon him back and begin all over again also he knew he was going to be sick he reached the carriage and managed to gasp port admirals house if you please in the tiny cabin lieutenant ozanne was watching tyacke who was trying to refill his glass he asked wearily what happened tyacke peered at him and wiped his eyes with his sleeve secret paul if i tell you then its not his voice was very slurred the bottle rolled unheeded on to the deck and tyacke would have followed it but for his powerful first lieutenant i dont know who said what james tyacke but i was a mite worried about you he gave a great sigh and snuffed out the candle then with tyackes coat over one arm he stepped outside and heard the rain on the companion ladder for a while longer ozanne who had been at sea since his boyhood looked around and listened to the watch below crowding into their messes for their evening meal there would be much discussion below deck about the proposed shore leave such generosity was unheard of he touched the solitary gold epaulette on tyackes coat and said quietly i think were losing you james and well be the poorer for it afterwards he knew he had been speaking toand forthe whole ship viceadmiral sir graham bethune strode across the thick carpet his face alight with a warm smile as he seized bolithos hand my god sir richard you make my heart sing to see you so well and rested i have to admit to a certain nervousness at the prospect of meeting you for the first time since my appointment those faroff days when you were my captain and i was a bumbling midshipman are hard to shake off the handshake like the smile was genuine bolitho thought bethune was not quite what he had expected and it was true that they had not met since his first command the sloopofwar sparrow in a lifetime ago the roundfaced midshipman with the dark freckles was no more instead here was a flagofficer who must be in his forties but who looked years younger brighteyed lean and confident a far cry from many senior officers who had languished in the halls of admiralty he had the same infectious smile but there was an air of confidence and authority about him which bolitho guessed would be a great attraction to ladies of the court or at the many receptions he would have to attend in his new capacity bolitho felt a touch of envy and cursed himself for his own vanity he had followed bethunes progress to fame in the gazette from time to time the turning point had come when he had been in command of a small gun sixthrate sailing alone he had fallen in with two big spanish frigates either of which should have been able to force him to submit instead after a spirited engagement bethune had run one enemy ashore and captured the other with hardly a man lost bethune said if it suits i will call a full meeting on the day after next i think it would be foolish to delay further he waved bolitho to a chair but i wanted to see you first to prepare myself there are many changes hereof necessity but i am sure you are well aware of that a servant entered with some wine and glasses he too was a different one from godschales or hamettparkers bethune toyed with his buttons how is her ladyship well i trust bolitho relaxed slightly a test perhaps like a ranging shot to decide on the next move lady catherine is in good health thank you i will be joining her shortly in chelsea just the merest flicker nothing more bethune nodded i would greatly like to meet her bolitho thought of godschale sitting at the same table complaining of the weight of his responsibilities and probably planning his next liaison with the young wife of some subordinate at the same time his appetites had done for him in the end he studied his onetime midshipman with new eyes handsome with the touch of recklessness some women admired he was married but perhaps he had a mistress somewhere the servant brought the glasses it was cold hock very refreshing after all the miles all the changes of horses at inns which had all begun to look very much like one another he wondered if the wine had come from the shop in st jamess street where catherine had taken him bethune said i have read all your letters and despatches particularly your views on blockade and the protection of trade routes you are correct of course sir richard again the infectious smile a lieutenant posing as a viceadmiral but it will be up to you to convince their lordships bolitho thought of tyacke and remembered catherines words when he had told her what he intended it was still heavy on his heart she had been right there is some good news about your friend and former flagcaptain valentine keen bolitho hoped that bethune had not seen his surprise it was as though he had been reading his thoughts he is to be promoted to rearadmiral and deservedly so as you made very clear in your original report bolitho looked away he recalled hamettparkers hostility at the suggestion but now that keen was secure as a flagofficer in his own right he could only recall adams despairing confession by the fire in falmouth zenoria as the wife of a flagofficer it was beyond imagination the girl with the moonlit eyes would be swamped destroyed even by a world she would never be able to share or understand it must not destroy adam also bethune took another tall glass of wine i appreciate your convictions concerning the united states by the way your recent adversary captain nathan beer is promoted commodore i hear bolitho remembered the moment of fear the splinters like barbs in his face herrick lurching on deck his amputated stump bleeding as he dismissed the valkyries captain and took charge to fight the ship he said sharply the next time we meet i shall make him an admiral he saw the satisfaction in bethunes eyes bethune said quietly you think there will be war i do if i can explain bethune smiled not to me sir richard i am convinced the others will be more concerned with expense than expediency bolitho thought of catherine she would be at chelsea or very close to it by now just before he had left for plymouth she had mentioned the surgeon in london it can do no harm perhaps he may even be able to help bethune asked suddenly does your eye trouble you he realised he had been rubbing it a chill i expect bethune said airily well you have been in cornwall it is possible he was a cornishman himself bolitho recalled that he had made a point of mentioning it when he had taken command of sparrow he could not imagine him in cornwall now but he was shrewd very shrewd it would not do to let him know about the injury bethune was saying your choice of flagship the indomitable did surprise me a little although i can fathom your reasons but some of our betters may suggest otherwise or say perhaps that you have a penchant for elderly vessels bolitho sensed the contempt he held for his betters bethune added i shall give you my support but i hope you knew that i will suggest that two other elderly vessels victory and hyperion have made milestones in history a servant entered and looked at the viceadmiral nervously lieutenant avery sir richard bolithos flaglieutenant is in attendance sir graham bethune smiled calmly a brave man to venture amongst senior officers he shot bolitho a quick glance and friends bolitho got to his feet as avery entered the big room his cocked hat crushed beneath his arm was something wrong had avery found the chelsea house empty avery nodded to bethune but bolitho saw the quick appraisal the sharp curiosity unlike poor jenour this man took nothing for granted he said letter by fast courier sir richard their eyes met from plymouth bolitho took it aware that bethune was watching him it was short and to the point in tyackes sloping hand mine is the honour it is more than loyalty i shall await your orders his signature was scrawled across the bottom barely legible bolitho glanced at avery but the flaglieutenants expression remained inscrutable then he raised the letter to his nose and saw that small cabin in his mind as he had left it in plymouth only days ago bethune smiled perfume sir richard dare i ask bolitho shook his head it was cognac with your permission sir graham i would give you a sentiment the glasses had been refilled and another had appeared for avery bethune remarked i am all curiosity bolitho felt his eye pricking not injury now but for a different reason to the most courageous man i have ever known avery watched him as they touched their glasses another secret then bolitho smiled for the first time since he had arrived they were ready so lets be about it the ocean is always there lieutenant george avery handed his hat to an admiralty porter and hurried across the marble hall to where bolitho was sitting in a highbacked chair i apologise for my lateness sir richard bolitho held out his hands to a wellbanked fire and said you are not late they are still rewriting naval history in that room it was spoken without impatience or bitterness perhaps he had seen too much of it avery thought bolitho wondered if his flaglieutenant had kept exactly to the arranged time in order to avoid questions about tyacke and his inexplicable change of heart regarding the appointment bolitho thought of catherine that morning the concern in her eyes while he finished dressing his coffee untouched on the table he had shown her tyackes note she had said let him decide richard i think you should wait for avery to tell you himself it is what you wanted i know how much you need james tyacke but i do not envy him what he must do they had stood side by side on the iron balcony of the chelsea house and watched the misty first light across the thames london came alive long before dawn but it was a leisurely awakening here a man with his little cart and tubs of fresh oysters setting up his stall for the various cooks and housekeepers to sample his wares hay for the stables a loudvoiced knifegrinder then a small troop of cavalry horses being taken on morning exercise to the park looking strangely bare without their saddles and bright accoutrements she had been wearing her heavy robe but even so it had been chilly so close to the slowmoving river he had held her and felt her shiver but not only from the air it would soon be a time for parting days or weeks after the freedom they had longed for and shared since bolithos return to england it would be all the harder to accept he heard avery say i was so glad to learn of commodore keens promotion well earned from what i have heard and read of him bolitho looked up at him sharply but it was only an innocent comment he wondered what zenoria would be thinking about it adam too thank god he would be sailing soon despite his shortage of men and officers of one company how many times had he heard it thus described he recalled the big frigate valkyrie aboard which he had been rendered completely helpless by tiny splinters in his uninjured eye command of her had gone to adams contemporary captain peter dawes the son of an admiral whose frigate laertes had been so badly battered by barattes crossfire that it was unlikely she would ever fight again many people would be surprised that such a prestigious command had not been given to adam no doubt some of them in the room beyond were also thinking as much but dawes had proved his worth he would give valkyrie fair and proper leadership unlike the brutal punishments which had been a regular occurrence under captain trevenen who had vanished overboard without trace murder an accident or had he committed suicide to save himself from a charge of cowardice when herrick had seized command he considered it and knew that adam would not wish to leave his beloved anemone even though there would hardly be a familiar face left now in her whole company he heard avery breathe in as footsteps clicked across the marble floor like distant slatehammers a whitefaced clerk said if you would please come this way sir richard he glanced nervously at avery i have been told nothing about then you will have no objection if my flaglieutenant remains with me avery almost felt sorry for the clerk almost the big room was full of distinguished people senior officers the lords of admiralty and civilians who looked more like lawyers at the old bailey than the planners of strategy bolitho sat down and heard avery move into a chair at his elbow there was no sunlight through the great windows nor were there any glittering chandeliers to dazzle his injured eye one or two of the officers nodded to him pleased to see him safe and apparently in excellent health others would welcome him for different reasons it was common enough for a clash of personalities to cause an uproar in this powerful place clerks a secretary or two and somebodys flaglieutenant hovered beside a pillar attempting to remain unnoticed avery whispered my uncle is here sir richard at that moment sir graham bethune rose to his feet and rested one palm on his table even that looked elegant but bolitho wondered if he was as confident as he appeared sir richard bolitho is no stranger to most of you and his name is known to many more he gave a gentle smile not least to napoleon there was laughter and bethunes eyes responded as he glanced at bolitho a heavilybuilt admiral whom bolitho recognised as the controller said bluntly we are here to discuss future tactics ifand for my own part it is a very doubtful ifthe americans show intentions of war against our king he glared furiously at two postcaptains who were whispering together enjoying the fact that there was no longer a king to govern them the united states would be insane to declare war on such a powerful navy the word insane brought more gleeful whispers from the two captains bethune said smoothly sir paul sillitoe is come amongst us to explain more clearly what we are about sillitoe stood up lightly his hooded eyes scanning the gathering like a man who has something better to do the situation is simple enough between napoleons land blockade and his very real threats against those of his neighbours who might dare to allow our ships to enter their ports for the purposes of trade and our own sea blockade we have divided the peoples of europe into friends and foes bolitho watched him thinking of him with catherine when he had escorted her to whitechapel a man who could be an enemy but one who was obviously so secure in his position as adviser to the prince regent that he spoke almost with disdain it has also divided the united states into opposing parties the war partylet us call itis in favour of napoleon the other party wants only peace the war party hate us and covet canada and also wish to continue to make money from the conflict the united states government insists that british deserters should be safe under the american flag and is doing all it can to weaken our fleet by encouraging many many seamen to take advantage of their offer dollars for shillings a bribe they can well afford his eyes flashed yes all heads turned towards a small darkclad clerk at the end table with respect sir paul i cannot keep up with you sillitoe almost smiled something i have thought characteristic of this edifice on many occasions there was laughter and handclapping in a lull bethune leaned over and whispered convince them bolitho stood up as the noise died away he felt out of place here the scene of so many disappointments after he had been so ill with fever in the great south sea war had broken out and he could recall himself pleading for another ship a frigate three of which he had already commanded by that time and the admirals cold response were a frigate captain bolitho where plots had been made against him to force him back to belindas side and where he had broken with herrick in that very corridor outside he heard himself speaking his voice carrying without effort we need more frigates it is always the way but this time the need is all the more urgent i am certain that the americans will force a war napoleon cannot hold out much longer unless he receives their support to stretch our resources still further likewise the americans will have left it too late if they drag their feet the controller held up a quill pen i must protest sir richard nobody would dispute your gallantry and many successes at sea but planning is the key to victory not necessarily the broadside a voice called hearhear encouraged the controller said we have many fine ships of the line on the stocks or completing every week of the year he paused and raised his eyebrows frigates before the line of battle is that what you advocate for if so bolitho answered quietly the americans laid down s but quickly saw the folly of it all were converted to big frigates and carry guns but are said to be pierced for ten additional heavy guns there was not a sound now he continued we crossed swords last year with one of their largest the uss unity i can vouch for her fire power his voice was suddenly hard and bitter as can many of our brave fellows a voice called what about the lineofbattle sir richard bolitho knew it was sillitoe conducting the scene like a puppetmaster he said flatly it is finished the day of the leviathans sailing slowly to a costly and terrible embrace is over well not see another trafalgar i am certain of it he looked around at their intent faces to some the truth of what he had said would seem like blasphemy to those who had faced closeaction it was something no one dared to admit bolitho said think of it the ships company of one firstrate could crew four fast and powerful frigates ships which can move from area to area with haste and without waiting for some faroff flagship to guess what is happening i have been offered a command which reaches from halifax and the th parallel south to the leeward islands and jamaica in any week of any year there are ships convoys with rich cargoes making their way back to this country without ready protection and the ability to hit back in their defence we will stand no chance bethune asked is that why you want indomitable for your flagship bolitho looked at him and forgot all the others yes she was cut down from a thirdrate to carry the very artillery i would need she is and always has been a fast sailer bethune smiled but his eyes were on the others she was rebuilt and rerated because of the operations at mauritius gentlemen unfortunately sir richard dished up the french before we could send indomitable out there there was a wave of cheering and stamping when he looked at bethune again bolitho saw the triumph in his eyes so long ago when they had boarded the enemy from his little sparrow he had seen that same expression all or nothing the controller held up one plump hand are they your only reasons sir richard yes my lord he pictured the great fireplace at falmouth the family crest worn away by time and many hands where his father had spoken of his hopes and his fears for his youngest son when he had first gone to sea for my countrys freedom he glanced at avery and saw what might have been emotion and my freedom from then on bethune smiled with relief a near thing he might have been unseated at the admiralty when he had scarcely begun and bolitho he would probably have refused any other appointment he said i will give you everything i can sir richard bolitho looked at him keenly and afterwards bethune thought he had been pierced through by those clear grey eyes i have everything graham and i want it to last bethune stared after him he called me by name as he had sometimes done in sparrow avery went to look for his hat and almost ran into his uncle who was speaking with a tall and very dignified soldier he did not introduce his nephew but remarked noncommittally it went well i thought avery watched him sillitoe was not interested in his opinion eventually sillitoe touched his arm nothing more but it was a kinder gesture than he had ever been offered before i have to tell you george the cold eyes searched his face your sister died in dorchester it wasnt unexpected but still he sighed i shall deal with it i have never felt that her husband is in the right calling he walked away to where his tall companion was waiting impatiently by the steps bolitho joined him is something wrong but all avery said was it was that day the last time i saw her he seemed to shake himself and said ill be glad to get back to sea sir he was staring at the groups of people breaking up and heading for club or coffeehouse but all he saw was his sister ethel in her drab clothing now she would never meet lady catherine he walked to the big doors and added it will be cleaner lieutenant paul ozanne the burly redfaced channel islander held open the cabin door and looked aft to where tyacke was sitting at his table exactly as he had left him how many times had he opened this door at sea or at anchor to report the sighting of a suspected slaver or perhaps an enemy sail tyacke always seemed to know anyway even before the masthead lookout he noticed that tyackes brassbound seachest had gone and despite what he had been told privately it saddened him tyacke had explained that when he left the ship ozanne was to be promoted to commander and given larne in his place ozanne could still not believe the swiftness of events or what it would mean to him tyacke had said you deserve it id have no other you ought to have been promoted long agoi know no better seaman or navigator his tone had hardened but there are those in authority and my guess is that there always will be who consider a man not fit for high rank if he has soiled his hands with honest work the news had gone through the little brig like a flame ozanne had seen it on their faces surprise but certainly relief too larne was too intimate and her people had been together longer than most for some new broom to come amongst them tyacke looked up from the bare table his face in shadow ozanne said theyre waiting sir tyacke nodded heavily your commission is here will you wait sir he already knew the answer no i wish you well i daresay we shall meet again it is the way of things he became impatient have them come in larnes officers filed into the cabin and found places to sit on chairs and on the stern bench seat when the door was wedged shut the cabin was packed tight larne was well blessed with both officers and masters mates she had taken many prizes slavers and smugglers alike and had always carried extra experienced men to sail their captures to the nearest friendly harbour there was plenty of cognac and ozanne recalled the day when sir richard bolitho had come aboard and later his flaglieutenant he had rarely seen his commander the worse for drink now he knew why it had happened or one of the reasons anyway tyacke said help yourselves they had no choice in such a crowded cabin he watched them without expression flemyng and robyns the lieutenants manley pitcair the sailingmaster and andrew livett the young surgeon who accepted his miserly pay so that he could study tropical medicines and fevers he had had plenty of experience on the slave coasts the masters mates bronzed and reliable but no midshipmen that would all change like everything else when he joined indomitable bolithos proposed flagship she lay some two hundred yards distant but tyacke typically had not gone to see her he would begin after he had read himself in and not before everything would be different indomitable would carry a royal marine contingent like all menofwar from sixthrates upwards tyacke had not served alongside the royals since the majestic he touched his scarred face and thought of bolithos eye the way he had seen him rub it when he had been thinking of something else i should have guessed he looked round the cabin so small and lowbeamed but after his first and only other command the schooner miranda it had seemed like a palace he had first met bolitho in miranda when he had accepted all the discomfort and shared quarters without complaint when she had been destroyed by a french frigate he had given him larne without hesitation the bond broken only by distance and the demands of duty had strengthened from then on he thought of averys visit his anger and despair i should have guessed he cleared his throat and every face looked aft today i shall leave this command to mr ozanne it is hard to describe my feelings he twisted round in his chair and glanced through the thick stern windows so many times the thump of the rudderpost the frothing sea rolling away from beneath the counter so many times god i shall miss you girl but he said i have requested that robert gallaway be promoted to actinglieutenant until it can be confirmed he saw the masters mate staring round with surprise and pleasure while his friends thumped him on the back he would leave ozanne to select a replacement for gallaway it would probably be his first duty a pleasant way to begin a commission the others were not even troubled by meeting his gaze that too would be different in another ship what had he expected that he would be permitted to keep sailing the deepwater trade routes like a phantom now he would be out in the open for all to see he took a swallow from his goblet he would stay at an inn pitcair had told him about small no questions asked he smiled sadly when he received his next allotment of prizemoney he could buy land of his own he said we have done a great deal together and we are all the better for it the ocean is always there waiting for us with a mood to suit every watch and occasion but the ship just once he reached out and touched the curved timbers there is never one like the last he heard a boatswains call unusually muted in the packed cabin all hands all hands muster on deck even the thudding of bare feet was subdued a seaman tapped the door and thrust his head inside one of the older hands who had been allowed ashore because of bolithos request to the port admiral beg pardon zur but the carriage be alongside tyacke nodded very well houston ill come up the seaman hesitated unsure amidst all of his lieutenants and warrant officers what is it the man named houston dragged a bright gold dollar on a chain from his pocket for a lady zurtook it from that brigantine good luck capn then he fled tyacke stood up slowly glad that he must bow his head between the beams and hide his face thank god he was not being pulled ashore in the gig which was what ozanne would have arranged had they been at anchor instead of alongside the wall pulled ashore by his own officers ozanne was that kind of man he was saying now to the others wait on deck please gentlemen then when they had filed out he stood by the door ill never forget what you done for me james never fret ill take good care of her youll be that proud when you see her again tyacke gripped his hand i know that old friend what bolitho called his coxswain he wanted to say aloud im afraid maybe i cant do it but all he said was she can still outsail the best of them then followed by ozanne he climbed the companion ladder and hesitated by the coaming my men no not any more they were clinging to the shrouds and ratlines framed against a clear bright sky there were no dockyard workers to be seen this was larnes moment and they would share it with nobody the carriage with the big seachest on its roof waited amongst the dockyard litter tyacke measured the distance with his eye it was probably the longest journey he would ever take he shook hands with the officers and the men of the side party a murmur here and there firm rough hands questioning glances he had to press his sword against his thigh with all his strength to contain himself lastly paul ozanne commander ozanne only their eyes spoke no words would come tyacke raised his hat and climbed on to the brow the calls twittered and then someone yelled huzza for the captain lads huzza people hurried to the sides of other vessels nearby as the wild cheering echoed and reechoed against the old stone walls for such a small ships company the din was enough to drown every other sound straightbacked his sword at his side tyacke walked steadily towards the carriage the cheers washing around him like breakers on the reefs he climbed into the carriage and the driver flicked his whip he did not look back he dared not catherine was waiting at the foot of the stairs when young matthew drove bolitho back from the admiralty after yet another meeting she watched him anxiously looking for a sign some hint that he was overtaxing himself he took her in his arms his mouth touching her hair her neck its settled kate i am to command the new squadron he searched her face as she had studied his we can soon return to falmouth it will be a while yet before my ships are ready he smiled and young matthew complains that london is too noisy and dirty for his tastes she linked her arm through his and turned him towards their room at the rear of the house with its tiny walled garden how is george avery relieved i think i have written to him about his sister i did not even know he had a family he said not when i first met him i know there is another story there i believe by family i think he may have meant somebody like you he saw the brandy on the table and wondered if tyacke had left larne yet he could remember his own farewells only too vividly for me richard will you visit the surgeon before we leave chelsea he kissed her lightly for you anything she watched him pour some brandy he was looking better than she had expected his face showing once again the benefit of their being together for over two months but last night she had been unable to comfort him and sleep had been denied to both of them she said perhaps there will be no war across the atlantic perhaps she saw his fingers playing with her locket beneath his shirt he had worn it deliberately for this latest visit to the admiralty his protection he had called it how was sir graham bethune today she had felt his hurt and jealousy at the beginning but bethune had stood by her man against the pack sillitoe too although she was doubtful if his motives were so easily defined he was fair and helpful he has given me most of what i requested maybe i will have the rest when the extent of my orders is realised he did not mention that he would be sailing first to english harbour in antigua the leeward squadron as bethune had dubbed it would establish itself there but he could not tell her not yet there would be pain enough in parting and antigua held so many memories where he had found her again and rediscovered the love which had changed his life his eye fell on a sealed envelope with a coat of arms adorning it when did this arrive i thought i would leave it until later a footman delivered it after you had gone this morning bolitho picked it up and stared at it will they never give up can they not understand that we belong to each other are they so hypocritical that they really expect me to go to belinda he ripped it open with a knife i shall see them in damnation first she watched his change of expression at a loss astonished as if he were a small boy again it is from the prince regent kate an invitation to dine she said then you must go richard your position demands that you he leaned over her and pulled down the back of her gown and kissed her bare shoulder he said quietly we are invited kate he held out the heavily embossed card and she read aloud admiral sir richard bolitho kb and catherine lady somervell she exclaimed it must be a mistake carlton house indeed they have even given you the wrong rank he said almost shyly i forgot to tell you darling kate i have been promoted in the kitchen sophie her maid and the cook both stared at the wall as catherine shouted you forgot she flung her arms around him bless you darlingno wonder they all love you you forgot her fine dark eyes flashed but all my clothes are in falmouth there is no time for she gripped his hand with both of hers except for the green silk you remember he smiled at her antigua oh yes i remember she could not look at him take me upstairs i have to remind you how it is how it will always be together in the kitchen they heard catherines familiar laughter then there was silence the cook glanced at the hob and shook one of the pots theyll be supping late in my opinion she looked at sophie disgraceful annit then she smiled bless em royal command for most of the journey from chelsea along the thames and towards parliament bolitho and catherine spoke little each reflecting on the immediate future sillitoe had sent a brief note by hand to chelsea intimating that the invitation to carlton house was not a mere matter of vanity or curiosity bolitho guessed that he had been told to ensure that they both attended this was also the day when bolitho had visited a consulting physician recommended by the great man himself sir piers blachford of the college of surgeons catherine had stayed in the carriage unwilling to wait at chelsea until the examination was finished it had been very thorough and bolithos eye still smarted from the probing and the stinging ointment when he had returned to the carriage she had known despite his smile and his cheery wave to young matthew that it had been in vain even now as she gripped his hand beneath her cloak she could sense his distress wondering perhaps if he could ever come to terms with it it seemed that nothing could be done unless some new technique were developed the doctor had spoken of damage to the retina and had warned that further probing could destroy the eye altogether he had used the terminology of his profession in an almost matteroffact fashion the language of his world it had probably meant very little to richard except for the verdict his eye would only get worse but it might be a considerable time before the disability became obvious to anybody else then this evening there had been that precious moment when she had descended the stairs in her green silk gown and he had watched her all the way so many memories their hands touching briefly when bolitho had all but fallen on the step in that house above english harbour her hair was piled on her head brailed up as allday had once described it to reveal the gold filigree earrings bolitho had given her the ones she had managed to hide in her stained clothing when her husband and belinda bolitho had connived to have her wrongly imprisoned for debt with deportation an almost certain outcome around her neck she wore his latest present which he had commissioned for her as a surprise when he had returned home from the sea it was a diamond pendant fashioned in the shape of an open fan like the one he had brought her from madeira she had watched his eyes had felt them like warmth from the sun the pendant rested provocatively in the shadow between her breasts he had said quietly you will be the most beautiful lady tonight it had touched her deeply a lady in title only but to richard she knew it meant far more a few people pointed at the crest on the carriage door but here in the heart of london fame was commonplace and too often ephemeral bolitho seemed to read her thoughts i will be glad to go home kate their hands embraced beneath the cloak like lovers themselves i do not know why we are here he turned and looked her full in the face but i shall enjoy showing you off i always do is that so childish she stroked his hand i would have you no other way and i am proud to be at your side even if sillitoe was wrong and the invitation had come only out of curiosity the love of scandal by those who had no cause to fear it she would show only dignity the sky over london was unusually clear but the windows of carlton house were ablaze with lights as smartly liveried linkmen and boys ran to open doors and lower carriage steps above the bustle of horses and staring spectators they heard the sound of music violins and a harpsichord bolitho felt her hand on his arm and heard her whisper like vauxhall pleasure gardens i shall take you there again he nodded he was pleased she still remembered that night when she had shown him a part of her london bewigged footmen whisked away their cloaks and bolithos cocked hat he watched them being carried into an anteroom and marked it carefully in case a hasty retreat should become necessary aware of his uncertainty she smiled at him her eyes flashing in the glitter of a thousand candles most men in his position would be revelling in it she thought here was a real hero loved feared respected and envied but she knew him so well could sense his wariness his determination to protect her from any who might try to harm her they were ushered into a great room with a painted ceiling of water nymphs and fantastical seahorses the orchestra was here although catherine suspected there was a second playing elsewhere in this extravagant building it appeared to have been newly decorated and perhaps was a reflection of the prince regents tastes or personality described behind his back as a gambler drinker and debauchee and to his face by his father as king of the damned his blatant affair with mrs fitzherbert and countless mistresses who had followed her clearly demonstrated the contempt in which he held both his father and society there were several women present some were plain and seemingly ill at ease with nothing to say their husbands on the other hand loudmouthed and sweating badly as the room became more crowded there were other women less overawed by their surroundings some vivacious and wearing gowns cut so low it was a marvel they stayed in position it was almost a relief to see sir paul sillitoe who was pointing them out to a footman while he himself came to greet them congratulations sir richard you are turning many heads this evening but his eyes were on catherine as he raised her hand to his lips each time we see you lady catherine it is like a first meeting you look enchanting she smiled you are all flattery sir sillitoe became businesslike it is a small gathering by prinnys standards the main banquet room is partitioned off we must accept it as an intimate affair the prince regents dislike for the prime minister has worsened i am given to believe he will not be missed bolitho took a tall beautifully shaped goblet from a tray and saw the footmans eyes dart between them did sillitoe obtain all his intelligence from men like this the extent of his knowledge was uncanny the power that that knowledge would represent almost dangerous sillitoe was saying about forty of us i understand bolitho glanced at catherine sillitoe would know exactly how many and the worth and perhaps the secrets of each and every one of them he had returned his attention to catherine now his hooded eyes giving nothing away there will be many wines at table she touched the diamond fan at her breast i take heed of your warning sir paul our host gains entertainment and amusement from his guests if they imbibe too freely is that it sillitoe bowed you are perceptive as always lady catherine i knew i had no need to mention it bolitho saw faces turning away when he caught them staring well let them stare damn them he could easily imagine some of these men making fools of themselves and ladies becoming the perhaps not unwilling prey of others he had seen it happen in army establishments often enough was that what they thought now watching catherine seeing her defiance of convention as a threat to their own manhood or a challenge to it he thought of her in those last days in the sunblistered longboat keeping his hopes alive when to everyone else rescue had seemed impossible and the prospect of death their only escape even now as she turned to glance around the room the faint scars of sunburn on her bare shoulders were still visible after all the months since golden plover had smashed on to the reef suddenly he wanted to take her in his arms to keep holding her until the terrible pictures in his mind were no more instead he asked when i am away he saw her stiffen and knew sillitoe was trying not to listen i would wish for nothing dearer than a portrait of you she tilted her chin and he saw a pulse beating in her throat i would be happy to oblige you richard she reached out and gripped his hand it was as if the room were completely empty your thoughts are always of me never for yourself she turned away as the doors were flung open and an equerry called importantly pray be upstanding for his royal highness the prince of wales regent of all england bolitho studied him intently as he entered the colourful gathering for one so heavy he walked with a light step he even seemed to glide and bolitho was reminded suddenly of a ship of the line losing the wind even as she floated smoothly to her anchorage he was not quite certain what he had expected something perhaps between gillrays cruel cartoons and the paintings he had seen at the admiralty he was about six years younger than bolitho but his excesses had worn badly a devotee of fashion he was elegantly dressed his hair swept forward in the very latest style while his lips remained pursed in a little amused smile as he moved slowly down the room women curtsied deeply while their partners bowed flushed with pleasure if they were noticed but the prince prinny as sillitoe had outrageously called him looked straight at bolitho and then more deliberately at catherine so you are my new admiral he bowed his head to catherine who had subsided into a curtsy please rise lady catherine his eyes rested on the glittering pendant and what lay beneath this is an honour you will sit with me he offered his hand to bolitho you have a good tailor sir do i know him bolitho kept his face impassive a courier to falmouth and a letter of instructions to the tailor there old joshua miller who had worked on the new uniform without pause the others would be ready when he hoisted his flag above indomitable he replied he works in falmouth your royal highness the prince smiled then indeed i shall not know him his eyes moved to the diamond fan again it must bore you my lady living in the country when sir richard is away hmm i keep too busy to become bored sir he gently patted her wrist one so beautiful should never be busy they led the way into the adjoining room bolitho had heard that when it had been fully extended for a more lavish banquet recently the table had been over two hundred feet long with an artificial stream running from a silver fountain at its head they were not to be disappointed at this more humble gathering it appeared a veritable army of footmen and servants lined the walls and music drifted gently through the far doors bolitho took his place without enthusiasm he had recognised the expression in the prince regents eyes the lewd confidence of one used to getting his own way as a footman pulled out a chair for catherine she glanced over the table at him her eyes very level and compelling remember me they seemed to say reassuring him the woman in the boat the one who loves you and no other the prince sat back in a tall chair at the head of the table it was more like a throne bolitho thought with an ornately carved back featuring the plumes of his own coat of arms and the royal crown and cipher gr it seemed that he already imagined himself as king catherine sat on his right hand bolitho on his left as far as the prince of wales was concerned his other guests could think what they chose he raised one hand and instantly like a welltrained platoon of royal marines demonstrating a complicated drill the footmen and servants moved into action as was customary bolitho had expected grace to be spoken in fact he had seen a severelooking bishop at the opposite end of the table in the act of getting to his feet the prince gave no sign that he had seen him but bolitho guessed that like sillitoe his royal highness missed very little soon the table was groaning with the weight of huge platters some of gold some of silver the number of staff in the kitchens must be equally large bolitho thought spring soup then slices of salmon and caper sauce were served with fried fillet of sole each dish would have satisfied even the hungriest midshipman but when he glanced along the table bolitho saw little hesitation as silver flashed in the candlelight and hands moved and plunged as if his fellow guests had not eaten for days the prince remarked as more glasses were filled this is a lighter wine lady catherine not much to my taste i prefer something with a little more body she met his gaze and said from madeira i believe she had not reacted to the emphasis he had placed on the last word in fact it was even rather amusing he was no different from other men after all she looked across at bolitho and raised her glass to our new admiral sir a few sitting close by followed suit but most were more concerned with emptying their plates in anticipation of the next offering the prince said indeed yes i was impressed with your choice of words at the admiralty sir richard although your choice of a flagship surprised me until i perceived the logic of it the vital need for speed and gunnery to act as one there are still many who will not believe it merchants and so forth who can see only an increase in trade and thicker linings to their purses if we slacken our pressure on the enemy this war must be pursued i insist on it he gave catherine a wry smile forgive this talk lady catherine doubtless you have heard enough on the subject where sir richard is concerned i am always ready to learn more sir he wagged one finger at her his will be an enormous responsibility she replied calmly cannot that be said of every captain who sails alone and with only his own skills and courage to sustain him he nodded surprised perhaps by her directness ah yes but an admirals responsibility is total bolitho leaned back as whitegloved hands darted around him and plates vanished as if by magic it gave him time to consider the princes remarks he had heard that he was eager to increase pressure on the french finish it once and for all no wonder the prime minister was absent spencer perceval leaned towards appeasement if only to avoid war with the united states but the regents powers were severely limited for another twelve months and no drastic actions might be commenced that could have farreaching effects to which after this period the king might object if recovered from his madness he looked up and found catherine watching him thinking no doubt of the dangers inherent in this new appointment they needed an admiral who would act without hesitation who would not drag his feet and wait for conflicting instructions from london that was the official position they both knew the reality he had often told her about the loneliness of command when sailing out of company without higher authority if you were successful others would take the credit if you failed the blame was yours alone he raised his glass to her the prince was running his eyes over the next course a highly decorative array of roast rack of lamb larded capon and braised turkey ham tongue and several kinds of vegetables and of course more wine he said i should have seated you at the other end of the table sir richard you and this lady are akin to conspirators but he laughed and bolitho noted that several guests were nodding and laughing too although they could not possibly have heard a word it was just as well that the soldiers and sailors in the field or on the ocean who often paid for their service with their lives could not see those who took them so much for granted i am told that you will sail first to antigua he gestured to a footman who served him a second portion of capon it gave bolitho time to look at her and recognise the shadow of pain at the princes abrupt disclosure i should have told her when i knew he answered i shall assemble my squadron there and i hope to gain some local knowledge as well the prince dabbed his chin and said casually i knew your late husband lady catherine an eager man at the tables he gazed at her reckless to a point of danger i know but we all have our weaknesses even i he did not elaborate but attacked the braised turkey with renewed vigour then he remarked your choice of captain sir richard he snapped his fingers absently in the direction of a footman tyacke isnt it you could have had any captain any man would be prepared to kill for such a chance and yet you chose him without hesitation why so he is an excellent seaman and an accomplished navigator but only the commander of a lowly brig the prince stared down with astonishment as catherine laid one hand on his sleeve she said quietly but is it not also true that nelson chose hardy for his flagcaptain when he in fact commanded a lowly brig he roared with laughter touchй lady catherine i am impressed she started with alarm as a glass fell on the table and the wine spread towards her like blood bolitho said forgive me sir but he was speaking to catherine and she knew it the light from one of the great chandeliers had dazzled him and he had missed the wineglass even as he reached for it no one else seemed to have noticed the prince patted her hand beaming genially at her we will take more wine while these fellows replace the cloth he did not remove his hand and added there are so many things i wish to know about me sir she shook her head and felt the diamond pendant warm against her breast you are much spoken of lady catherine admired too ive no doubt i am loved by but one sir bolitho glanced at the footman who had replaced his glass thank you the man almost dropped his tray and bolitho guessed that he was rarely acknowledged let alone addressed he looked down the table and found sillitoe watching him too far away to hear anything but near enough to guess what the prince was doing what he did so often and so well my spies tell me that you are a good horsewoman perhaps when sir richard is away you would join me for a ride i adore horses she smiled the light and shadow on her high cheekbones making her appear even more lovely i shall not come sir when he leaned towards her she shook her head and laughed not even for you the prince appeared surprised and uncertain we shall see then he turned to bolitho and said all real men must envy you his irritation was plain as a woman several places away leaned forward and pitched her voice until it was audible i have wondered lady catherine and others must have asked you since that terrible shipwreck catherine glanced at bolitho and gave a slight shrug this was familiar ground his sister felicity had put forth the very suggestion this woman was about to make what have you wondered madam all those men in one small boat she looked around her eyes just a little too bright she had obviously not been warned about the princes love of wine and you the only lady amongst them catherine waited sophie apparently was not included in the ordeal she was only a servant she said coolly it is not an experience i would wish to repeat on the opposite side of the table a worriedlooking man with thinning hair said in a fierce whisper that is enough kathleen his wife very much younger tossed her head things which women must do but in front of staring eyes bolitho said abruptly do you never ask about the sailors who are at sea in all conditions madam how they live why they tolerate such conditions then i will tell you it is out of necessity he turned towards catherine i shall never forget her courage and i would suggest you do not either the prince nodded and said in a stage whisper i expect that lady kathleen would have welcomed the experience his eyes were hard with dislike as the insinuation reached the woman in question the remainder of the evening was an ordeal of endurance and discomfort another great course arrived this time of guineafowl oyster patties and curried lobster with more wine to wash it down finally a rhubarb tart was served with three kinds of jelly and lastly cheesecakes bolitho wanted to drag out his watch but knew his host would see and resent it he looked across at catherine and she blew out her cheeks at him i shall not eat again for another month eventually it was over after the ladies had withdrawn there was port and cognac for the gentlementhe latter assured the prince not contraband bolitho guessed that most of the guests were beyond caring the prince detained them until the last as bolitho had known he would he watched a servant bringing his hat and cloak but before he could take them the prince said in his thick voice admiral bolitho may good fortune go with you then he took catherines hand and kissed it lingeringly he looked into her dark eyes i never envied a man before lady catherine not even to be king then he kissed her hand again and held her bare arm with his strong fingers sir richard is that man finally they were in the carriage the ironshod wheels rattling over the cobbles and into the darkened streets he felt her nestle against him i am sorry about antigua i think i knew you were wonderful kate i had to bite my tongue at times she rubbed her head against his shoulder i know i almost told that kathleen woman a thing or two she laughed bitterly are you tired richard she touched his arm too tired he slipped his hand beneath her cloak and caressed her breast i will wake you when we see the thames kate then we shall see who is tired young matthew heard her laugh all those carriages and famous people but when the others heard whose coachman he was they had treated him like a hero wait until they reached falmouth again he thought he might even stretch the story for ferguson and alldays benefit and say that the prince of wales had spoken to him the thames showed itself in the moonlight like blue steel and bolitho moved slightly in his seat he heard her whisper no i am not asleep do not take your hand away i shall be ready the crossed keys inn was small but commodious and perched beside the road that ran north from plymouth to tavistock it was rarely used by the coaching trade which was hardly surprising james tyacke on his walks after dark had discovered that in places the track was hardly wide enough for a farm wagon let alone a coachandfour this evening he sat in a corner of the parlour and wondered how the inn paid for itself it was run by a homely little woman named meg a widow like so many inn and alehouse proprietors in the west country few folk from the nearby village of st budeaux seemed to come here and during the day most of the customers were farm workers whothank god he thought kept to themselves he sat in the shadow of the big chimneybreast and watched the flickering flames in the hearth it was april and the trees were in bud the fields alive with birds but it was still cold at night soon he would eat one of megs rabbit pies most likely then another walk maybe he glanced around the parlour the furniture scrubbed and clean the walls decorated with hunting scenes and some old brasses it was his last night here he stared at the new uniform coat that lay on a bench seat opposite his own the cost of gold lace had risen since his last purchase he thought just as well he had received a large payment of prizemoney memories came sudden and vivid larnes gunner dropping a ball across the bows of some stinking slaver terrified black faces naked women chained together in their filth like animals the slavers themselves portuguese and arab men prepared to bribe and barter when they were brought to him they knew it was pointless there were no more bargains to be made only the rope at the end of the passage to freetown or the cape the thrill of the chase with every spar threatening to splinter itself under a full press of canvas ozanne had her now tyacke could think of no better man he stared again at his coat a bright new epaulette on the right shoulder it seemed somehow out of place he thought but he was a captain now no matter how junior he wondered if avery had told sir richard how he had betrayed his secret in order to persuade him suppose avery had kept silent would i have changed my mind or would i still be in the dockyard in larne two men came in and moved to a table on the far side of the room meg seemed to know them and brought tankards of ale without being asked on her way back to the kitchen she paused to poke the fire if she had been shocked by tyackes face she had not shown it perhaps she had seen worse in her time so wem losin yew tomorrer mr tyacke yes he said turning slightly away from her ive told henry to fetch is cart bright n early for yew tomorrow weeks of uncertainty now it was almost time tyacke had not been back in england for years on his way here from the dockyard he had watched the passing scenery like a stranger in some foreign country through the city itself shop after shop hairdressers and hatters painters and distillers and more inns and lodginghouses than he could imagine plenty of sea officers and sailors who he assumed had the protection and were free to come and go as they pleased he recalled the disbelief amongst larnes company when bolitho had granted permission for his men to go ashore only one had failed to return drunk he had fallen into a dock and drowned he had seen plenty of women too some prettily dressed and decorative the wives of army and naval officers perhaps others like meg of the crossed keys trying to do mens work to replace those who might never come home he said ive been very comfortable here maybe ill see you again some day she turned to look at him and although he watched carefully for it there was no abhorrence in her eyes when they rested on his face ill fetch your supper soon zur they both knew they would not meet again he sipped his brandy good stuff maybe smugglers came this way his thoughts returned to his new command how different she would be designed originally as a small thirdrate of guns she had been cut down to her present size by the removal of most of her upper deck and corresponding armament but her forty pounders remained with an additional four pounders for bow and sternchasers tyacke had studied every detail of the ship and her history since she had been built at the famous william hartland yard at rochester on the medway he considered bolithos comments the ships possible use if war broke out with the united states all the big new american frigates carried twentyfourpounders and for sheer firepower were far superior to english frigates like anemone more to the point perhaps his new command had a far greater cruising range her original company of over six hundred had now been reduced to which included royal marines she was still undermanned but then every ship was which was in or near a naval port all those unknown faces how long would it be before he came to know them their value their individual qualities as a captain he could ask what he pleased of his officers respect as he had seen with bolitho had to be earned he thought again of the ship herself thirtyfour years old built of fine kentish oak when there had been such trees for the asking in newer ships some of the timbers were barely seasoned and their frames were cut by carpenters not shaped over the years for extra strength some were built of teak on oak frames like john companys ships which were mostly laid down in bombay teak was like iron but hated by the sailors who had to work and fight in them unlike oak splinters teak could poison a man kill him far more slowly and painfully than canister shot tyacke swallowed more brandy his new command had first tasted salt water while he had been in his mothers arms his face softened into a smile we must have grown up together she had even been at the nile he tried not to touch his scarred cheek other battles too the chesapeake and the saintes copenhagen and then because she was too small for the line of battle she had shared all the miseries of blockade and convoy duty there must be a lot of experienced postcaptains asking why sir richard should hoist his flag above an old converted thirdrate when he could have had anything he wanted a full admiral now he wondered what catherine somervell thought about it he could see her as if she were beside him first in the dirty and soaking sailors clothing and then in the yellow gown he had carried with him since the girl of his choice had rejected him it was strange but he could even think of that without the pain as if it had happened to somebody else he tried to remember if he had all he needed and his thoughts returned to bolithos mistress but the term offended him his lady she would make certain that bolitho was well provided for when he left home he thought he could smell cooking and realised how hungry he was it made good sense to eat well tonight he would be too tense and anxious later on he smiled again as he recalled that bolitho had told him he was always nervous when he took over a new command but remember they are far more worried about their new captain and what about john alldayhis oak as he called him would he be so eager this time to quit the land one of the men at the other table put down his tankard and stared at the door his companion almost ran through the adjoining room where some farmhands were drinking rough cider then tyacke heard it the tramp of feet the occasional clink of metal meg bustled in her hands full of knives and forks the press sir theym not usually this far from ome she smiled at him never fear ill see they dont disturb yew he sat back in the deep shadows being in charge of a pressgang was a thankless task as a junior lieutenant he had done it only once whimpering men and blaspheming women curiously enough although most of the shore parties who performed that duty were themselves pressed men they were usually the most ruthless there were muffled shouts from the rear of the inn and tyacke guessed that the man who had rushed from the room had been taken his companion came back shaking despite the folded protection he had been fortunate enough to carry the door crashed open and a young lieutenant strode into the parlour he snapped stand up and be examined then he seemed to realise that the man in question had already been inspected and swung towards the shadowy figure by the chimneybreast and you did you hear me in the kings name tyacke did not move but thrust out his foot and pushed the bench seat into the candlelight the lieutenant gaped at the gleaming gold lace and stammered i did not know sir few officers come this way tyacke said quietly which is why i came not to be shouted at by some arrogant puppy hiding in the kings coat he stood up meg two armed seamen in the doorway and the man who had been examined all froze as if it were some kind of mime tyacke turned very slowly what is your name lieutenant but the young officer was unable to speak he was staring at tyackes terrible wound as if mesmerised then he muttered in a small voice laroche ssir may i ask what ship indomitable sir then we shall meet tomorrow mister laroche i am captain james tyacke suddenly he had the parlour to himself meg hurried in again a steaming pot wrapped in a cloth i be that sorry zur tyacke reached out and touched her arm it was nothing we all have to begin somewhere tomorrow it would be all over the ship he considered it indomitable my ship again he thought about bolitho and the memory steadied him they will be far more worried about you meg left him to his supper but paused in the door to watch him wondering how it had happened how such a finelooking man could ever learn to accept it she quietly closed the door and thought of him long after he had gone indomitable henry the carter tugged slightly at the reins as the wheels clattered over the first of the dockyard cobbles he said shes out at anchor zur he glanced at his passengers strong profile unable to understand why anybody would willingly go to sea captain or not tyacke stared across the gleaming water and was surprised that he was so calm no that was not it he felt no emotion whatsoever he glanced towards the wall and was relieved to see that larne had moved her berth doubtless to complete her rerigging he wondered if they knew he was here if someone was watching him with a telescope at this very second he said there are stairs at the end roight zur ill make sure there be a boat waitin for ee oh there will be he thought even if the boats crew had been up since before dawn tyacke had done it himself often enough waiting for the new lord and master imagining what he would be like the man who would rule everybodys life from senior lieutenant to ships boy who could promote disrate flog and if necessary hang anyone who did not abide by his orders he shivered slightly but disdained to put on his boatcloak it was a fair morning and the sea was a mass of dancing white horses but it was not the cool air that caused him to tremble it was this moment which he had dreaded of this particular day he saw a flurry of splashes and knew it was a boat casting off from a mooring buoy his arrival had been noted thank you henry he put some coins into the mans fist and stared at the big brassbound chest they had travelled a long way together since he had recovered from his injuries his complete world was contained in it recovered hardly that it was impossible not to be reminded of it daily he saw himself reflected in other peoples faces and the horror and the pity he saw there had never ceased to wound him all through the night he had gone over everything he had discovered about indomitable his head filled as if it would burst if he could not rest all the lieutenants had been aboard throughout the refit even the luckless laroche who had blundered into the inn parlour the first confrontation there would be many more he gazed out at the moored ship without her original tophamper she looked like any other large frigate at this distance like the valkyrie with her main gun deck higher than fifth and sixthrates so that her devastating broadside could be used to maximum effect he watched the approaching boat critically the oars rising and falling like wings he thought even allday would approve he turned to speak once more but the little cart had gone only the seachest remained the gig swung in a tight arc the bowman poised with his boathook to grip the mooring ring on the stairs after what seemed an eternity a young lieutenant ran up the stairs and raised his hat with a flourish protheroe sir at your service ah yes fourth lieutenant he saw the young officers eyebrows lift with surprise and thought for a moment that his memory had betrayed him whyyes sir tyacke turned deliberately to reveal the burned side of his face it had the effect he expected when he turned back protheroe had gone pale but his voice was controlled as he rapped out orders and two seamen ran to collect the heavy chest tyacke glanced at them as they hurried past with their eyes averted laroche had obviously told a grim story about their new captain protheroe watched the chest being carried down to the gig no doubt terrified that they would let it fall into the water not long out of a midshipmans berth tyacke thought may we proceed mr protheroe the lieutenant stared around with dismay i was looking for your coxswain sir tyacke felt his mouth break into a smile i am afraid that the commander of a brig does not run to his own coxn i see sir he stood aside and waited for tyacke to descend the weedlined steps again the quick stares from the boats crew then every eye looking instantly away as his glance passed over them tyacke sat down in the sternsheets and held his sword against his thigh as he had done when he left larne let go bear off forrard out oars tyacke turned to watch the gap of lively water widening i am leaving god for what give way all he asked how long have you been in indomitable a year sir i joined her while she was still laid up in ordinary and about to complete her rebuilding he faltered under tyackes eyes before that i was signals midshipman in the crusader tyacke stared across the stroke oarsmans broad shoulder at the masts and yards rising up to greet him as if they were lifting from the seabed now he could see the difference one hundred and eighty feet overall and of some fourteen hundred tons her broad beam betrayed that she had been built originally for the line of battle her sail plan had changed little he thought with a wind over the quarter she would run like a deer if properly handled he saw the pale sunlight gleaming on several telescopes and knew the men were stampeding to their stations what would his first lieutenant be like perhaps he had expected promotion even command of the powerful ship once her overhaul was completed indomitables last captain had left her months ago leaving his senior lieutenant in charge until their lordships had decided what to do with her they had not he gripped his sword even tighter sir richard bolitho had made that decision he could imagine the words so be it bring her to larboard mr protheroe there was an edge to his voice although he had not realised it as he watched the long tapering jibboom reaching out towards them like a lance he saw the figurehead where it crouched beneath the beakhead crouched was right it was in the form of a lion about to attack with both paws slashing at the air a fine piece of work tyacke thought but it was not the original figurehead which would have been far too big for the rebuilt hull except for the bright red mouth and gleaming eyes it shone with expensive gold paint perhaps a gift from the builders who had converted her carry on mr protheroe he was suddenly eager to begin his stomach in knots as the gig veered towards the mainchains and the entry port where he had already seen the scarlet of the marines my marines he thought of adam bolithos frigate anemone lying alongside this ship she would be overwhelmed his experienced eye took in everything from the buff and black hull that shone like glass above the cruising white horses to the new rigging shrouds and stays freshly blackeddown and every sail neatly furled probably by the petty officers themselves for this important occasion for all of us a voice seemed to say he would find himself a personal coxswain another allday if there was such a man he would be more than useful at times like these the gig had hooked on the oars tossed the seamen staring directly astern anywhere but at their new captain tyacke rose to his feet very aware of the lively gigs movement waiting for the exact moment to climb up to the entry port thank you mr protheroe i am obliged then he seized the handropes and stepped quickly on to the tumblehome before the sea could drag him down like the walk from larne to the waiting carriage the minutes seemed endless as his head rose above the port the sudden explosion of noise was deafening the bayoneted muskets of the royal marines snapped in salute in time with their officers sword and the calls of boatswains mates followed by the rattle of drums rose and then fell silent tyacke removed his hat in salute to the extended quarterdeck with its neatlypacked hammock nettings he noticed that the wheel and compass boxes were unsheltered builders and designers then as now saw only the efficiency of their work not men being shot down by enemy sharpshooters with nothing but the stowed hammocks to protect them a squarefaced lieutenant stepped from the ranks of blue and white warrant officers and midshipmen two so young that tyacke wondered how anyone could have allowed them to leave home i am scarlett the senior here he hesitated and added welcome to indomitable sir a seriouslooking face reliable perhaps thank you mr scarlett he followed the first lieutenant along the rank all standing in order of seniority even protheroe had managed to slip into the line during the brief ceremony at the entry port four lieutenants including the unfortunate laroche their eyes met and tyacke asked coldly how many men did you press mr laroche he stammered three sir he hung his head expecting the mainmast to fall on him we shall find many more i daresay all plymouth knew you were abroad last night he moved on leaving the third lieutenant looking dazed lieutenant scarlett was saying this is isaac york sir our sailingmaster a capable interesting face you would know him as a deepwater sailor even if he were disguised as a priest tyacke asked how long have you been sailingmaster mr york he was younger than most masters he had known the characters of almost every vessel york grinned a year sir afore that i was masters mate aboard this ship for four years tyacke nodded satisfied a man who knew how she would handle under all conditions the face appeared about thirty except that his neatly cut hair was slategrey they turned to the quarterdeck rail the midshipmen could wait tyacke felt in his coat for his commission as so ordered he would read himself in have all hands lay aft mr scarlett he stopped and saw the first lieutenants instant uncertainty that man by the boat tier scarlett relaxed only slightly thats troughton he serves as cook is something wrong sir have him come aft a midshipman scuttled away to fetch him and most of the men already on deck turned to watch as the onelegged sailor in the long white apron clumped on to the quarterdeck if you do not approve sir scarlett sounded apprehensive tyacke stared at the limping figure he had sensed somebodys eyes upon him even as he had come aboard now of all times there was utter silence as he strode over to the cook and reaching him put his hands on the thin shoulders dear god i was told you were dead troughton the man studied him feature by feature and lastly the scars then he glanced down at his wooden leg and said quietly they tried to do for both of us that day sir im so glad youve come to the old indom welcome aboard very solemnly they shook hands so she even had a special nickname tyacke thought it was like a triumph someone had survived on that hideous day a young seaman working with a handspike to retrain one of his guns he should have been killed tyacke had imagined him being thrown outboard with all the other corpses but he himself had been deafened and blinded and had heard only screams his own as the ships company swarmed aft and he took out his commission and unrolled it tyacke saw men whispering to each other those who had seen the incident trying to describe it to their friends the scarred captain and a onelegged cook grouped behind him most of the officers were too young to understand but york the master and the first lieutenant knew well enough what it meant and when tyacke began to read himself in they both leaned closer to hear as if this tall straightbacked man gave the formality both significance and a new impact it was addressed to james tyacke esquire appointing him to the indomitable on this day in april not far from the place where drake was alleged to have kept the fleet and the dons waiting while he finished his game of bowls willing and requiring you forthwith to go on board and take upon you the charge and command of captain in her accordingly strictly charging and commanding all the officers and company of the said indomitable at that point tyacke looked across the mass of upturned faces the old indom but the onelegged cook was not in sight perhaps he had imagined it and troughton had been only a lingering spectre who had come back to give him the strength he had needed eventually it was all over ending with the customary warning threat as he perceived it hereof nor you nor any of you may fail as will answer the contrary at your peril he rolled up the commission and said god save the king there was neither sound nor cheering and the silence at any other time would have been oppressive he replaced his hat and gazed aloft where sir richard bolithos flag would soon be hoisted to the mainmast truck for the first time you may dismiss the hands mr scarlett i will see all officers in my quarters in one hour if you please the figures crowded below the quarterdeck rail were still thinking only of their own future and not of the ship not yet and yet despite the silence he could feel only a sense of elation an emotion which was rare to him this was not his beloved larne it was a new beginning for him and for the ship lieutenant matthew scarlett strode aft glancing this way and that to ensure that the ship was tidy the hammock nettings empty all spare cordage coiled or flaked down until the new day the air that touched his face when he passed an open gunport was cold and the ships motion was unsteady for so powerful a hull he had overheard the sailingmaster lecturing some of the young gentlemen during the dogwatches when the gulls fly low over the rocks at night itll be bad next day no matter what some clever jacks tell you scarlett had seen the two newest midshipmen glance doubtfully at one another but the gulls had flown abeam even as the darkness of evening had started to close in around the anchored ship isaac york was rarely mistaken past the unattended double wheel and further aft into the shadows where a royal marine sentry stood in the light of a spiralling lantern the indomitable had been converted to contain two large cabins aft one for her captain and the other for use by the senior officer of a flotilla or squadron but for tyackes arrival and the vessels selection as sir richard bolithos flagship one of the cabins might have been his he acknowledged the watchful sentry and reached for the screen door the sentry tapped the deck with his musket and bawled first lieutenant sir enter scarlett closed the door behind him his eyes taking in several things at once tyackes supper stood on a tray untouched the coffee he had requested must be icecold the table was completely covered with books canvas folios and pages of the captains own notes scarlett thought of the officers all packed into this cabin shortly after the captain had read himself in could that have been only this morning tyacke must have been going through the ships affairs ever since you have not eaten sir may i send for something tyacke looked at him for the first time you were at trafalgar i believe scarlett nodded taken aback by the directness aye sir i was in lord nelsons weather column the spartiate captain sir francis laforey did you ever meet nelson no sir we saw him often enough aboard the flagship few of us ever met him after he fell many of our people wept as if they had known him all their lives i see scarlett watched tyackes sunbrowned hands leafing through another book did you ever meet him sir tyacke stared up from the table his eyes very blue in the swaying lanterns like you i only saw him in the far distance he was touching his scarred face his eyes suddenly hard at the nile scarlett waited so that was where it had happened tyacke said abruptly i understand that the pursers clerk has been doing the work of ships clerk as well as his own yes sir we have been very shorthanded so i thought tyacke closed the book pursers and their clerks are necessary mr scarlett but it is sometimes a risk to give them too much leeway in ships affairs he pushed the book aside and opened another where he had used a quill as a marker detail one of the reliable midshipmen for the task until we are fully manned i shall ask the purser if tyacke regarded him no tell mr viney what you intend he paused i have also been going through the punishment book scarlett tensed with growing resentment at the manner in which the new captain was treating him sir this man fullerton three dozen lashes for stealing some trifle or other from a messmate rather harsh surely it was my decision sir it was harsh but the laws of the lower deck are harder than the articles of war his messmates would have put him over the side he waited for a challenge but surprisingly tyacke smiled id have offered him four dozen he glanced around and scarlett studied the burned half of his face he looks at me as the captain but inwardly he must bleed at every curious stare tyacke said i will not tolerate unfair or brutal punishment but i will have discipline in my ship and i will always support my officers unless he did not finish it he pushed some papers along the black and white chequered deckcovering and revealed a bottle of brandy fetch two glasses his voice pursued the first lieutenant as he pulled open a cupboard scarlett saw all the other carefullystowed bottles he had watched it being swayed up on a tackle just the previous day he said cautiously fine brandy sir from a lady who but lady catherine would have taken the trouble would even have cared they drank in silence the ship groaning around them a wet breeze rattling the halliards overhead tyacke said we will sail with the tide at noon we will gain sea room and set course for falmouth where sir richard bolitho will hoist his flag i have no doubt that lady catherine somervell will come aboard with him he felt rather than saw scarletts surprise so make certain the hands are well turned out and that a bosuns chair is ready for her scarlett ventured from what ive heard of the lady sir he saw tyacke tense as if about to reprimand him he continued she could climb aboard unaided he saw tyacke nod his eyes distant for that moment only another man entirely she could indeed he gestured towards the bottle another thing as of tomorrow this ship will wear the white ensign and masthead pendant accordingly he took the goblet and stared at it i know that sir richard is now an admiral of the red and to my knowledge he has always sailed under that colour but their lordships have decreed that if we are to fight it will be under the white ensign scarlett looked away as we did at trafalgar sir yes about a coxswain sir dyou have anyone in mind theres a gun captain named fairbrother a good hand but if he doesnt suit ill find another ill see him after breakfast rain pattered across the tall stern windows its going to blow tomorrow sir all the better i went through your watch and quarter bills immediately he sensed scarletts anxiety one who resented criticism or had been unfairly used in the past youve done a good job not too many bumpkins in one watch or too many seasoned hands in another but once standing downchannel i want all hands turnedto for sail and gun drill they will be our strength as always he stood up and walked aft to the windows now streaked with salt spray we carry eight midshipmen keep them changing around get them to work more closely with the masters mates it is not enough to tip your hat like some halfpay admiral or have perfect manners at the mess table as far as the people are concerned they are kings officers god help us so they will perform accordingly who is in charge of signals by the way mr midshipman blythe sir scarlett was amazed at the way the captains mind could jump so swiftly from one subject to the next he will be due for examination for lieutenant shortly is he any good he saw the lieutenant start at the bluntness of his question and added more gently you do no wrong mr scarlett your loyalty is to me and the ship in that order and not to the members of your wardroom scarlett smiled he attends well to his duties sir i must say that his head sometimes gets larger as the examination draws closer well said one other thing when sir richards flag breaks at the mainmast truck remember i am still your captain always feel free to speak with me it is better than keeping it all sealed up like some fireship about to explode he watched the effect of his words on scarletts open honest features you can carry on now i feel certain that the wardroom is all agog for your news but he said it without malice he realised that scarlett was still there his hands playing with his cocked hat is there something else mr scarlett well sir scarlett hesitated as we are to be of one company war or no may i ask something if it is reasonable sir richard bolitho what is he like sir truly like for a moment he thought he had tested the captains confidences too far tyackes emotions were mixed as if one were fighting the other he strode across the spacious cabin and back again his hair almost brushing the deckhead we spoke of lord nelson a leader of courage and inspiration one i would have liked to meet but serve under himi think not he knew scarlett was staring at him earnestly waiting sir richard bolitho now he hesitated and thought of the brandy and wine lady catherine had sent aboard for him he felt suddenly angry with himself for discussing their special relationship but i did invite his confidence he said quietly let me say this mr scarlett i would serve no other man for that is what he is a man he touched his face but did not notice it he gave me back my pride and my hope thank you sir scarlett reached the screen door afterwards he guessed that the captain had not even heard him james tyacke looked around the large cabin before examining his face in the mirror that hung above his seachest for a second or two he touched the mirror scratched here and there dented around the frame he often wondered how it had survived over the years or me either the ship had quietened somewhat after all the bustle and preparations to get under way calls twittered and voices still shouted occasional orders but for the most part they were ready tyacke walked to the stern windows and rubbed the misty glass with his sleeve it was blustery the windows full of cruising white horses the nearest land only a wedge of green he could faintly hear the clank clank of pawls as the seamen threw their weight on the capstan bars but down aft this cabin was like a haven a barrier between him and the ship unlike the little larne where everybody had seemed to get under his feet any minute now and scarlett would come down and report that they were ready he would be curious no doubt to see how the new captain would perform on his first day at sea tyacke had already been on deck at the first suggestion of dawn with plymouth sound glittering in a moving panorama of small angry waves he had found the master isaac york by the compass boxes speaking with two of his mates the latter had melted away when they had seen their captain up and about so early they might think him nervous unable to stay away from the scurrying seamen both on deck and aft how is the wind mr york york had peered aloft his eyes crinkling into deep crowsfeet steady enough sir east by north itll be lively when we clear the land confident a professional sailor who could still appreciate being consulted by his captain he had added in an almost fond tone the indoms a fine sailer sir ive known none better shell hold close to the wind even under storm staysls not many frigates could boast as much he had squinted up at the small monkeylike figures working far above the deck with her press of canvas she can shift herself a man proud of his ship and of what he had achieved to become her master tyacke dragged out his watch almost time he listened to the clank of the capstan and could picture the straining seamen as they fought to haul the ship up to her anchor boots thumped overhead the royal marines who were part of the afterguard preparing to free the mizzen sails and the big driver when so ordered the seamen always claimed contemptuously that the marines were only given the task because the mizzenmast was the simplest rigged and even they could manage it more feet were running over the deck tyacke tried to identify every sound the boats were hoisted on their tier the ships launch had been landed and a new dark green barge lashed in its place the admirals own boat he thought about the colours being hoisted that morning the white ensign curling in the wind nelson at trafalgar had been the first admiral to fight a fleet action under that flag in the smoke and hatred of a seabattle it was absolutely vital that every captain should know friend from foe and the red ensign or even the blue had been too dangerous at trafalgar where french and spanish flags of similar colouring could easily have confused the identity of ships and impeded the immediate response to signals he knew that scarlett was coming even before the sentry yelled out the news he compared him to the two royal marine officers captain cedric du cann and his lieutenant david merrick men who would never question their orders no matter what perhaps it was better to be like them imagination could be a risky possession he called enter scarlett hat tucked underneath one arm opened the screen door his eyes seeking out his captain to assess his demeanour or plumb the depths of his uncertainty the anchor is all but hove short sir i shall come up scarlett was still watching him the master has laid a course to weather nare head sir i know scarlett saw him glance around the cabin he himself had gone on deck after a late night in the wardroom fending off speculation and gossip until the others had tired of it except the purser james viney who had repeatedly questioned him about the captains decision regarding his clerk scarlett was beginning to wonder if viney did have something to hide it was often said that half the inns and lodginghouses in naval ports were either owned or supplied by pursers at the countrys expense but once on deck scarlett had seen the captains skylight still aglow did he never sleep or rest could he not tyacke led the way up the companion ladder and on to the breezy quarterdeck a slow glance took it all in seamen standing at braces and halliards topmen already aloft spread out on the yards and silhouetted against the sky like dwarfs three men on the wheel york was taking no chances the lieutenants like little islands of blue and white at each mast each man staring aft as tyacke walked to the quarterdeck rail he listened to the capstan and heard the faint scrape of a violin the sound of which had been inaudible in his quarters the signals midshipman blythe was standing with his small crew of seamen his face severe as he watched the captain tyacke nodded to him he could well imagine he would have a big head he glanced aft the two marine officers with some of their men their scarlet coats very bright in the drifting spray york was with his mates near the wheel but peered up at him and touched his hat standing by sir tyacke saw a squat figure in a plain blue coat and carrying a rattan cane walking along the larboard guns that would be sam hockenhull the boatswain seeking the new men all of whom were probably sick with dismay at being torn from their loved ones to go to god knew where and for how long beyond hockenhull he could see one upraised paw of the lion figurehead further still the blurred outline of plymouth and what looked like a church tower he walked across the deck feeling the stares hating them there are two collier brigs larboard quarter mr york the master did not smile aye sir ive marked em well tyacke looked at him im told that if you ram a fully laden collier its like hitting the barrier reef then york did grin ill not be the one to find out sir anchors coming home now sir tyacke folded his arms get the ship under way if you please stand by the capstan more calls twittered urgently spithead nightingales the sailors called them loose the headsls hockenhull the boatswain jabbed the air with his rattan youmove yourself take that mans name mr sloper loose topsls that was scarlett his powerful voice magnified by his speakingtrumpet while he wiped the drifting spray from his eyes man the braces mr laroche put more hands on the weather side as she comes clear tyacke shaded his eyes and watched the headsails flapping and banging until brought under command then up to the topsail yards where the tancoloured canvas was barely under control the wind eagerly exploring it as if to hurl the topmen down to the deck tyacke studied the great mainsail yard its canvas still neatly lashed into place from the quarterdeck it looked twice the length of larnes mainyard where one or two slavers had danced their lives away anchors aweigh sir released from the land indomitable heeled over to the thrust of canvas and rudder the sea almost brushing the lee gunports while she came about sails thundering as fore and mainsails were hauled and beaten into submission some men lost their footing on the deck and fell gasping until dragged back to the taut braces helped or punched as seemed necessary tyacke watched the two anchored colliers slide past as if they and not indomitable were moving he heard the squeak of halliards and saw a new ensign break out from the gaff so white against the angry clouds hold her steady steer southwest by south he walked up the tilting deck while men dashed hither and thither on the wet planking steady she goes sir full an bye tyacke called once we clear the point we will set the driver mr scarlett he had to shout above the violent din of rigging and canvas the crack of halliards and shrouds as every inch of cordage took and held the strain scarlett touched his hat aye aye sir he wiped his face and grinned someone wishes us well tyacke crossed to the nettings and stared across the choppy water it was larne out at an anchorage now perhaps leaving this very day but it was not that every yard was manned with more seamen clinging to the ratlines to wave and cheer even indomitables own chorus could not drown the wild cheering scarlett glanced round curiously as tyacke removed his hat and then waved it slowly back and forth above his head the uninjured side of tyackes face was turned towards him and he felt something like pity as he realised what he was seeing it was a last farewell cross of st george bolitho put his arm around her shoulders and said this is far enough kate the path is barely safe even in such clear moonlight they stood side by side on the rough track from pendennis point and looked out across the sea it shone like melting silver so brightly that the stars seemed faint and insignificant by comparison they had walked and ridden every day since their return from london savouring every moment sharing every hour not speaking of the future the hillsides were covered now with bluebells and brilliant contrasting yellow gorse how much longer three days perhaps at the most as if reading his thoughts she said quietly tomorrow your indomitable will come aye i hope james tyacke is settling down to the change she turned lightly and he felt her looking at him her hair shining as she pulled out the combs and let it fall across her shoulders will we settle down darling richard she shook her head angry with herself forgive me it is not easy for either of us but i shall miss you so she paused unable to speak of what was uppermost in both their minds there may be farewells but we will never be parted tiny lights blinked on the water like fallen stars lost in the great full moon bolitho said fishermen at their pots he tried to smile or revenue officers after another kind of catch you know what we promised one another she had been wearing a shawl but it had slipped down her arms to leave her shoulders bare in the moonlight not to waste a minute kate but that was then this is now i never want to be parted from you again once this matter is settled she touched his mouth with her fingers so cool in the night air i am so proud of you and you cannot even understand why you are the only man who can do it you have the experience and the success and you will give heart to all those under your command have their lordships given you all that you wanted he caressed her shoulders their smoothness and their strength exciting him as always all that they have is more likely apart from indomitable and valkyrie i shall have six other frigates as soon as anemone has completed her refit at plymouth and there are three brigs as well not a fleet but a flying squadron to be reckoned with thank god larne was ordered back to the antislavery patrols it would have been torture for tyacke to see her in company day after day his thoughts turned to george avery he was not staying at the house but had gone over to the inn at fallowfield where allday would be fretting about everything as sailing time drew relentlessly closer it might help allday to have somebody with him to whom he could talk about the ship and the destination just as it might help the flaglieutenant to accept that his sister was dead that he could have done nothing to save her she said suddenly richard are you troubled about your daughter bolitho caught his shoe on some loose stones and felt her arm instantly supporting him there are no secrets from you kate he hesitated she will be nine years old in two months time but i do not know her nor she me her mother has made her into a doll not like a real child at all it was always there guilt a sense of responsibility it was nothing of which she could be jealous he said as though reading her thoughts i love only you catherine faced him i shall always remember what you gave up because of me she shook her head as he began to protest no hear me richard because of our love you have been abused and taken for granted when all england should honour the bravest and the gentlest of her commanders she relented the man who forgot to tell his lover he had been made an admiral i shall never be allowed to forget that he turned her towards the deeper shadows of the hillside they will have a search party out looking for us we had best get back to the house she put her arm around his waist home one word it was enough the austere stone buildings did not soften against the perfect sky there was a light in the adjoining cottage ferguson bolithos steward was still awake doing his books or planning something to please his old friend allday before he left an old dog slumbered in the yard it was quite deaf and was no longer much use as a guard dog but like the crippled and injured men who worked on the estate the harvest of the war at sea it belonged here strange not to see leaping flames in the great fireplace summer was almost here catherine tightened her grip on his arm but they would not share it together she glanced at the rug by the empty grate where two young people believing they had lost everything dear to them had found one another and had loved and might still be damned for it she had sensed richards unease when he had mentioned adams anemone which was still lying at plymouth it was a heavy secret to carry she glanced over her shoulder and saw the sea beyond the windows shining in the moonlight the enemy she could feel the portraits watching from the stairwell they had all left here never to return she thought of the painting richard wanted done of her and she had wondered briefly if he would also like one of his brother hugh but this was not the time to ask him her man was sailing to confront the americans and she sensed that in the present hostile atmosphere neither country would back down there was too much at stake he would not wish to be reminded of his brothers treachery had hugh known of adams existence perhaps things might have been different but fate having determined the course of lives could not be unwritten together they walked to the broad opened windows and listened to the silence once they heard an owl and bolitho remarked the mice will have to take care tonight tomorrow the ship would come he would be inextricably involved in its affairs and haunted by the inevitability of their parting she said dear bryan has left some wine for us he took her in his arms and felt the tension in her body he knows knows what that i want you dearest kate need you she let him kiss her on the mouth the throat and then on her bare shoulder watching his hands in the strange light moving over her gown until she could wait no longer then she stood quite naked like a silver statue her fine breasts uplifted her arms stretched out to hold him away undress richard then she lay in the moons path before drawing him down beside her when he reached for her she exclaimed they call me a whore dearest of men i will kill anyone who she knelt beside him tracing each scar on his body even the deep wound in his forehead she kissed him not with tenderness but with a fierce abandon he had rarely experienced again he tried to embrace her but she denied him i am here to torment you richard you are mine completely for this night bolitho felt her fingers touch and then grip him and all the while she was kissing him her tongue exploring his body as he had so often explored hers she broke away and he felt her breasts move over his skin prolonging every sensation then all at once she was above him her legs straddling him while she gazed into his face i have teased you enough i shall give you your reward he moved to possess her but she pretended to resist her nakedness framed against the moonlight until with a cry she felt him enter her as dawn laid its first brushstrokes across the sky they still slept entwined on the bed the wine stood nearby untouched and the owl was long silent she opened her eyes and turned to study his profile youthful now in sleep she ran her fingers over his body not wishing to wake him not wanting to stop she touched herself and smiled secretly whore lover mistress i am all of these things if you desire me she caressed him again and waited her heart beating for him to respond it was as if she had spoken her thoughts aloud the next instant he was holding her down like a captive you are shameless kate then he kissed her passionately stifling her gasp as he took her without restraint down in the yard ferguson looked up at the opened windows the curtains were fluttering out over the sills blown by some inshore breeze so many years since the pressgang had taken him he thought of it even now especially when the press still trod the streets looking for men he thought too of the battle of the saintes where he had lost his arm and bolithos coxswain had been killed trying to protect his captains back somehow since then the little crew had grown around them allday also a pressed man had become bolithos coxswain and he too would soon be off to sea again he heard lady catherines quick laugh or were they tears it troubled him greatly more than he could remember john allday glanced around the parlour of the old hyperion and said so indomitable anchors tomorrow lieutenant george avery watched him thoughtfully this was a different allday from the one he had seen in the smoke of battle or holding sir richard bolitho in his arms when he had been struck down by splinters not even the same big gentle man he had watched going to his wedding here in fallowfield on the helford river he was obviously still uneasy about his new existence and avery could sympathise with him it was strangely peaceful he could hear alldays wife unis speaking with some ploughman in the adjoining room and the thump of her brother johns wooden leg as he put up another cask of beer a friendly place and he was glad he had stayed here after hearing about ethels death he had slept and eaten better than he could remember and unis had been very kind to him he said so the coastguard say again he watched the conflicting emotions in alldays weathered face needing to go wanting to stay he was not even concerned about sitting at the same table as an officer any more any more than i am it was bolithos doing his example my little crew allday put out a lighted taper and laid his pipe aside trying to explain it its all so different ysee sir people talk about their farms and the sales of stock an grain he shook his shaggy head i thought id get used to it resign meself to the land he stared hard at the perfect model he had given unis of the old hyperion in which her first husband had been killed but not yet see avery heard the pony and trap being brought into the yard ready to take him to falmouth where he might be needed at any time now he thought of tyackes outburst and wondered how he would behave when next they met allday was saying then we get all the old jacks in here too not a whole man amongst em but the way they talks youd think every captain was a bloody saint and each day afloat was a pleasure trip then he grinned not what they really thought ill wager unis entered the parlour and exclaimed no dont get up mr avery avery remained standing she was a pretty little woman natural and uncomplicated like the countryside the wild flowers and the bees she had probably never had an officer stand up for her before in her life or anyone else for that matter he said i must be leaving mrs allday even that sounded strange he thought he saw their quick exchange of glances the big shambling sailor and the wife he had never expected to find the look told it all sudden anxiety courage too and full knowledge of what it would mean she said you go with mr avery john give my best wishes to lady catherine she looked leveleyed at avery a beautiful lady that one shes been good to me allday said hesitantly well if you dont need me unis she folded her arms and pretended to glare at him you know youre anxious to see sir richard so be off with you you just come back to me tonight then she kissed him standing on tiptoe to reach his face like a bear with a sore head you are john allday avery said impulsively ive been so happy here he spoke with such sincerity that she wiped her eyes surreptitiously with her fingers she said youll always be welcome until you get settled down like yes thank you mrs allday he saw her hand on his sleeve and heard her say you dont say much and ive no right to pry but youve carried a deal of worry these past years i can tell she gave his arm a gentle squeeze and sad though it is it isnt the loss of your sister im speaking of he took the workworn hand and kissed it it smelt of fruit and flour she stood beside her brother and watched allday hoist the lieutenants chests into the trap as the pony clattered across the yard out of the inns shadow and into the bright april sunlight she said wretchedly oh john why must it be her brother also called john wondered if she were speaking to him he said quietly you told him yet she shook her head it wouldnt be fair it wouldnt be right she laid her hand across her apron hell have enough to worry about fighting them yankees i wont have him fretting over me at the same time she smiled sides i dont know for sure do i bit late in life to have a babe of my own her brother put his arm around her youll be brave lass unis shaded her eyes but the trap had vanished beyond the hedgerow where some swifts were performing like darts she said suddenly my god john ill miss him so he saw her sudden determination and was proud of her but ill not let on or make a big show of it she thought of the gravefaced lieutenant with the tawny eyes allday had told her that avery had read her letters for him she had been deeply touched especially now that she knew the lieutenant better there was a woman behind his sadness she was certain of it perhaps when he read her letters to allday he was pretending they had been written to him someone called from the inn and she tidied her hair before going to serve him ill go lass you stay an dream a while she smiled it was like the sun breaking through cloud no ill deal with him you chop some wood she glanced again at the empty road itll blow cold off the river tonight then she squared her shoulders and marched through the door the man uppermost in her thoughts sat in the back of the trap one leg swinging above the narrow road while he watched the passing countryside he had known leaving would be hard some dogs were rounding up sheep in one field and he thought of his time as a sheepminder when phalarope had put a pressgang ashore on pendower and caught several men who were trying to keep their distance including me nobody had realised that the frigates young captain was a local man born and raised in falmouth before being packed off to sea like all the other bolithos a lot of water since then young adam a successful frigate captain himself now he sighed remembering how his own son had quit the navy and gone to settle in the promised land of america it still hurt him it always would the way his son had turned away from him instead of continuing as adams coxswain and now richard bolitho was a full admiral an im an admirals coxswain as i promised him flag at the main time he thought troubled by its swift passage where did it all go avery was also watching the scenery but he was thinking of unis alldays words a deal of worry how did she know two farm workers plodding in the opposite direction waved and yelled yew give them buggers a quiltin avery raised his hat to them remembering bolithos bitter words when they had joined the unhappy valkyrie at plymouth what did men like these care who they were going to fight dutch french or dons it was all the same to them so long as their bellies were full and they did not have to go to sea or follow the drum what did it signify to them he gave a wry smile i am becoming cynical like sir richard to take his mind off it he twisted round and looked at his companion youve a fine wife allday i envy you alldays eyes crinkled then well have to do something about that wont we sir avery smiled easily he would never have believed it possible for this kind of relationship to exist within the rigid strictures of the navy allday asked you sorry to leave sir avery thought about it and remembered his sisters last desperate embrace if only i had known he shook his head no theres nobody to leave allday studied him most people would think lieutenant avery had all that a man could need aide to englands most famous sailor with all the chances of rank and prizemoney denied to others but in fact he had nothing he was both surprised and saddened by his discovery and said awkwardly perhaps you would have the goodness to write a letter for me once we weighs anchor sir averys clear eyes settled on him it was like seeing a man reaching for a lifeline it would be an honour he almost added old friend catherine somervell was crossing the yard with a sheaf of flowers over one arm when they arrived she shaded her eyes and watched as they climbed from the trap why mr averyand john allday i was not expecting two such important visitors she held out her hand and avery took it not like sillitoe she thought nor like the prince regent either he kissed it and she sensed his hesitancy he was still uncertain about something perhaps herself and her relationship with bolitho it was possible that she would never know she greeted allday with affection why john allday i swear you have filled out a little good food and affection do wonders for a man body and soul allday said uneasily i have to get back mlady but tomorrow she said ah yes tomorrow we shall have to make the best of it from an upstairs window bolitho watched them his kate walking between the two uniforms she looked so at ease with them so right he thought of her in the night the eager desperation of one for the other love passion and the unspoken dread of parting a shaft of sunlight pierced through the leaves in the light offshore breeze and he put his hand to his eye as if it had been stung holding one hand over it he looked again and after a few seconds his vision seemed to clear and sharpen it must be the effect of the drops the doctor had given him beneath the windows she turned between two of the most important men in his life she was as tall as avery and perhaps a little taller than allday she must have felt his eyes upon her she looked up searching his face perhaps sensing what had just happened she held up the flowers and blew him a kiss but all he heard was her voice on the wind dont leave me captain james tyacke stood by the quarterdeck rail and watched the throng of bustling figures which to any ignorant landsman would seem like chaos he laid one sunburned hand on the rail and was surprised to see it so still even though his whole body seemed to be trembling with an excitement he had rarely known it was not recklessness not exactly but he had had to discover what his ship and his unknown company could do shortly after indomitable had hoisted anchor and successfully beat clear of the sound the wind had risen slightly and by the time she had been laid on her new southwesterly course downchannel spray was bursting over the beakhead soaking even the upper yards where dazed and uncertain figures were being pushed and dragged from one task to the next lieutenant scarlett had ventured we are thirty hands short sir tyacke had given him a brief glance in a seafight we could lose that many in minutes ii know sir tyacke had retorted sharply i know you know but most of these people do not so get the hands aloft and make all plain sail as the wind and quartersea had mounted the indomitable big though she was had seemed to bound from trough to trough like the lion she followed spray and spindrift pouring from the bulging canvas like tropical rain tyacke had glanced at the sailingmaster his slategrey hair flapping in the wind his arms folded as he watched his helmsmen and masters mates he had felt his captains scrutiny and looked up his eyes gleaming as he had called she can do it sir tyacke had seen scarlett and daubeny the second lieutenant clinging to the stays and staring at him he said stunsls mr scarlett like giant ears the studdingsails were eventually run out from their yards men slithering and clutching wildly for handholds now as he looked up at the squared yards and furled sails at the gulls circling noisily around the ship hoping for scraps he was amazed by what he had done what they had all managed to do one way or the other every spar had held although he had seen the great mainyard bending like an archers bow under the tremendous pressure of wind here and there cordage had parted snapping above the din like musket shots but that was not uncommon with new ropes and halliards the stretched and seasoned rigging had taken all the strain with no complaint save the clatter and bang of flapping canvas tyacke walked to the taffrail and back again that was it why indomitable was so different from any other ship it was her power through the water even in half a gale the noise frightening to the untrained landmen had been exhilarating with each great plunge into sunburst clouds of spray it had been staggering a sound he could liken to a great gale through a forest menacing and then rising to a wild shriek of triumph isaac york the master had claimed they had logged some fifteen knots when under those conditions most vessels would have been tempted to shorten sailor if undermanned to lieto under reefed topsails until it was all over as they had closed with the land tyacke had touched the first lieutenants arm and was certain he had started with alarm shorten sail if you please mr scarlett he saw the other mans confusion thinking perhaps he had misunderstood the order tyacke had pointed at the larboard battery of twentyfourpounders you decide if we fight and i should fall you will command here can you do it scarlett had stared at him there had been a lot of coastal shipping moving in and out of the harbour and the distance between the two headlands pendennis point and st anthony had probably looked no wider than a farm gate but with york close by scarlett had not hesitated on the starboard tack with all sails clewed up except topsails and jib indomitable must have made an impressive entrance but now safely at anchor he might well ask himself why he had done it even if scarlett had collided with another vessel or put the ship aground the responsibility would lie with her captain as it should scarlett was here again all secure sir very well sway out the barge and put my coxn in charge he almost smiled i have no doubt that allday will bring the barge back himself he saw no understanding on scarletts face like these others the legend had passed him by he would be part of it soon enough he heard a yelp of pain and saw a man hurrying forward holding his shoulder where a boatswains mate had obviously struck him with his starter nearby the junior lieutenant philip protheroe stood watching the land he had ignored the incident tyacke said remind that young man of what i said when i took command an officer must be obeyed he must also set an example unwittingly his hand had gone to his disfigured face even if you have been badly used it does not give you the right to abuse others who cannot answer back scarlett said i understand sir he said curtly i am glad to know it he watched the new greenpainted barge being hoisted and swayed over the starboard gangway and then lowered slowly into the water alongside and beckoned to the gun captain who had been chosen for his coxswain he was a short completely square man with a puggy face and a chin so blue it must defy every razor you over here the man bounded over and knuckled his forehead aye sir your name is fairbrother right bit of a mouthful in times of haste the man stared at him tis the only one i got sir tyacke said first name well eli sir right then eli take the barge to the stairs wait until they arrive however long it takes from the corner of his eye he saw a boatswains chair being lowered from the mainyard for lady catherine somervell he had no doubt in his mind he sensed the curiosity around him some of these men had not been with a woman for over a year perhaps longer what would they have thought had they seen that same catherine somervell being hauled aboard larne wet through in her seamans shirt he knew he himself would never forget he looked around the harbour he had not been in falmouth for many years it had not changed the brooding castle on one headland and the big st mawes battery on the opposite one it would take a bold captain to try to cut out a sheltering merchantman here he thought tyacke beckoned to the harassed first lieutenant again i want all the boats in the water send the purser ashore in one he did not miss scarletts sudden interest as many fresh vegetables as he can find fruit too if he can get it its possible with the dons being so friendly nowadays scarlett did not miss the sarcasm and i want captain du cann to have his marines in a guardboat with a picket or two on the nearest land in case some poor wretch tries to run he spoke without emotion and yet scarlett sensed that his new captain felt a certain sympathy for those who were so tempted boat approaching sir that was lieutenant john daubeny officerofthewatch tyacke called to a midshipman his mind groping for his name over here lad he took a telescope from the rack and rested it on the youths shoulder it came to him his name was essex the one appointed to take over the duties of pursers clerk the boat and contents swam into focus he quickly recognised the round shoulders of yovell sir richards faithful servant the boat also contained chests and packingcases and the beautifully carved winecooler which catherine had given to bolitho to replace her original gift now lying on the seabed with hyperion scarlett was saying as though almost to himself it will be strange not being a private ship any more tyacke closed the glass with a snap thank you mr essex you are exactly the right height the youth was nervous but pleased tyacke saw him drop his eyes rather than look at him he said heavily strange for me also mr scarlett he watched the boat come alongside hockenhull the squat boatswain leaping down with some of his men to unload it tyacke glanced up to the top of the mainmast an admirals flag how do i feel but it would not come to him neither pride nor uncertainty it was something already decided like a storm at sea or a first broadside only fate would determine the outcome sir sir the barge is bearing off tyacke gazed along the upper deck all the confusion had gone now this was a shipofwar not so loud mr essex he said youll awaken the sheep some of the seamen nearby grinned tyacke turned aside it was another small beginning clear lower deck mr scarlett man the side if you please boatswains mates and sideboys in illfitting white gloves assembled followed by the tramp of boots as the guard of honour fell in by the entry port their lieutenant david merrick looking like an actor in an unfamiliar role then the officers warrant officers and captain du cann standing in his perfectly tailored scarlet coat with several marines and a squad of young fifers and drummers tyacke saw a midshipman below the massive mainmast with its surrounding girdle of boardingpikes the flag was expertly folded over the youths shoulder done by more experienced fingers than his own tyacke thought he lifted a glass again and sensed midshipman essexs eagerness to assist him but he would share none of it this time she was dressed in deep green as he had somehow known she would be with a broad straw hat tied under her chin with a matching ribbon beside her bolitho sat with his sword between his legs one hand lying close to but not touching hers the flaglieutenant was with them and at the tiller he saw alldays powerful figure tyackes own coxswain beside him stand by with the boatswains chair one small fifer moistened his lips and a drummer boy gripped his sticks exactly as he had been taught at the barracks the sideboys had gone down the side ready to assist the lady passenger into the chair there would be many eyes watching her today the rumours the gossip the slander and the indisputable courage after the loss of the golden plover tyacke heard the distant bellow oarsup allday seemed very calm as always like twin lines of bones the dripping oars rose and steadied even as the bowman hooked on to the mainchains the tackle squeaked and two seamen swung the chair above the gangway belay that tyacke knew scarlett was watching him his face full of questions but he no longer cared she was looking up at him her hair breaking from beneath her hat while she rested one hand on sir richards shoulder she was laughing then she took off her shoes and handed them to avery before reaching out for the guideropes and staring straight up at the gilded entry port allday was looking anxious avery too but she waited for the right moment before stepping out on to the thick wooden stairs which curved into the ships tumblehome spaced apart for a seaman but hardly for a lady tyacke held his breath until he saw her head and sir richards cocked hat appear above the top stair royal marines present arms the flash of bayonets and the usual cloud of pipeclay rising from the slings the shrill of boatswains calls earsplitting at close quarters bolitho raised his hat to the quarterdeck his eyes resting only briefly on the white ensign curling from its staff then he turned to face forward then he said a moment if you please in the silence he held out his hand to support her so that avery could kneel and replace catherines shoes he saw the smudge of tar on her foot and a bad snare in her stocking as she straightened up their eyes met and tyacke saw what passed between them the love but above all the triumph then the fifes and drums broke into heart of oak only then did bolitho look up at the mainmast as the flag was run smartly to the truck where it broke immediately to the wind somehow he knew that catherine was near to tears with all society against them they had achieved this and they were together he stared at the flag until his eyes watered or was that his own emotion his flag the cross of st george there was cheering too but not because of the flag or the honour of the occasion it was because of her the sailors woman who had come amongst them to show that she at least cared for them and for her man the din subsided and catherine curtsied to tyacke before saying you look very well james tyacke then as he reached out to take her hand she lifted her face and kissed him on the cheek you are so welcome here then she looked over the rail at the silent watching sailors and marines they will not let you down she could have been speaking to either of them tyacke thought or to the ship indomitable like a troubled sea richard bolitho sat on the long leather bench seat at the foot of the tall stern windows and watched the sea heaving and breaking astern the ship was no longer quivering to the squeak and rumble of gun trucks and he guessed that lieutenant scarlett had decided to discontinue yet another drill and await better weather while the crews recovered their strength sail and gun drill tyacke had exercised all hands within a day of leaving falmouth he had seen tyacke glancing at him as though to know his opinion whenever he had taken a walk on the quarterdeck but bolitho had left him to his own devices it was difficult enough for him as it was without interfering or making suggestions he felt the timbers bite into his shoulder as the ship plunged into another long trough every stay and spar creaking to the pressure it was late afternoon and the watch would be changing soon he glanced at the unfinished letter on his table and imagined her face when she opened it whenever that might be unless they met with a friendly homebound vessel the letter was likely to be put ashore in antigua he massaged his forehead and pictured her as she had gone down the side in falmouth that time in a boatswains chair as he had insisted they had cheered her again when she had been assisted into his barge with allday and avery to see her safely ashore only she had known the pain their parting had given him equally she had realised that by coming aboard into his world no matter how briefly she had made such a difference for all the men who were sailing into the unknown six days out from falmouth and a thousand miles already logged this night they would pass the azores and cross the th parallel of latitude southbysouthwest and further still he stared at the sea again sharkblue with long ranks of yellowtoothed breakers indomitable was taking it well and smashed over every obstacle with a kind of arrogance he had rarely seen before many of the new hands raw to the navy and its brutal indifference had either been seasick or knocked senseless when the pitching deck caught them unawares and flung them against unyielding guns or stanchions but they would learn they had no choice bolitho had noticed that tyacke was always on deck whenever drills were being carried out or some violent change of tack sent the topmen swarming aloft leaving the landmen and marines to man the braces and trim the great yards while the wind roared around them he had heard scarlett call after a particularly hard exercise at the larboard battery better that time sir and tyackes blunt reply not good enough mr scarlett it took twelve minutes to clear for action i want it done in eight six days how different from those times when he had been so eager to get to grips with the enemy any enemy that their lordships dictated he thought suddenly of the moment when indomitable had weathered the headland to find open water in the channel catherine had said nothing of her plans but he had known she was watching him he had snatched a telescope from the rack and steadied it carefully while the ship had leaned over stiffly in the offshore wind below the point where the cliffs dropped to the rocks and the tiny beaches were then covered by the tide she had been there her hair blowing unheeded in the wind one hand holding tamaras bridle while she levelled a small glass on the slowmoving ship she would have seen indomitable come to life sails being freed from every yard and sheeted home so that they bulged like steel breastplates she would have seen it all would have watched the spray leaping beneath the snarling lion while indomitable carried her man away beyond touch each denied to the other in her own way she had given an example to tyackes watching sailors showing that she knew how they felt and that she shared the same pain of separation then the land had crept out and bolitho had handed the telescope to a staring midshipman he had seen the boys awe and had said quietly aye mr arlington mark it well the other price of war the midshipman had not understood but it must have made a good tale in the gunroom how the admiral had confided in him ozzard tapped at the door and entered silently may i lay for supper at seven bells sir thank you yes crossing the first bridge he would dine with both tyacke and avery tonight he glanced around the cabin at least here were familiar furnishings the mahogany sideboard and dining table tugging occasionally at their lashings whenever the tiller head gave a particularly violent jerk kates fine winecooler and beyond in the smaller sleeping compartment he could just see the two new dressingchests and mirror catherine had insisted on buying for him ozzard stood in his usual stooped position his hands held molelike in his apron he seemed ill at ease but these days that was nothing new as he had with allday bolitho had offered him his freedom to stay behind in safety at the house in falmouth but ozzard had always refused apparently determined to remain as his trusted servant for as long as he was needed not that he liked the sea he was openly terrified whenever they had been called to battle it was as if he served not out of duty or straightforward loyalty but as some kind of penance he heard the sentry shout captain sir tyacke entered his lean body angled to the extreme slope of the deck i hope i am not disturbing you sir bolitho waved him to a chair of course not is something wrong tyacke glanced around the cabin as if he were seeing it for the first time i cant say for certain sir bolitho gave him time to assemble his thoughts you have been on deck for most of the day james will you take a glass with me tyacke seemed about to refuse then reconsidered and nodded perhaps the casual use of his christian name had taken him by surprise at noon sir when our young gentlemen were shooting the sun one of them craigie was skylarking the master sent him aloft to mend his manners he took a glass of cognac from ozzard and examined it thoughtfully bolitho watched him mastheading was a common enough punishment used to curb a midshipmans high spirits he had endured it himself for him it had been worse than for most as he had always hated heights the way indomitable was leaning over on the starboard tack would be enough to teach anyone a lesson but it was hardly something to concern the captain enough to bring him aft tyacke looked at him and gave a slight smile i know sir we all went through it the smile vanished mr craigie is not the brightest of stars but he is blessed with good eyesight he did not see or seem to see the flicker of emotion on bolithos face there is a sail to the noreast sir when he told the officerof thewatch a glass was sent aloft it was a sail right enough he lifted his goblet and the ship is still there maybe a trivial matter but i thought you should know bolitho rubbed his chin and on the same tack never changes sir what dyou think james tyacke seemed surprised that he should be asked whoever it is might take us for a liner with our rig he stroked the arm of his chair by god hed get a surprise if this lady turned on him it was like hearing somebody else the voice of pride how tyacke had spoken of his larne could we catch him dyou think bolitho watched tyackes expression calculating seeking conclusions strange that they had already given the unknown vessel a character of its own ill need three days more sir then if the weather holds we should be picking up the northeast trades thatll give us power to come about and catch him he paused almost hesitantly i know this is faster than any brig sir but ive done it with larne when some crafty slaver tried to spy out our intentions bolitho realised that it was the first time tyacke had mentioned his last command since indomitable had broken out his flag at the main what do you think of the people james are they coming together as one company instead of answering tyacke stood up with your permission sir then he opened the big skylight his hair ruffling in the sudden breeze theyre standing easy ive worked them hard day in day out since i took command in plymouth they may loathe me fear me i know not which nor must i allow myself to care good men and scum side by side gallowsbait and mothers boys his mouth softened as he said now sir you listen to them bolitho joined him beneath the skylight and peered up at the straining mizzen topsail far above them they were singing men offwatch and idlers resting on deck after a long hard day it was one of dibdins songs sometimes used by shantymen when a ship was being hauled up to her anchor in readiness to weigh this life is like a troubled sea wear helm or weather all alee wear helm or weather all alee the ship will neither stay nor wear but drive of every rock in fear of every rock in fear it was as though catherine were here as she had been in the longboat when she had urged allday to sing to raise their spirits when all had seemed lost tyacke was still watching him his eyes very blue and steady he said your lady understood sir he closed the skylight and gave the lusty voices back to the sounds of sea and wind they will not let you down bolitho touched the locket which she had fastened around his neck before they had parted i shall take it from you when you come to me as my lover again he made up his mind so be it then james when the trades are good to us well go and snare that cunning fox and discover what he is about tyacke picked up his hat ill see you at supper sir and thank you for what tyacke shrugged justthank you sir then he was gone ozzard entered the cabin and glanced around without curiosity as bolitho returned to the skylight and opened it they will not let you down nor i you but the singing had stopped captain adam bolitho strode through the dockyard his hat tugged down on his forehead against the lively breeze from the sound he glanced past hurrying seamen and dockyard workers to the wall where larne had been moored to complete her overhaul and beyond to the glittering sea itself now reflecting the afternoon sunlight like a million flashing mirrors from this place indomitable had weighed anchor for falmouth in his heart he knew he had wanted to go aboard before she had made sail to wish tyacke good fortune but convention had held him back although tyacke was older than he he was still very junior in rank he was also aware that tyacke might have misconstrued his visit or considered it patronising it was better to leave him to find his own way and make his own mistakes without critical eyes or wellmeaning advice adam admired tyacke greatly next to his uncle he had encountered no greater strength of character nor higher courage in any man he half smiled bolitho must have had a quiet word with the port admiral on his behalf anemone had been desperately shorthanded after her battle with the privateers death and mutilation had taken a heavy toll but when she quit plymouth this time her company would be almost complete again bolitho must have asked for more men scum they might be many would otherwise have been hanged or deported but firm discipline and fair treatment would soon change that the hard men who would never break adam would take on himself to train they often proved to be the best sailors especially those who had never known anything but poverty and oppression he tightened his jaw but if they did not respond to training and example he would change them in other ways he thought of his three lieutenants all had seen action before but only one had ever served in a frigate to adam the navy was divided down the middle there were frigates and then there were all the rest the warrant officers were experienced prime seamen of quality again he suspected his uncle had some hand in their acquisition but he did not know any of them as he had his other company perhaps it was better that way he thought of friends he had seen fall in that last seafight of the midshipman for whom he had had such hopes of early promotion the youth had died in his arms his eyes staring up at him until they became fixed and unmoving yes it was better not to become too close he had seen his uncles grief too many times when those dear friends he called his happy few had been killed one by one catherine would be alone now waiting and wondering not daring to hope that it might be over quickly that his uncle might come home safely once again he would put into falmouth and pay his respects to her before taking anemone to join the new squadron in antigua he had no doubt at all that there would be war he had never forgotten the american captain nathan beer now a commodore of his own squadron an impressive man a dangerous adversary he saw the port admirals house with its tower and fine gilded weathervane his would be a quick visit for the sake of courtesy only although it might be difficult to escape the admiral who was known for his bounteous hospitality to the young captains who passed through the dockyard a carriage was just arriving at the house and two others were waiting nearby adam frowned trying to think of some excuse that would allow him to leave the carriage rolled to a halt the horses stamping noisily on the stones as a royal marine ran to open the door and lower the step something fell on the ground and adam picked it up excuse me maam you dropped this he stared past her at the severelooking man who was regarding him as he would an intruder zenoria looked straight into his eyes only a pulse in her throat betraying her outward composure why captain bolitho this is a surprise adam waited for the rebuff fearing she would turn away he offered his hand but she rested hers on the marines white glove instead did you know i would be here he said i did not i swear it she frowned slightly as though warning him this is mr petrie from london she turned to the sharpfaced man may i introduce captain adam bolitho of his britannic majestys ship anemone the man attempted to smile it obviously did not come easily to him zenoria added he is a lawyer captain and he is under instruction to complete the purchase of a suitable house for us here in plymouth her poise and her selfconfidence impressed and surprised him but when she turned from the others he recognised the pain in her eyes the girl with the moonlit eyes bolitho had called her he controlled his own emotion with an effort a harassedlooking lieutenant hurried down the steps i see you have introduced one another he shook his head i am all aback today maam i should have remembered your husband is a great friend of sir richard bolitho he turned to adam i was going to send word to your ship captain inviting you to sup with the admiral but there was no timeyou see sir i understand i was once a flaglieutenant myself relieved the lieutenant led the way up the steps but hesitated when he realised that adam had not followed adam said i am not certain i mean no offence to your admiral after what he has done for my ship he looked at her again no contempt no resentment but there was something i have no desire to intrude she said quickly for my part there is no intrusion do come captain bolitho i hope to see lady catherine while i am in the west country she hesitated again then they were in the large reception room with its vast paintings of seabattles and memorabilia in glass cases a great house where admirals had lived for many years which had never become a home the port admiral a small energetic man with an oldfashioned queue bounced to greet them there were several other officers present and a solitary scarletcoated marine women too with the uncomplaining faces of service wives the admiral took zenorias arm and adam heard him say i hear youre buying boscawen house mdear a fine old place the views are breathtaking huntings good around there too she replied rearadmiral keens father suggested mr petrie should deal with the matter she glanced at the solemn petrie he knows more than i about such things the admiral nodded his eyes running over her like an invisible hand quite so mdear a man of the city he would know not something to trouble your pretty head about she looked across the room until she found adam and her gaze seemed to say help me it was suddenly obvious to him like the house in hampshire and the stifling kindness of keens family nobody had even asked her for her opinion the admiral was saying to the room at large ill be hauling down my flag next yeara quieter appointment for me at the admiralty he gave his short barking laugh i think boscawen house would make the perfect residence for my successor what the others laughed and raised their glasses adam saw her looking nervously around imagining how it might be when valentine keen came home again his father had made no secret of his resentment that keen should prefer the hazardous life of the navy to power and success in the city any more than he would want his grandson to follow keen into the world of sea and ships adam was surprised he had not heard some mention of this appointment he glanced at her slight figure again like a little girl amongst all these people who knew and wanted no other life lost completely lost suppose somebody knew or even suspected the truth he strode to the admirals side caution gone like the wind from a shotriddled sail i beg your pardon sir but may i show rearadmiral keens wife the beautiful garden you have here so long as you behave yourself mlad i know about young frigate captains his barking laugh followed them to the french windows that opened on to a wide terrace which was decorated with large urns of plants as soon as it was possible to speak adam said i am so sorry about this zenoriai really did not know you were here she said nothing and he continued more urgently my ship sails in three days you have nothing to fear from me i wronged you i will never forget i would never have harmed you because her eyes were misty he dared not think there might be kindness in them for him because one word so gently said i have no right she put her hand on his sleeve we should walk but remain in view of the house i know from lady catherines experience how cruel are those who know nothing but envy they walked slowly by the wall her gown touching the saltroughened grass his sword slapping against his thigh then she asked abruptly can you see me with all these clever worldly people she turned to look up at him in truth adam can you he placed his hand over hers and they walked on you will captivate them as you do me he waited expecting her to react angrily reject him as she had in hampshire the last time he had seen her but she said when val returns he will rightly expect me to be proud of his achievements and i want to be equal to his expectations i am proud of him and i have never forgotten what i owe him he said holding her hand against his arm and what about you little mermaid are you owed nothing what if others care she glanced up at him i know you care of course i know i remember what do you remember she was faltering pulling away when i found you in tears adam grieving for sir richard and then i loved you zenoria i shall always love you i want no other she stared at him her eyes frightened stop you must not say such things they halted at the end of the wall and looked at one another for a long moment an old gardener carrying a rake passed them they neither saw nor heard him adam said quietly i am not proud of what i am zenoria but if i could take you from your husband a man i like and greatly admire then i would do it he saw her agitation but did not release his grip i would not hesitate please somebody is coming it was the flaglieutenant the admiral desires you to join the others for refreshments afterwards there will be a recital his eyes moved between them but were without curiosity adam offered his arm and they walked slowly back towards the house shall i leave zenoria she shook her head her profile suddenly very determined no talk to me about your shipanything dyou understand but do not reveal your heart again like that he said i still have your glove something to say to control his need of her keep it for me her voice was husky think of me sometimes will you always i love you zenoria they reentered the house in silence the admiral raised his eyebrows god swamp you captain bolitho i thought you had spirited her away she curtsied as if to conceal the colour in her cheeks only little mermaids can do that sir their eyes met across the table nothing could ever be the same again dreams the figures standing around the quarterdeck and grouped by the big doublewheel were still only shadows revealed but without personality against the pale planking john allday waited by the hammock nettings and glanced at the lightening sky it would be dawn very soon the few stars beyond the topgallant yards were fainter than when he had last looked then by daylight they would know if the captain and sailingmaster had judged it correctly the whole ships company had been standingto since the early hours peering around in the darkness trying to remember who was where seeking out friends perhaps or maybe looking out for a boatswains mate ready to use his starter on anyone who was slow to move when the orders came james tyacke was pacing from one side of the broad quarterdeck to the other suppose daylight found indomitable with the ocean to herself it would be a bad beginning for him as captain allday thought he felt the wind against his neck and shivered it had shifted as york had predicted the ship was as closehauled as she would bear the canvas cracking overhead losing the wind until the vigilant helmsmen brought her back under command again allday heard someone speaking hoarsely to eli fairbrother the gun captain selected to be the captains coxswain he moved into the deeper shadows by the nettings he was in no mood to chat with the man he might prove to be a good hand given time but at the moment he was so overwhelmed by his unexpected promotion that he would not stop talking about it allday glanced up again into the darkness he could see some of the shrouds and ratlines now and far above a flapping white movement like a seabird trapped in the rigging the admirals flag at the mainmast truck all the years the pain and the danger friends and enemies wiped away lost like smoke in the wind to serve with bolitho had been all he had ever wanted needed they had both taken a few bad knocks over their years together and allday had shared the best and the worst of it his oak bolitho called him and the name meant much to allday it gave him a sense of belonging that few jacks were lucky enough to enjoy now they were off again he rubbed his chest where the spanish blade had nearly killed him always the pain sir richard with his wounded eye he needed his oak more than ever now he sighed but now there was unis ever since indomitable had put out from falmouth he had thought of her in so short a while unis had become precious so dear to him once he might have laughed at anybody else who had claimed such an attachment not any more even ozzard who was quick to find fault with most women had held his peace it had been a difficult parting ferguson had come over to fallowfield with his little trap to collect him they had agreed it would be better so instead of saying goodbye in falmouth he couldnt bear the thought of leaving her like all those other women who sometimes stood for hours days even to stare at some manofwar in the hope of catching a glimpse of their loved ones he had held her very gently with her he was always gentle protective careful not to offend and she had pressed her face into his blue coat ill not break john harder hold me harderthen kiss me and go then she had looked up at his face as if to hold every detail i love ee john allday youve brought peace and purpose to my life allday had said awkwardly ive not much to offer my lass but ill be back you see if im not ill not forgive you if you stay away then there had been tears on her cheeks and she had dashed them away angry with herself now be off with you then she had hesitated as if uncertain what to do what is it lass she had answered i put a few things in your bag i dont want you depending on ships victuals then she stood on tiptoe and kissed him hard on the mouth ill pray for you john allday had grasped the side of the trap he knew she could not see him even though she was smiling and waving her eyes were blinded by tears he had found himself beside ferguson and the trap had moved away once he had looked back unis had been staring at the road while the old hyperion inn sign swung relentlessly above her head he thought she had been going to tell him something when lieutenant avery read her next letter to him maybe she would explain what it was all ferguson had said was youre a lucky man john allday heard voices nearby the admiral was coming up he heard the new coxswain fairbrother exclaim an not only that but the capn calls me by my first name allday sighed again lucky when i could be with unis he stared into the dark water alongside but for once he could find no comfort in the familiarity of his world bolitho was wearing his old seagoing coat without the proud epaulettes and was hatless he saw allday by the side and asked how goes it today old friend allday glanced towards tyackes coxswain he calls me by my first name he can put that in his pipe and smoke it he answered well enough sir richard bolitho found tyacke by the quarterdeck rail with the first lieutenant allday could hide nothing from him they had been together too long for that he was missing unis the first real love he had ever known as i miss you kate tyacke remarked well soon know sir he turned to the first lieutenant check each mast mr scarlett the lieutenants must be certain of every man in their divisions when we come about even if it takes a mite longer i dont want the ship in irons nor do i want to see anyone lost overboard scarlett had already done it but knew better than to argue or explain as he moved forward along the weather gangway he glanced aloft the flag and masthead pendant were much lighter he thought of tyacke and the admiral beside him so different and yet not so different he saw avery with a telescope tucked under one arm in the wardroom several of the others had tried to pry information out of him concerning the admiral and what he was really like he had seen averys strange tawny eyes flash like a tigers watched him deflect each question like an experienced duellist faces took on shape and identity and then the first pale sunshine ran down the upper spars and revealed to many that the wind had indeed shifted tyacke cupped his hands ready ho figures scampered to braces and halliards while each lieutenant and midshipman checked his men very aware of the two figures silhouetted against the paling sky by the quarterdeck rail put the helm down bolitho could feel the quarterdeck rail quivering under his hand as the straining seamen let go the headsail sheets so that the sails could lose the wind and yet not prevent the ships head from swinging off tacks and sheets scarletts voice boomed through his speakingtrumpet even as the shadowy bows began to stagger into the eye of the wind mainsl haul haul lads put your bloody backs into it hockenhull the squat boatswain sounded fierce but was grinning as the ship around and above him fought to answer the demands of sail and rudder mainsl haul bolitho watched the hands hauling at the braces to swing the great yards around the sails in wild confusion until with something like a roar they refilled and the ship heeled right over canvas taut and bulging lines being turned expertly on to belaying pins while the landmen tried to keep out of everybodys way bolitho shaded his eyes and stared up again big though she was and with a partlytrained company tyacke had brought the ship about to lay her on the opposite tack the helmsman yelled steady she goes sir west by north by an large even he sounded excited and when bolitho looked at york the master he was grinning hugely like a midshipman with a fresh apple pie deck there the masthead lookout the man who saw everything before anyone else bolitho saw tyackes brown hand tighten on the rail if there was anything to see sail fine on the lee bow sir tyacke turned to the signals midshipman aloft with you mr blythe and take a glass with you bolitho said that was well done captain tyacke together they watched the spray bursting over the beakhead tyacke said quietly mr york was right about this ship deck there tyacke smiled already he must have flown up there blythes voice reached them again barque sir shes all aback tyacke said contemptuously trying to make a run for it is he he swung round mr scarlett get the tgallants on her and set the forecourse driver too when the first lieutenant hesitated he snapped lively it is mr scarlett ill not lose the bugger now bolitho saw the flash of resentment in scarletts eyes but this was no time to consider a mans hurt pride tyacke was beckoning to another midshipman craigie the one who had sighted the stranger in the first place find the gunner mr craigie and have him lay aft he fumbled in his coat and bolitho saw the gleam of gold you did well quite well the midshipman stared at the coin in his grubby palm ththank you sir tyackes voice pursued him forward to the main hatchway but next time you skylark on duty the prize had better be worthwhile several of the seamen who were hauling and coiling a confusion of halliards and tackles grinned bolitho smiled if the barque proved to be useless it would no longer matter they had just accomplished something and they had done it as one company richard bolitho opened his eyes and stared at the deckhead his ears and mind taking in the sounds the angle of a small shuttered lantern telling him instantly how indomitable was behaving but for the lantern the cabin was in complete darkness the occasional grumbling clatter of the rudderhead the predominant sound not much wind then two or three times in the night his sailors instinct had awakened him and as usual he had felt a sense of loss at not being up there with the watch on deck when the ship had changed tack yet again he had never lost that feeling and he had often wondered if other flag officers still yearned for the more personal command of a captain he lay with his hands behind his head looking into the darkness it was hard to believe that indomitable would reach antigua tomorrow or if the wind failed them again the next day at the latest even now he knew that the small island of barbuda was less than fifty miles to the northwest part of the natural chain that formed the leeward islands tyacke could be well pleased with his fast passage three weeks from falmouth england to falmouth and english harbour in antigua and they had been uneventful after the early excitement of sighting and boarding blythes barque as it had become known only to discover that although she wore american colours she had been under charter to the british government and had carried nothing more interesting than a mixed cargo of china clay and building materials for port royal in jamaica scarlett had returned fuming with his boarding party because of the charter he had been unable to examine the company for british deserters let alone search the vessel later they had sighted and stopped several vessels of various sizes and flags but apart from a few deserters they had found very little to their advantage it had seemed as though the whole ocean had become a desert and every ship going about her business had somehow avoided them there had been little to do but carry out regular sail and gun drills and as usual inactivity had had its sideeffects outbursts of anger and violence on the lower deck usually between the trained and experienced hands and the amateurs and landmen whom they seemed to delight in provoking the punishment book had made its first appearance and several floggings had been awarded bolitho had known and served in ships where floggings had been too commonplace to mention because a wrong word had been taken for insolence or a captain had cared little for his subordinates methods provided the end results were acceptable but bolitho knew tyacke had felt it badly after his little schooner miranda and the brig larne with their tightlyknit companies the ritual of punishment in a ship of indomitables size had sickened him not that he had lost his determination or pride and neither his wardroom nor the midshipmen were spared the edge of his tongue at the boarding of one schooner avery had accompanied the first lieutenant and afterwards there had been open hostility from scarlett while avery had withdrawn into apparent indifference and been loath to discuss the subject tyacke in his own forceful fashion had uncovered the bones of the matter on board the schooner scarlett had admitted that it was almost impossible to discover the presence of deserters or others taking an illegal passage to escape from the navy as long as individual masters spoke up for them or provided false papers avery who had been told to act only as an observer and not interfere with the first lieutenants procedures had apparently answered that men should be stripped of their shirts for inspection without requesting permission from anybody a sailors back even if he had been flogged but once would carry the scars of the cat to the grave distinctive naval tattoos were another definite way to identify a deepwater sailorman as a kings seaman who had run scarlett had retorted sharply ill trouble you to keep your ideas to yourself sir avery had responded equally coldly and when tyacke had told him later bolitho had been well able to imagine him saying it you can go to hell for all i care hard work perverse winds and sometimes blistering heat each had played a part men used to the english channel and to north sea blockade duties were resentful at being chased through every minute of a drill while the newlypressed hands made mistakes that brought scorn and humiliation in their wake he closed his eyes but sleep defied him it would be dawn soon and land was in sight from the masthead at least exciting many of their company who had never left england before in their lives he thought of the dream which had pursued him almost from the boarding of blythes barque he was not certain how many times it had returned since then but he knew it had never varied and when he had woken only minutes ago he had known somehow that the dream had awakened him even his heart had been pounding something very rare for him unless the dream had become nightmares like the ones in which he had seen catherine being carried away from him her naked body and streaming hair and her terror making him call her name aloud before he had burst out of it the dream was completely different always the same picture the narrow waters of carrick roads in falmouth the murky hump of pendennis castle lying across the starboard bow of the ship flying an admirals flag his flagthe knowledge of that had been quite definite as it so often was in dreams the squadron had been all around him ready to weigh or still shortening their cables about to leave falmouth as he had done so many times without realising it he was out of his cot his bare feet on the decks cool slope and the sudden icy chill of recognition seemed to freeze his whole body even though his brain told him that the cabin was as hot and humid as before the ships of the squadron had all been his own undine sparrow and phalarope black prince and hyperion there had even been the topsail cutter avenger in which he had served under his brother hugh the realisation was unnerving and he knew that the dream would return yet again what did it mean what had brought all those familiar ships to falmouth only to depart and which one had he been on board at the time he felt indomitable shiver the awakening rattle of rigging and blocks a freshening breeze there was the responding slap of bare feet overhead brief orders to send the watch to braces and halliards and retrim the great yards and contain the wind once more he saw them in his mind figures in the darkness the helmsmen as they felt the spokes in their hands their eyes peering aloft to seek out the shaking sail or the small gauge nearby so that they could discover the winds true direction perhaps it would be better after antigua once he knew what awaited him the total responsibility for him there had been too much time to brood to consider the various courses of action for which he would be praised or abused by the faroff admiralty he even wondered if avery regretted having accepted this appointment or if tyacke had only changed his mind out of sympathy he felt the deck lift and slide across a trough she was moving again he reached the main cabin and groped his way right aft to the tall windows he managed to open one of the quarter shutters which within hours would be packed with blown saltspray no moon but there were plenty of stars to make the ships wake sparkle how would he feel at english harbour where he and catherine had found each other again she would be remembering it too the house above the harbour their love which had driven even sanity to the winds he felt the damp air around his body and wondered what his seamen and marines would think if they saw him now dressed only in a loose pair of white trousers in case he was needed i am playing the captain again his thoughts returned to the barque her name was la perla and she was registered at boston his mind shied away from it the enemy her master had denied that he had been deliberately following this ship he smiled to himself the old indom as the onelegged cook troughton had called her the master had insisted that he had every right in the world to be where he was but he had obviously been surprised by indomitables speed and agility and like some others he had mistaken her for the ship of the line she had once been he touched the thick glass what tales could she tell how many hundreds of feet had trod these decks what ambitions and failures had lived here he heard whispers and then a door opened somehow he knew it was ozzard before he could smell the coffee thought you were about sir richard his small figure seemed to glide down towards him as the helm went over yet again thisll do you good ozzard always knew perhaps he could rarely sleep himself the coffee was excellent he could see her again in the shop in st jamess street choosing the coffee with the care she showed for everything for me he found his watch secured to his seagoing coat and held it against the shuttered lantern so many memories dearest kate there was about four hours difference between them a spring morning in falmouth the air filled with birdsong and the hum of bees and always the salt tang of the sea perhaps she was out visiting nancy and her husband the king of cornwall or perhaps she was changing after an early ride standing by the tall chevalglass disrobing as he had seen her do a prelude to love in that same room he put the empty coffeecup on the deck where it would be safe from any sudden gust and climbed once more into his cot he imagined that it was a little lighter in the adjoining great cabin and recalled when she had come to him in the night on another occasion dazed with sleep he had gone to her and had kissed her but her lips had been like ice and when he had called her name he had realised that too had been a dream but even across the ocean he had heard her cry out dont leave me he closed his eyes and felt something like peace for the first time since indomitable had weighed the phantom squadron did not return the small carriage rattled along a straight wellkept road the hampshire countryside laid out in fresh square fields of green and yellow like part of a giant patchwork quilt it was early still but when she lowered the window zenoria could hear the trilling evensong of thrushes interrupted occasionally by the harsh croak of crows they would reach keens family home within half an hour and as always she thought with apprehension of the reception she would get from his sisters she had visited the proposed new house at plymouth three times and on each occasion the lawyer petrie had accompanied her he was dozing now on the seat beside her even he was finding the journeys and negotiations with the land agents in plymouth more than tiring she watched the passing fields and the darker patches of trees on the edge of the new forest in a day or so she would go with petrie to london vals father thought that a man in his position should have a town house as well he had never meant to offend her quite the opposite but he made no secret of the fact that he believed women had no place in matters of property and business and he probably thought that she had no idea at all of what might be expected of her he had hinted of further promotion for val and every likelihood of a title and once out of the navy a firm and prosperous place with him in the city as she had wandered through room after room in the vastness of boscawen house in plymouth her mind had been unable to accept it the entire house and spacious gardens filled with servants and workers who would watch her every move discuss her behind her back perhaps laugh at her attempts to entertain her betters she had lost her temper only once when petrie had explained that there was really no need for her to tire herself with visiting the great empty house or looking through deeds and past amendments she had said sharply i would remind you that it will be my house too mr petrie i am also one of the family he had studied her not unkindly and had replied it will be a new and very different experience for you mrs keen there will be many who will envy you if you will excuse my impertinence you are a very fortunate young lady married to one of englands heroes who will i know do all he can to make your life a happy one she had felt suddenly weary of it i know mr petrie he is a good man and i owe him much if petrie knew what she meant he had given no sign if only she had had time to visit catherine at falmouth she felt something like a hand on her heart the day proposed for the london visit was the sixth of june it was as if adam were here with her it had been on that day that she had kissed him and he had given her some wild roses from beside the track where was adam now had he joined his uncle or would he be ordered to vals squadron instead the thought brought colour to her cheeks two who loved her and yet neither could speak of it she could remember his searching gaze at the port admirals supper in plymouth could it really be two months ago the hand on her arm his expression so intense but tender in the way she had never forgotten i love you zenoria the carriage slowed on the last rise before the final approach to the keen estate and farmland she heard the clink of metal as the guard unholstered his pistols it was pleasant peaceful countryside so unlike the wild rocky coast of her cornwall but there were dangers here nevertheless deserters living rough and stealing what they could footpads highwaymen it was not a road on which to travel unprepared petrie stirred and adjusted his spectacles ah nearly home i see she had not realised he was awake a tiring week mr petrie for us both he nodded sagely it is good of your husbands family to allow me to stay in the house mrs keen it saves a good deal of time money too yes as i am allowed to stay here also she turned to the window again so that he should not see her face she could smell the flowers and the hedgerows like perfume but not cornwall she tried not to think of the last time adam had come to this house how she had berated him blamed him for what had happened then hating herself for the things she had said she had run to the front door to call him back but the road this road had been empty perhaps while she was in london she might see something he would like a small present no it would be cruel a temptation which she could never honour the tall iron gates were open and with sudden energy the two horses quickened their pace and she saw a groom hurrying to meet them keens familys country house was an awesome building which never failed to overwhelm her petrie shifted his legs and said i see you have another visitor my dear he did not see her sudden anxiety he was contemplating the supper they would provide for him she said in a small voice not a visitor then he did look at her the way her hand had gone to her throat she said i recognise the carriage it is the doctor she waited for the horses to wheel round in front of the broad steps before being braked to a halt the big double doors opened as if they had been waiting for this very moment although it was still a bright summers evening there were chandeliers alight everywhere and zenoria saw vals sister and her husband standing in the great marble hallway like players poised in the wings all at once she was running heedless of one shoe which had caught in the step and fallen on the driveway then she saw the doctor a tall grey man with an outthrust lower lip he seized her as she tried to pass him he had a grip like iron be brave mrs keen i did all that i could we all did she heard a scream her own calling his name perran perran she tore herself free and ran to the open windows and stared out at the wellcut grass and formal flower beds where her little son would sit and play with his nurse or vals bereaved sister she peered blindly at the tall shadows which were already crossing the lawn dear god perran but only the startled crows replied she heard someone cry quick hold her then there was nothing the mark of satan lady catherine somervell allowed herself to be guided to some cane chairs and a table arranged in the shadow of one of roxbys big oaks pleased that she had thought to bring a pair of shoes to exchange for her ridingboots she sat down and adjusted her widebrimmed hat to keep the sunlight from her eyes while bolithos sister nancy directed a servant to bring tea it was a lovely summer day the air full of birdsong and insects and the sounds of men haying in the adjoining fields nancy said im pleased for lewis of coursehes such a dear and never says a harsh word to me she chuckled not within earshot in any case but really can you imagine my feelings when they bow and call me mlady she reached out impulsively for you it is different catherine but i shall never get used to it she glanced across to the stone terrace where roxby was studying some plans with two visitors lewis adores it as you can see he never stops now hes discussing the folly he wants built can you credit it catherine let her chatter on while the table was being laid summer in cornwall how perfect it could be if only he were here he had been away so long and there was still no word she had read in the newspapers that some of the mailpackets had been attacked and plundered might their letters have gone astray she looked up and found nancy watching her what is it my dear nancy smiled i worry about you and i miss him toohe is my brother after all she sat down comfortably spreading her skirts is something else troubling you catherine shrugged how pretty richards younger sister must have been pretty and fair like their mother richard spoke to me about his daughter it is her birthday quite soon there is nothing you can do catherine belinda would never allow her to accept a gift or anything else i know i do not want to see her anyway when i think of what she tried to do how she intended to hurt richard i know the true meaning of hate she took the cup offered to her and sipped the tea conscious of the suns warmth on the one shoulder turned to its light she hoped her fatigue did not show in her eyes she had been sleeping badly sometimes hardly at all every night she dreamed or thought of richard imagined him coming into the room and touching her arousing her and yet every day increased the distance between them as if the ocean had swallowed the ship and all aboard her he was still with her even though the seas divided them so that she found herself unwilling to visit people even to discuss the collier brig and the daytoday running of the estate with bryan ferguson not that he needed her help she thought of the other faces she knew and loved valentine keen last heard of at cape town adam who had called briefly to see her before sailing to join his uncle allday and tyacke avery and the portly yovell at least they had one another to sustain them she heard roxbys resonant voice bidding his visitors farewell she watched him as he strolled across the lawn his hands in his breeches pockets he loved riding and blood sports but his fondness for good living was exacting a toll she hoped that nancy had noticed and would use her influence to good effect his face was very red and it was all too apparent that he was breathing with difficulty as if he had read her thoughts he dragged out a large handkerchief and mopped his streaming face sir lewis roxby knight of the hanoverian guelphic order landowner and magistrate described in london as a friend of the prince of wales he had come a long way for the son of a local farmer roxby waved the tea aside something a bit stronger for me mdear catherines still waiting for a letter lewis roxby nodded gravely bad business understand how you feel his eyes took in her sunbrowned shoulder the proud or perhaps defiant manner in which she held her head he had heard all about her boarding his brotherinlaws flagship at falmouth up the side like a powdermonkey to raise cheers even from the pressed men whose fate would be in richards hands what a woman he thought with dislike of nancys sister felicity she would have something vicious to say about it mercifully she did not come to the house very often now with her stupid son and when she did call roxby was careful to keep away in case he lost his temper again he said hell be home before you know it mdear he punched the back of his chair by god hell soon drub those damn yankees as he did baratte nancy held up one hand something she rarely did to her husband now lewis dont agitate yourself so catherine saw the quick exchange so she had noticed it was just as well roxby grinned ill go and fetch a drink for meself he shook his head i dont know you women he walked away heavily and catherine watched as nancy gestured for fresh tea how different her life might have been had she been allowed time to fall in love with richards young friend martyn when they had both been midshipmen together here she had comfort and respect and she did not have to lie awake at night listening to the wind or the boom of surf below the cliffs but nancy was a sea officers daughter and the sister of englands most famous living sailor she might still have preferred that other life she saw nancy look up surprised roxby was coming back from the house carrying a sealed envelope with a perplexed expression on his face in those remaining seconds catherine realised he had even neglected to bring himself the promised drink nancy stood up what is it roxby stared at them not sure mdear it was sent to your house catherine special courier catherine felt her heart leap like a pain then she said let me see she took the envelope seeing at a glance that it carried a crest which was vaguely familiar but she did not recognise the handwriting roxby had drawn close to his wifes side and had put his arm around her shoulders he could feel the tension like something hostile an enemy catherine looked up at both of them it is from valentine keens father he thought i should be told without any delay val and zenorias child is dead it was an accident suffocated the words were falling from her lips without order or understanding zenoria was not at the house when it happened she collapsed vals father has written to him the admiralty has been informed she turned away seeing and hearing nothing feeling only the scalding tears which would not come how long had all this taken to write the letters to mourn the child to arrange for a special courier she almost spat out the word eventually while the family stood together in grief and turned their backs on the girl who had come amongst them was it so cruel she heard fergusons voice so he was here too she reached out to grip his hand unable to see him roxby asked gruffly have you heard something yes sir lewis but he was looking at catherine one of the stable lads thought he saw mrs keen in falmouth roxby exploded thats impossible its miles to hampshire man catherine said quietly so they let her go allowed her to leave the house after what had happened to her she thrust out the letter i think you should read it she put her other hand on his arm as a dear friend and perhaps later as a magistrate roxby cleared his throat and peered at some figures beyond the trees who had paused to discover what had happened you brooks ride like the devil to truro and fetch captain tregear with his dragoons tell him i sent you no catherine released their hands i know where she is when i rode here i knew someone was watching me i did not know she was saying goodbye ferguson took her hand let me take you home mlady he was pleading trying to help as allday would have done roxby called carriage fetch some men but it was already too late they left the carriage where catherine had waited with tamara to watch indomitable clear the harbour all those weeks ago then along the winding cliff path which had crumbled away in so many places dangerous even for a surefooted cornish girl in the dark but it had not been in the dark and as they scrambled up the last stretch catherine saw the familiar landmark like some crouching thing known locally as trystans leap catherine stood motionless her gown and hair moving slowly in the light breeze off the water she was aware of nothing but the rise and fall of the seas glistening face the longboat so tiny from up here backing oars like a waterbeetle to avoid the hissing rocks which the receding tide would soon reveal to the sun they were lifting a small figure from the undertow an oar moving this way and that to maintain control of the boat she heard herself say i am going down i must she felt a hand seize her wrist to guide her as she began her descent but there was nobody beside her aloud she said richard its you when she reached the suddenly bare shining crescent of beach her gown was torn her hands cut and bleeding one of the coastguards stepped between her and the little bundle on the sand no my lady you cant go no further it was tom who had so often seen and spoken with her when they had met on these same cliffs he dropped his eyes as she stared at him er face is gone the rocks just for a momenti beg you another voice called ive covered she some tom the coastguard let her pass him then and she walked blindly to the body she knelt down on the hard wet sand and grasped the outthrust hand so cold so very still even the wedding ring had been battered by the rocks very gently she raised the corpse so that the bandaged head drooped against her shoulder as if she were listening then she opened the neck of the torn clothing until she could see the beginning of the scar where the whip had laid open zenorias back on the transport from which val had rescued her on their walks along this coast zenoria had referred to it as the mark of satan she could hear roxby gasping and panting down the last part of the track then his hands firm on her shoulders as some of the others took the girls body from her was it her yes there can be no mistake then she said perhaps she cried out i might have heard or thought it was a seabird then she shook her head rejecting it knowing she must no she wanted to go we who are closest to her might have helped her more but the pain is only just beginning ferguson asked what shall we do mlady she said we must do what richard would have done were he here we must take her back to the sea to zennor from whence she came perhaps her spirit will be at peace there god knows she had little of it elsewhere afterwards bryan ferguson knew it was something he would never forget nor want to sir richard bolitho walked slowly across the stoneflagged terrace and felt the heat coursing up through his shoes it was very hot and the sun seemed to stand directly above monks hill unwavering and appearing to discourage even the movement of small craft in the wide expanse of english harbour other houses used mostly by senior officials and dockyard officers stood out white and stark against the lush greenery like this building to which he had come seven years ago and where he had found catherine again seven years it seemed impossible so much had happened since that time friends killed fine ships lost or battered into hulks in every corner of the world and across every ocean he reached the stone balustrade and touched it with his fingers like a heated gunbarrel just as it must have been when she had stood here in this very place and position to watch the painful approach of his ship hyperion the old ships name had meant very little to her and she had been totally unprepared for the shock when she had heard her husband mention that hyperion had become a flagship my flagship he cupped one hand over his left eye and looked at the ships anchored here part of his squadron sprawling untidily to their cables in the airless heat beyond the larger indomitable the three frigates zest virtue and chivalrous made perfect reflections on the still water their ensigns and pendants barely moving the big frigate valkyrie now commanded by captain peter dawes lay at halifax with two sixthrates in company together they and three brigs represented the leeward squadron only one was still missing and she should arrive here very shortly adams anemone fresh from her refit and manned almost completely by strangers would complete a lively and useful force adam might miss the faces lost in the last fight with baratte but improving the performance of the new men and the ship herself would keep him too busy to brood he loved anemone more than any ship he would not rest until she responded to his hand like the true thoroughbred she was bolitho took his hand from his eye and was surprised that it gave him no pain or irritation the air was clearer and perhaps his freedom ashore with catherine had helped more than he knew he studied his ships again each one as strong or as fragile as the man who commanded her so many times had bolitho come to this small but powerful outpost in the caribbean to stand against the american rebels the dutch the spaniards and the old enemy france and now the new american navy was posing a threat once again there had still been no declaration of war nor even a suggestion from either government that danger threatened on the horizon bolitho watched a few boats weaving in and out among the moored menofwar otherwise nothing stirred in a month or so that would change with the beginning of the hurricane season it had been that time of year when he had come here last and found catherine he thought of her letters which had arrived only two days ago all together in a sealed bag having gone to gibraltar first by accident he smiled hearing her voice in each written word savouring them strange how unlike letters unpleasant and direct despatches from higher command never seemed to go astray but found you without any apparent difficulty he had read through all of them twice and he would read them again later when the ship was at rest once when he had been sitting at his table the ship dark around him and lanterns glinting on the water like fireflies he had heard the low murmur of a voice reading aloud close by he understood now what it meant his flaglieutenant george avery was reading a letter from home for alldays benefit a small unlikely thing perhaps but bolitho had been touched by it the lieutenant who like tyacke never received letters from anybody and the one who received them and could not read them another bond among we happy few catherines letters were written with care and with love their contact was so important vital to him and she understood exactly what he needed to know seemingly inconsequential details of the house the weather her roses and the people who were part of that other life which he had had to discard like all those other times and all those bolithos before him she told him of the cliff walks and the gossip in the town of roxbys obvious pleasure in his knighthood of her mare tamara but she never wrote of the war except once she had been writing of indomitables departure how she had waited with tamara to watch the powerful ship spreading sail and heading for the channel it was such a proud sight darling richard but i was the proudest of all i did not cry i could not i could not allow tears to hide those precious moments there goes my man an admiral of england the rock so many have depended on for so long only a man you once described yourself so typical of you dearest of men but not true you lead they follow so it will be until the last shot in this damnable war last night you came to me again darling richard i allowed you to touch me before you left me there was more her words bringing him a poignant elation and comfort which made other concerns unimportant was that why he had stayed away from this fine house until her letters had arrived to sustain him am i still so unsure although our love has survived even the fiercest trial he crossed to the nearest door and paused in the bars of dusty sunlight although the furniture was covered with protective sheets and the valuable candlesticks and crystal had been removed he could still see it as it had been when he had stumbled half blinded by reflected lights and she had reached out to steady him he had not known catherine was here whereas she had endured the knowledge of his arrival and emotions and memories of their affair too powerful not to be reawakened there was a gleam of scarlet from the other end of the terrace as a royal marine wandered past the windows he was one of a handful who had been instructed to watch over the empty house and to ensure that nothing went missing before the next occupant arrived from england as somervell had been despatched to take up residence here a man trusted by the king a man respected because of his lovely wife and perhaps for little else by those who truly knew him out into the impressive reception area and beyond it the big staircase where he had found her at night when the curtains had swirled through the rooms like torn sails in a mounting wind she had carried a loaded pistol hidden against her thigh he would never forget the look in her fine dark eyes when she had recognised her intruder she had written that she was losing her maid sophie who was to marry the son of a prosperous farmer over near fallowfield he wondered if allday was still troubled over his separation from unis love permanent love was so new to him and completely unexpected bolitho walked out into the glare again glad he had come back to this place perhaps it would be possible to write to her about it in a way that would not hurt her he smiled faintly sensing that she would already know he had made his pilgrimage here he descended the worn stone steps and paused to look back at the house the windows were shuttered blind and yet curiously he felt as if the place were watching him allday was sitting on a bollard by the waterfront his hat tilted over his eyes he stood up immediately and signalled to the long greenpainted barge idling in the shadow of a stores hulk bolitho wondered if the new barge crew knew how lucky they were to have him to watch over them other coxswains no matter how junior might have left them baking in the heat until they were required but this big shambling sailor always cared until somebody crossed him then the heavens would fall allday watched the approaching barge with a critical eye a second coxswain had been appointed as his assistant mostly to supervise its cleaning and general maintenance he would be a help to allday who was so often troubled by his old chest wound bolitho looked away alldays expression seemed to suggest that the man in question still had a long way to go a lot of memories in this place old friend allday answered thoughtfully indeed sir more than a few bolitho said impulsively i know how you are feeling about home but i have to tell you lady catherine is grateful that you came with me and so am i it was like a cloud drifting away allday gave a great grin so that his troubled thoughts seemed to go with it ah well we just need capn adam alongside now and well be ready for anything his eyes hardened as the barge tossed oars too soon and came against the fenders with a sickening lurch unabashed protheroe the young fourth lieutenant leapt ashore and removed his hat with a flourish at your service sir richard beyond his shoulder bolitho heard allday growl at the second coxswain i dont care see even if he is a bloody officer you take charge dont treat the barge like a batteringram protheroes bright confidence had been replaced by two vivid spots of colour in his cheeks he had heard every word as allday had intended bolitho settled himself in the sternsheets and waited for the barge to glide away from the jetty he glanced at protheroe and said quietly if it is of any consolation i once collided with my admirals barge when i was a midshipman oh the relief flooded his face oh after the din and turmoil of being piped on board bolitho took allday to one side captain tyacke and i are being entertained to dinner in the wardroom tonight it may be the last chance we get for a while i knows about that sir bolitho hid a smile like many other people allday probably thought it was absurd that the admiral and the ships captain had to wait for an invitation before they could enter the wardroom mess his father had dismissed it as tradition part of the navys mystique but where did all that go when the screens were torn down and the decks were cleared from bow to stern and such gentility was drowned and lost in the din of war when it is done and if you have a mind lay aft and join me and captain tyacke for a wet as you would call it allday grinned and thought of the captains new coxswain eli fairbrother the day he gets asked for a wet will be the day bolitho saw scarlett the first lieutenant waiting nearby mr scarlett how may i help you scarlett almost stammered tonight sir richard i we have not forgotten and i intend that we should entertain all our captains who may be present as soon as anemone arrives it is always good to know the men who command the ships you may have to rely on scarlett came out of his troubled thoughts a sail was sighted at noon sir richard bolitho recalled once more hyperions approach at snails pace as catherine had described it to him so many times today there was even less wind at the newcomers disposal scarlett glanced at the listless masthead pendant the army lookout station on monks hill sent word that she may be the schooner kelpie she is apparently due he sensed the question in bolithos eyes mailpacket sir richard from the bermudas an odd expression a sadness bolitho thought crossed his face before that england bolitho turned away maybe another letter from catherine perhaps new directions from the admiralty bethune might have changed his mind or been ordered to change it he had seen the doubts for himself it was dangerous as it was delicate the americans could be provoked into war or they could be dissuaded from open conflict nothing would be achieved by sitting still and pretending a confrontation would go away of its own accord so lets be about it then he said scarlett was still staring after him as he strode aft to the cabin lieutenant george avery nodded to the marine sentry and waited for ozzard to open the screen door for him the great cabin was lit only by two lanterns and right aft beyond the tall stern windows he could see some scattered shore lights and the moons silver reflection on the gently breathing water he saw his admiral sitting on the bench seat his heavy goldlaced coat draped over ozzards arm his shirt open while he sipped a tall glass of hock bolitho said be seated he saw allday begin to rise for the lieutenant but he changed his mind as avery shook his head to bolitho he said let it be like that time in freetown sir richard there are no officers here tonight only men bolitho smiled avery was more outspoken than usual but there had been plenty of wine at the wardroom dinner and so much food that considering the temperature and the unmoving air between decks it was a wonder some of them had not collapsed after the first awkward formalities between the mostly young officers and their admiral as well as their formidable captain things had settled down unlike meat from the cask rockhard when the cooks got their hands on it there was a pleasant surprise on offer an unlimited supply of fresh roast pork the captain of the dockyard had his own pigs on the island and had presented the meat from his own larder apart from the four lieutenants and the two royal marine officers the wardroom consisted of the ships specialists isaac york the sailingmaster seemed to have an endless fund of stories about strange ports he had visited since going to sea at the age of eight it was bolithos first real meeting with the ships surgeon philip beauclerk young for his trade with the palest eyes bolitho had ever seen almost transparent like seapolished glass an educated quietspoken man a far cry from the rough and ready surgeons the butchers as they were called men like george minchin who had once served in hyperion and had been on board when the old ship had given up the fight wildeyed crude and often halfdrunk with rum he had nevertheless saved many lives that day and he had not quit the ship until the last of the wounded or those who were not beyond hope had been taken off minchin would be in halifax now serving in the big frigate valkyrie where bolitho had last met him bolitho had caught beauclerk watching him several times throughout the meal the general drinking and the seemingly endless procession of toasts it was impossible that he could know anything about his eye or was it there was no more private society than the medical profession but beauclerk had spoken with great intelligence and interest about what might lie ahead and was probably trying to guess what his own part might be it was very hard to picture him like minchin in that raging bloody hell on the orlop deck the wingsandlimbs tubs filled to overflowing with the gory remnants of those who had been cut down in battle three midshipmen had been invited too and one of them midshipman david cleugh had been required to call the loyal toast this he did in a piping quavery voice he had then been sternly ordered to drink a full goblet of brandy by the captain of marines for by coincidence it was the midshipmans twelfth birthday the quietest man in the wardroom had been james viney the purser he had been unable to drag his eyes from the captain who sat directly opposite him like a mesmerised rabbit bolitho had thought tyacke had not come aft for a last drink and had made his excuses as the messmen had started to clear away the table so that cards and dice could be produced out of politeness nobody would move until the senior guests had departed tyacke his torn face in shadow had said only i want to go through a book or two before i turn in bolitho recalled the pursers nervousness the books might have a lot to do with that bolitho had thrust out his hand and had seen the sudden surprise in those clear blue eyes that reminded him so much of thomas herrick thank you james for what sir his handshake had been firm nevertheless bolitho had answered quietly you know for what as i know what this evening cost you but believe me you will not regret it nor will i ozzard brought another glass of hock and placed a goblet of rum almost within alldays reach his quiet stubborn way of showing he was not his servant they sat in silence listening to the ships private noises and the dragging step of a watchkeeper overhead avery said suddenly the leaves will soon fall in england then he shook his head and winced god how i shall pay for all that wine in the morning bolitho touched the locket inside his shirt and saw avery glance as it flashed in the lantern light perhaps they all saw him in different ways few would imagine he could be as he was when he and catherine were together scarlett had also asked yovell as a guest but he had declined and had spent the evening in the tiny cabin that also served him as an office and writingspace allday had assured him that yovell was quite happy to be alone he had said with some amusement he reads his bible every night theres still quite a lot of it to take in through the open skylight and stern windows they heard the creak of oars it was so still that every sound seemed to carry then the hail boat ahoy avery looked surprised who is abroad at this hour he stood up ill go and see sir he smiled suddenly and appeared young and relaxed as he must have been once there may not be another officer sober enough to deal with it the oars were louder nearer then came the reply officeroftheguard bolitho massaged his eyes he was tired but rare moments with friends like these could not be ignored he thought of scarlett anxious and unsure of himself during the meal was it so important to him he was a good officer and watching him going about his duties bolitho might have believed that he was completely confident with perhaps only his next promotion uppermost in his mind he had noticed however that neither he nor avery had spoken to one another avery returned carrying a waterproof envelope would you believe sir the mailschooner kelpie entered harbour in pitch darkness after all the guardboat stood by just in case he held out the envelope kelpie met with anemone shes waiting until first light before she comes in bolitho said very wise with the harbour full of ships and adam with a raw company he saw allday watching him questioningly bolitho said its from lady catherine a cold hand seemed to touch him and he could not shake it off he recognised her handwriting instantly and had seen an admiralty wax seal on the envelope a priority for private correspondence avery stood up then i shall leave you sir no he was surprised by the sharpness of his own voice what is the matter with me ozzard recharge the glasses if you please even ozzard was motionless watching listening if you will excuse me bolitho slit open the envelope and unfolded her letter he was suddenly quite alone with only the letter her words rising to meet him my darling richard i would give anything not to write this letter to send you news which will grieve you as it has me i have to tell you that vals little boy is dead it was an accident and he suffocated in his cot before anyone could help him bolitho looked away feeling the sting in his eye and yet unable to hide it he heard allday ask thickly what is it sir but bolitho shook his head and read on the others saw him fold the letter and then raise it to his lips then he became aware of his companions he felt as though he had been absent from them for a long time ozzard held out a glass of brandy and bobbed nervously just a sip sir thank you he could barely taste it as a child before entering the navy he had often walked with his mother along that path to trystans leap it had been frightening even in daylight full of legend and superstition he felt the cold hand on his heart again and in his minds eye he saw her falling so slowly her long hair like weed as she came to the surface her slender body broken on those terrible rocks he asked although it did not seem like his own voice they sighted anemone you say avery responded crisply aye sir standing about five miles to the souwest bolitho stood up and crossed to the two swords which hung on their rack adam he thought adam adam how could he tell him and what of val so proud of his first son who was one day to wear the kings uniform he touched the old family sword what did fate intend he said i want no talk of this he turned and looked at each of them in turn the stooping little figure by the pantry hatch avery on his feet again his eyes wary uncertain lastly he looked at allday i have to tell you that rearadmiral keens child is dead he tried not to think of catherine on the beach with the dead girls body in her arms shortly afterwards there was no point in telling these honest men that the family had said and done nothing at all until keens father had been located in london the girl we saw wed val at zennor killed herself he saw alldays fists open and close as he added at trystans leap avery said rearadmiral keen will be desolate sir bolitho turned to him calm now knowing what must be done do something for me go now and ensure that there is a note in the signals log for the morning watch as soon as anemone is within signals range i want captain repair on board hoisted then hoist immediate when she is anchored allday offered roughly i could clear away the barge and collect him sir bolitho stared at him no old friend this is a private matter for as long as we may keep it so to avery he said please do it i will see you tomorrow he paused thank you allday made to follow but bolitho said wait allday sat down heavily they were alone and they could hear ozzard tidying up in his pantry you knew their feeling for one another allday sighed i seen em together there was no intrigue if thats what you mean allday watched him carefully knowing this man so well but with no words to help him now that he needed it he said not in the way we means sir but loves new to me and ive heard tell that it can be a blessing then again it can be a curse and you knew all this felt it more like no one must suspect captain adam means so much to me i knows it sir it must have been another world to that poor lass he shrugged they looked so right together i thought bolitho walked past him but paused with his hand on his massive shoulder a curse you said he thought of catherines words a cry from the heart the mark of satan he said quietly then let them have peace now he was still sitting at the open stern windows when the first pale sunlight spread across english harbour in cornwall the passage of time would have blurred the memories of most people while in some isolated villages there would be those still pondering on the old beliefs curses and morals and the torment for those who defied them but this morning there was still a pretence of peace above his head on the quarterdeck he knew avery had not slept either and was watching even as adams anemone glided slowly to her anchorage for him it would still be a puzzle a mystery he was not privileged to share but he must sense that the answer lay in the flags barely moving in the breeze captain repair on board immediate part ii deception captain james tyacke stood at the top of the companion ladder and waited for his eyes to become accustomed to the early morning darkness it was a moment he never grew tired of quiet because the hands had not yet been piped to begin another day private because of the lingering shadows above all private no easy thing in a manofwar not even for her captain in a short while the sun would change everything reaching from horizon to horizon all privacy gone water was getting short they would have to return to antigua in a few days time what would they find fresh orders news from england the war that other world none of it mattered much to tyacke the indomitable was his main concern week in week out he had drilled his company until it was almost impossible to tell the seasoned professionals from the landmen gunnery and sail drill but with leisure still for the simple pleasures sailors enjoyed parted from their homes it was all they had to keep them out of mischief hornpipes and wrestling in the dogwatches and contests mast against mast to see which one could reef or make more sail in the least time indomitable was now a shipofwar which could give a good account of herself if so called but mostly she had been concerned with constant patrols the stopandsearch procedure even of neutrals to prevent trade with french ports and to seek out deserters from the kings navy the leeward squadron had taken several prizes and recovered many such deserters mostly sailing in american merchantmen trying to reach a new life in what they believed to be a democratic paradise compared with the hardships they were forced to suffer under the british flag in this endless war it probably was the first lieutenant was officerofthewatch and he could sense his presence on the opposite side of the quarterdeck scarlett had become used to tyackes ways his early walks on deck when most captains would have been content to leave a morning watch to their senior lieutenants it was still cold the quarterdeck rail damp with moisture when dawn came up that would all change the vapour would rise from the sails and rigging like steam and the tar in the deck seams would cling to shoes and bare feet alike tyacke could see it clearly in his minds eye as if he were a seaeagle soaring high above the blue water with the ships like tiny models below in a ragged uneven line abreast indomitable in the centre and the two smaller frigates one to starboard and one to larboard once they had exchanged the first signals their line would extend and take proper station the masthead lookouts would be able to see one another just and together their span of vision would cover a range of some sixty miles to the spies and to the small trading vessels who would sell their information to anybody the leeward squadron that patrolled as far north as the canadian port of halifax would have become well known a protection or a threat their presence could be interpreted either way the big gun frigate valkyrie was the senior ship at halifax and the rest of their vessels could operate either together or independently between the two main bases tyacke thought of the wild storms they had weathered in the caribbean given the choice he preferred these waters rather than endure halifaxs bitter winters where rigging could swell in the blocks and freeze leaving any ship barely able to tack or shorten sail he considered the other captains knowing them now as individuals the necessity of that had been taught him by bolitho to assume you knew a captains mind simply because he was a captain could be as dangerous as any hurricane all the leagues they had sailed in company or with the ocean to themselves he imagined green fields in england they had gone through another winter into a new year and now that year was half gone it was june and if it was to be as demanding as the previous year overhauls would have to be arranged english harbour at antigua was adequate for limited repairs but not for an extensive campaign and should there be a seafight with more destruction to hulls and rigging he sighed when had the navy ever had enough of anything he stepped back from the rail and heard the first lieutenant crossing the damp planking good morning mr scarlett is all well aye sir wind steady at noreast by north course west by north estimated position some miles northeast of cape haitien tyacke smiled grimly as close to that damned country as id ever want to get scarlett asked what orders for the forenoon sir he hesitated as tyacke turned sharply towards him what is it sir tyacke shook his head nothing but there was something it was like a sixth sense which he had at first refused to accept when he had been on the antislavery patrols sometimes a premonition of where his prey might be found he felt it now something would happen today he moved restlessly across the deck telling himself he was a fool like the morning when adam bolitho had come eagerly aboard at antigua in response to the flagships signal immediate when he had left indomitable an hour or so later he had walked like a man face to face with some terrible fate bolitho had sent for him and had broken the news about rearadmiral keens wife and her death on the cornish cliffs just for a moment tyacke had imagined that bolitho had once felt a certain tenderness for the girl then he had dismissed the idea thinking of catherine somervell how she had come aboard at falmouth and how the sailors had loved her for it what then in his heart he knew the connection that bound them was a deeper secret than he would ever share but why should a young womans tragedy have the power to affect them so profoundly it happened women and their children often died of fever or other causes on their way to join their husbands in the navy or the army with its farflung outposts and lonely forts even the caribbean possessions were described as the islands of death certainly more soldiers died of fever out here than ever fell to an enemy ball or bayonet death was commonplace perhaps it was the rumour of suicide that they could not accept allday would know he thought but when it came to sharing secrets allday was like the rock of gibraltar scarlett joined him again the admirals about early sir tyacke nodded he wanted to shake scarlett a good officer and very conscientious and as popular with the lower deck as any first lieutenant could hope to expect dont be timid with me i told you before my blood may be spilled before yours and you could find yourself in command think of it man talk to me share your thoughts he said he has always been the same i believe had he he wondered or was some premonition driving bolitho also it was slightly brighter now topgallant masts touched with pale light as though they floated separately above the dark mass of spars and black rigging bolithos flag rippling as if newly awakened like the man it represented a boatswains mate and a handful of men checking the boats on their tier inspecting hatch fastenings putting fresh oil in the compass lamps a ship coming to life the masters mateofthewatch said softly admirals comin up sir thank you mr brickwood tyacke recalled the beginning when all these men had been unfamiliar knowing from his own experience and later from bolithos example how important it was to remember each mans name as well as his face in the navy you owned little else the midshipmanofthewatch a youth named deane said rather loudly halfpast four sir bolitho walked amongst them his ruffled shirt very clear against the deck and the seas dark backdrop beyond good morning sir richard bolitho looked towards him it is too captain tyacke he nodded to the first lieutenant and you mr scarlett are your lookouts aloft aye sir hesitant again it was impossible to know what he was thinking bolitho rubbed his hands that is a vile smell from the galley funnel we must endeavour to take on more supplies when we return to english harbour fresh fruit with any luck tyacke hid a smile just for a moment bolitho was allowing himself to be a captain again with a captains concern for every man and boy aboard walk with me james together they began to pace the quarterdeck in the dim light they could have been brothers bolitho asked what ails that man tyacke shrugged hes an officer not lacking in some fine qualities sir but aye james i have often found but to be the hurdle he looked up as the first thin sunlight felt its way through the tarred rigging and out along the braced mainyard even the sea had gained colour a rich blue which gave it an appearance of even greater depth than the thousandodd fathoms claimed to lie beneath indomitables keel tyacke watched bolithos profile the obvious pleasure it gave him to see another dawn in spite of all his service he could still suppress and contain his inner worries if only for this moment of the day bolitho turned aside as the usual procession of figures trooped aft to speak either with the first lieutenant or the captain when the hands had been fed the main deck would become the marketplace where the professional men would work with their own little crews the sailmaker and his mates repairing and still more repairing nothing could be wasted with a ship so many hundreds of miles from harbour the carpenter too with his team he was evan brace said to be the oldest man in the squadron he certainly looked it but he could still repair and if necessary build a boat as well as any man bolitho heard a familiar yorkshire voice joseph foxhill was the cooper up early to obtain deck space where he could scour and clean some of his empty casks before they were refilled a midshipman strode beneath the quarterdeck rail the white patches on his collar showing brightly through the withdrawing shadows and he was reminded painfully of adam he tended to think of him always as a midshipman the lively coltlike boy who had joined his ship when his mother had died he sighed he would never forget the look on adams dark features when he had told him about zenoria it had been pitiful to see his stunned disbelief like the tragedy you try to pretend has not happened you will awake and it will have been a dream he had not resisted when bolitho had made him sit down and he had asked his uncle quietly to repeat what he had said bolitho had listened to his own voice in the sealed cabin he had even closed the skylight in case someone overheard adam was a captain perhaps one of the best frigate captains the fleet had ever known but in those quiet wretched faltering moments he had seemed that same darkhaired boy who had walked all the way from penzance to falmouth with only hope and bolithos name to sustain him he had said may i see lady catherines letter uncle bolitho had watched him seen his eyes moving slowly over the letter line by line perhaps sharing the intimacy as if she too were speaking to him then he had said it was all my fault when he had looked up from the letter bolitho had been shocked to see the tears running down his face but i could not stop i loved her so now she is gone bolitho had said i was a part of it too catherines words seemed to ring in his mind the mark of satan was there could there be substance in the old cornish beliefs and superstitions after that they had sat mostly in silence until at last adam had made to leave i grieve for rearadmiral keen his loss is all the more tragic because he had left the rest unsaid he had picked up his hat and straightened his uniform when he returned to his ship they would only see him as their captain so it must be but as bolitho had watched him climb down into his boat to the trill of calls he had seen only the midshipman he stirred himself as voices pealed down from aloft deck there zest in sight to larboard like yesterday and all the others before it he could picture the rakish gun frigate her captain too paul dampier young perhaps too headstrong and very ambitious rather like peter dawes the admirals son who now commanded valkyrie out of halifax deck there reaper in sight to starboard a smaller frigate of guns james hamilton her captain was old for his rank and had been attached to the honourable east india company until he had reentered the navy at his own request and away to windward would be the little brig marvel ready to run down on anything suspicious to search coves and inlets where her larger consorts might lose their keels to run errands almost anything bolitho had often seen tyacke watching her whenever she was close by still remembering marvel was very like his larne he saw allday at the foot of the quarterdeck ladder he had his head on one side and was ignoring the rush of seamen to trim the yards again urged on no doubt by the smell of breakfast bolitho asked sharply what is it allday looked at him impassively not certain sir deck there sail in sight to th noreast tyacke glanced around until he found midshipman blythe aloft with you my lad and take a glass there was an edge to his voice and bolitho saw him stare at the horizon already glassy bright and searing prepare to make more sail mr scarlett blythe had reached the mainmast crosstrees sail to the noreast sir just the slightest hesitation schooner sir scarlett remarked well shes not running away with indomitable and the other two frigates hoveto and the brig marvel making sail to block the strangers escape if she proved hostile every available glass was trained despite the heavy regular swell midshipman cleugh blythes haughty assistant called in his squeaky voice shes reynard sir scarlett said courier i wonder what she wants nobody answered allday climbed silently up the ladder and stood at bolithos shoulder ive got a feeling sir somethings wrong it was almost an hour before the schooner was near enough to drop a boat her captain a wildeyed lieutenant named tully was taken down to the cabin where bolitho was pretending to enjoy some of ozzards coffee well mr tully and what have you brought me he watched as avery opened the bag and then dragged out the sealed and weighted envelope but the schooners young captain exclaimed its war sir the americans are already at the canadian frontier bolitho took the despatches from averys hand where are their ships one letter was from captain dawes in valkyrie he had taken his ships to sea as already arranged and would await fresh orders as they had planned it seemed so long ago he repeated but where are their ships dawes had written as a postscript commodore beers squadron quit sandy hook during a storm he could almost hear the words a total responsibility but he felt nothing it was what he had expected hoped perhaps to end it once and for all tyacke who had been waiting in silence asked suddenly what is the date of origin sir avery replied ten days ago sir bolitho stood up aware of the silence in the ship despite the heavy movement ten days and they had been at war without knowing it he swung round the next convoy from jamaica tyacke said sailed theyd not know either bolitho stared at the chair by the stern bench where adam had sat with catherines letter where his heart had broken he asked what escort he saw tyackes face he too had known that this was coming but how could that be avery said anemone sir if they were not expecting bolitho interrupted him sharply make a signal to zest and reaper repeated marvel close on flagship and remain in company he looked directly at tyacke excluding everyone else we shall lay a course for the mona passage he could recall it so clearly that muchdisputed channel to the west of puerto rico where he and so many faces now lost had fought battles now forgotten by most people it was the obvious route for any jamaica convoy heavily laden merchantmen would stand no chance against ships like the uss unity or men like nathan beer unless the escort saw through the deception and turned to defend the convoy against overwhelming odds as seraphis had faced john paul joness bonhomme richard in that other war against the same enemy it was just possible that convoy had been saved seraphis had been beaten into submission he looked at tyacke but in his heart he saw only adam all the sail she can carry james i think we are sorely needed but a voice seemed to echo back mocking him too late too late richard hudson first lieutenant of the gun frigate anemone strode aft to the quarterdeck even as eight bells chimed out from the forecastle he touched his forehead as a mark of respect to the second lieutenant whom he was about to relieve like the other officers he wore only his shirt and breeches and was hatless and he could feel even the lightest garment plastered to his body like a second skin the afternoon watch is aft sir the words were formal and timeless the navys custom from the indian ocean to the arctic if so ordered the other young lieutenant the same age as himself replied with equal precision the course remains at southeast by south the wind has backed to about north by west around and below them midshipmen and the duty watch took their stations while others filled in their time splicing and stitching the endless tasks of maintaining a shipofwar hudson took a telescope from its rack and winced as he held it to his eye it was as hot as a gunbarrel for a moment or two he moved the glass across the drifting heat haze and the dark blue water until he found the shimmering pyramids of sail the three big merchantmen which anemone had been escorting from port royal and would continue to escort until they had reached the bermudas where they would join a larger convoy for the atlantic crossing even the thought of england made hudson lick his lips summer yes but it might be raining cool breezes wet grass under foot but it was not to be he realised that the second lieutenant who had been in charge of the forenoon watch was still beside him he wanted to talk up here where he could not be heard it made hudson feel both guilty and disloyal he was the first lieutenant responsible only to the captain for the running and organisation of the ship and her company how could things have changed so much in less than a year when his uncle a retired viceadmiral had obtained him the appointment in anemone through a friend in the admiralty he had been overjoyed like most ambitious young officers he had yearned for a frigate and to be secondincommand to such a famous captain had been like a dream coming true captain adam bolitho was all that a frigate commander was supposed to be dashing and reckless but not one to risk lives for his own ends or glory the fact that bolithos uncle who commanded their important little squadron was as celebrated and loved in the fleet as he was notorious in society ashore gave the appointment an added relish or it had until the day adam bolitho had returned to anemone after his summons to the flag ship at english harbour he had always been a hard worker and had expected others to follow his example often he carried out tasks normally done by common seamen if only to prove to the landmen and others pressed against their will that he was not asking the impossible of them now he was driving himself to and beyond the limit month by month they had patrolled as near to the american mainland as possible unless other ships were in close company they had stopped and searched ships of every flag and taken many deserters and on several occasions had fired on neutral vessels which had showed no inclination to heaveto for inspection a quarter of anemones total company were even now in captured prizes and making either for antigua or bermuda even that seemed to give the captain no satisfaction hudson thought he shunned the company of his officers and only came on deck when required for sailing the ship or in times of foul weather which had been plentiful over the past months then soaked to the skin his black hair plastered to his face looking more like a pirate than a kings officer he had never budged until his ship was out of danger but he was curt impatient now an entirely different man from the one hudson had first met in plymouth vicary the second lieutenant said ill be glad when this convoy is out of our hands slow to sail slow even to cooperate sometimes i think these damned grocery captains take a delight in ignoring signals hudson watched a fish leap and fall into the heaving water he had found himself assessing even the most commonplace remarks for some secret significance captain bolitho was never brutal with punishment otherwise sailing with only the elderly brig woodpecker in company he might well have expected serious trouble hudson had questioned some of the retaken deserters himself and many had pleaded that they had run only because of unfair and in some cases horrific floggings for even minor offences now returned to british ships but in the same war their treatment would be gauged by their behaviour hudson glanced at the men working on deck some trying to remain in the shadows of the reefed topsails or watching the marine sentry with his fixed bayonet on sweating guard over the freshwater cask if only they could be free of the merchantmen and their painfully slow progress day in day out only the wind seemed to change and there was precious little of that too hudson said you think that all this is a waste of time do you philip yes as a matter of fact i do this is a drudges work let them fend for themselves i say they are quick enough to squeal and appeal to higher authority if we take a few of their prime seamen to fill the gaps but they bleat even louder when they are in danger themselves hudson thought of a verse he had once heard somewhere god and the navy we adore when danger threatens but not before obviously nothing had changed anemone had been driven hard a proper refit was inevitable he tried not to hope too much one of the ships awaiting their arrival at bermuda had been out here for less time than anemone and she was going to sail home as an additional escort home he almost gritted his teeth then he lifted the telescope again and moved it deliberately towards the distant sails further downwind the brig woodpecker stood above the thick heat haze like a pair of feathers so white against the pitiless sky he said why dont you cut on down to the wardroom itll be a mite cooler if nothing else he lowered the glass and waited here it comes vicary said weve always got on well i cant talk to anyone else you know how things get twisted distorted you mean vicary was a native of sussex fairhaired and blueeyed with hudson thought what his mother could have called such an english face he contained a fond smile and retorted you know i cannot discuss the matter even that felt like disloyalty i appreciate that vicary plucked at his stained shirt i just want to know why what happened to change him we deserve that much surely hudson toyed with the idea of sending him below with a direct order instead he said something very personal perhaps not a death or wed have heard of it his future is assured provided he can stay alive and i dont just mean in the line of battle vicary nodded perhaps from satisfaction that their friendship was not in danger i did hear a few tales about a duel somewhere everyone knows it goes on despite the law hudson thought of the captains uncle as he had been when he had come aboard to meet the officers adam was so like him exactly as bolitho must have been at the same age the hero the man who was followed into battle with a kind of passion as they had once followed nelson and yet unlike so many highranking and successful officersheroeshudson had felt that sir richard bolitho was a man without conceit and one who truly cared for the men he inspired it was more than charisma as he had heard it described when the admiral looked at you you as an individual person you could feel it run through your blood and you knew in the same breath that you would follow him anywhere he felt suddenly troubled adam bolitho had once been very like that he saw the masteratarms and the boatswain standing by the weather side and its rank of long eighteenpounders and the sight brought him out of his thoughts with a jolt punishment was to be carried out at two bells when the watch below had finished their meal he could smell the rum on the hot breeze which was barely enough to fill the sails punishment was usually carried out in the forenoon it gave all hands time to get over it and wash away the memory with rum but for some reason the captain had ordered an extra gun drill today had even been on deck to time it himself as if he did not trust his officers to stress the importance of teamwork had they been running free with all canvas filled and driving the anemone until every strand of rigging was bar taut it would have been just another punishment two dozen lashes it could have been many more for the man in question this would not be the first time he had received a striped shirt at the gangway he was a hard man a lowerdeck lawyer a born troublemaker captain bolitho could have awarded double that amount but this was different moving so slowly with nothing in sight but the faroff convoy and brig it could be like a spark in a powder keg the nearest land was santo domingo some hundred miles to the north the perverse wind made it impossible to tack any closer but in another two days they would reach the mona passage where many changes of tack would be required keeping all hands busy for days until they broke out into the atlantic hudson turned as a shadow moved across the rail it was the captain adam bolitho gazed at them impassively nothing to do but gossip mr vicary he looked at the first lieutenant i would have thought you could discover something not too tiring for an officer to do if he has no stomach for his lunch hudson said we have not had too much time to talk of late sir he studied his captain as he walked to the compass and then glanced at the limply flapping masthead pendant the helmsman called huskily soueast by south sir steady she goes hudson noted the dark shadows beneath the captains eyes the restless way he moved his hands like the rest of them he was casually dressed but he wore his short fightingsword which was unusual the boatswains party was preparing to rig a grating and hudson saw cunningham the surgeon appear in the companionway when he realised the captain was on deck he disappeared down the ladder without another glance but the captain had seen him he said the surgeon has protested to me about punishment being carried out did you know that hudson said i did not sir he states that the seaman in question baldwin whose name has repeatedly appeared in the punishment bookand not only in anemones i suspecthas some internal illness too much rum and other more damaging potions what do you say mr hudson he is often in trouble sir adam bolitho said sharply he is scum ill suffer no insubordination in my ship hudson had always been very aware of the captains love for this ship such a personal attachment seemed only another aspect of the bolitho legend but now he thought he knew why he was so intense about it his beloved anemone was all he had in the world the other lieutenant had used the opportunity to go below it was a pity hudson thought had he stayed he would have seen it for himself or would he the boatswain lumbered aft and called ready sir adam said very well mr mcrea put up the prisoner and clear lower deck as if to a secret signal the royal marines marched up to line the quarterdeck their bayoneted muskets and equipment gleaming as if at their barracks their faces as scarlet as their tunics george starr the captains coxswain brought the old seagoing coat and hat to cover him with a cloak of authority all hands all hands lay aft to witness punishment the seaman named baldwin strode aft the masteratarms and ships corporal on either side of him a big man a bully he ruled his own mess like a tyrant a boatswains mate and another seaman took his arms as soon as they had stripped him of his chequered shirt and seized him up to the grating by his wrists and his knees even from the quarterdeck it was possible to see all the old scars on the strong back adam removed his hat and took out his thumbed copy of the articles of war he had been aware of hudsons scrutiny just as he had sensed vicarys keen resentment given time both would make good officers he felt the anger stirring but they did not command he saw the surgeon taking his place and recalled his pleas on behalf of the prisoner cunningham was a whining hypocrite he would not cross the road to help a child knocked down by a runaway horse from the corner of his eye he saw the boatswain drag the infamous catoninetails from its red baize bag adam hated the use of the cat as his uncle had always done but if like the line of sweating marines it was all that stood between disobedience and order then so be it he put his hand in his pocket and bunched his knuckles until the pain helped to steady him he could feel his coxswain starr watching him worried and anxious as he had been over the months a good man not another allday but there was no such creature he loosened his fingers carefully testing the moment as he felt her glove in his pocket so many times he had taken it out and had stared at it remembering her eyes when he had handed it to her how they had walked together in the port admirals garden feeling her presence like a beautiful wild flower what can i do why did you leave me he realised with a start that he had begun to read the relevant article his voice level and calm calm i am destroying myself he heard himself say carry on mr mcrea two dozen the drums rattled noisily and the boatswains brawny arm went back the lash seemed to dangle there for an eternity until it came down across the prisoners naked back with a crack mcrea was a powerful man and although a fair one was probably enjoying this task he saw the red lines break into bloody droplets but he felt no revulsion and that alone frightened him deck there it was as if the call had turned them all to stone the lash dangling from the boatswains outthrust fist the drumsticks suddenly still in the heavy air the prisoner himself face pressed against the grating his chest heaving as he dragged in breath like a drowning man hudson raised his speakingtrumpet what is it man sail on the larboard quarter he hesitated the heat haze was probably just as bad in that direction two sail sir hudson knew that every eye but the prisoners was turned upon the little group of officers on the quarterdeck but when he looked at the captain he was astonished to see adams expression his utter lack of surprise as if a question which had troubled him had suddenly been made clear what do you think sir well no matter who they are they are certainly not ours that we do know he was thinking aloud as if there was nobody else near him they must have used the windward passage west of port au prince that way they would have the wind which is eluding us hudson nodded but did not understand adam looked at the towering mainmast spars the quivering canvas i shall go aloft the man at the grating tried to twist his head what about me you bastard adam handed his hat and coat to starr and snapped be patient man and mr mcrea another dozen for his damned impertinence he reached the crosstrees surprised that he was not even breathless he acknowledged the lookout one of the best in the squadron a man who looked twice his real age well thomas what do you make of them menowar zur no doubt o that adam unslung his telescope aware of the great trembling mast and yards the bang and slap of canvas the very power of the ship beneath him he had to wait a few seconds more even the lookouts familiar cornish accent caught him unawares like a trap then he levelled the telescope as he had done so many times in his anemone the smaller of the two vessels could have been anything in the haze sloop or brig it was impossible to determine but about the other one there was no such doubt it could have been yesterday the uss unity s great cabin and his conversation with her captain nathan beer who had known his father during the american revolution yankee he said shortly thought as much zur well done thomas ill see you have an extra tot for this the man watched him puzzled but we baint at war with they zur adam smiling made his way down like a practised topman he met hudson and the others and saw all the questions in their eyes although nobody spoke he said crisply one of thems the big yankee frigate unity guns that i know of for sure maybe more now he glanced at the nearest guns unity carried twentyfourpounders he remembered the american mentioning them pride or threat probably both he glanced at the sky two hours before they were up to anemone seven hours more before the convoy could escape in the darkness hudson said carefully what are their intentions sir adam thought of the splendid sight unity had made as she edged round to beat closer to the wind the other vessel responding to a bright hoist of signal flags there was no need for such a manoeuvre her captain could remain on his present course untroubled by either the convoy or her escort instead he was taking the windgage and would hold it until he was ready i think they intend to attack dick in fact i am sure of it the use of his first name surprised hudson almost as much as the simple acceptance of something unthinkable you know this ship sir i have been aboard her and have met her captain an impressive man but know her that is another matter adam stared along the deck above the mass of silent figures towards the beakhead the perfect shoulder and gilded hair of the figurehead daughter of the wind almost to himself he said we are of one company dick some good some bad but every so often we must forget our differences we become an instrument to be used rightly or wrongly as directed i see sir he touched hudsons arm as he had seen his uncle do on many occasions i want you to make a signal to commander eames of the woodpecker repeated to our fat charges make more sail disperse the convoy he hesitated for only a few seconds suppose i am wrong but his conviction to the contrary was more compelling then make enemy in sight to the northwest he heard men calling out as the midshipman in charge of signals and his crew ran to the halliards while hudson repeated the instructions behind them he saw lieutenant vicary staring at him his face suddenly pale under the tanned skin he asked quietly will we be able to outreach them sir adam turned and looked at him and through him today we are the instrument mr vicary we fight that others shall survive hudson glanced at the streaming flags orders sir adam tried to discover his innermost feelings but there were none did that mean there would be no tomorrow orders carry on with the punishment he smiled and was suddenly very young then you may beat to quarters the rest you know he turned away as the drums began to roll again and the frozen images came to life a voice called out as the lash cracked down woodpeckers acknowledged sir adam watched the punishment without emotion they were committed i committed them the instrument like father like son adam bolitho returned to his place by the quarterdeck rail and looked along the full length of his command the deck had been sanded around each eighteenpounder so that the gun crews would not slip and fall in the heat of battle equally sand soaked up the blood if the enemys iron came crashing inboard lieutenant hudson strode aft and touched his hat ship cleared for action sir his face was full of questions adam said well done mr hudson nine minutes they are improving he stared up at the clear sky and felt his heart quicken as the masthead pendant licked out in the breeze this time it did not fall back limply to the mast the wind was getting up very slightly but if it held he shut the ifs and buts from his mind instead he said you are probably asking why i did not order the nets to be spread how open and vulnerable it looked without them the nets were usually prepared as the ship was cleared for action mainly to protect the gun crews from falling wreckage but also to be joined to the looselyslung boarding nets to trap enemy attackers until they could be driven off with pikes and musket fire any sign of either would warn the americans that they were ready to fight likewise he had told hudson to keep the marines out of the fightingtops where their bright uniforms would shout the same readiness for action hudson listened to his brief explanation not knowing whether to find hope in it or to disbelieve it adam said unity has all the sea room in the world like us she depends on surprise my guess is she will keep to windrd and try to cripple us at long range then she will attempt to board us hudson said nothing he could see the dilemma that confronted the captain if the americans were allowed on board there would not be enough men to fight them offtoo many were away in anemones recently taken prizes however if the captain showed his hand too soon unitys massive broadside might dismast them even as she remained safely beyond accurate fire from anemone adam raised his telescope and studied the other ship with complete concentration she had set more sail and had left her small consort astern commodore beer would not be able to see the convoy as yet nor would he know it had been ordered to disperse and devil take the hindmost he said full broadside doubleshotted for good measure go to the gun captains yourself although most of them will not need to be told he glanced at lieutenant vicary by the foremast like the third lieutenant george jeffreys he had barely seen any real action at close quarters he thought of unity s guns they would soon know all about it he felt starr beside him and spread his arms to receive the coat with its gold epaulettes he had been so proud when he had been posted just as he had known how pleased bolitho would be it had been fate golden plover running herself on the african reef and all hope given up for his uncle and catherine he swallowed hard valentine keen had been reported lost in that wreck as well how it haunted him the night it had happened zenoria had come to him to share their grief and out of that shared grief they had discovered a love they had hidden from one another and from the rest of the world he touched his breeches and felt her glove against his leg could see her eyes as she had gazed into his when he had reached up to the carriage window at plymouth all guns loaded sir he thrust the memories away they could not help him now keep the hands out of sight just a few idlers gaping on the larboard gangway will suffice a natural thing eh tis not every day we see a true symbol of freedom joseph pineo the old sailingmaster nudged one of his three helmsmen but nobody else moved or spoke adam dragged out his watch and flicked open the guard beyond it he saw one of the young midshipmen taking huge breaths his eyes watering as he stared at the other ship plunging over the water suppose i am mistaken that there had been no declaration of war even though he and many others had expected it two ships passing and nothing more he said with this puff of extra wind i intend to come about and engage him on the starboard side he may anticipate it but he cannot prevent it he smiled suddenly we shall soon see if all our drills and exercises have had any value he looked again at his ship a lingering gaze full of questions hudson thought memories too missing faces pride and fear comradeship he bit his lip if the worst happened some of the pressed men might try to surrender he realised with a start that he was unarmed except for his hanger which his father had presented to him when he had joined anemone this will serve you well my boy as will your fine young captain what would his father think now he saw the captain raise his glass to study the other ship to gauge her approach the moment of embrace adam said i see him dick it is nathan beer right enough be ready to put the best marksmen aloft there may not be much time hudson was about to hurry away when something in the captains voice made him turn back if i fall fight the ship with everything you have he looked up at the white ensign streaming from the peak weve done so much together as he walked around the upper deck hudson was struck not by the tension but by the air of resignation anemone was fast if she could break off contact she might easily lose the yankee when dusk came where was the point in fighting and dying for a handful of poxy merchantmen hudson was young but he had heard that sentiment expressed often enough he paused by vicary who said quietly shes big aye but captain bolitho is just as experienced as this commodore beer i keep hearing about he clapped him on the arm and felt him jump vicary glanced at the nearest gun crew as they crouched below the gangway behind their sealed port are you not afraid hudson considered it his eyes never leaving the oncoming pyramid of sails im more afraid of showing it philip vicary held out his hand as if they had just met in a street or country lane in england then ill not let you down richard he stared beyond the vibrating shrouds to the empty blue sky though i fear ill not see another day hudson returned to the quarterdeck his friends words hanging in his mind like an epitaph adam said to him pass the word just as we discussed it we will come about and lay her on the starboard tack do they all understand those who count sir surprisingly adam grinned his teeth very white in his face by god dick we shall need everybody even that oaf baldwin stinking of rum in the sickbay though he might be hudson loosened his hanger and murmured good luck sir adam licked his lips and said i am as dry as dust then he stooped slightly to stare along the quarterdeck rail using it like a ruler as unitys long jibboom appeared around the tightly packed hammock nettings for the first time ready ho put the helm down helms alee sir even as the ship tilted to the thrust of wind and rudder adam found time to see one of the marines kneeling beside the hammocks with his long brown bess propped beside him turn to stare at his captain open the ports as one the gunportlids were hoisted on both sides of the ship the gun crews already ready at the tackle falls staring aft for the order run out like squealing pigs each carriage was hauled smartly to the side the black muzzles pointing at empty sea and sky while anemone continued to bear round across the wind mainsail haul adam strode across the tilting deck as the waiting marines swarmed up the shrouds and ratlines to the fightingtops on each mast we did it we did it instead of being on anemones quarter the big frigate was sliding past the bowsprit her sails in confusion as she prepared to follow suit she was running up two additional ensigns beer had not been completely unprepared steady hold her steady as she goes sir souwest by west adam stared until his eyes felt raw on the uproll without taking his eyes from unity he could picture each gun captain looking aft watching his raised fist every man with his triggerline bartaut fire the ship shook as if she had run aground as the guns hurled themselves inboard on their tackles and smoke funnelled through each of the starboard ports all tension was gone in an instant whooping like madmen the gun crews threw themselves into the drill over which they had cursed and sweated for months stop your vents sponge out load run out the gun was god nothing else mattered and each man in a crew had learned the hard way arms reached up through the drifting smoke ready but adam was watching the other ship the range was about a mile and a half too far for certain accuracy but he had seen unity s sails jerking or carrying away as the broadside had hissed over the water and raked her like a deathly wind adam raised his fist it was working three shots every two minutes fire wreckage splashed around unitys bows as she continued to come around smaller weapons were firing from her forecastle and adam glanced at the main course as a blackrimmed hole smacked through the canvas now unity was lying across the starboard quarter and continuing to turn gathering speed as her topmen fought to set the royals on her for extra speed not that she needed it fire adam grasped the rail as gun by gun the american began to retaliate with so many pressed men in the english ships beer had probably been surprised by anemones agility and confidence he winced as he felt the iron smashing into the hull or through the rigging overhead the boatswain and his crew were running this way and that marlin spikes and spare cordage already being put to good use unity still held the advantage if anemone stood away downwind to obtain more distance beer would send a full broadside through her stern if their positions remained the same it was only a matter of time gun for gun fire anemones one advantage was that by being downwind her guns could be elevated to the maximum every ball was finding a target and there were wild cheers as the americans forecastle was blasted into splinters and one of her bowchasers was hurled aside on to its crew the deck shuddered violently as the quarterdeck nettings were cut to pieces and scorched and slashed hammocks were flung across screaming marines who were tossed aside like bloody rags adam pulled a seaman to his feet get to it lad but the man stared at him emptily as if his mind had completely cracked hudson hatless his hanger already drawn hurried aft grapeshot sir aye adam wiped his mouth although it was so dry he could barely swallow hes a confident one not to use his heavier metal at this range the ship lurched again and he saw two guns upended tendrils of blood running across the deck where the crews had been cut down standto the third lieutenant clapped his hands to his chest and fell kicking to the deck vicary jumped forward to take his place fire as you bear the eighteenpounders recoiled down the side each gun captain seemed able to ignore the chaos and death men pulped by incoming shots while they crouched at the guns on the disengaged side adam did not even blink as two marines fell from the maintop to join the crawling pleading wounded and those who were already beyond aid hudson yelled get those guns working mr vicary lively now the lieutenant turned and peered aft through the thickening smoke like a drowning man reaching for a line load run out he staggered as shots hammered into the lower hull and more rigging fell on to the gangways to add to the destruction and chaos vicary looked up and stared with disbelief as the americans upper yards and punctured sails rose above the fog of gunfire like a cliff hudson retched and turned away as vicary fell his fingers clutching what a charge of canister had found and destroyed there was no face left even in this murderous hell hudson heard his mothers voice such an english face now in a split second he had become nothing sir the capns hit it was starr adams loyal coxswain fetch the surgeon hudson knelt beside him and gripped his hand easy sir hell soon be here adam shook his head his teeth bared against the pain no i must stay we must fight the ship hudson shouted to the sailingmaster let her fall off two points his brain cringed to the constant crash of shots hitting the hull but all he could think of was the captain he saw starr pulling open the coat with the bright epaulettes and swallowed as he saw the blood pumping out of adams side covering him encircling him like something foul and evil another great splintering crash and the roar of trailing rigging as the whole of the foremast went over the side taking sails broken planking and screaming men with it into the sea cunningham bent down and applied a dressing which within seconds was as bloody as his butchers apron he looked at hudson his eyes wild and afraid i can do nothing theyre dying like flies down below he ducked as more balls ripped overhead or exploded into lethal splinters against one of the guns adam lay quite still feeling his anemone being torn apart by the unwavering bombardment his mind kept fading away and he had to use all his remaining strength to bring it back there was little pain just a numbing deadness fight the ship dick the effort was too much oh dear god what must i do hudson stood up his limbs very loose unable to believe he was unmarked amongst so much suffering and death he raised his hanger and hesitated then with one slash he severed the ensigns halliards and in the sudden silence that followed he saw the flag running out to the full extent of the line until it floated above the water like a dying bird then there was cheering deafening it seemed from anemones bloodied and splintered decks hudson stared at the blade in his hand so much for glory nobody would use it to taunt them in defeat blindly he flung it over the disengaged side then knelt down again beside his captain adam said vaguely we held them off dick the convoy should be safe now in the dark he gripped hudsons hand with surprising strength it was our duty hudson felt the tears stinging his eyes the sunshine was as bright as before there was more movement as the great frigate came alongside and armed seamen swarmed across the deck as anemones company threw down their weapons hudson watched as the men he had come to know so well accepted defeat some were downcast and hostile others greeted the americans with something like gratitude an american lieutenant called here he is hudson saw the massive figure climbing up past the abandoned wheel even the sailingmaster had fallen always a quiet man he had died just as privately nathan beer looked around at the carnage on the quarterdeck you in charge hudson nodded remembering adam bolithos description of this man yes sir is your captain still alive he stood staring down at adams pale features for several seconds take him across mr rooke get our surgeon to see him right away to hudson he said you are now a prisoner of war there is nothing to be ashamed of you had no chance he watched as adam was carried away on a grating but you fought like tigers as i would have expected he paused like father like son the deck gave a lurch and someone called better clear the ship sir that was an explosion the boarding party were hastily rounding up their prisoners and dragging some of the wounded to the ship alongside starr the captains coxswain walked past he touched his hat to commodore beer and for only a second looked at hudson theyll not take his ship away from him now sir the deck was tilting over starr must have prepared anemone for this all on his own now she would never fight under an enemy flag and i shall never fight under mine as darkness covered the misty horizon and the unity still lay hoveto carrying out makeshift repairs anemone drifted clear and began to settle down stern first the lovely figurehead holding on to her last sunset how he had wanted it he thought of nathan beers quiet comment and did not understand like father like son he looked at his hands as they began to shake uncontrollably he was alive and he was ashamed every moment roused a fresh thrust of agony pain which defied even the need to breathe to think sound welled and faded and despite his inner torment adam bolitho knew he was in constant danger of losing consciousness even as his reeling mind told him he would not live if he did he was on board the ship which had defeated him but it was not like that at all voices cried and sobbed it seemed on every side although somehow he knew the awful din came from elsewhere as if through a great door muffled and full of anguish like the abyss of hell itself the air was still sharp with smoke and dust and strange lurching figures pushed past some so near that they brushed against his outflung arm once again he tried to move and the pain held him in an iron fist he heard another voice cry out and knew it was his own at the same time he knew he was naked yet could recall nothing of it only hudson holding him in his arms while the battle thundered all about the ship there was a vague recollection that his coxswain starr had not been with him he screwed up his eyes and tried to clear a part of his mind the foremast going over the side taking rigging and spars with it dragging the ship round like some great sea anchor and laying open her side to those murderous broadsides the ship what of anemone his hearing was returning or had it ever left him distant patient sounds men working with hammers blocks and their tackles squeaking in that other place where the sea was still blue the air free of smoke and the smell of charred rigging he raised his right hand but was almost too weak to hold it above his nakedness even his skin felt clammy already that of a corpse someone beyond that final door screamed not my arm then another scream which was suddenly cut short for him the door to hell had closed behind him there was a bandage wet and heavy with blood a hand reached out and grasped his wrist adam was helpless to protest keep still the voice was strained and sharp adam tried to lie flat on his back to hold the spreading fire in his side at bay hes coming now another said what the hell the dry stifling air moved slightly and another figure came to the table the ships surgeon when he spoke adam detected an accent french the man said i do not know your thoughts commodore he is the enemy he has taken the lives of many of your company what does it matter as if from far away adam recognised the strong voice beer he thought nathan beer what are his chances philippe im in no mood for lectures not today the surgeon gave a sigh it is an iron splinter the size of your thumb if i try to extract it he may well die if i do not it is a certainty i want you to save him philippe there was no response and he added with sudden bitterness remember i saved you from the terror did i say what does it matter almost brutally he continued your parents and your sister how was it again their heads were struck off and paraded on pikes to be jeered at and spat upon that mob was french was it not somebody held a sponge soaked in water against adams lips it was no longer cold or even cool and it tasted sour but as he moved his lips against it he thought it was like wine the commodore again was this all he carried the surgeon replied wearily that and his sword beer sounded surprised a womans glove i wonder adam gasped and tried to turn his head mmine his head fell back it was a nightmare he was dead nothing was real but that then he felt beers breath against his shoulder can you hear me captain bolitho he gripped adams right hand you fought bravely nobody could deny it i thought i would beat you into a quick submission save lives and with luck seize your ship but i misjudged you adam heard his own voice again faint and hoarse convoy you saved it he tried to lighten it that time but his voice remained immeasurably sad adam spoke only her name anemone shes gone nothing could be done to save her somebody was whispering urgently from the other world and beer grunted as he got to his feet i am needed he rested his big hand on adams shoulder but i will return adam did not see the quick glance at the french surgeon is there anyone he tried to shake his head zenoria her glove now she is dead he felt neat rum pouring into his mouth choking him making his mind reel still further through the waves of agony he heard the rasp of metal then felt the hard hands encircle his wrists and ankles like manacles the surgeon watched the leather strap being placed between adams teeth then he held up his hand and it was removed were you trying to speak msieur adam could not focus his eyes but he heard himself say distinctly i am sorry about your family a terrible thing his voice trailed away and one of the surgeons assistants said sharply it is time but the surgeon was still staring at the enemy captains pale features almost relaxed now as he fell into a faint he placed the palm of his hand on adams body and waited for one of his men to remove the bloodsodden dressing almost to himself he said thank you perhaps there is still hope left for some of us then with a nod to the others around the stained table he forced the probe into the wound his mind so inured to the agonies he had witnessed in ships and on the field of battle that even as he worked he was able to consider the young officer who writhed under his hands who had moved the formidable commodore beer to plead for his life on the very doorstep of hell he had still found the humanity to express sympathy for anothers suffering when he eventually went on deck it was pitch dark the heavens covered with tiny stars which were reflected only faintly in the dark waters and as far as the invisible horizon work on repairs and rerigging had ceased and seamen sprawled about the deck too exhausted to continue in the darkness it appeared as if corpses still lay where they had dropped while the air was still tinged with smoke and the smells of death the surgeon philippe avice was well aware that sailors could perform miracles and without even going into harbour unitys men would soon have their ship ready to sail and fight again only an experienced eye would be able to see the extent of the english frigates ferocity and the dead drifting falling like leaves into the oceans deeper darkness while the wounded waited enduring their pain and fear to see what another dawn might offer them he found commodore beer sitting at his table in the great cabin even here the enemys iron had left its mark there was no safe place above the waterline in a shipofwar but beers favourite portrait of his wife and daughters was back in its place and a clean shirt lay ready for the morning beer looked up his eyes hard in the lanternlight well the surgeon shrugged he is alive more i cannot say he took a glass of cognac from beers big hand he sipped it and pursed his lips very good beer smiled his eyes vanishing into the crowsfeet of many years at sea the cognac philippe or the fact that you have saved the life of an enemy avice shrugged again it is just that i was reminded of something even in war one should never forget it beer said after a pause his uncle would have been proud of him the surgeon raised his eyebrows you ave met the famous amiral who is said to risk his reputation as much as his life beer shook his head im getting too old for this game he glanced at one of the cannons that shared this cabin when the drums beat the hands to quarters it was still uncovered the barrel and tackles heavily smokestained no i never have but i will as sure as fate his head nodded with exhaustion and the surgeon slipped away quietly through the replaced screen door beer drifted thinking of the young frigate captain and the unknown girl named zenoria next time he wrote to his wife in newburyport he would tell her about them with something like a groan he pulled himself from the chair but first there were the ships needs to attend to damage to assess his men to be encouraged always the ship must come first captain adam bolitho had been ignorant of the declaration of war between the united states and england with nothing but instinct and youthful experience he had fought with a tenacity that might have turned the tables despite unity s superior artillery he picked up the glove and held it to the light so small a thing perhaps a mere gesture without significance to the woman but her loss had made bolitho throw away caution and prepare to fight his ship to the end in his minds eye beer could still see the beautiful barebreasted figurehead when anemone had finally given up the fight because her captain had nothing left to live for witness lieutenant george avery hesitated by the screen door and knew that the royal marine sentry was watching him with an unmoving stare above his head he could hear the muffled bark of orders the sounds of men hurrying to their stations for the last change of tack before entering english harbour he had been wondering what might be waiting for them here orders or a new appraisal of american intentions and the prospect of fresh fruit and the chance of stretching his legs on dry land had pleased him that had been before they had met with the convoy and had received news of anemone against orders the little brig woodpecker had returned under cover of darkness to the scene of the battle but had found nothing the brigs commander nicholas eames had come aboard indomitable without delay to make his report avery had known that bolitho was tearing himself apart because of what had happened eames had said anemone came about and went into the attack sir richard no hesitation no nothingyoud have been proud of him i am it was all he had said from what the brigs commander had been able to tell them there had been one main adversary with perhaps other vessels in company at first sir richard the gunfire was so heavy and fierce i imagined the enemy was a liner he had looked at their faces tyacke scarlett and his admiral and had added sadly but anemone could have run rings around one of those beauties so i knew it must be one of the new yankee frigates no wreckage or if there was it had drifted fast away with the current and then eames had described the one small miracle a survivor one of the ships boys more dead than alive he had been hauled aboard woodpecker it was a wonder he had lived avery glanced at the sentry the marine tapped the deck with his musket and called flaglieutenant sir the survivor had been transferred immediately to the flagship as eames had said my brig doesnt have the space for a surgeon indomitables surgeon philip beauclerk had insisted that the youth be allowed to rest in order to recover from the nightmare he had endured it was doubtful that one so young would ever completely get over it enter avery strode into the main cabin his eyes taking in bolithos breakfast tray scarcely touched a halffinished letter on his table an empty glass nearby captain tyackes respects sir richard and we shall be entering harbour within two hours i see is that all then bolitho stood up abruptly and said that was uncalled for i apologise abusing you when you cannot answer back is unforgivable avery was moved by the intensity of his words he seemed to speak with his whole body as if he could not bear to be still bolitho said two hours very well i must speak to this youth send alldayhe has a way with youngsters i have noticed that he rubbed his chin the skin smoothly shaved i have no cause to treat him badly either the finest of men a true friend ozzard appeared with fresh coffee and said i shall tell him sir richard bolitho slumped down again and pulled at his shirt as if it was choking him my little crew what am i without them he began to slip out of his coat but avery said no sir with respect i think this may be important to the lad your rank will not frighten him he has had enough terror i imagine bolitho said you are all surprises george did i choose you or was it the other way round avery watched his despair needing to help but unable to ease the way i believe lady catherine decided for both of us sir he saw bolitho glance quickly at the unfinished letter and knew he had not yet been able to bring himself to tell her outside the door allday and the roundshouldered secretary yovell stared down at the boy who had been snatched from the sea from death he was freshly clothed in a chequered shirt and white trousers the smallest the pursers store could produce the boy was very slight with frightened brown eyes and woodsplinter scars which had been cleaned by the sickbay allday said sternly now listen to me my lad ill not be saying anything twice you feel a bit sorry for yourself just now and that aint too surprising the boy watched him as a rabbit would stare at a fox what do they want of me sir in this cabin is the finest admiral englands ever had though precious few says as much he wants to ask you about what happened you just tell him son as if he was your father he saw yovell sigh as the boy began to sob me fathers drowned sir allday glared at yovell this is no damned good is it yovell put his hand on the boys shoulder come with me he sounded quite severe which was almost unknown with him answer the questions allday said tell it just as it was its important to him see ozzard watching from the door studied the small figure without expression to yovell he said you should have been a school teacher yovell smiled benignly i was that and other pursuits avery waited for the others to leave and murmured to allday that was well done to the boy he said gently sit here bolitho made himself remain very still as the boy sat on a chair directly opposite his table he looked terrified barely able to drag his eyes from the gold epaulettes and obviously overwhelmed by the vastness of an admirals quarters when compared with a frigates crowded messdeck what is your name whitmarsh sir he hesitated john whitmarsh and how old are you john the boy gaped at him but his hands had stopped shaking and his dark eyes were like saucers at being addressed by the admiral twelve i think sir he screwed up his face in an effort to concentrate i bin in anemone for eighteen months bolitho glanced at the piece of paper yovell had copied out for him and you lost your father aye sir he lifted his chin as if with pride at his memory he were a fisherman and got drowned off the goodwins now he had started he could not stop my uncle took me to plymouth and volunteered me for anemone they was recruiting see he hesitated nervously sir avery recognised the pain in bolithos grey eyes the boy must have been only about ten when his uncle put him in a kings ship if uncle he was it was too common a story these days women left to fend for themselves their men killed in battle or too badly wounded to return home or drowned like this lads father this boy had proved an obstacle to someone and had therefore been removed bolitho said tell me about the battle where were you what were you doing try to remember again he screwed up his eyes we sighted the enemy when the watches changed i heard old mr daniel the gunner say she were a big yankee there was another too a little one but the masthead couldnt make her out cause of the sea mist me an my friend billy was at the foremast sir the ship was that short of hands that even we was needed at the braces bolitho asked quietly how old was your friend same as me we come aboard together i see it was clear to him now as the woodpeckers commander had described adam had believed he must hold off the enemy until it was dark enough for the merchantmen to escape knowing that by then it would be too late for anemone he said so your ship came about to engage he saw the boy nod his eyes clouding with memories did you see your captain while all this was happening oh yes sir he was always about i went aft with a message an i heard him tell the first lieutenant to keep the marines hidden and not to rig the nets in case the yankee guessed what we was doin then he smiled it was the nicest thing which had happened he said our captain was scared o nuthin go on the boy opened and closed his tarstained fingers then the firin started sir we got the first shots off but the big yankee found the range and we was hit again an again spars an riggin was fallin all around and men was dyin callin outthere was blood in th scuppers like ive never seen voices called overhead and bare feet thudded across the planking indomitable was changing tack making for the harbour but to this boy it was like the battle being refought the foremast was shot away an the whole of the forecastle was covered in riggin and sails fallin on us like somethin terrible he turned and looked at avery for the first time we couldnt move sir men was fightin to get out others went over the side caught like they was in a net i was held fast i tried i tried bolitho held up his hand as avery began to move forward did you see the captain when he fell sir he repeated in a small voice broken by sobs when he fell bolitho waited his muscles bunched like fists adam had fallen and only this boy had survived to describe it he stared at him blindly as he continued then the other ship was hard alongside sir the enemy was tramplin aboard but our flag had been cut down we was finished you are doing very well bolitho glanced despairingly at the flaglieutenant did anyone help the captain the boy nodded they carried him to the other ship he nodded again i seen em he looked at bolitho remembering where he was what he was doing then there was an explosion we started to sink bolitho stood up and walked to the stern windows an explosion after the colours had been cut down somebody unknown acting as adam would have done rather than surrender his beloved anemone i cant remember much after that sir i called out but nobody came there was dead men all around and even wounded who never reached the upper deck i held on to billy an together we floated off with some spars when the ship went under then the tears came and did not stop he managed to gasp but billy didnt answer me he just drifted away i think hed been dead all the time bolitho said abruptly take him down to the sickbay and see that he gets a good meal before we anchor then he changed his mind and found himself crossing the cabin to the chair pulling out one of the handkerchiefs catherine had bought for him he gave it to the boy avery watched it was like being under a spell and he could not speak or interrupt bolitho said so softly that the boy had to stop his tears to listen your captain is my nephew he is very dear to me as you were to your father it does not bring back friends but if it is any help what you have told me has given me hope do you understand he nodded his streaming eyes never leaving bolithos face allday padded in silently and shook his head when the boy looked up at him he said well let me tell you matey no admiral ever spoke to me like that an thats no error he seized him by the top of his shirt and added well go an take a look at the pantry eh as the door closed and ozzard reentered with two glasses on a tray bolitho sat down on the bench seat as if the deck had been cut from under him that man really is a marvel i agree sir to himself avery added and so as it happens are you bolitho drank from the glass without tasting it we shall go on deck george it is a sight i never tire of avery asked carefully where you met lady catherine sir bolitho looked at him the life like hope returning to his eyes where i found her when i thought i had lost her for ever then he said over his shoulder i am not a fool i know the odds as well as you do but he was alive right avery followed him up to the bright sunshine do not hope too much he thought suddenly of catherine and the endearment he had once overheard dearest of men it was all true he had just seen him bring a twelveyearold boy back from the dead as a man later with the ship anchored and surrounded by lighters and dockyard boats avery sat propped in his hutchlike cabin while he sorted the despatches into coherent order the courier brig had not only brought important intelligence for the admiral but also some mail which seemed to have gone around the world before reaching its proper destination there was a tap at the door and avery opened it with one foot without getting up it was allday he said begging your pardon mr avery but i got a letter he held it out his face baffled and worried sit down on that chest if you like you dont mind sir but i knows youve been busy what with young captain adam and everything of course not he rather enjoyed it it was as if he was getting a letter of his own if there had been someone who cared enough to write he said pour yourself a drink and slit open the envelope it was badly stained probably the vessel which had been carrying it had been damaged in the atlantic gales the mail transferred to another he could see her now my dear john it seems so long since i heard allday waited perched on the edge of the brassbound chest what is it sir is something wrong tell me please avery leaned over and poured a glass of brandy he said congratulations john allday allday was frowning whats happened avery held out the letter and pushed the glass towards him youve become a father that is whats happened man allday stared blindly at her round handwriting a baby shes had a baby avery smiled you stay here and enjoy your wet ill lay aft to the admiral i think this news is just what he needs butbut allday waved the letter after him boy or girl sir avery thought of lady catherine clambering up indomitables side while the sailors had cheered he replied simply a little girl your wife wants to call her kate the door closed and then allday did pick up the brandy well ill be damned he grinned at the cabin well ill be doubledamned bolitho looked up from his table as tyacke entered the cabin his hat tucked beneath his arm with your permission id like to weigh before noon mr york insists the wind is about to veer and freshen although for the life of me i dont know how he can tell bolitho said i think we shall have to be guided james i have no wish to linger here in antigua three days since their return and still no word of anemones final moments apart from the description offered by the boy john whitmarsh anemones company had been taken prisoner but there had been no official confirmation three days and he had thought of little else save adams fate if badly wounded then how badly if he had survived would he be exchanged for an american prisoner if any of equal rank had been taken he watched yovells pen scratching out the final copy of his orders to the captains of his overstretched squadron he had sent off a plea to the admiralty for another frigate to replace anemone he suspected there was little chance of getting one he could almost hear his own words when he had spoken his thoughts aloud to the assembled powers there the end of the fixed line of battle the coming of age of a faster more powerful frigate commodore nathan beerand in his heart bolitho had never doubted it was unity which had been after the jamaica convoy had more than proved that how many more did the americans have or intend to build apart from valkyrie and indomitable he had nothing that could stand against them determination and skilled seamanship had always been expected to succeed against odds but the americans massive firepower and impressive gunnery had already scattered several local convoys it had put the leeward squadron on the defensive no war could be won while their strength was divided by fruitless searches and hazy intelligence the americans were obviously intent on attacking canada just as the british were determined to increase their military strength by every means available the admiralty had sent lists of possible routes and times of arrival of military convoys all of which would eventually make their landfalls at halifax the americans would know as much of these movements as the british such activity was impossible to conceal it was also known that the americans were mustering smaller menofwar for use on the great lakes to find them would be like looking for a needle in the proverbial haystack bolitho had used zest and reaper to strengthen dawes flotilla out of halifax apart from the local patrols mostly brigs and commandeered schooners that left only indomitable and the gun frigate attacker to liaise with the convoy escorts from jamaica these convoys had already been reduced to two a month because of the very real threat from the americans who had nothing to protect and to whom every ship was a possible target and prize in a moment of frustration and anger bolitho had exclaimed to tyacke our nel was right james the best form of defence is attack so let us find their lair and go for them and to hell with the risk tyacke could see the logic of it if they had to divide their small squadron after each enemy sortie they would soon be too weak to offer any protection at all a week before the attack on anemone they had stopped and questioned a brazilian trader her master had reported sighting a force of american menofwar two large frigates and two other smaller vessels steering south possibly from philadelphia fearing for his own safety the brazilian had gone about to retrace his course to the bermudas two large frigates could one of them have been the unity and if so where were the others bolitho said i am poor company today james tyacke regarded him impassively supposei mean just suppose his fingers played with the tarnished buttons of his faded seagoing coat bolitho said sharply you have more experience of lonely command than any man i know speak outthis is the time tyacke walked to the stern windows and watched a cutter being warped around the stern ready to be hoisted aboard in harbour it was usual to lower all boats otherwise their seams opened in the relentless heat at sea it was sensible to keep them partly filled with water for the same reason everyone knows about us sir more especially about you with captain bolitho taken prisoner and many of his people wouldnt it seem obvious to the enemy that you would take some action direct action bolitho shrugged it is what i would like tyacke rubbed his chin and they will expect it with indomitable gone what chance would our ships stand bolitho stared at him you mean that this ship will be marked down as the next victim he saw it suddenly his mind clearing that is good sense he stood up and leaned over the chart yovell continued to write without a pause except to dip his nib the bermudas a likely area for the americans to gather no english menofwar there they rely on their garrison and the reef tyacke glanced at the chart curiously why none of our ships sir there is no water there none apart from the seasonal rainfall they have to conserve it as best they can tyacke gave a reluctant smile that i didnt know sir it was as close to admiration as he could come perhaps i am wrong perhaps i am presuming too much to base our strategy on the word of a sailingmaster who sells fruit for a living he tapped yovells plump shoulder i want to send fresh instructions to captain dawes in valkyrie they can go in the schooner reynard when she leaves tyacke saw the animation and eagerness returning to his tanned features we shall muster a convoy and the world shall know about it and indomitable shall sail to meet it it is not for me to say but but that word again and it is for you to say what you think you are my flagcaptain and we must share our views tyacke watched him warily views yes and i am proud of that trust but the responsibility lies with you dont stop james responsibility is something i am used to tyacke said then speak my mind i will sir he stabbed the chart with his finger here halifax his finger moved down the coastline boston new york and right here philadelphia if i was the yankee commander this is exactly the area i would choose with philadelphia to run to for repairs or protection if things went wrong he raised his eyes to bolitho but suppose in a manner of speaking captain dawes in his big frigate decided not to act on your instructions without question if a convoy of soldiers was the real target and he left it without an escort for the final approach he might feel that his head was the one on the block not yours he is a resourceful captain james but you know that tyacke responded bluntly he is also ambitious and the son of an admiral the two together are dangerous bedfellows that was outspoken he smiled to soften it i like that but dawes is acting secondincommand i have to rely on him he paused i have no choice nor do i have justification to believe otherwise tyacke looked round sharply as the sentry announced the arrival of the first lieutenant yes mr scarlett cannot it wait scarlett answered hesitantly the last fresh water is inboard sir he glanced at bolitho i am sorry for the intrusion sir richard as the door closed tyacke snapped i apologise sir richard i shall have a gentle word with that one he calmed himself then i shall see that your despatches are put aboard the schooner indomitable swung lightly to her cable perhaps yorks prediction was already making itself felt a shaft of strong sunlight probed through the quarter windows and tyacke saw bolitho flinch from it and turn away can i help sir bolitho sat down and pulled out a handkerchief reminding tyacke poignantly of the one he had given to the boy tyacke turned the chair for him so that he faced away from the glare bolitho said quietly you know dont you have known ever since you took command as my flagcaptain tyacke met his gaze equally unflinching dont blame avery sir he thought he was doing the right thing for me and the ship he turned aside as if suddenly conscious of his terrible scars if you will excuse me sir i have much to do bolitho followed him and stopped him by the screen door do you regret it tell me the truth well i didnt do it out of pity sir surprisingly he grinned regret it ill speak my mind when we run that damned yankee to earth he was still smiling as he shut the door behind him bolitho touched his eye and waited for the pain but there was none he sat again deeply moved by tyackes words the very strength of his concern a truly remarkable man that night while indomitable thrust her heavy bows into open sea bolitho awoke with that same dream still fixed in his mind carrick roads and pendennis castle the ships as clear and familiar as ever each one taking in her cable where bound who manned these phantom ships there was an additional vessel this time with the gilded figurehead he knew so well daughter of the wind and when she swung to her cable he saw that it was zenoria even then as he fought his way out of the dream he heard her last scream all right sir richard it was allday his powerful frame leaning over with the ship bolitho held on to the cot as his feet touched the deck tell me something old friend do you think he is still alive allday padded after him to the stern windows the moon was making a ragged silver path on the lively crests so that was what troubled him he thought as much or more than ever all this time with officials and officers coming and going with their offers or demandsmostly the latter no doubtplanning what he should do placing his ships where they would make the most difference he had been fretting about captain adam his nephew but more of a son a friend than anyone else really knew then he walked to the swordrack and waited for the moonlight to touch the old blade he had proudly buckled or clipped into place before so many fights so many deeds which he had shared when were gone sir richard he knew bolitho was watching him in the eerie light an we cant live for ever nor have i a mind to this old blade will be his must be he heard him say quietly his voice suddenly calm again aye old friend the last of the bolithos allday watched him climb into his cot he seemed to fall asleep instantly allday smiled the squall was over the storm still to come loneliness lady catherine somervell rose from the tall leatherbacked chair and walked to the window down in the street in front of the admiralty main building it was raining quite heavily she toyed with one of the thick gold ropes that held the curtains and watched people hurrying for shelter heavy cleansing rain thinning the traffic causing steam to rise from the dirty cobbles refreshing the avenues of trees so richly green on this late summers day she turned and glanced at the empty fireplace the old paintings of seabattles richards world she shook her head rejecting the antiquated ships no more his fathers navy she had learned much merely by listening by being with him just as he had shared her london and she hoped learned to enjoy it in a manner he had not found possible before she studied herself in a gilded tall lookingglass imagining nervous sea officers here examining their reflections before being summoned to meet whichever admiral would decide their fate a plain green gown the hem and sleeves of which were spotted with rain even as she had alighted from the carriage she wore a widebrimmed hat with a matching green ribbon she had dressed with care as she always did not from vanity or conceit but out of defiance and because of richard sixteen months now and the ache was as cruel as ever the room was much as she had expected it would be unwelcoming aloof from the rest of the building a place of decisions where mens lives could be changed with the stroke of a pen she could imagine him here as a very young captain perhaps or afterwards as a flagofficer when their affair had become common knowledge the whole world knew about them now she half smiled but the admiralty would not be impressed by her position in his life or by her rank if anything happened to richard it was ironic that belinda would be the first to be told officially over the months she had kept busy helping ferguson or independently with her own projects but each day was an eternity her rides on tamara her only escape she had not been near the cliff path and trystans leap since the day of zenorias death an old servant stood now between the tall double doors catherine had not noticed him nor heard the doors open sir graham bethune will see you now my lady he bowed slightly as she passed him she could almost hear him creak sir graham bethune strode to meet her she had resented the fact that he had once been one of richards midshipmen in his first command even though he had explained the complexities governing seniority it still seemed deeply unfair only one rank lower than richard and yet he was a lord of admiralty a power who could help or dismiss as he chose but bethune was not what she had expected he was slim energetic and was wearing a genuine smile to greet her suddenly and rather unwillingly she understood why richard had liked him my dear lady somervell this is indeed an honour when i heard you were in chelsea and i received your little note i could scarce believe my good fortune catherine sat in the proffered chair and regarded him calmly he was charming but he was quite unable to hide his curiosity and the interest of a man in a beautiful woman she said we were deeply concerned at falmouth to learn of anemones loss i thought that if i came in person you might give me more newsif there is any sir graham we will take refreshment in a moment lady somervell he walked to his desk and rang a small bell yes we have indeed received more news first by telegraph from portsmouth yesterday and then confirmed by courier he turned and rested his buttocks on the table it is much as i expected after the sinking the american frigate unity took what prisoners could be saved from anemone and because of her own damage was forced to cancel any further attempts on our convoy it was a brave act on captain bolithos part it will not go unrewarded she put her hand on her breast and saw his glance follow it and linger there for a few seconds she said then he is alive a servant entered with a tray he did not look at either of them bethune watched the servant opening the bottle with the deftness of one who was called to perform the task often i was told that you enjoy champagne my lady i think we have something to celebrate dont you agree she waited bethune was probably imagining other reasons for her concern he said he was badly wounded but our informants have told us that thanks to the american commodore he was well cared for he hesitated for the first time we are still uncertain as to the extent of his injury catherine took the tall glass and felt its coolness through her glove word for word richards letter was engraved on her memory adams arrival at english harbour and his anguish at the news of zenorias death it was like some playlet in which they all had lines to speak richard and his dead brother adam and zenoria and yet to come valentine keen bethune held his glass to the window we have not been told officially what the americans intend captain bolitho in the normal course of events would be exchanged with one of our prisoners however as a frigate captain of some stature with many prizes and successes to his credit they might decide to keep him if only in a mood of selfcongratulation or perhaps to goad his uncle into some reckless action has he written to that effect my lady you know him do you not you should not need to ask me he smiled and refilled her glass true then he said i hope you will do me the honour of allowing me to escort you to a reception he hurried on as if he already knew that she would refuse sir paul sillitoe whom i believe you know wishes to celebrate his new title he goes to the house of lords shortly he will be a powerful adversary there by god is a powerful adversary she thought i cannot be certain sir graham she smiled faintly would not your reputation be a trifle smudged by me he looked away and for only an instant she saw the freckled midshipman it was quickly past i would relish your company lady somervell she said the rain is finished and here comes the sun i worship it despite what it once tried to do to us he nodded gravely the golden plover yes i understand may i enquire as to your plans for the remainder of the day she faced him unmoved by the hint in his tone i shall interview a new personal maid sir graham but first i must go to st jamess the palace my lady she held out her gloved hand and felt him lingering over it then she laughed no the wine shop of course long after a servant had accompanied her downstairs bethune stood staring after her his secretary entered and placed some papers on the desk he said there is bad news sir graham he waited patiently for his lord and master to notice him bethune asked did you see her man he seemed to realise what his secretary had said what news not confirmed sir graham but we have received a despatch concerning our frigate guerriиre of guns which was overwhelmed and captured by the uss constitution after a fight lasting only two hours bethune stood up again and walked to his window you are a melancholy fellow saunders you make it sound both trivial and disgraceful in the same breath only two hours you say i have endured just such a trivial amount of time he swung away from the window believe me it is like hell as you say sir graham he dismissed the unctuous insincerity recalling instead bolithos voice in this very building and the disbelief even amusement in the room when the role of the fixed line of battle had been criticised they might think differently now a frigate was already reported missing in the caribbean with anemone destroyed and now guerriиre beaten and captured so easily some might remember bolithos words he looked out of the window again but her carriage had gone then he smiled picked up catherines halfempty glass and put his lips where hers had been aloud he said we shall see by the time catherine reached chelsea the sky had cleared and the houses along the thames embankment were basking in brilliant sunshine once more young matthew lowered the step and offered his hand to assist her his eyes everywhere like a watchful terrier ill put the wine in the house once ive taken care of the horses mlady she stopped by the steps and looked at him you hate london dont you matthew he grinned sheepishly not used to it mladythats all i suppose she smiled only until next week then we shall go home to falmouth matthew watched her open the front door and sighed she was doing too much taking too much on herself just like him catherine pushed open the door and stopped dead in the entrance hall there was a goldlaced hat on the hall table like richards the new girl lucy came bustling from beneath the stairs wiping her mouth with her hand flustered by her mistresss unexpected return sorry mladyi should have been here ready like catherine barely heard her who is here it could not be he would have let her know somehow if only lucy glanced at the hat unaware of its significance he said you wouldnt mind mlady he said he would leave his card if you didnt come otherwise hed wait in the garden she asked who lucy was a decent girl she had been recommended by nancy but another sophie she was not good in the house and as a personal maid but slow and sometimes maddening in her inability to think for herself catherine brushed past her and walked blindly down the passage to the garden door valentine keen was standing by the wall in profile to her only his hand moving as he stroked the neighbours cat unfamiliar in his rearadmirals uniform his fair hair bleached almost white from the african sun only when he heard her footstep on the terrace did he turn and she saw the change in him deep shadows beneath his eyes the harsh lines around his mouth which even a smile failed to erase she said dear val im so glad you waited i had no idea she clasped him in her arms how long have you been back he held her tightly with affection or desperation it could have been either a few days ago i came to portsmouth i was told you were in london i thought i must see her the words seemed to jerk out of him but she did not interrupt who could have told him she was in london arm in arm they walked around the small garden with the sounds of london beyond the wall she said you should be careful of that cat he uses his claws when you play with him keen looked at her searchingly your letter was such a help to me i wish it had not fallen on your shoulders he swallowed hard she was buried in zennor how so you must not mind my asking i still cannot accept it she said gently there was no proof of suicide val it may have been an accident the church could not begrudge her a grave in her own parish churchyard i see catherine thought of the reluctant curate the bishop had been signalling his disapproval because it was rumoured that the girl had taken her own life the magistrate was very definite her death resulted from misadventure it is small comfort i know but she rests in peace roxby had been the magistrate otherwise and you were there i should have known you would be she waited knowing what was coming next he asked were some of my family at zennor when she was buried there were flowers do not feel bitter about it there was grief enough i expect he did not reply he was going over it again and again try ing to understand the reasons trying to assemble the truth even if he could never accept it he said i loved her so even she never knew how much i think she did val i must go there and see the grave as soon as i have dealt with things here he looked at her his face drawn as though grief had made him ill will you come with me catherine to that church where we were married of course there is no stone yet that is for you to decide she held his arm not daring to look at him of course i will come after a time he said you went to the admiralty was there any news of adam he is alive and a prisoner of war it was all they knew we can only hope she told him what bethune had said and keen murmured i expect they know more than they care to make public then he turned and looked at her there is to be a reception for sir paul sillitoe i was told of it today she forced a smile i know i was invited to attend she thought of bethunes eyes when he had mentioned it perhaps she had imagined what she saw there but she had never known a man she could trust completely except one keen said then let us go together catherine nobody could say anything about it and under the circumstances he did not continue as if someone else had answered she heard herself say my dear i would be honoured richard would understand and he would know that he might need friends like sillitoe where their power carried real weight keen said suddenly how is richard he worries about me and about adam about his men and his duty she smiled i would not change him even if i could the light had dimmed more rain i think we had better go inside the housekeeper was waiting ominously by the stairs and lucy could be heard sobbing somewhere the housekeeper glanced incuriously at catherines hand on the rearadmirals sleeve she said just broke two more cups mlady god that girl will put me in the poorhouse she softened slightly ill fetch some tea they sat by the window and watched the leaves shiver to the first heavy drops of rain the cat had disappeared catherine said there was talk of your removal to a house in plymouth he shrugged no longer the flagofficer there is expected to have a wife by his side with sudden bitterness he added it will be another sea appointment for me it cannot be soon enough for my liking have you seen your father yet he shook his head when i leave you i shall go i am sure he will be working late in the city she wanted to hold him like a child or like richard ease his grief heal his despair there was no one else he said i should have known dont you see i had so many plans for her the boy too i never once asked her what she wanted she was like you catherine a living precious creature she might have been lost in my world she never told me i never asked her the housekeeper came in with the tea and departed without a glance or a word keen was saying if i had only been with her he looked at her sharply she did take her own life is that not true please i must know the truth she was not herself val he stared down at his hands i knew it i should have seen the dangers all along she asked quietly do you remember cheney the girl richard married and lost he hesitated yes i remember her even though we are denied marriage and the acceptance of societyeven though marriage may have scarred useven though such things are impossible we found one another again richard and i might not good fortune take your hand too val and give you happiness once more he got to his feet and released her hand i must leave now catherine i feel better for speaking with you stronger in some way he did not look at her if there was ever such a good fortune and things i have seen of late make me doubt it then i could hope for no more admirable a woman than one like you she walked with him to the door knowing very well what he had really meant he was not just attractive and amusing company in other circumstances it went much deeper it would not be difficult to love a man like him i shall ask matthew to take you he picked up his hat and looked at it ruefully she thought he said thank you but my carriage is waiting in the mews she smiled you did not wish to set the tongues awagging by leaving it at my door on the steps he took her hand and kissed it gently few passersby took any notice of them nor could they or he she thought ever guess at her true emotions as he turned the corner catherine stared across the river remembering those other times the vauxhall pleasure gardens laughter through the trees and the dancing lanterns kisses in the shadows she touched her throat dearest of men come back to me soon soon the tray of tea still lay untouched on the table sir paul sillitoe held out his arms so that guthrie his valet could help him into his fine silk coat as he did so he glanced at his reflection in the windows guthrie brushed his shoulders and nodded with approval very nice sir paul sillitoe listened to the sound of music from the wide terrace where the reception would be held the whole place seemed to be full of flowers his housekeeper had not spared the purse for this occasion it was all sheer extravagance he smiled at his reflection but he felt elated lightheaded even an alien sensation for one so habitually controlled he could hear carriages already clattering into his large driveway friends enemies people with favours to ask once he had consolidated his position in the lords power not popularity was the key to most challenges he thought he watched the opposite bank of the thames the great curve of chiswick reach still holding the late sunshine there would be torches on the terrace champagne and endless dishes for the guests to sample more expense this time he could not take it seriously why had she decided to come to congratulate him it was unlikely for a favour then or on some personal mission or intrigue like the secret she had shared with him even before bolitho knew it when she had asked for his help on the death of her hated father in that stinking slum in whitechapel quakers passage that was the name how could she ever have lived there as a child but she was coming and with rearadmiral valentine keen another friend of bolithos or was he with his young wife deadand sillitoes agents had insisted that she had taken her own lifemight he not look to the lovely catherine for comfort if he held out such hopes she would soon dissuade him sillitoe thought and if he persisted his next appointment might well take him back to africa and beyond he patted his stomach flat and hard unlike so many men he knew he took care to use his energy in play as well as work he enjoyed riding and walking for the latter he usually had his secretary marlow trotting beside him while he outlined the letters and despatches for the day it saved time swordsmanship was another of his interests and he was rarely beaten in mock duels at the academy where he exercised and if the need commanded him he would go to a particular house where he was known to the proprietor and her girls and where his peccadilloes would be respected when he received his title he would have achieved everything he had planned and would still retain his influence over the prince regent when he was eventually crowned king a complete life then he thought of catherine somervell again perhaps it still could be his valet saw him frown and asked is something amiss sir paul i shall go down guthrie it would be churlish not to be present from the beginning as his guests were announced sillitoe smiled and said much the same to each one not precisely a welcome but an acknowledgement that they came out of respect or fear the thought gave him immense satisfaction his eyes moved restlessly to the great arched entrance then to the bewigged footmen sweating in their heavy coats as they bustled with trays of glasses while others stood at the long tables of food bowing over their charges like priests at an altar loaded with offerings viceadmiral sir graham bethune and his fraillooking wife two or three generals and their ladies politicians and merchants from the city rearadmiral keens father had at first been unable to accept the invitation pleading a previous engagement sillitoe had seen to that the footman tapped his staff on the marble floor the viscountess somervell a pause and rearadmiral valentine keen the noise of conversation faded away like surf dying on a beach as sillitoe took her hand and kissed it it was so gracious of you to come lady catherine she smiled how could i not sillitoe offered his hand to keen it is good to have you back at home sir tragic news of course my sincere condolences to catherine he said i will see you again very shortly his eyes lingered on the diamond fan at her breast you do me too much honour catherine and her escort walked out on to the terrace as the conversation buzzed into life once more keen said i am never certain of that man you are not the first val she took a goblet from a tray or the last it is as well to be wary of him she had not expected to be participating in any social activities during what had been intended as a brief visit to london and had brought only one suitable evening gown a particular favourite of richards it was of kingfisherblue satin so that her piled hair seemed to reflect in it as if she stood above moving water but it was cut very low and she knew that the sunburns she had suffered in the shipwreck were still visible after nearly four years so long she thought how could the time have passed so quickly she would not allow herself to dwell on the precious hours and days she had spent with richard since then because they could never be relived could never be had back again the torches were lit and the lights and the river reminded her sharply of the pleasure gardens where she had taken him to her surprise she recognised valentine keens father who had been ushered in without any announcement and presented to sillitoe she heard sillitoe say silkily i am so gratefulyou changed your arrangements neither of them smiled sillitoe glanced up at an overly ornate clock and left his place by the doors then he saw them and came to join them taking a glass as he passed a footman i have done my part as host lady catherine now let me bask in the light which you seem to create wherever you go he barely glanced at keen your father is here sir he craves a word i think it may be useful if you oblige him keen made his excuses and left to look for his father he had said nothing of his relationship with the rest of his family but he appeared angry at the interruption was that true sir paul he looked directly at her of course but i do see a rift between father and son which is a pity over the girl from zennor no doubt no doubt she refused to be drawn why sir paul it was viceadmiral bethune with his wife may we both offer our congratulations but his eyes moved too often to catherine bethunes wife said a pity sir richard cannot be so rewarded for all that he has done for england sillitoe was for once caught off guard i am not certain what she said rudely a peerage such as yours sir paul after all lord nelson was so honoured bethune said angrily you have no right catherine took another glass of champagne and found a few seconds to thank the footman she was inwardly burning with anger but her voice was quite calm if sir richard and i were parted madam he would still not return to his wife but then i am certain you know that already bethune almost dragged his wife away and catherine heard him muttering do you desire to ruin me sillitoe said i should have prevented it i know something of that womans spite catherine smiled but her heart was still beating furiously no wonder bethune had eyes for other women he surely deserved better sillitoe said abruptly let me show you something of the house she said very well but not for too long it would be discourteous to my escort he smiled you seem to have a habit of provoking sea officers my dear they walked along a colonnade and up a staircase which was bare of any paintings except one of a man in dark clothing a sword with an outdated basket hilt at his hip despite the neat spanishstyle beard and the clothing it could have been her companion he was watching her profile the smooth curve of her breasts her breathing shown only by the diamond pendant my father she looked at it more closely it was strange that she knew nothing about this man but his present power and his confident use of that power it was as though a door or a locked chest had been opened for the first time what was he like i barely knew him my mother was in poor health and he insisted we were in the west indies as little as possible i yearned to be with him instead i was sent to school where constant bullying taught me that it was sometimes necessary to hit back she turned her head to change the light on the portrait even the same hooded compelling stare the west indies he had mentioned his estates in jamaica and elsewhere he was obviously very wealthy but still lacked satisfaction she said was he a man of business or a courtier like his son he took her arm and guided her to a wide balcony which overlooked the terrace with its flickering torches and the river beyond he gave a harsh laugh he was a slaver a black ivory captain the best she heard her gown hissing against the balustrade the din of voices from the terrace it looked so far away you are not disagreeable to that lady catherine they were different days she thought suddenly of tyacke coming to their rescue in his brig larne there will always be slaves no matter what people promise and pretend he nodded a wise head as well as a beautiful one they reached the end of the balcony and she said i think we must go back certainly he seemed to be grappling with something i must say lady catherine that you are quite lovely i can take care of youyou would want for nothing there would be no more scandal no harm done to you by simpering fools like bethunes wife believe me i would see to that she stared at him can you see me as your mistress what it would do to the one and only man i love he gripped her arms as a wife lady catherine that is what i am asking you as a wife she released herself gently and slipped her arm through his i am sorry sir paul i thought i can imagine he pressed her arm against his side let me hope you overwhelm me she glanced at his face but saw only the man in the portrait once i came to you for aid i shall not forget but do not hurt me or richard if i decline ah your escort is approaching she turned but sillitoe seemed quite composed it was as though she had imagined all of it when he had withdrawn keen asked suspiciously what happened i was concerned for you she saw heads turning mouths whispering behind fans on this humid summers night she thought of sillitoes words his cool pride for his father he showed me some of the house and you my father had some wild plan for me to leave the navy he has just signed a deed of contract with the east india company expansion progress you know the kind of language he uses catherine watched him with sudden concern he had been drinking rather heavily and had lost some of the confidence she had seen in chelsea keen said he doesnt understand the navy is my life my only life now the war will not last for ever but until it ends i shall stand in the line of battle as i have been entrusted to do his voice was louder than he had intended she said gently you speak very much like richard he rubbed his eyes as if they were hurting him richard oh richard how i do envy you sillitoe appeared as if by magic you are leaving lady catherine his glance flickered to keen are you quite safe she offered her hand and watched him kiss it like an onlooker safe sir paul she touched the diamond pendant on her breast i am always that she knew he was still watching them as matthew brought the carriage smartly around the drive to the steps an eventful evening and a disturbing one she would write to richard about it no secrets there never would be between them keen leaned against her and she guessed he was falling asleep the ride from portsmouth london and then his father trying to force his plans on him again did he have no remorse no sense of shame that zenoria had been allowed to throw herself away while in the care of the family she watched the trees flitting past in the moonlight and wondered where indomitable lay what richard was doing she felt keens face on her shoulder drowsy but not asleep she could smell something stronger than champagne his fathers idea no doubt she pressed her head back against the cushions and tried to hold her breath as she felt his lips on her skin gentle and yet more insistent as he murmured oh catherine he pressed his lips on the curve of her breast and kissed her again his breath hot desperate catherine clenched her fists and stared into the shadows his fingers were on her gown she could feel it moving her breast rising out of it to his mouth then his hand fell across her legs and with great care she moved him back on to his seat she rapped on the roof and when matthew answered she called we shall take the admiral to his fathers house you all right mlady she smiled but her heart made it a lie and readjusted the gown i am always safe matthew she waited for her breathing to steady it had been a near thing the thought shocked and disturbed her was that what loss and loneliness could do when they reached the keen town residence in a quiet leafy square she watched a footman hurrying down the steps to meet the carriage was he always there night and day just in case someone arrived the idea made her want to laugh she touched keens shoulder and waited for him to recover himself she knew that if she allowed it there were more likely to be tears which she would be unable to stop keen said shall you come in and meet my father no it is late she could sense matthew listening and added i leave for falmouth shortly he took her arm and peered at her in the darkness i wronged you dear catherine i was beside myself she put her finger on his lips i am not a piece of stone val he shook his head youll never trust me again i must have been a fool she said i will take you to zennor so i must trust you he kissed her on the mouth and she could feel herself tensing until just as gently he moved away matthew flicked the reins and watched the house slide away into darkness what would they say in falmouth if they could see him driving to all these fine houses and places theyd never even heard of he thought of the young officer he had just delivered and relaxed slightly before pushing a heavy cudgel back under his cushion admiral or not if he had laid a finger on her ladyship hed not have woken up for a week then whistling softly between his teeth he turned the horses heads once more towards the river change of allegiance on the morning of september rd the shadows began to recede and for the first time in the three months since he had been cut down on anemones quarterdeck captain adam bolitho realised he would live the weeks and months had been as vague and as terrifying as a hundred nightmares people who were only phantoms or perhaps only figments of his imagination seemed to come and go sharp stabs of agony when he had to bite his lip to prevent himself from crying out fingers and probes in the depth of his wound like fire which even drugs could not placate in his reeling mind he had tried to keep some sort of record from the moment he had been carried aboard the big enemy frigate to the ships eventual arrival at the delaware river and his journey by coach to philadelphia apart from unitys french doctor he had recalled no visitor but for the massive shadow of commodore nathan beer and one other just before he had been lowered down by tackle into a cutter alongside he had found his first lieutenant richard hudson waiting to say goodbye before he was landed with the other prisoners i wish you well sir may god speed your recovery he had faltered and had then murmured and your release it had been like listening to two strangers adam thought as if he had already died of his wound but was still clinging to the world unable to accept his nonexistence he had heard himself his voice harsh as he gritted his teeth to hold the pain under control iorderedyoutofightthe ship hudson had replied hoarsely our ship was finished sir adam had felt his strength returning and his voice was surprisingly steady my ship anemone was never yours you struck the colours you surrendered the ship an orderly had murmured something and an armed seaman had touched hudsons arm to lead him away adam had fallen back on the stretcher drained by the outburst his chest heaving from all the blood he had lost and the total despair which had replaced it hudson had called if we ever meet again it had been as far as he had got adam had stared unblinking at the sky as god is my witness ill kill you if we do damn your eyes with his strength almost gone he was still able to realise that the americans were careful to offer him the best possible treatment he had overheard a couple of army surgeons discussing his plight when he had rested for two weeks at a military hospital hes got courage ill say that for him not many could survive in his condition he must have powerful friends in heaven another coach and on to boston where he had been taken immediately to a quiet house on the outskirts guarded by soldiers but to all appearances a private residence twice a day a doctor named derriman visited him to inspect the wound and change the dressings at first he had said almost nothing but now after all these weeks a kind of restrained respect one for the other had come about a personal servant had also appeared to break the monotony and emptiness of adams life a bristol man who had been taken prisoner in that other war and who had decided to remain in american service on a full seamans pay and allowances his name was arthur chimmo and he walked with a heavy limp having had his foot crushed when a ninepounder had been overturned on top of him on this particular day he was unusually excited ive got to shave you nice an early capn somebody importants comin to see you adam waited while chimmo took his arm and gently swayed him upright on the edge of the bed then slowly and carefully he took the weight on his feet his muscles bunched against the pain it was still there but when he considered how it had been the improvement was like a miracle chimmo stood away and watched him while he seated himself in the big chair by the rooms only window stables hid the roadand everything else for that matter he had tried to picture it in his mind boston bay cape cod it might as well be the moon chimmo produced his oldstyle bowl and razor he had obviously been chosen because he was as english as adam but had been ordered not to discuss matters concerning the outside world the doctor had told him of a battle between an american frigate constitution and the british guerriиre the latter had suffered the same fate as anemone except that she had been captured and was probably already flying the american flag at least anemone had been saved from that disgrace without knowing how he was certain that his coxswain starr had seen to that another piece of news had been the assassination of the british prime minister spencer perceval in the lobby of the house of commons chimmo had been quite outraged by it as if his heart still lay firmly in england to adam it had meant very little nothing did any more without his ship and with only the memory of zenoria they would know about anemone by now in england and in his blackest moments of despair he imagined them all catherine calming the servants at falmouth if only to hide her own concern for him his uncle john allday the formidable tyacke he wrestled with another constant thought valentine keen what might he do how much did he suspect if anything there we are capn chimmo beamed and balanced himself on his wooden stump you looks fair an brave again he glanced without interest at his reflection a clean shirt and pressed neckcloth and a plain blue coat unmarked by rank or other decoration the face of a man who had come through hell he knew that he would have died but for the special care he had been given it might have ended suddenly weeks ago when somebodys carelessness had almost cost him his life he had been standing by the window moving his arm back and forth to prevent additional stiffness to his right side and the wound itself it had been evening and he had known that the sentries were changing just as he had known it was their custom to linger near the cooks door for a cup of something he had often thought that he knew their routine as well as they did themselves but he had seen a horse near the stables fully equipped and saddled there was even a sword hanging in its scabbard it had been absurdly easy down some narrow stairs and above what had smelled like a food store the horse had stared at him with little interest it had been like a blurred dream he recalled the tremendous strength he had needed to pull himself up and on to the unfamiliar saddle the rest was like mist voices yelling boots hammering across the cobbles while he had slithered helplessly to the ground in an everwidening pool of blood from his reopened wound dr derriman had exclaimed angrily youre a damned fool they have orders to fire on those stupid enough to try and escape you would have saved them the trouble where the hell did you hope to reach in gods name he had answered quietly the sea doctor just the sea then he had fainted the door opened and a lieutenant snapped is he ready chimmo adam said i am ready the lieutenant regarded him coldly i am glad i do not serve in your navy sir adam nodded to chimmo and retorted i doubt we would have you sir he picked up the stick he had been given and followed the lieutenant along the corridor he glanced briefly at the small door where his attempted escape had ended within minutes but suppose chimmo opened a door and said loudly capn adam bolitho sir it was a bare but strangely beautiful room with tall windows that looked out on to gardens which must once have been equally appealing they were now uncaredfor and overgrown the previous owners replaced by the military a palefaced man in dark clothing sat at a desk fingers pressed together his eyes deepset and unmoving he said i am captain joseph brice be seated adam said i would rather stand there was a log fire in a fine mantelled hearth like the one in falmouth it was strange to see a fire in september captain brice said please be seated you have made your point during your detention i understand that you have made several adam sat down and winced as the dressing dragged at his side i thought we should meet i am no stranger to war i served in the trenton during the war of independence as your famous uncle also served he is back in these waters so then am i adam waited he sensed that the other man was merely the instrument he looked away as anemone had been the instrument but anything was better than staring at the wall or out of the window brice continued in the same unemotional tone you were courageous and were one of the most successful frigate captains england has ever known and yet you fought with the unity and you must have known you had no chance against such a powerful ship that was not merely brave it was reckless since the fight many of your faithful and loyal company have signed their allegiance over to the united statesbut i expect you saw that as a possible outcome too i did what i saw was my duty your ship unity was set upon overhauling the small but valuable convoy under my care the choice of any captain is not always the agreeable one he glanced through the window was that the complete truth could it be that hudson had been right in deed as well as appreciation at that time the convoy had been out of danger when he had cut down the colours anemone had caused enough damage to the american frigate to prevent a further chase by fighting on against such odds many more would have died was it any captains right to make such a brave sacrifice captain brice nodded slowly i thought i knew you even though we had never met i was supposed to put it to you that a rightful and proper command should be offered to you i shall inform my superiors that it is out of the question i shall remain in detention is that what you mean it was like feeling a cage closing around him restricting him until he could barely breathe there is no other solution adam touched his side it would have been better to die even when he had fallen from the horse in his pathetic attempt to escape they could have let him die instead they wanted him as another renegade or as a trophy of battle he would be unable to walk unhindered in this unknown land his own reputation had put paid to that after all your father changed sides during the revolution did he not a good captain to all accounts although i never met him unlike commodore beer adam thought of the massive nathan beer who had visited him in the unity although he could not remember clearly how many times it was strange to realise that beers home was barely any distance away from this house near salem brice watched him curiously you would never give your word under oath as a kings officer that you would accept parole and not attempt to escape he paused i can see from your face that you would not your eyes speak what you believe to be true your duty is to fight your countrys enemies by any and every means he gave a dry cough adam watched him a sick man despite his authority and intelligence another victim so then must i attend to my duty you will be moved when you are fit enough and be detained in a safe house there you will remain until the war is finished is there anything i can do for you adam was about to offer an angry rebuff but something in the mans voice told him to desist brice did not like what he was doing nor the mission which had been given him by others i would wish to write some letters captain brice you must realise they will have to be examined censored if need be adam nodded to a wife or lover perhaps there is none he met his gaze directly not any more very well tell the man chimmo when you are ready he stood up and held out his hands to the fire in his unemotional tone he explained fever the levant long long ago he was still by the fire when the lieutenant of the guard came to escort adam back to his room the true realisation hit him like a fist a prisoner of war a nobody who would soon be forgotten or conveniently overlooked the lieutenant said not so much to say now eh he stood aside for chimmo to collect some cups and added youve had it your own way too long so accept it adam regarded him calmly and saw him flinch i shall see that someone spells your name correctly for the grave mark you that sir he saw chimmo staring past the flushed lieutenant his eyes moving like marbles back and forth to the rooms solitary table the door slammed and adam stood with his back pressed against it until his heartbeat had returned to normal a prisoner he might as well take his own life something caught his attention the holy bible lay on the table a piece of paper acting as a bookmark it was the only book in the room and he had certainly not marked a place in it nor had he even picked it up he stared round the room and out of the window to the deserted stable yard where he had lost his chance to ride away at the gallop as dr derriman had asked in anger and amazement where the hell did you hope to reach adam even thought of kneeling to peer under the bed where he had spent so much of his time he walked to the table and opened the muchused bible there was a single sheet of paper the handwriting scrawled with obvious haste adam had seen the same script many times when he had inspected anemones daily log for a few seconds he felt nothing but despair and disappointment it was from richard hudson the bloody traitor who had surrendered the ship he could feel his eyes stinging and he was about to crumple the letter into a tight ball when something held him motionless like an icy hand words stood out through the mist until with an almost physical effort he forced himself to read it slowly and carefully do not believe what they say i heard some officers speaking of you you are to be moved to a safe place somewhere on the coast you will not know where it is but word will be smuggled to the admiral adam had to pull his nerves under control the admiral hudson was talking of sir richard bolitho if i say more others will suffer adam stared at the last two words forgive me if i say more adam held the letter to a candle and watched it burn in the empty grate he did not need to go any further if his uncle knew where he was and could trust the source he might mount a rescue attempt no matter how stretched his squadron had become he had always treated him like a son trusted him loved him had even held his tongue about his secret zenoria they wanted to take richard bolitho dead or alive his name alone was the one danger they feared at sea he walked to the window and watched the breeze stirring dead leaves around the overgrown sunscorched grass he thought of the new american frigates some of which might be right here in the bay he rested his forehead against the dusty glass aloud he said brokenly oh god im to be the bait when arthur chimmo came with adams midday meal he could barely prevent his hands from shaking with one eye on the door he whispered you wouldnt tell em what i done would you sir you eard what appened to your coxn easy man i have burned the note but i must know what is happening adam could hear the officers boots tapping outside the door a different lieutenant for the afternoon one who was usually disinterested probably glad to have an easy duty away from the war and its risks all i can say is it were a sailor who brought the message if anybody finds out he did not need to finish it a sailor theirs or ours he wondered it was true that the men involved including the quivering chimmo were risking their lives even by discussing it chimmo had made up his mind and said very heavily it will be while youre here capn he nodded to emphasise each word while youre here adams mind was working at a feverish pace no wonder the gravefaced captain brice had obviously disapproved one of the old salthorse sea officers he almost smiled but the sudden excitement was too much for it as my father would have been had he lived as my uncle is now a man who could still maintain standards and old loyalties despite the endless war and the carnage it brought everywhere in the world ill see you dont regret this chimmo put down a plate of steaming beef with difficulty and shook his head wildly no sir nary a word im appy in this country appy as any man with one pin id not want to go back beggin on the streets o bristol what would my old mates think of me eh adam touched his fat arm go your way ive said and heard nothing he looked at his food his appetite gone i wonder who this man is chimmo had his fingers on the door he knows you capn through the door adam heard the lieutenant complaining pity you dont pay as much attention to the officers here arthur then he laughed another four hours and im off watch not surprisingly chimmo said nothing that afternoon the doctor came to make his usual examination he told adam he was well satisfied with the wounds progress but he seemed vaguely troubled eventually derriman said youll be told soon enough so i might as well share the news youre to leave here tomorrow you are strong enough to travel but i hope somebody has made certain that the regular inspections continue for a while anyway adam watched him as he put away his bag of instruments where to the doctor shrugged im not trusted to be told apparently adam was satisfied that the doctor knew nothing he was an open sort of man unused as yet to the demands war would make upon him so it was soon he tried to hold on to the fading glimmer of hope or never but he said thank you for all youve done doctor derriman i could easily have gone over the side derriman smiled it was the french surgeon in unity you should thank a man id like to meet thats for sure they shook hands and adam said i shall miss our talks derriman studied him and said so shall i then he was gone chimmo brought some cheap wine which he had got from the officers mess he moved awkwardly around the room touching things peering out of the window with a great effort he said goin to blow cold tonight capn best keep your clothes close bytoo early for fires the major says its all right for him with his fine ouse an mistress to keep im warm o nights adam stared at him it was tonight thank you arthur chimmo watched him worriedly i just opes the door closed adam examined his feelings like preparing for battle the terrible calm while any captain considers the odds on success or failure death hope my friend it is all we can ever have in the end he lay on the bed and sipped the wine watching the square of daylight above the stable roof opposite the room the duty lieutenant opened and locked the door without a word his feet retreating down the stairs where he could be heard talking with one of his guards the light faded and the breeze hissed amongst the leaves a light rain pattered against the glass he had sometimes thought of escaping from the window but without help he could get nowhere suppose somebody asked for payment he had nothing even his watch had gone probably while he had lain in unitys sickbay he sat up on the bed and began to pull on his shoes he touched his pocket and felt her memory stab his heart like a barb all he had was her glove oh zenoria my dearest love i love thee so i will never forget he stared at the window barely able to breathe as something tapped softly and then more insistently against it adam slipped the catch and pushed it open he tensed expecting the crash of a musket or an outcry in the yard below there was a rope dangling from somewhere above the window he leaned out and peered down where it had vanished into the early darkness can you climb are you able the man was a black shadow but adam could tell from the edge in his voice that he was very aware of danger or sudden death he whispered ill manage he swung from the sill and almost cried out as his wound awakened to torment him his guide hissed faster weve no time left his feet reached the cobbles and he would have stumbled but for the mans strong grip when he looked the rope had disappeared ive got a cart outside keep with me he thrust a pistol into adams hand if we fail youll be on your own see adam blundered through a gate the one he had seen from his window and out on to the road he could feel the sweat running down his body soaking his shirt like a rag the weakness of the months and days trying to slow him down he felt the rain on his lips and tasted salt in the air the sea just get me to the sea a second man waited by a small horsedrawn cart he was equally faceless and dark impatient to go he snapped all quiet john no alarm adam pictured the empty room with luck he might not even be missed until early morning when the soldiers beat up the camp nearby he felt his hands shaking badly he was free no matter what happened now or what became of him he was free he allowed the man to help him into the back of the cart a battered hat was jammed on his head and he gasped as a liberal measure of rum was poured over him his guide chuckled if were stopped you are too drunk to talk his voice hardened but have the piece ready ready tom he turned as adam asked but why the riskswhat might happen to you he stifled a laugh why captain bolitho sir dont you recognise your old coxn john bankart what else could i do the cart began to move and adam lay back on a pile of sacks and bales of straw believing he was losing his mind he no longer knew what to say or think what to believe or to doubt a cart on an open road men risking their necks for his sake and john alldays only son who had once served as his coxswain it had broken alldays heart when he had left for america adam could remember what he had said about it an englishman you was born and an englishman youll die and here they were somewhere outside boston and heading down towards the sea he clutched the glove in his pocket im coming zenoria i promised i would he had lost all idea of time and had to hold on to a wall when they helped him out of the cart the man called tom said what dyou think then bankart said in a bad way been through the thresher an no mistake suppose the boats shoved off got scared or somethinits one hell of a risk bankart sounded quite calm ill stay with him i owe him that much adam barely heard him just the muffled scrape of oars fierce whispers before he was dragged down into a small boat the other man called hoarsely good luck john you mad bugger alldays son moved the battered hat to shield adams face from the rain which was already heavier the men at the oars when they spoke to one another used a language he did not recognise not spanish probably portuguese he managed to ask are you really staying with me bankart grinned but had it been daylight his sadness would have been very evident certainly sir he straightened his back as my dad would say an thats no error adam pulled the hat away and opened his mouth to the rain free trick for trick matthew scarlett indomitable s first lieutenant ducked his head as he stepped into the wardroom and tossed his hat to one of the messboys despite the cool northerly wind which had filled the sails well enough for the whole forenoon watch the air between decks was dank and humid the atlantics warning of what was to come before dusk they would rendezvous with two of the squadrons other frigates zest and reaper and ride it out for the night he sat down and thought savagely for all the bloody good it will do the only vessel they had sighted on this bright september day had been the busy schooner reynard pausing only briefly to exchange despatches before hurrying on to the next point of command the messboy placed a goblet of red wine before him and waited for instructions scarlett barely heard him and snapped salt pork again ill begin to look like a pig very soon he stared aft as if he could see the captain discussing the latest despatches with the admiral he swallowed half the tepid wine without even tasting it avery the flaglieutenant would be there too of course could he speak privately with the captain after what he had told him when he had taken command at plymouth might he be prepared to listen the two royal marine officers were dozing in their chairs while jeremy laroche the third lieutenant sat at the end of the table idly shuffling and reshuffling a pack of cards scarlett ignored him how long would this go on the yankees might never break out in strength even anemones loss had been sheer mischance had it been dark nothing might have happened at all laroche called in his affected drawl i say matthew if i can rouse the two soldiers here would you care to make a foursome he ruffled the cards and added chance to even the score what not now but itll be allhands before you know it you know what its been like i said not now are you bloody deaf or something he did not see the lieutenants anger and resentment all he could think of was the letter which had come with the schooners mail even the sight of his mothers spidery writing had twisted his stomach like a sickness it should have been so different could have been indomitable had lain at plymouth undergoing alterations and rerigging ready for a role which had not come about in time for the mauritius campaign as first lieutenant he had had every hope and promise for promotion to commander in all probability on a temporary footing until he could be advanced to captain captain of this powerful vessel a match for any of the crack american newcomers like unity and the rest the money that went with such a command would be further increased with the prizes he would take or share a real chance to wipe out the mounting debts that hung over him like a spectre his mother was desperate they had threatened her that they would if necessary go to the lords of admiralty but the deeds of the house which her late husband had left her would show an honest attempt at repayment the very mention of cards by the unimaginative laroche had nearly made him vomit he knew that he was behaving strangely but the sudden gusts of rage and his harsh treatment of some of the warrant officers seemed beyond his ability to contain on or off watch in his cot at night or pacing the quarterdeck in all weathers he was dogged by worry and despair indomitable was not to continue as a private ship as he and others had expected when sir richards flag had broken out at the mainmast truck he had watched his hopes begin to dwindle it was well known in the fleet that bolitho often promoted his various flaglieutenants to command at the end of a commission for some it had been richly deserved others who could say scarlett was one of the most senior lieutenants in the squadron apart from a few of the old hands who had risen from warrant rank and the like it was so unfair but it would not go away there would be no peace another messman faltered by the table beg pardon sir scarlett turned sharply what i eard a cry from the masthead sir well so did i damn it he stood up and strode out snatching his hat as he passed in fact he had heard nothing captain du cann of the royal marines opened one eye and looked at laroche coming in for a blow what laroche was still sulking i hate a bad loser on deck scarlett adjusted to the hard glare thrown back from the endless undulating swell of empty ocean like molten glass the emptiness was an illusion their last estimated position had been only miles southeast of sandy hook and new york lieutenant protheroe the officerofthewatch studied him warily lookout reports a small sail to the noreast sir who is up there crane sir scarlett stared up through the shrouds and rigging at the flapping topsails and topgallants it was so bright that he could scarcely see the lookout but from his name he got an immediate picture a good reliable hand not a man to imagine what he saw he asked shortly what sort of vessel i sent up a glass sir not what i asked protheroe swallowed hard he had always got on very well with the first lieutenant or thought he had he replied very small sir topsail schooner but foreign rig he thinks portuguese does he indeed he took a pace to the rail and stared down at the men working their watch on deck as soon as she sights us shell be off like a rabbit he saw isaac york the sailingmaster a bundle of charts beneath one arm and his slategrey hair ruffling in the breeze pause with his hand above his eyes while he scanned the horizon for the as yet invisible vessel york continued his way to the quarterdeck and said ill tell the captain matthew scarlett swung round his eyes ablaze with sudden anger dont you start york stood fast its me matthew remember sorry he touched his rough coat so sorry if you want to talk he nodded blindly i know i am in hell to protheroe he added get aloft eh tell me what you make of her to york he said maybe later ill be able but isaac york had gone below york was tall and had to stoop as he made his way aft towards the marine sentry outside the admirals quarters what had happened to scarlett he wondered a good first lieutenant one spoken of for promotion that was then the sentry tapped on the deck with his musket master sir ozzard opened the door and squinted around it york thought rather like a suspicious housewife examining a pedlar it took a minute for york to accustom his eyes to the comparative gloom of the great cabin then he made out the comfortable shape of the admirals secretary his small round glasses perched on his moist forehead while he awaited the next instruction avery the flaglieutenant was standing beside the desk his body swaying easily to the ships heavy progress some papers in his brown hands and their captain moving restlessly by a gunport the reflected sunshine lighting his hideous scars one way losing them in shadow the next york remembered how his midshipmen had been terrified of tyacke when he had first come aboard few would even catch his eye now in some strange way all that had changed the fear remained but it was greatly tempered with respect and perhaps a recognition of his courage and of course sir richard bolitho shirt loosened his legs thrust out while he sat framed against the glistening panorama astern york smiled the midshipmen were not the only ones in awe of admiral and captain be seated mr york ill give you the barest details of a despatch i received from halifax in the schooner reynard bolitho forced a smile little news of the war i am afraid although the duke of wellington continues to advance and press upon napoleons coattails york was as shrewd as he was experienced there was tension here anxiety in their various stances no roles for the actors he thought bolitho watched him fighting the despair the sense of helplessness he continued word has come from some unknown source that my nephew is recovered from his wound but is to be held captive isolated like some felon he calmed his sudden anger with an effort no chance of exchange nor a just release because of his wound he looked directly at the sailingmaster i need your advice mr york tyacke said hotly its a trap sir that would finish us right enough york waited it must be bad for the captain to speak so forcefully to his admiral bolitho showed no sign of irritation delaware bay that is where he is imprisoned a place named avon beach they all watched while york unrolled one of his charts and flattened it on the table ah here it is sir richard bolitho glanced away to the small lacquered box on his desk a letter from catherine how he longed to read it to share his hopes and fears across the leagues of ocean which held them apart york nodded a good choice if youll pardon my saying so sir richard too shallow for anything but small vessels at that point plenty of deep water in the bay of course fine anchorage bolitho watched yorks mind working while the others waited in silence he turned his eyes back to the small box each word in every letter meant so much there had been a letter for allday too he would be waiting somewhere ready to spring out on the flaglieutenant so he could listen to her voice in averys words it touched bolitho deeply that allday had forced himself to say so little about his new daughter even though he was bursting with it because of me and of kate he looked at his hands and because of adam york raised his head a landing party sir richard his tone hardened or a rescue attempt is that what youre proposing bolitho said quietly would they really expect me to risk ships and men because of my heart he was feeling the locket through his damp shirt trying to summon her voice but there was nothing tyacke asked abruptly what was the commotion on deck mr york a small sail to the noreast sir the first lieutenant is given to ignore it bolitho looked at him this place avon beachdo you know it of it sir loyalists were imprisoned there now i believe it is derelict they watched him seeing him creating the prison in his mind it will break his heart tyacke said it has happened to many good men sir richard i know it is not honour i seek nor even yet revenge tyacke frowned as the sentry called first lieutenant sir tell him to wait to bolitho he added i had better go to him his expression softened but for the scars he would have been handsome bolitho thought gentle i meant no offence sir richard i have too much respect for you and much more that id say naught of in company i do know your feelings as your flagcaptain he shrugged you taught me remember york said uncertainly if you need me sir richard thank you mr york we will talk further york gathered up his charts and departed bolitho sat with his back against the windows feeling the warmth through the thick glass the lift and roll of all of her tons men weapons and perhaps the will to win what chance had all these against love he looked at his flaglieutenant his tawny eyes were very clear from the seas reflections well george nothing to say your leader taken all aback and you remain silent i see someone who is helpless because he cares so much for others the ships and men who must rely upon him people he knows good and badthey are in his hands bolitho said nothing and avery added a general will say order the th to advance and if they are not enough or are hacked down he will send in another regiment he sees no faces hears no pitiful cries which will never be answered only flags pins on a map there was a long silence and bolitho could hear averys breathing above the other sounds i know when he looked up avery was shocked to see tears in his eyes i had no right sir you of all people had every right they heard tyackes voice raised in anger you are dismissed man go to your barracks until told otherwise tyackes anger seemed to pursue the luckless sentry we are all fighting on the same bloody side i hope then scarletts voice hoarse and angry zest has been sighted sir what is the matter with you man it is near enough to rendezvous is that all you had to tell me avery asked shall i go and quieten things sir he stared as bolitho held up one hand not yet tyacke asked sharply what about the lookout and the sighting to the noreast i have set more sail sir she will lose us at dusk so i thought tyacke sounded very calm suddenly the sharpness of his temper gone like a passing squall heaveto signal zest to close on flag when he reentered the great cabin he looked quite impassive i apologise for my rough tongue sir richard ive long since lost the pretty manners of liners allday entered silently his eyes questioning the absence of a sentry by the screen door are you going up sir richard indomitable rolled heavily as the hands ran to the braces and sheets to shorten sail and bring her up to the wind on deck there were startled faces everywhere peering at the sea empty still but for small slivers of sail which appeared to be circling indomitable like sharks while she continued to head upwind bolitho lurched against a stay as the deck tilted over his shoe sliding on the wet planking he saw tyacke watching then turning away again as allday caught his arm he took a telescope from lieutenant protheroe very carefully he raised it to his right eye hardly daring to breathe as the brightly painted schooner lurched into the lens have the side manned mr scarlett he tried again afraid that his voice might betray him there is a captain coming aboard and we shall offer him all honours on this september day he could feel alldays grasp on his arm his anxiety what is it sir richard bolitho looked across the broad quarterdeck where tyacke was watching his ship respond to canvas and rudder his coat soaked with flying spray tyacke had guessed he had known then he handed the telescope to allday and said quietly see old friend there is one other coming aboard today philip beauclerk the surgeon wiped his strong bony hands with a wet cloth and said whoever had cause to attend captain bolitho after he was wounded must have been an excellent doctor i should like to congratulate him enemy or not bolitho sat beside the cot which had been rigged in his own quarters and grasped adams hand he could scarcely believe it and yet somehow like tyacke he had known the one and only chance and it had been theirs to seize adam opened his eyes and studied him slowly feature by feature perhaps to reassure himself that it was not merely another dream another lost hope well uncle you cannot rid yourself of me so easily he seemed to realise that his hand was clasped firmly and whispered it was alldays son he took a terrible risk so did you adam he smiled gripping harder as the pain returned i would have been caged uncle he would have been hanged like poor george starr i shall never forget what he did beauclerk said he is still very weak sir richard his recent exploits have done little to speed his recovery adam shook his head why is it uncle when you are ill that those who care for you seem to think you are deaf and slightly stupid they discuss you as if you are only one step from heaven bolitho touched his bare shoulder even that felt stronger less feverish you are better already adam he tried to force the despatches which reynard had delivered to the back of his mind the troop convoy had been doubled and would arrive at halifax within the next two weeks he had mentioned it to tyacke while beauclerk had been examining adam and had seen the arguments in tyackes eyes the americans had leaked the information about adams place of captivity to encourage a rescue attempt to split the leeward squadron when it was most needed the convoys size and importance had dwarfed even that would men like beer really believe that he would make such a reckless and personal foray in the face of such local and forceful opposition by now they would know of adams escape but it would be impossible for anyone to expect him to have reached indomitable one favourable card then bolitho watched adams eyes begin to droop felt the grip of his hand slacken if there is anything i can do for you he saw adam trying to speak and guessed that the surgeon had given him some drug to ease the shock and strain of his escape i never thought you were lost but i cared very much adam pulled the crumpled glove from his breeches keep this for me uncle it is all i have of hers avery had entered quietly but stood motionless and in silence the glove the rumour of suicide and the young captains despair told most of the story and he was deeply moved by what he had seen and heard then adam said softly a ship uncle please find me a ship bolitho gazed at him the words unlocking another old memory when he had returned from the great south sea half dead from fever and on his recovery had pleaded for a ship any ship you should be sent home adam you are not yet recovered what must i do to make you beauclerk took adams hand and put it beneath the sheet he hears nothing sir richard it is better this way his pale eyes were assessing bolitho curiously he is very strong bolitho stood up unwilling to return to the squadrons affairs call me instantly if beauclerk gave a small smile when sir richard when bolitho saw avery and said a miracle to beauclerk he added i meant to tell you the results of your work in this ship are excellent i shall see that it goes on your report as you have seen in my papers sir richard my service will be terminated at the end of this commission but there are no regrets either way i have learned firsthand of the desperate need for improved surgical techniques in the kings ships and i will do my utmost to make my opinions survive beyond the furnace bolitho smiled i wish you luck i am grateful for what you have done in indomitable beauclerk picked up his bag but lingered to rest a hand on adams brow then he said quietly in sir piers blachford i had the finest of tutors bolitho touched his eye so he had known all the time but had said nothing loyalty seemed to come in all guises and he was suddenly glad that beauclerk had shared the secret on deck the sky and the sea were like bronze the breeze barely strong enough to lift the sails into motion tyacke strode to meet him and wasted no time we made signal contact with zest sir richard she had a skirmish this morning and suffered small damage when she surprised an enemy brig well inshore at the time bolitho saw the reckless captain dampiers eager face clearly like a portrait in his mind tyacke was saying i did not disturb you there is nothing we can do until we meet with the courier brig tomorrow he hesitated i am glad about captain bolitho sir i have much respect for him what damage james again the hesitation in a moment he knew why very little a spar or two shot away but the brig was taken as a prize unhappily captain dampier was killed outright by a stray ball hell be sorely missed bolitho paced along the side deep in thought dampier was always one to take risks to lead his men in person to board an enemy to walk his deck when all hell was breaking loose around him a popular captain who had never appreciated that there was always one risk too many bolitho watched the bronze shine on the deep troughs giving way to deeper shadows i shall write to his parents it was better not to know men so well that well but how could you not when to lead you must take and hold their confidence despite the pain the sense of betrayal when they died tyacke said this plan of yours sir richard you are still against it i am sir he paused as seamen scampered past to take in the slack of some loose lines because it might fail that i might be wrong about the enemys intentions tyacke faced him stubbornly because of you sir if the enemy is uncertain of the troop convoys time of arrival at halifax he might attempt an attack in the caribbean where he has more chance of success either way he can divide our strength but at least we will have taken all precautions open to us and this ruse to draw us against captain bolithos proposed prisoni am firmly convinced it would be a trap to seize or destroy more of our vessels he took a deep breath in every case every action will point to you you of all people should not be so surprised james but i have little or no choice the americans will finish us piecemeal if we keep up this unrewarding hitandrun strategy we are here to destroy their ships and to reopen our safe seaways for supplies and the military for the conflict in canada they might still fight on the lakes but that will never decide a war they walked a few more paces while the other ships in company seemed to melt into the ocean itself bolitho said victor or scapegoat james the price of admiralty then send for yovell i shall issue the squadrons orders by morning tyacke watched him stride to the companionway and tried to feel the depth of the man his energy his infectious optimism and his black despair what had restored him his nephews incredible escape aided by a man who had once served as his coxswain alldays son or was it the letter still unopened in the admirals little box catherine somervells words and strength from across an ocean he saw allday by the hammock nettings and asked him how he was he saw the tired grin in the shadows i feel at odds with meself capn i was flung right over when i saw who it was with capn adam like turning the pages friend or father im not sure which hes not going back to their lot though an thats a blessing tyacke said did he tell you what happened allday stiffened suspiciously but why not captain tyacke was no enemy also he needed to talk if only to sort it out for himself to make some sense of it he couldnt get work not the kind he quit the navy for sir he wanted to fish or work on the land nobody had any use for him he gave a bitter laugh even his wife gave up on him and took to another mans bed so when he heard about capn adam he knew what he must do hell hang or worse if they catches him tyacke said go below there was a letter from home for you i believe allday sighed it makes up for all this sir tyacke watched him melt into the gloom and was suddenly filled with envy he stared into the darkness seeing the last of the horizon then he touched the weathered quarterdeck rail aloud he said well fight very soon my girl you and me never ask the bloody reason only fight and win adam bolitho lay in the gently swaying cot listening to the groan and shiver of cordage and rudder the occasional slap of spray against the quarter windows the cabin was in darkness but for a solitary lantern and he knew that his uncle was elsewhere expanding upon his instructions to his captains for the courier brig it was heavy and close between decks with all hatches and shutters sealed as though against some unseen enemy witness he was sweating and the ache in his side felt as if the wound had been reopened it was still hard to accept that he was in indomitable that he would not be awakened by the onelegged man from bristol or the surly lieutenant of the guard they would be hunting for him a needle in a haystack he prayed that those who had aided his escape would remain safe and unknown he listened to the footsteps on deck and pictured the duty watch the lieutenant and his midshipmen and masters mate the helmsmen watching the dimly glowing compass card their bare feet braced against the tug of the great rudder sounds and sensations so familiar and personal that he was even more aware of his sense of bereavement of not belonging he heard the scrape of boots and quick murmurs beyond the screen as the marine sentry was relieved his world and yet denied to him since anemones loss a door opened and he thought he heard ozzards sharp voice another lantern threw more light around the sleepingcompartment and he saw a small figure with unruly hair and bare feet treading carefully down the slope of the deck with a tray gripped in his hands like something precious adam forced himself on to his elbow and opened the shutter of his lantern i know you boy youre john whitmarsh they told me what happened to you the boy stared at him almost afraid shocked perhaps to see his captain lying like any wounded seaman aye sir tis me mr ozzard said for me to come to you ive brought some wine he said it belonged to some lady though i didnt understand what he meant sir adam reached out and took his arm there was nothing of him volunteered by some relative who found his upkeep and care too inconvenient you survived when so many fell john whitmarsh he tried to smile or surrendered i tried sir he did not explain be you goin to be all right sir adam nodded when i get a ship ill be brave enough then he realised that the boy was staring at him his eyes filling his face the realisation came starkly to him the boy had nothing even his best friend had been lost he asked will you come as my servant john when i get another ship will you do that the boy nodded and began to sob quietly id be that proud sir can you read no sir but i could learn adam smiled i shall teach you who knows you may wear the kings coat one day then i shall be proud of you eh i dunno what to say sir adam sipped the wine lady catherines ozzard would understand this poor twelveyearold youth probably imagined that he was offering him some kind of lifeline he would never believe that it was the other way round the excitement the emotion and now the wine were making him drowsy again he said on days when we are sad young john we can restore ourselves by remembering our old ship and our lost friends his eyes hardened in the flickering lights our enemies too if it pleases you the boy watched until he was asleep and then curled up near by without fear without need he was somebody the strength of a ship bolitho walked up to the stern windows of the great cabin and watched the spray soaking the thick glass hardening like ice rime in the southwesterly wind captain james tyacke watched him noting each mood while half his mind clung to the sounds of wind and rigging his responsibility to his ship you still think i am wrong james im more worried by the weather sir york claims it will remain the same for a few days yet but im not so sure if the halifaxbound convoy is caught by wind and heavy seas it could be scattered and that means they would be without whatever escorts their lordships have seen fit to provide he did not hide the contempt in his voice all those men and horses and guns too it would be slaughter bolitho walked to the chart on his table it was noon but gloomy enough for sunset he tried to picture his extended line of ships with captain dawes big valkyrie in command spread along the th parallel while the rest of their patrol areas were left undefended beers unity was at boston and the baltimore another of the new american frigates had been in delaware bay waiting for any rescue attempt it seemed unlikely although zests first lieutenant had reported sighting such a vessel when they had crossed swords with the smart little brig every captain would act as he thought fit if challenged without hope of assistance and support bolitho touched his eye he had to be right the convoy of soldiers now said to be doubled in size was a prize no commander could ignore but if i am wrong the door opened and adam entered the cabin three days since alldays son had guided him to safety and what a difference except in his eyes there was tension there and strain around his mouth which bolitho had not seen before anemones loss there was eagerness too in marked contrast almost the midshipman again or was it only wishful thinking well adam you look the part at least adam glanced down at his various items of uniform clothing which had been donated by indomitables officers and midshipmen tyacke asked did the first lieutenant have something to offer bolitho glanced at him the sharpness in the question was very evident adam said easily i expect he forgot all first lieutenants have much to do on the eve of great matters he tried to grin but it did not relieve the intensity in his eyes bolitho asked you are so certain of that impulsively he put his hands on adams shoulders i have your commission for you you will assume command of zest immediately in case the weather goes against us but no risks adamyou are far from well as yet hold the people together and try to keep anemone a kind memory one that will not incite you to avenge her beyond what you know to be any chance of victory you are my best frigate captain so take heed he squeezed his shoulders and thought of the letter he had sent away in the schooner reynard my dearest kate i am loath to send him to zest after what he went through but he is the best i have and he needs the command as i once did tyacke glanced at the salt stains on the leaning windows he was eager to get it over with in his heart he knew they all were like the last goodbyes never the proper words when they were most needed he said captain dampier was a good leader if a trifle reckless for my taste but because he is dead he will suddenly become a martyr when anyone speaks of him he smiled briefly as if touched by some memory his company may close ranks regard you as an intruder yes adam nodded very conscious of the power of this tall figure with the ruined face i understand you oh yes they will curse their new captain and damn his eyes to the full swear to god he can never hold a slowmatch to their old one but you are the captain allow nobody to forget it he held out his hand and youre taking the boy whitmarsh with you he knew one of the reasons was because the boy had been the last one alive to leave anemone but all adam said was he deserves it a midshipman his jacket black with spray peered in at them first lieutenants respects sir boats ready alongside he fled bolitho said there is one thing more he walked to the bulkhead and took down the old family sword take this it will be yours by right one day adam refused it gently putting it back into his hands well not speak of that uncle i shall find another when the need arises they walked out into the passageway between the lines of officers cabins hutches which could be ripped down in minutes when the hands dashed to quarters and the drums stopped every mans heartbeat figures moved out like shadows allday with a handclasp yovell even ozzard who rarely showed any emotion at all and john bankart alldays illegitimate son unknown for so many years perhaps adam was thinking of his own upbringing fatherless as he had then believed his mother selling herself to feed and educate him bolitho watched as adam shook bankarts hand never a youth but now a man of thirty or so he heard adam say leave the sea john it is not for you and never was ill never forget what you did for me nor will your father he smiled with genuine warmth give him time he is all aback because of you the calls trilled and he was down the side nimbly and surefooted despite his wound bolitho shaded his eyes to stare over at zest showing her copper as she pitched violently in a quarter sea her company were in for a surprise it would do them good he watched adam turn just once to wave from the sternsheets his borrowed hat pressed between his knees it would do adam good as well tyacke had already put the event from his immediate thoughts i shall exercise the guns when the hands have eaten sir richard this is no time for slackness bolitho left him and went aft to his cabin there he took out his unfinished letter and wondered when they would meet with the reynard again or some other courier who would take it on board he sat with the pages spread out on the table and laid her last letter beside them she had written of the changing colours of cornwall of falmouth the coming of autumn and the mists over pendennis point each night i lie and await thee dearest of men i speak your name and like that terrible day when they found zenoria i feel your hand on mine safe safe and oh so precious to me i wrote to you before about val keen he was grieved by his loss bolitho had imagined that he had felt her hesitate as she had written it but he will get over it i am certain and he shall find another there are those who have no such escape he looked up annoyed at the interruption but it was allday allday said i thought id stop them disturbing you sir richard reaper has just sighted a sail to the eastrd a brig one of ours then old friend his eyes moved to the letter no he would finish it afterwards why should that word hold such threat allday said gruffly its strange to have your own kin aboard better he were a strangerid not feel so ill at ease his eyes crinkled still he was fair tickled when he heard about the baby bolitho smiled kate he hoped it had not saddened his own kate two hours later indomitable was near enough to the newcomer to identify her as the brig weazel of fourteen guns she had been ordered to patrol as close as was prudent to the southern approaches of nantucket sound as laid down in his original instructions her commander a redfaced devonian named john mates had left the sector to find either his admiral in person or one of the chain of vessels that made up this very mixed squadron tyacke brought the news to bolitho in his cabin from weazel sir the uss unity has put to sea she slipped out three nights ago he spread his strong hands gone just like that he saw bolithos mind working busily on the information or the lack of it he added ive repeated the signal to reaper his blue eyes did not even blink and zest bolitho leaned over his chart again not yet not yet two days more how could they know be certain of anything this was not warfare as it was expected to be fought but then those who made the rules of battle had too often never seen one this was personal coldbloodedly personal either beer must be destroyed or he must kill me nothing else would make the vital difference tyacke said quite suddenly i shall give you all i have sir bolitho said looking up at him then we shall succeed he glanced at the unfinished letter again dearest kate our love is greater even than duty once he might have challenged such a sentiment but that was in the past tyacke had gone he was like the strength of indomitable herself her great keel her shining batteries of guns strong enough to control landmen and seasoned sailors like the ships rigging itself he smiled as an old hand who had once trained him had explained every mile of cordage equal strain on all parts my young gennleman thats the strength of it it certainly described tyacke better than he knew himself on the weather side of the quarterdeck george avery gripped a stay and watched the majesty of the ocean stretching away on either beam it was hard to accept until somebody like york showed you the chart and the pages of calculations tides depths and currents that there was any danger land of any kind was beyond the sight of even the most keeneyed lookout only the misty topsails of their two consorts like linked hands were visible on the horizons he thought of the letters he had read and written for allday vignettes of rural england small personal comments which he could not fathom but he could see the true pleasure they gave in the coxswains eyes bolitho had mentioned rearadmiral keen again when he had received a letter from lady catherine he gave it all a great deal of consideration intrigued also by the glove obviously cherished which was all of his personal possessions that adam bolitho had been able to save in his captivity what was honour when it came to love no matter how secret the love is this all you have to do with yourself it was scarlett swaying back and forth on his heels as the indomitable thrust through every roller with disdain avery answered calmly i am busy enough i do not wish to argue nor do i wish to be insulted he might as well have stayed silent oh no not for you eh no hard struggle to gain advancement like the rest of us privilege whoyouknow that is your navy sir but it is not mine hold your noise damn you the watchkeepers will hear and that would never do would it because he is a bolitho he gets a new command instantly and i bloody well suggest it will be your turn next ill hear no more he turned to go but scarletts fingers gripped his forearm like claws avery said very quietly remove your hand mister scarlett or or what do not try to provoke me sir you can have all the commands on the ocean for all i care but i tell you this he saw scarlett flinch under his tawny stare i do not believe youre fit to command anything a midshipman called captains coming sir but he dropped his eyes as scarlett glared past him hold your noise mr essex or ill have you mastheaded all night if need be he turned back to avery when he pondered over it later in his hutch avery thought it was like seeing an entirely different person scarlett merely said you mustnt be so hasty man so quick to burn a fuse eh he even smiled like a stranger and yet they had shared the same mess since plymouth in two days or so they would fight or so york the sailingmaster had surmised suppose tyacke should fall he thought of the momentary wildness in scarletts eyes something was pulling the man apart drink women or money it was usually one of the three but a madman on the quarterdeck of a kings ship who would carry the blame he imagined bolitho below his feet in the cabin reading his letters or the leatherbound shakespeare sonnets which she had given him the man they all depended on and yet he was still called to depend upon them us lieutenant laroche had the afternoon watch and was regarding scarlett very warily as he strode away from the captain ah jeremy you have the watch we shall exercise the weather battery this afternoon but later in the dogs maybe do you fancy a game good goodcant bear people who sulk bad losers usually avery saw laroche staring after him a look of utter astonishment on his piggy face avery walked to the companionway so that was it yovell laid another paper on the table and waited for bolitho to sign it bolitho said that will have to do i expect you have done more than enough quillpushing as well on my behalf yovell was peering at him over the top of his gold spectacles you should eat something sir richard it is not good to fast in the face of danger bolitho looked up from the table the ship noises and stresses intruding as his mind cleared the thrumming of taut stays and shrouds the creak of the steeringgear beneath the counter the thousand and one unknown murmurs of a ship at sea york had been right about the weather the wind was still strong and gusty but held steady from the southwest he tried to see it in his minds eye the endless landmass to the northwest cape cod then eventually on to halifax nova scotia yovell had sensed his tension it was hardly surprising they had been together a long time it may come to nothing bolitho turned his head to listen as his ear caught the brief sound of a fiddle the watch below were resting their last meal of the day cleared away did they feel the closeness of danger or did nobody care what they thought and felt the door opened and avery stepped into the cabin sir richard i thought you might take a glass with me avery glanced at yovell who shook his head you should eat sir richard bolitho contained his anger what about you george have you eaten avery sat down and watched as ozzard padded past to fetch the cognac bolitho was restless ill at ease he replied when i was a prisoner of war i found i could eat everything and anything sir a habit that came in very useful bolitho watched him fondly of course that was why avery had understood so completely his anguish over adam the misery of detention after the freedom of the sea he held up the glass to us and whenever we are called to prove ourselves he knew yovell was about to leave but was lingering by the screen door just as he knew that anything said here would remain here i think it will be sooner rather than later the door closed silently yovell would take his bible to his little office where he slept and preserved his privacy a difficult thing to achieve in a ship in the company of other souls from admiral to powdermonkey he thought again of his scattered squadron suppose he was mistaken and beer had decided to act without sentiment and head straight for the convoy on the other hand far far astern the gate to the caribbean lay wide open and unguarded which might tempt him the most he sipped the cognac and tried not to think of catherine alone in the old grey house avery said quietly i think that commodore beer is much like his opponent sir richard me how can that be i have never met him avery warmed to his theme its you he wants i believe he held unity back because he sincerely believed that you intended a rescue attempt i also believe that zest was chased by another big frigate the baltimore was mentioned i believe he realised with a start that bolitho was on his feet moving catlike about the swaying cabin as he had seen him do so often bolitho said then we shall fight he looked at avery searching his face as if to discover someone else you see george this will not be like other seafights we have been fighting the french and their allies on and off for twenty years and even before that out here in these same waters the english sailors cheerful contempt for foreigners the frogs the dons and the meinheers has sustained him when all else seemed overwhelmingly against him this is different as it was after the american revolution it is one thing to stand in the line of battle fighting it out until the enemys flag comes down when i was out here at that time i was young full of ideals of what i thought the navy should be i soon learned at close quarters just how different such a conflict can be he touched his arm and avery knew he had done so without noticing it how so sir richard bolitho turned on him his eyes cold clear grey like the sea at pendennis sword in hand cutting and thrusting all about you breath gone your heart filling your mouth and then you hear them avery waited a chill on his back holding him silent the voices george they are what you remember voices from the shires the west country and the dales fishermen and ploughmen farmworkers and weavers you hear your own voices on every side when we meet the americans this time it will be the same they will be fighting for the freedom they wrested from us once before the freedom of their new country and they will regard us as the aggressors yet again avery said our people will not let you down sir i have watched them heard them they speak of home but they seek no other land he thought of alldays letter from that tiny inn at fallowfield the contentment and the love which even distance could not break men like allday would not change bolitho clapped his hand on his shoulder we shall have another drink then you can tell me what is troubling you it is nothing sir nothing at all bolitho smiled methinks he doth protest too much he sat down again scarlett the first lieutenant is it not before he could answer bolitho said i have watched you too you know ever since the day my catherine took you to her heart when you thought i would send you packing you are loyal but sensitive as you showed just now when you mentioned your time as a prisonerofwar the unfair court martial that followed your release has also given you sympathy for others in that position some of whom deserve nothing but harsh treatment if the people have been placed in jeopardy because of their misjudgement he was on his feet again head turned as a spectre of foam clawed up the quarter windows as if to seize the whole ship if a captain stands his ship into unnecessary danger he can expect to face a court martial or worse he tried to smile and myself i would probably end up being shot dead on the quarterdeck by captain du canns royal marines like poor admiral byng half a century ago perhaps but still the same navy he handed avery a goblet his vice is gambling is it not avery stared at the goblet overwhelmed by the force of these revelations and his glimpse of bolithos true emotion he dared not think of it as uncertainty bolitho said quietly you forget george like you i have good cause to remember some of my socalled friends who were quick to remind me of my brothers gambling debts and the price he eventually paid for his folly i am sorry sir i expect captain tyacke suspects it if so i could feel pity for scarlett but he is one of the few experienced lieutenants on board he has felt the enemys breath in his face bladetoblade him or me the only code of battle avery got to his feet thank you sir richard for sharing your thoughts and for finding time for my own problems i promise then he shook his head and gave a rueful smile i am sorry i must not say that when i first presented myself to you and lady catherine at falmouth you warned me then you said promise nothing it is wiser in the long run bolitho said send allday to me a wet sir they grinned like conspirators the door closed and bolitho returned to the saltcaked windows my little crew it needed to be stronger than ever now captain james tyacke walked to the quarterdeck rail and took several deep breaths beyond indomitables powerful shadow he could see the boiling ridges on every long roller feel the jubilant chorus of wind through canvas and rigging a ship responding to chart and rudder figures took shape around him as his eyes became used to the unbroken darkness john daubeny the second lieutenant and officer of the first watch hovered nearby unsure whether to speak or remain silent well mr daubeny i am not a mindreader wind remains steady sir souwesterly still moderate tyacke glanced up at the pale squares of canvas spread like huge wings but barely visible through the spindrift and drifting spray the reduced sail plan would suffice until daylight while they sought out their two consorts and then what he still thought it unlikely that the enemy would have been expecting bolitho to fall bait to the tale of captain adams place of captivity commodore beer was an old dog with more experience than most and a hard head to protect him against foolhardy schemes daubeny ventured carefully do you think we shall fight sir tyacke smiled grimly as i said i am no mindreader but we shall stand prepared and ready what say you he guessed that the lieutenant was squinting his eyes as he always did when asked a direct question i think we are prepared sir he hesitated thanks to you tyacke frowned but it was not idle flattery which he might have expected from lieutenant laroche he replied i had a lot to learn too this is a vast change from commanding a brig with nobody to crowd you and no admirals flag to fill you with terror the lieutenant laughed he could never imagine his formidable captain being frightened except perhaps when he had found himself on the orlop deck after the nile and had seen his own face he said i wrote my last letter to my father sir and told him of our pride at being sir richards flagship he flinched as tyacke seized his arm tyacke said harshly never speak of a last letter to anybody do you hear me for it may well be your last if you dwell on it too much daubeny swallowed hard then i shall pray sir aye do that although i have more faith in a good surgeon than a prayer book he turned sharply who is that he saw the senior midshipman blythe climbing up from the boat tier where he had been inspecting the lashings sir i was going to tell you mr blythe he hesitated wondering why he disliked the signals midshipman in spite of the outstanding reports of him from other officers a confidence as big as his head well never mind he said i have put you in my despatches to confirm that i am making you actinglieutenant until your examination blythe stared at his shadow thank you very much sir that will help considerably even he could hide neither his pleasure nor his surprise tyacke rarely spoke with his young gentlemen content to leave it to officers who really knew them i have a question mr blythe the figures standing around them were suddenly quite still and trying not to appear as if they were eagerly listening deane the other midshipman of the first watch was paying particular attention in case he was asked the same question when his time came navigation or seamanship gundrill or boatwork it would be well to be prepared blythe was standing very upright tyacke could almost hear his brain working he asked what is the strength of a ship mr blythe can you tell me that blythe was at a loss for words the keel and main timbers sir tyacke said curtly im taking this midshipman with me mr daubeny i trust you can manage they walked along the weather gangway dark shapes jumping aside as they passed tyacke climbed down the forward ladder pausing to study the empty hammock nettings if sir richard was right there would be blood on the packed nettings very soon he examined his feelings fear doubts of his own ability resignation no it was more of an awareness the tasks of responsibility fate might already have decided he said do you go down to the messdecks mr blythe the youth stared at him sometimes for drills sir the bosuns mates can deal with the other matters can they indeed well follow me down another wide ladder which would be replaced by a less vulnerable rope one if they were called to action when indomitable had been a twodecker before her conversion many of the messes had been crammed between the guns on either side now they had more space at least there was sudden silence as tyackes white breeches appeared on the ladder and an old seaman bellowed attention for the capn his eyes were popping as if he could scarcely believe it tyacke tucked his hat beneath his arm and snapped to the midshipman remove your hat man you are not called to duty here and this is their home always remember that blythe watched almost humbly as tyacke waved the seamen to reseat themselves on the long benches beside the scrubbed deal tables the smell of cooking still filled the long messdeck and tyacke paused to examine a fine model of a fifthrate which was being completed critically watched by the mans messmates one said cheekily tis the only ship jake erell ever command sir tyacke listened to them laugh felt their unexpected comradeship their simple pleasure at what would otherwise be regarded as an intrusion he picked out the various faces knowing the parts of ship where they worked saw the dittyboxes in which they kept their small treasures a few portraits perhaps needles and thread whalebone and canvas for repairs to their seagoing clothing he said to blythe remember this is home all they have is here we goin to trounce them frenchies sir the man fell silent as tyackes eyes found him frenchies many of these same men had no idea of where they were or where bound weather food security there were very different values on the messdecks the smells of packed humanity bilge and tar hemp and paint he answered we fight the kings enemies lads but mostly we keep just the one hand for his majesty and the other for ourselves he looked around at their intent faces for each other some stared at the hideous scars others watched only his eyes there was laughter some at the other messtables craning to hear or ask what he had said a voice called would you care for a tot sir aye ill have one it was as if somebody else had spoken as he added must keep a clear head for tomorrow they watched in utter silence as he drained a tumbler of neat rum he nodded catching his breath nelsons blood lads then he straightened as much as was possible no less impressive a figure stooped between the low deckhead beams god bless you lads they cheered the din filling the cramped place until tyacke said carry on mr blythe through the royal marines messes the barracks as they insisted on calling them neatly piled drums and pipeclayed belts stands of brown bess muskets and their bayonets scarlet coats and delighted grins even a handshake or two from the ncos tyacke felt the sea air on his face and was thankful it was over he knew who had taught him the importance and pain of such close intimacy with men you could promote flog or hang even in the jaws of death a familiar figure lounged against one of the black twentyfourpounders troughton the onelegged cook who had shared his own horror at the nile you got em capn the old indoms in the palm of your hand that she is he was called away and tyacke was glad the young freshfaced seaman who had been blasted down when the world had exploded around them probably knew better than any and would see through his disguise if only from memory he turned instead to midshipman blythe who was watching him with a mixture of awe and fear men mr blythe ordinary everyday menyoud never notice any one of them in a street or working in the fields in england right blythe nodded but remained silent tyacke continued relentlessly but they are your answer they are the strength of a ship so let them not die to no good purpose he watched the midshipmans shadow melt into the darkness he might have learned something from it until the next time he thought of the man whose flag flew at the masthead and smiled embarrassed because of what he had just done he touched the tarred rigging and murmured to himself so lets be about it then and for what richard bolitho peered into the small lookingglass and felt the smoothness of his skin after alldays careful unhurried shave the ship was in total darkness and with so much low cloud the first light would be late in coming and yet the ship felt alive men moving about the smell of breakfast still hanging greasily on the damp air suppose i am wrong he was surprised to see the face in the glass smile back at him so many times different ships other seas and oceans he knew that he was not wrong it was not merely the calculations on yorks charts the estimated time of arrival of the convoy at halifax it went deeper so much so like the minds of men dedicated to survival but condemned to danger even death so many times allday knew it too but had said very little on this chill morning on the great western ocean bolitho had touched only briefly on the matter of his son bankart allday had hesitated the keen razor poised in the air i want to feel him as my son sir richard but something stands between us were strangers as we were when i first met him bolitho touched the locket beneath his shirt a clean frilled shirt one of ozzards best why was it necessary to do this allday had told him that his son had confided that the largest american menofwar had the pick of the navys sharpshooters former backwoodsmen who lived or died by the success of their marksmanship it was madness surely to present an admirals hat and epaulettes as a ready target or even a captains he had said as much to tyacke whose answer had been uncompromising and blunt like the man im proud of this ship sir richard shes mine and i know her better than i ever believed possible and i want our people to see meknow im with them even at the worst of times he had given one of his attractive smiles i seem to have learned that too from somebody not so far away bolitho rubbed his eye and winced but if i have miscalculated then beer will have joined his other ships to attack the convoy even valkyrie and her smaller consorts could not withstand such an onslaught ozzard came out of the shadows carrying the heavy dress coat bolitho said if we are called to battle you will go below thank you sir richard he hesitated ill be ready when you need me bolitho smiled poor ozzard he always took refuge below the waterline whenever battle was joined as he had in the old hyperion when she had begun to founder allday had even hinted that it had been his intention to remain there and go down with the old ship as so many had done that day how hyperion cleared the way the ballad was still everpopular in sailors taverns and alehouses too many ghosts he thought ships and men men and ships too many lost too many lives there was a tap at the door and tyacke made his way aft his single epaulette glinting in the spiralling lanternlight the winds backed a piece sir richard more like souwest by south steady enough though he glanced at the deckhead as if he could see the yards and reefed sails shell fly when we give her the chance bolitho tried to clear his mind when we are able james signal the frigates to close on us woodpecker will remain well up to windrd a lone witness if things went badly wrong tyacke said i was wondering if we should signal zest to change stations with reaper sir a captain with a new ship a ship with a new captain he shrugged id suggest that reaper would be better placed closer to the enemy so even tyacke was coming round he said that is what i intend james if i am right tyacke exclaimed you mean that commodore beer has anticipated this move and has outsailed us during the night bolitho felt the locket again warm against his skin wouldnt you take the windgage if you had the chance and if we run we will eventually be caught on a lee shore yes tyacke said shortly sometimes you have me in irons sir richard but run never while i draw breath he listened to the feet overhead recognising every sound knowing the qualities and the reliability of each man there that was a fine thing you did james the strength of a ship it is a pity such moments never reach the pages of the gazette well im damned if i know how you know but it gave him something more important than himself to think about allday entered quietly horizons losing its cloak sir richard he glanced at the swordrack cant see nothing yet tyacke smiled and left the cabin saying over his shoulder that son of yours might still change his mind and sign on with us allday allday watched the door close its no joke sir richard bolitho touched his arm i know it was no time to be thinking of such things a man could die in a moment of distraction he said how do you feel old friend allday seemed surprised by the question then a lazy grin spread over his face and he said weve seen it all afore sir richard he shrugged today or never bolitho nodded there was a smell of rum in the cabin and again he was moved by alldays unbreakable faith and loyalty have another wet old friend he glanced around the spacious cabin a place to think to remember and to hide in his bones like allday he knew it was almost time he went out through the screen door and saw a squad of marines having their weapons checked by sergeant chaddock they did not look up or see him as he passed so intent were they on their inspection it made him feel invisible like one of the many ghosts this old ship must have in plenty he stooped to peer through an open gunport the twentyfourpounder like ice under his fingers not for much longer very dark with only a few pale crests breaking away from the lower hull just a slight brushstroke the eastern horizon oh dear kate think of me of us spray touched his skin like an awakening and he thought he heard her voice above the sounds of sea and ship dont leave me he rested his forehead on the weapons black breech and whispered never captain james tyacke paused outside isaac yorks chartroom and glanced in at the sailingmaster who was crowded against his table with his three mates york smiled his sharp eye taking in the dress coat and gleaming epaulette youre about early this day sir tyacke glanced over a masters mates shoulder at the open log and the date on the first page in yorks strong handwriting september th with the time and date of todays estimated position at the head of the column their eyes met york had no doubts either tyacke nodded at the masters mates watch well today gentlemen you will learn something of your enemy then he left the small space and walked towards the open deck silver sharkblue and lingering banks of shadow sea and sky he could feel scarlett walking closely behind him could sense his uneasiness but not fear that was something at least he turned abruptly and said what is wrong man i told you when we met i command sir richards flagship but i am still your captain speak out i nurse the notion that we will be too busy presently scarlett licked his lips his eyes so listless that he seemed disinterested in spite of what the day might bring tyacke was growing impatient in truth i cant help you if you remain dumb sir what is it a woman have you fathered a child scarlett shook his head i wish it were that simple sir money then he saw the bolt strike home cards scarlett nodded i am in debt sir serious debt tyacke regarded him without pity then you are a fool but we shall speak later i may be able to help you his tone hardened give of your best today i am relying on it indomitable will make this her day he strode aft and stared up at the reefed topgallants and courses the admirals flag and masthead pendant whipping out in the wind with the racing grey clouds beyond them he could hear the scrape of grindstones as duff the gunner put his men to work sharpening cutlasses and boardingaxes it could not have been very different before crйcy and agincourt he thought he saw actinglieutenant blythe in earnest conversation with protheroe the fourth lieutenant he still wore his midshipmans white patches but in a kings ship the word would have travelled like wildfire blythes one of them now tyacke smiled grimly or soon would be if he was prepared to listen for a change allday passed him by resting a cutlass on his hand to find the right balance some of the hands spoke to him but he did not seem to hear at the foot of the quarterdeck ladder allday gripped the handrail while indomitable buried her stem in a long atlantic roller hurling spray heavily over the figurehead the prancing lion with bared claws what are you doing here his son a cutlass thrust through his belt looked at him and shrugged the boatswain put me with the afterguard allday tried to make a joke of it old sam probably knew you were useless as a topman not so many ropes to play with down aft he was troubled all the same the quarterdeck in any ship was a target for marksmen and swivels it always had been the chain of command began and ended here many of the royal marines served in the afterguard too their boots and equipment making them useless for work aloft allday folded his arms we may be fighting some of your lot afore long my lad so be warned bankart regarded him sadly i wanted to live in peace that was all capn adam was the first to understand why cant you there always has to be a flag or one side or tother i hoped to find peace in america allday said gruffly when we gets home my son just remember what its cost some of us my wife unis has already had one man killed aboard the old hyperion and her brother john lost a leg in the line with the st huntingdonshires youll find plenty of good men whove been maimed in falmouth where sir richards found work for them and what of you he hesitated father ive moren any man could hope for unis and now my little kate theyll both be waiting for me now theres you john his eyes crinkled three johns all told eh bankart smiled strangely proud of this big man who for once was at a loss for words they both gazed up at the ragged clouds as the masthead lookout called reaper in sight to the soueast sir the frigate must be right in the spreading cloak of silver the first sighting of the day allday saw tyacke with daubeny the officerofthewatch conferring together looking along the upper deck and gangways as more light spilled over the seas edge like water over a dam he heard daubeny call aloft with you mr blisset and take a glass you idiot the brighteyed midshipman swarmed up the ratlines like a monkey and allday murmured cheeky little bugger that one asked me what the navy was like in my day they both fell silent as blissets piping voice floated down from the crosstrees deck there from woodpecker repeated reaper sail in sight to the souwest tyacke called my respects to the admiral mr scarlett and i heard captain tyacke bolitho waited for the deck to level off and then walked unhurriedly to the quarterdeck rail where he and tyacke formally touched hats to one another allday watched it always unnerved him even though he knew sir richard would never suspect it from his oak he turned to speak with his son but bankart was already being urged aft by the squat boatswain sam hockenhull allday felt the soreness in his chest come alive like a warning it never left him completely nor did it allow him to forget the day he had been cut down by spanish steel and bolitho had been on the point of surrendering to save him always the pain tyacke looked for another midshipman acknowledge the signal mr arlington he turned to bolitho and waited for the inevitable bolitho glanced across the motionless figures and those who peered up at the lookouts lofty perch as if they expected it to prove a mistake he saw allday looking at him remembering or trying to forget he smiled and saw allday raise one big hand like a private salute when you are ready captain tyacke tyacke turned on his heel his mutilated face stark in the first pale rays of silver light beat to quarters and clear for action if you please mr scarlett avery was here too with the new senior midshipman carleton the replacement for blythe who had taken the first vital step on his ladder of promotion avery said make to reaper repeated woodpecker close on flag he glanced at bolitho and saw him smile briefly to the captain like a last handshake he thought of his sister in her shabby clothes the way she had embraced him on that final day the drummers and fifers scrambled into line dragging their pipeclayed belts into place their sticks crossed beneath their noses as they watched their sergeant now the drums rolled and rattled drowning even the scamper of bare feet as the men ran to obey to clear the ship from bow to stern opening her up into two great batteries bolitho watched without expression even right aft beneath this deck there would be nothing to impede the seamen and marines once action was joined all gone catherines gifts the greenbound shakespeare sonnets the winecooler which she had had engraved with the bolitho crest and family motto for my countrys freedom he could recall his father tracing that same motto with his fingers on the great fireplace in falmouth it would be cold in cornwall now the wind off the sea the anger of breakers beneath the cliffs where zenoria had thrown herself away and had broken adams heart everything carried below a few portraits perhaps wardroom chairs a metal box with individual moneypouches a family watch a lock of somebodys hair cleared for action sir scarlett sounded breathless although he had not moved from this place and tyackes laconic comment nine minutes mr scarlett they do you proudly sir bolitho touched his eye praise indeed from tyacke or was it scarletts troubles that concerned him more deck there sail in sight to the norwest then midshipman blissets reedy voice tis zest sir tyacke smiled i had forgotten all about that shrimp acknowledge but tell zest to remain on station avery saw bolitho nod to him and he touched the signals midshipman on the arm he jumped as if he had been hit by a musketball hoist battle ensigns mr carleton how do i feel he lifted and dropped the hanger in its scabbard at his hip and saw some of the quarterdeck gun crews staring at him i feel nothing only the need to belong he glanced at bolitho his profile so calm as he watched the horizon for the first sign of the enemy to serve this man like no other deck there second sail to the souwest nother manowar sir avery expected he might see surprise even dismay in the profile turned towards him if there was anything he might recognise it was relief he repeated his thoughts in his mind like no other bolitho stood watching the sea and his men while they waited for their next orders the little woodpecker would give them early warning before scuttling to safety from those great guns two ships then as he had expected the other one must be baltimore royal marines take station up the shrouds on either side to their positions in the fightingtops marines known to be good shots above the rest at least three of them tyacke had discovered were once poachers the rest tramped across the quarterdeck and took up their stations behind the tightlypacked hammock nettings grimfaced bayonets fixed the debonair captain cedric du cann watching them with cold professional interest his face almost the colour of his tunic solitary scarlet figures stood at the hatchways ready to prevent men from running below if their nerve broke or they were driven mad by the sights and sounds around them tyacke called you may cast off the boats mr hockenhull always a bad moment even for the most experienced seamen who would know well the additional danger from flying splinters if a longboat were smashed by cannon fire but as they were lowered and allowed to drift away many saw them as a last chance of survival if the battle turned against them loosely moored together they would drift with the sea to await recovery by the victors whoever they might be rig the nets more men ran to obey and allday saw his son hauling on blocks and tackles with his new companions to spread the protective net above the big doublewheel and its four helmsmen just a glance and he was gone for a brief second allday tried to recall bankarts mother and was shocked to discover he could remember nothing about her as if she had never been from reaper sir enemy in sight to the souwest acknowledge and repeat signal to zest bolitho said suddenly do your fifers know portsmouth lass sergeant the royal marine puffed out his cheeks yessir it sounded like of course then so be it isaac york recorded in his log that on this september morning in while the indomitable held her same course under reduced canvas the ships small drummers and fifers marched and countermarched up and down the crowded gun deck the familiar tune portsmouth lass lively enough to set a mans foot tapping or purse his lips in a silent whistle allday looked at his admiral and smiled gravely bolitho never forgot nor would he bolitho took a telescope from the rack and walked aft towards the taffrail his body angling to the deck without conscious effort he raised the glass with care imagining his small force as the morning gull might see it sailing in line abreast with indomitable in the centre the wind lively but steady across the starboard quarter by and large as isaac york would describe it he steadied the glass once again on the western horizon still partly in misty shadow compared with the silver knifeedge of the eastern sky he tightened his grip on the cool metal controlling his emotion the quarterdeck gun crews were still awaiting orders after clearing for action some would be watching him and wondering what this day might cost there she was beers unity with almost every sail set and filled so that she appeared to be leaning forward into the surging spray beneath her beakhead the huge broadpendant straight out like painted metal a picture of naval strength at its best over his shoulder he said tell captain tyacke fifteen minutes he glanced up to the masthead pendant and felt his injured eye sting in protest avery was ready the signal already bent on as they had discussed it for such an eventuality except that adam had commanded anemone then he would be feeling her loss today with men whose strength he did not know in a frigate which was very like the one which had been so dear to him and yet he would be thinking so different he turned and walked down to the quarterdeck rail and ran his eyes the full length of the ship the gun crews were stripped to the waist despite the winds bitter edge their muscled bodies very brown from their service in the caribbean beer could not risk losing them but he would not expect them to run either he tugged out his watch and saw midshipman essex observing him with studied concentration there must be no mistakes at this stage beer had the windgage and that was bad enough he felt allday moving closer heard his uneven breathing the old pain probably aroused and reminding him of that other time and all the rest unity and baltimore between them probably carried as many guns as a firstrate ship of the line together or separately they would be hard to surprise or vanquish he said mr avery general signal alter course steer northwest by north as the bright signal flags soared aloft to break out to the wind he could see adams intent face in his mind and hamilton of the reaper and the plump eames of woodpecker who had defied orders to hunt for survivors the topmen were already spread out along the yards with every spare hand at braces and halliards the moment of decision had come which could destroy every one of them all acknowledged sir avery licked his lips to moisten them bolitho looked at tyacke execute as the flags darted down again to drop amongst the signal party in colourful disorder tyacke shouted lay her on the larboard tack mr york steer norwest by north as close as you can with the spokes gleaming in the strange light the big wheel was hauled over the helmsmen squinting at the masthead pendant and the shaking driver while indomitable continued to swing he snatched a telescope from a gasping midshipman and rested it on the boys shoulder as reefs were cast off and the spreading canvas thundered out from every spar until even the great main sail yard appeared to be bending like a bow from lineabreast to lineahead with the little brig lost somewhere beyond reaper tyacke yelled cast off your breechings prepare to load full elevation mr scarlett then surprisingly tyacke removed his hat and slapped it against the nearest breech come on my lads watch this lady fly with almost every sail she could carry filled and hard to the wind the ship did seem to be bounding over the crests not away from the enemy this time but on a closehauled converging tack all guns load bolitho gripped a stay and watched the halfnaked bodies of the gun crews moving in tight separate teams the scampering powdermonkeys with their bulky cartridges each gun captain stooping to check the training tackles his heavy gun moving slightly with the breeching rope cast off open the ports the gunports on either side were hauled open as if raised by a single hand drills drills and more drills now they were ready lieutenant daubeny by the foremast his sword across his shoulder while he watched the enemy not merely sails any more but towering and full of menace as they bore down towards the larboard bow heavy artillery roared from elsewhere and there was something like a sigh as the little woodpecker drifted out of command her foremast yards and flapping canvas trailing over the side even as more longrange balls from unity slammed into her hull tyacke drew his sword on the uproll lads lay for the foremast bolitho gripped his hands together and watched the glittering sword in tyackes fist the baltimore was steering directly for the gap between indomitable and adams zest in the van the deck tilted slightly the topsails flapping in protest while the ship came as close as she dared into the wind fire it was like watching an invisible avalanche as it roared across baltimores tall side splintering gangways and timbers alike upending guns and clawing every sail so that some ripped open tearing into long ribbons as the wind completed the destruction signal zest mr avery attack and harry the enemys rear tyacke glanced round hell need no second order sir stop your vents sponge out load along the deck each grubby gun captain held up his fist ready sir run out a few flashes burst through the thickening smoke and bolitho felt the enemys iron smash into the lower hull men peered at one another looking for friends and messmates not a single man had fallen and bolitho heard a ragged cheer defiance pride and the overwhelming madness of a fight at sea fire allday exclaimed the buggers mizzen is goin sir the baltimores steering must have been damaged or its helmsmen smashed down in that last broadside a few guns were still firing but the timing was gone the ability to change tack destroyed with it bolitho wiped his face with his sleeve and saw the long orange tongues spitting through the smoke beyond the big american steady and merciless gun by gun into the drifting baltimores unprotected stern bolitho could imagine adam sighting and firing each gun himself remembering what he had lost and could never reclaim scarlett called wildly reapers struck sir he sounded half mad with disbelief the bastards bolitho lowered his glass reaper had been overwhelmed all but dismasted her sails like blackened rags she was falling downwind her ensign gone her upper deck like a slaughterhouse smashed guns men and pieces of men her brave captain james hamilton in a game made for others far younger killed on the quarterdeck where he had fought his ship to the end he should have remained in the heic this was not for him bolitho looked at his hand on the rail gripping until it was bloodless not for me either run out take aim fire bolitho coughed as more smoke swirled inboard through the open ports acrid savage blinding reaper had had no chance a small sixthrate of guns against beers powerful artillery he wiped his eyes and saw avery watching him surprisingly calm distancing himself from the shattered ships and the floundering bodies that marked woodpeckers sudden end as he did from many other experiences all reloaded sir scarlett was staring from tyacke to his admiral a silence had fallen over the ship even the wind had lulled for the moment drifting through smoke as dense as fog with only the muffled sounds of musket fire and swivels and the smells of burning timber like the gateway to hell itself then he saw unitys topgallants her skyscrapers punctured here and there but strangely serene above the smoke and carnage it concealed stand by lads bolitho watched tyackes sword wondering in those few seconds why fate had decided that this vital meeting was to be but the sword fell from tyackes hand as the smoke exploded in one huge broadside a world of screaming madness of falling rigging and razoredged splinters men dying or being pounded into bloody gruel even as they stood mesmerised by the enormity of the bombardment there were twisting unreal shapes as the maintopmast thundered down over the side the corpses of some marines tossed from the nets and into the sea like human flotsam hands pulling him to his feet although he could not recall having fallen his hat was gone and one of his proud epaulettes there was bright blood on his breeches but no pain and he saw midshipman deane staring at him from the rail half his young body pulped into something obscene bolitho heard avery calling but it seemed far away although their faces all but touched are you hit sir he gasped i think not he dragged out the old sword and saw allday crouching near by his cutlass already drawn while he peered half blind into the smoke somebody yelled repel boarders standto marines face your front bolitho wiped his face again with his sleeve there was still order and life in the ship axes flashed through the trailing cordage and shattered spars alongside and he heard the boatswain bellow more men on the forebraces ere tyacke was also on his feet his coat badly torn by the trailing halliards which had almost clawed him over the side but the guns were still loaded waiting to fire when tyacke dropped his sword now bolitho would have fallen but for alldays grip on his arm the deck was slippery and the sweet smell of death was stronger even than the burned powder tyacke stared at him and then waved his blade open fire unitys shadow seemed to tower above them sails already being brailed up as the americans lined the gangway and prepared to board the drifting indomitable tyackes voice seemed to rouse a memory a discipline which had all but gone with the hulls barely yards apart the roar of indomitable s twentyfourpounders sounded like the climax to a nightmare it seemed to give individual strength where before there had been only the raw fury of war wildeyed the indomitables remaining men and the marines from the nettings charged yelling and cheering blades clashing and stabbing as they swarmed on to the enemys deck musket and pistolshots brought down a few of them and one hot blast of canister cut down captain du cann and some of his marines before the frenzied mob overwhelmed the swivel and hacked the solitary gunner to bloodied rags suddenly there were more cheers english voices this time and for one dazed instant bolitho imagined relief had arrived from the convoy but it was zest grappling the big unity from the opposite side adam and his new company were already swarming across the gap allday parried a cutlass to one side and hacked down the man with such a powerful blow that the blade almost severed his neck but it was too much for him the pain seared through his chest and he could barely see which way he was facing avery was trying to help and allday wanted to thank him to do what he had always done to stay close to bolitho he tried to shout but it was only a croak he saw it all as if it were a series of pictures scarlett yelling and slashing his way over the bloodred deck his hanger like molten silver in the misty sunshine then the point of a pike motionless between two struggling seamen like a snake allday thought then it stabbed the lieutenant with the speed of light scarlett dropped his sword and clung to the pike even as it was dragged from his stomach his scream silenced as he pitched down beneath the stamping hacking figures he saw sir richard fighting a tall american lieutenant their blades ringing and scraping as each sought the others weakness avery saw it too and dragged a pistol from beneath his coat tyacke shouted the flag cut it down he turned and saw another officer running at him with his sword almost contemptuously he waited for the man to falter at his terrible scars and momentarily lose his nerve before he ran him through as he would have done a slaver there was one great deafening cheer which seemed unending earsplitting men hugging one another others peering round cut and dazed not knowing whether they had won or lost barely knowing friend from foe then silence the sounds of battle and suffering held at bay like another enemy bolitho went to alldays assistance and with avery got him to his feet avery said simply he was trying to protect you sir but allday was crawling on his knees his hands and legs soaked with blood his eyes suddenly desperate and pleading john its me john dont leave us now bolitho watched unable to speak as allday knelt and with great gentleness gathered his sons body into his arms bolitho said here let me old friend but the eyes that met his were blank like a total strangers he said only not now sir richard i just needs a few minutes with him he brushed the hair from his sons face so still now caught at the moment of impact bolitho felt a hand on his shoulder and saw that it was tyackes what the enemy had surrendered but it made no sense only alldays terrible hurt was real tyacke glanced at allday on this crowded and foughtover deck so alone with his grief he said abruptly im sorry sir richard he waited for bolithos attention to return to him commodore beer is asking for you he looked up at the sky clearing now to lay bare their wounds and damage if he was surprised to be alive he did not reveal it he said hes dying then he picked up a fallen boardingaxe and drove it with furious bitterness into the quarterdeck ladder and for what commodore nathan beer was propped against the broken compassbox when bolitho found him his surgeon and a bandaged lieutenant trying to make him comfortable beer looked up at him i thought wed meet eventually he tried to offer his hand but as if it was too heavy it fell back into his lap bolitho stooped down and took the hand it had to end in victory for one of us he glanced at the surgeon i must thank you for saving my nephews life doctor even in war it is necessary to love another the commodores hand was heavy in his the life running out of it like sand from a glass then he opened his eyes and said in a strong voice your nephewi remember now there was a ladys glove bolitho glanced at the french surgeon cannot anything be done for him the surgeon shook his head and afterwards bolitho recalled seeing tears in his eyes he gazed into beers lined face a man with an ocean of experience he thought of tyackes bitterness and anger and for what someone he cared for very much but beers expression interested and eager had become still and unmoving allday was helping him to his feet set bravely sir richard bolitho saw lieutenant daubeny walk past the stars and stripes draped over one shoulder he touched alldays arm and then realised that adam was watching them across the fallen yes old friend it gets harder he pointed at daubeny here lay the flag over the commodore ill not part him from it now he climbed slowly across the fallen spars and on to indomitable s scarred deck then he turned and grasped alldays arm aye set bravely he looked at the watching faces what did they really think pride or was it conceit the need to win no matter what he touched the locket beneath his stained shirt which had been clean only hours ago aloud he said quietly ill never leave you until life itself is denied me despite all this carnage or perhaps because of it he knew she would hear him epilogue lady catherine somervell stared at her reflection in the lookingglass and brushed her long dark hair her eyes critical as if searching for a fault brushbrushbrush automatic and without feeling it was just another morning a bitter one too if the frost around the bedroom windows was any gauge just another day perhaps a letter would come in her heart she knew it would not in two days time it would be december after that did not bear thinking of another year separated from the only man she loved could ever love it had been a hard winter so far she would ride around the estate and then go to nancy lewis the king of cornwall was ill he had suffered a stroke the possibility of which his doctor had warned him often enough in the past catherine had sat with him reading to him feeling the frustration and the impatience of the man who more than most had lived life to the full he had muttered no more hunting no more ridingwheres the point of going on she had said there is nancy to think of lewis try for her sake she crossed the room now to the tall cheval mirror the one decorated with carved thistles a gift from captain james bolitho to his scottish bride in spite of the cold air which even an early fire in the grate could not dispel catherine opened her gown and let it fall over her arms again the searching stare like despair like fear she cupped her fine breasts in her hands and pressed them together as he had done so often will he still love me like that will he believe me beautiful but when when when the news from north america had been vague and sparse reports had criticised the inability of the smaller english frigates to maintain their usual superiority over the new american vessels which were more powerful and skilfully handled but that war was a long way from england the newssheets were more preoccupied with wellingtons continued success against the french and the prospect of an overwhelming victory within months catherine dressed herself slowly and with care it was strange not to have sophie helping her starting each day with her uncaring chatter she would have to find another maid perhaps in london someone in whom she might see herself again she opened a drawer and saw richards gift lying there she took it out and carried it to the window the freezing air took her breath away but she ignored it and opened the velvet box his last present to her the fan set with diamonds when it hung between her breasts she felt both proud and defiant together they had defied society but had won the heart of a nation she kissed the pendant and fought against the tears i must hold on it is just another day in their simple way the people on the estate some of them crippled sailors from richards own ships seemed to turn to her trusting her to look after them with so many of the menfolk at sea or forming squares on wellingtons fields of battle she glanced down at the yard two horses being groomed a carter delivering cider for the estate workers not that there was much to do in this bitter weather and beyond the naked trees ragged spectres on the headland beyond them the sea would soon show itself as something solid like water penned in a great dam how will he see me when he first comes through those doors she offered a wistful smile more likely he will be worried about how i shall receive him he dreaded getting older even his wounded eye was like a cruel taunt a sign of the years between them she sighed and left the room the dark portraits were all here watching her pass the bolitho faces she paused on the staircase and what of adam would he ever recover she saw bryan ferguson the steward about to leave the house he had probably been discussing the days arrangements with his wife grace the housekeeper a man so full of energy and enthusiasm despite his single arm he grinned at her and touched his forehead you caught me out my lady i was not expecting you this early is it early ferguson watched her so beautiful even with her rough ridingcloak over her arm sad too the other face that few people ever saw she said im ready if you are bryan i have no feeling for breakfast he said dont you let my grace hear that my ladyshell take it badly they walked out into the grey light and turned towards the office where ferguson kept his estate accounts and records she saw his eyes fall to the breast of her gown and the glittering pendant she had hung there almost without realising it she said i know you think me foolish to wear it i might lose it somewhere its only she turned suddenly her face terribly pale what was that ferguson wished his wife was here she would know what to do he listened as a hollow bang echoed across the headland and imagined that he felt the ground shake he stared as young matthew came hurrying from the stable yard did you hear he saw lady catherine and touched his hat beg pardon mlady i didnt know you was here too another bang the echo going on and on until lost inland she asked a ship in distress her mouth was quite dry and her heart was throbbing with an almost physical pain ferguson took her arm best you come inside where its warm he shook his head thats no ship my lady thats the st mawes battery he tried to control his racing thoughts hearing nothing but the regular boom of cannon fire young matthew looked around as other figures emerged into the crisp morning there was a sudden silence and she heard herself ask what does it mean bryan please tell me grace ferguson had arrived at last her plump arms outstretched as ferguson said hoarsely seventeen shots my lady an admirals salute thats what that is they all stared at one another with disbelief until young matthew exclaimed well the port admiral from plymouth wouldnt warrant that he grinned hugely hes come home mlady hes here grace ferguson said youre not riding down there in your state mlady her husband said matthew the carriage catherine walked slowly down to the low wall where her roses would bloom again in the spring coming home it was not possible but it was i must not let him see me like this she could feel the tears on her cheeks and lips like salt from the sea she said let us go down bryan i want to watch him come in the horses were stamping and shaking their harness as they were backed into the shafts of the handsome light carriage with the bolitho crest on the door i am here dearest of men no more will you come home to an empty house the tiny village of fallowfield on the helford river was quiet and still protected from the freezing southwesterly by the hillside and the trees although the wind had sent even the hardiest fisherman scurrying for harbour the little inn with its proud sign the old hyperion was as always like a haven used mostly by farmworkers and passing merchants in the open doorway unis alldays onelegged brother john stood unmoving in the cold years of marching and fighting with his regiment had hardened him against it and he was more interested in how many customers they would fetch in this day than in the weather he had heard alldays child kate chuckling from the kitchen a happy little soul at the moment anyway unis came into the parlour and regarded him thoughtfully ill fetch you some ale tapped it this morning just to your taste she wiped her scrubbed hands with a towel quiet aint it hope we gets more folk in here later on a horse clattered along the narrow road john saw the glint of buttons the familiar hat pulled down against the breeze off the sea one of the coastguard he touched his hat smiled at the two figures in the doorway and called did you hear the excitement over yonder at falmouth wont do your trade no good thoughtheres a kings ship in carrick roads so the press are bound to be abroad tonight he cantered away unmoved by the misfortunes of others unis ran out after him in her apron something she would never normally do what ship ned he twisted round in the saddle frigate the zest the onelegged exsoldier put his arm round her shoulders and guided her back into the parlour i know what you were thinking unis love but she pulled herself away and stood motionless in the centre of the room her fingers clasped as if she were in prayer john remember that letter we had zest she be one of sir richards ships she stared around must change the bed john you fetch some of the new bread tell annie to keep an eye on young kate he protested but to no avail she stared past him through that door my man is going to come this day as god is my witness i just knows it there were tears too but she was more excited than anxious they had two customers carpenters working on the little church where unis and john allday had been wed it would be dark early he watched his sister worriedly follow the drum wear the kings coat they said but nobody ever told you about this part of it unis walked into the parlour her eyes very bright hes coming john like i said like he promised then he heard it for the first time faint but familiar above the soft moan of wind around the eaves the steady clipclop of bryan fergusons pony and trap she said quietly dont go john youre part of it there were muffled voices and she whispered dear god let it be him the door opened slowly perhaps even nervously and then she was in his powerful grip her face nuzzling his fine blue jacket with the bolitho buttons on it oh dear john its been so long ive missed you so her brother watching offered no need to look surprised john we just heard that the zest was in port allday stared around barely able to believe he was here yes we was aboard her young captain adams in command he held her gently as if she might break ive thought so often of this minute he thought too of the big grey house where he had left sir richard with his lady he must have written to her about his son that had been almost the worst part she had looked at him very calmly and had said he has not really gone you know think of that sometimes and now he was here he stiffened as the girl unis had hired to help her came in with a baby in her arms he knew by instinct that it was his daughter although it could have been anyones he would not tell unis about his lost son not yet this was their moment alone he took the child carefully shes a mite small unis said softly the doctor says its unlikely ill carry another john i know a son might have pleased you better he pressed the child against his body and tried not to relive the scene on that dreadful september morning friends and enemies alike helping and consoling each other when the fighting had stopped and the flag had come down through the smoke he replied quietly shes our kate shell do me fine he hesitated a son can break your heart unis glanced at her brother but he shook his head it would keep she asked have you brought somebody with you john allday left him outside in the cold what will people think the door opened and lieutenant george avery ducked under the low beams a room for a few days mrs allday id be obliged he looked around remembering when they had left here i thought it fairer to leave sir richard to enjoy his homecoming he was smiling but she noticed that it did not reach his tawny eyes it was a strange feeling because of the letters he had written for her man she seemed to know him well avery was saying long walks good food a chance to think before the next time satisfied allday said so youre staying with the little crew after all avery said was there ever any choice he looked around the parlour again slowly allowing himself to accept the peace and welcome of the place the child almost lost in alldays arms he would never forget that morning either allday carrying his dead son so tenderly across the littered bloodied deck where so many had fallen allday quite alone for those last moments before he lowered his son into the sea alongside and watched him drift away unis exclaimed drinks for everybody now mr avery what would please you best like a reply they heard fergusons trap clatter away he had been waiting just in case richard bolitho sat by the great fire and held his hands towards the blazing logs when i saw the carriage kate he held out one hand and touched her as she came to him with goblets of brandy i could scarcely believe it she nestled down beside him a toast to my admiral an admiral of england he stroked her hair her neck where he had seen the pendant how could she have known really known so many memories to share with her when they walked again tyackes moving farewell when indomitable had entered halifax with her two american prizes where repairs some urgent would be necessary bolitho had clasped his hand for the last time when his flag had been shifted to zest tyacke had said when you need me sir richard just say the word together they had looked at the battered prizes already swarming with men and bolitho had said it might be over soon once and for all tyacke had smiled then i shall return to africa i liked it there the long voyage home soon to be summoned to the admiralty he could even find an ironic amusement in that again and adams grave pleasure when the guns had thundered out in salute to his new command and to the man whose flag flew proudly from the mainmast truck the formality had been as unexpected as it was moving after all that had happened the guns had said it all their welcome home to falmouths most famous son bolitho looked up at her as she said bring your drink i have something to show you hand in hand they climbed the staircase past each watching portrait and then to their room it was already very dark outside and bolitho heard an early fox barking harshly she had told him about roxby he would ride over and see him but not yet catherine had covered the portrait with a silk shawl she smiled but her eyes hinted at uncertainty ready it was not as he had expected or was it not in one of her fine shotsilk gowns or ridinghabit she was barefooted her hair loose to the wind wearing the same sailors shirt and breeches she had worn aboard the golden plover when it had been smashed on the reef and they had suffered the privations of an open boat until in all the limitless miles of sea james tyacke had found them she was watching him anxiously it is the real me when we were so close when we needed each other as never before he took her in his arms and faced her towards the chevalglass i shall never forget kate he felt her tremble as she watched his hands in the glass caressing her undressing her like a stranger all else forgotten she whispered i love you so the rest was lost as he came to her out in the darkness on the crumbling cliff path a sleeping gull was suddenly awakened but on the wind it could have been mistaken for a girls last cry
