affairs secretary of homeland security prologue the last thing eddie gostowski was thinking about on thursday evening the twentysecond of may was that he was going to die for the first hour or so of his pm to am shift as a security guard for the nyiso power distribution giant he had been thinking about the yankees and wondering if they had enough pitching to win the american league east division again for the second hour he had debated whether to buy flowers or candy this year for his beloved marys sixtieth birthday eddie had been patrolling this particular control facility for most of the eleven years the new york independent system operator had been in existence and nothing out of the ordinary had ever happenedabsolutely nothing not once he understood his job and he understood what was at stake should the nyiso somehow shed its entire load at oncea massive blackout of almost indescribable proportions engulfing everyplace from albany to new york city and long island it was his job along with others in the chain of virtually failsafe checks and balances to ensure such a disaster never occurred but nothing out of the ordinary had ever happened at his control facilityabsolutely nothing not once as he had every night at this time eddie set a timer for fifteen minutes and prepared to take a nap but first one last check of things it took him a few seconds to realize that several of his gauges had gone out of whack the unmanned substations serving marcy to albany and albany to leeds had gone offline curious eddie began ticking off all the possible explanations for the weird happening and came up with little if the gauges were right and there was no way they could be there was no longer any power going to the capital district which surrounded and included albany still more bewildered than alarmed eddie moved to his left his equipment told the same story for other substations dunwoodie to long island and ravensbrook in queens had also been tripped goethals and farragut controlling the power to large portions of new york city was down as well assuming the readings were all correct the whole system was unstable and the largest city in the country was on the verge of something massive and horrible eddies first move was a call to the nearest manned station miles north in albany seven rings and an answering machine even an explosion at the facility in albany would not cause this sort of power loss since its inception nyiso had been closing loopholes in its system to the point where an almost inconceivable number of events had to occur simultaneously to cause any major degree of problems but incredibly those events were happening as far as eddie could tell his control station was now the only thing standing against a blackout that would engulf most of eastern new york including long island and the five boroughs of new york city he raced to the phone got the emergency number of the fbi from a chart on the wall and began dialing that was when he felt the point of a knife press against the back of his neck set the receiver down sport a mans husky voice said in an accent that sounded british the knife point felt as if it were going to slice straight into eddies spine pplease that hurts whats your name sport eddie eddie gostowski please im going to lower the knife eddie but unless you do exactly as i say youre a dead man got that yes i said have you got that yes yes now pl okay sport we dont have much time youre going to turn around and look me in the eye if you fuck with me in any way any way at all im going to slit your throat is that clear okay now swing around eddie did as he was ordered towering above him was a mansix foot three maybe more with shoulders that seemed to block out the room he was dressed in blackwatch cap jeans and a turtleneckwith black greasepaint covering his face his eyes were dark and cold in his hand was a bowie knifebroad and curved at the tipten inches long at least behind the man and to his right arms crossed feet apart stood a second man in identical dress and greasepaint as frightened as he was eddie couldnt get the notion out of his head of the disaster that would ensue should the brownout that was already in effect be allowed to progress as if responding to his thoughts the big man placed the tip of the bowie knife beneath eddies chin and lifted his face up no arguing with me now he said i want you to use whatever you have here to trip this unit offline but the huge man drew the razorsharp blade across eddies gullet like a violin bow slicing open a shallow gash from one side of his jawbone to the other i said dont argue with me sport now do as i tell you and you wont be hurt any more mess with me and youll die in pieces and well still find the trip switch to take this place offline he pulled a handkerchief from his back pocket and passed it to eddie to stanch the flow of blood shakily eddie crossed to the adjacent room hesitated and then threw the trip instantly the substation went black moments later a generator kicked on and the lights returned anything else we need to do the big man asked the other all four teams have reported in no problems at all they motioned eddie back into the control room and down onto his chair that your emergency line sport the man asked gesturing to a red wall phone yes eddie managed continuing to put pressure on the gash the handkerchief was sodden with blood is it monitored yes but with the blackout im not sure anyone is there im sure this call will be recorded though right i said right rright okay then this the number yes yes sir only then did eddie realize the man was wearing latex gloves the intruder fished out a sheet of paper from his back pocket and unfolded it then he dialed eddie could hear the taped message go on at the beep the man held up the paper and read with some unevenness what was typed on it in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth then god said let there be light now genesis has taken that light away this is the beginning okay sport youve been a big helpa real big help thanks eddie said meekly the man turned to go then with a sudden vicious backhand swipe he slashed the huge bowie knife through eddie gostowskis throat maybe i should have told him that sometimes i cant be trusted he said chapter day pm est madam speaker the president of the united states at the words from the sergeant at arms of the house of representatives the audience rose to its feet as president james allaire entered the house chambers to thunderous applause mixed with cheers allaire glanced at the two secret service agents stationed opposite each other just inside the entryway standing as straight and still as the black and gold ionic columns dividing the wall behind the tribune sean oneil head of the presidential secret service unit shadowed allaire as he gladhanded his way down the long royalbluecarpeted corridor the presidents heart responded to a rush of adrenaline as the clapping neared the decibel level of a jet engine on takeoff he stopped every few steps to shake hands or exchange modest embraces with men in dark suits wearing carefully chosen ties and with impeccably dressed women who smelled of exotic perfume ahead of him he could just see the nine justices of the supreme court and the five members of the joint chiefs of staff allaire sensed oneil move a step closer behind him as a congressman from missouri exuberantly pumped his hand and then shouted go get em mr president youre going to wow em tonight thats right allaire thought i am going to wow them there had been many occasions during the beginning of the first term of his presidency when dr jim allaire privately wondered about a decision he was forced to make the weight of a single act benign as it might at first seem often carried with it surprising ripples and unintended consequences that added to his graying hair and the crowsfeet at the corners of his grayblue eyes however delivering the first state of the union address of his second term was not one of those moments of selfdoubt he had won reelection by a fairly wide margin over speaker of the house ursula ellis and now despite lingering sub rosa enmity between the two of them it was time to cast aside politics and get some business done for the past hour allaire had paced inside the office of the minority leader of the house sipping diet pepsi and having makeup reapplied for the cameras all while trying to contain his nervous energy the feeling he got before a speech of this magnitude reminded him of his days playing quarterback for the spartans of case western reserve where he also earned his md degree between his college football career and years spent working as an internist at the cleveland clinic allaire had learned the importance of balancing confidence with a respectful fear of failure viewed as a man of the people the genuine caring that had made him a respected physician contributed to his consistently elevated job approval rating as president with the worlds problems getting progressively more complex and domestic terrorism on the mind of every american the people needed a leader they could believe ina man of poise and dignity in whom to invest their trust tonight allaire vowed to reaffirm that he was that man and to give them a speech they would all remember the president reached the podium where his head speechwriter visibly more nervous than he was had placed two leatherbound copies of tonights carefully guarded address he turned and presented the first copy to vice president henry tilden in his capacity as president of the senate and then the other to ursula ellis who strained to maintain eye contact and whose handshake held all the energy of a mackerel on ice the president stifled a grin although he suspected ellis knew what he was thinkingfiftythree to fortyfourthe margin by which he had beaten her in the election allaire had practiced the speech dozens of times and could probably have delivered it flawlessly without the aid of the transparent teleprompters set on either side of his lectern the crowd kept up its applause with the american flag serving as his backdrop he faced the people and waved his appreciation then he set his hands on the sides of the podium as a signal he was ready to begin his eyes met briefly with those of his wife of twentyseven years the muchloved first lady rebecca allaire and next to her their only child samantha whom he still could not believe was a senior at georgetown already set for harvard law the clapping continued speaker ellis rose from her chair and banged her gavel several times at last a profound hush fell over the seven hundred in attendance on the cornice overhead the clock read exactly pm allaires thoughts flashed on the motto inscribed in the friezein god we trust it was a running joke about doctors that their md degree really stood for m diety allaire had a deep faith and had never felt comfortable with the notion of physicians as gods but he did know that at that moment he was closer to being god than any doctor had ever been thanks to the recurring deadly attacks by the apparently domestic group calling itself genesis the first order of business for the night had to be terrorism people were on edge the four attacks orchestrated by the group had been bold ruthless arrogant and very dramatic still there had as yet been no demands madeonly the damage and the deaths he was going to start strong with a warning to genesis whoever they were of american solidarity and a promise that their capture and successful prosecution was the top priority of his second term allaire had been assured by hank tomlinson chief of the fifteenhundredofficer capitol police force that security for tonights speech was the most extensive ever employing stateoftheart magnetometers camera after camera and manual bag checks in addition to advanced xray screeners now it was up to the president and his speechwriters to convince the american people that they were as safe and secure in their homes and personal lives as those here with him in the capitol of the united states allaires speech materialized on the virtually invisible teleprompters madam speaker vice president tilden fellow citizens as a new congress gathers i am reminded of and humbled by the sacred honor you the american people have invested in all of your elected officials so before i begin tonights state of the union address on behalf of all who have been blessed with your trust i want to offer my bottomless thanks for another term of what my father would have called good steady work allaire paused waiting the perfect number of beats to let the laughter subside before resuming it was a strategic opening that he had argued for with his speechwriters all of whom felt it important to start on a more somber note as usual he was right the state of the union was a wonderful opportunity to showcase his humanity in addition to imparting to the electorate his resolve and courage to do what was right and necessary but with this responsibility comes great challenges that we must strive together to overcome our economy is growing stronger now but there is much to be done unemployment is at its lowest level in more than a decade slowly we are winning the war against poverty our optimism that we as a people can master any difficulty and achieve unparalleled peace and prosperity throughout the world has never been greater and the state of our union is strong allaire beamed as those on both sides of the aisle and in the gallery rose to their feet as one cheering loudly he could hear whistles over the applause and hesitated long enough to draw in a slow deep breath the next several crucial minutes of his speech would focus on international and domestic terrorism the crowd settled down allaire scanned their faces he would know when they were ready for him to resume as a dense silence enveloped the room the president suddenly heard a disturbing noisea popping sound immediately followed by something that to him sounded like the plink of breaking glass the sound came from somewhere in the crowd to his right allaire and many others turned and watched as california senator arlene cogan opened up the purse that she had stowed beneath her chair instantly a thin white mist wafted out from within it covering her heavily madeup face like a steam bath within seconds cogan and those nearest to her began to coughand cough vehemently allaire immediately gave a prearranged signal to the coordinating technical director ordering the man to implement antidemonstration procedures and shut down the network pool controlling all television feed from the capitol murmurs from among the crowd escalated as another pop occurred across the chamber from the first followed by another and another each accompanied by the breaking of thin glass white mist and more coughing the murmurs gave way to shouting another briefcase and a purse were opened releasing identical thin clouds dont open it someone hollered i cant breathe for gods sake thats you thats your pocketbook get out of here lets get out the popping and breaking glass continued two more three four five allaire could see that mist was even arising from some bags that were unopened he quickly counted fifteen plumes scattered about the room maybe more do not open your briefcase or purse allaire shouted into his microphone he slammed his open palm on the podium everybody please remain calm secret service agents rushed the stage and quickly surrounded him they attempted to escort him to safety but he struggled against them and continued to call loudly for order at that instant allaire caught sight of something on the two teleprompters in front of his podium his blood turned cold the speech which seconds ago was easily legible in fourteenpoint helvetica font had disappeared from the screens in its place were three lines of text allaires breathing nearly stopped as he read the message on the fourth day god created the sun the moon and the stars and genesis released wrx chapter day pm est wrx jim allaire knew immediately what had happened genesis had struck a mortal blow at the government of the united states and at the very heart of the country every soul in the us capitol building including himself the vice president and nearly the entire line of succession to the presidency was in danger if there was to be any hope of averting an even more unprecedented disaster he had to take control of the situation he felt his chest tightening and wondered if it was just fear settling in or something far more horrificsomething in his bloodstream already at work attacking his body wrx for a moment the magnitude of the evolving crisis held allaire immobile from his vantage point on the rostrum he could see that panic had already begun to overtake many of the seven hundred who had gathered for his address selfpreservation was replacing civility men and women alike some of whom he had known for decades were shoving their way toward the exits some of them viciously job one allaire decided would have to be to secure all the doors in the center row of the balcony rebecca and samantha stood immobile side by side looking down at him even at a distance he could make out the pallor in their faces and the fear in their eyes before he could act though several agents took him by the shoulders and began moving him away from the microphone others stepped in and began helping to guide him toward the rear emergency exit no allaire shouted tend to the doors the doors he could see to his horror that people were already nearing the exits from the chamber and he knew they would all have to be brought back in by force if necessary several more agents arrived theyre just trying to get me to safety allaire told himself but they dont realize that there is no place safe to go there wasnt time to explain allaire twisted his body hard to the right breaking the hold of the agent positioned directly behind him while simultaneously seizing the lapels of another agents suit jacket he pulled the man to within inches of his face making certain his orders would be heard over the escalating din call and get the exits out of the chamber secured right now lock them down but sir we need to evacuate listen to me nobody is to leave this building absolutely nobody get everyone who leaves the chamber back inside right now it is life and death do you understand but i said do you understand yes sir then i want guards posted at every exit shut down the elevators to the gallery level and block those doors as well have guns drawn if need be and use them if you have to nobody gets out no exceptions but sir dammit do it now or go sit down the presidents face was flushed he could feel the arteries pulsating in his neck the agents guarding him peeled away as if from a football huddle chief agent sean oneil was just a few feet away barking orders into his radio sean allaire said motioning the man closer weve got a lethal situation on our hands a virus get three of your guys to the press gallery and confiscate all cell phones pagers and anything that might record or transmit use force if you have to tell them ill explain soon oneil hesitated a shadow of doubt darkening his face mr pres dont challenge me sean move now the cries of those in flight intensified as capitol police and secret service agents moved into position and began the difficult task of herding them back inside the house chamber allaire estimated that no more than twentyfive or thirty had actually made it out the doors to the vestibule his wife and daughter remained in front of their seats two of the few who werent in motion then he saw rebecca cough several times further down the row she was in a congressman from new hampshire was also coughing allaire searched for the plumes of smoke nearest to his family but by now the mists had almost totally dissipated i am responsible for this he thought forcing his way back to the rostrum i should never have allowed it to happen you cant block these exits a senators familiar voice boomed let us out they cant do this a woman cried they cant trap us in here like this what the hell is going on i wont go back in there i wont sweat something allaire had felt certain would not be an issue tonight cascaded down his brow stinging his eyes then salting his lips mr president allaire turned toward the voice which came from the center aisle along which just a few minutes ago he had made his grand entrance the architect of the capitol jordan lamar a portly african american man was pushing toward him through the dense crowd mr president lamar called out again allaire motioned for the man to hurry together on the rostrum they were joined by hank tomlinson chief of the fifteen hundred men and women of the capitol police force what the devil is going on mr president lamar asked weve got to get you out of here im not going anywhere no one is now listen i need every person back in his original seat immediately make sure every door leading to the outside is sealed no one gets in and no one gets out i mean no one it was hard to hear over the clamor behind them in the main chamber and a story above in the gallery now there were also some shrieks as word spread that the ways out were being sealed sir i dont understand tomlinson said whats happened allaire struggled to maintain his composureseldom a difficult task for him behind and above the capitol police chief he could see that rebecca and samantha along with some others had instinctively sat back down ill tell you hank ill tell everyone allaire said first though we need order in this room and we need it now but how allaire had heard enough gripping tomlinson firmly by the lapel he pulled the man close to his body distracting him long enough to extract the officers gun from his shoulder holster allaire had learned how to fire the semiautomatic sig p as part of operation keepsake a longstanding secret service program as an emergency security precaution operation keepsake was designed to impart special forces combat training to the president of the united states or as he was commonly referred to by the agents the potus before tomlinson could react allaire raised the gun high above his head four shots fired in rapid succession and amplified by the sound system exploded from the blacksteel barrel the discharges echoed deafeningly inside the enclosed chamber plaster from the ceiling where the bullets struck dropped onto several startled attendees silence quickly followed allaire wasted no time taking advantage of the change he grabbed the microphone turning up the volume until he heard feedback this is the president of the united states please return to your original seatsprecisely your original seats i am commanding the military the secret service and the capitol police to see to it that there are no further attempts to leave this building all exits have been secured right now i need each and every one of you to sit down at your original seat immediately you must be seated exactly where you were prior to the disturbance this is a direct order from your president as soon as you are back in your seats and have quieted down i will explain what is going on at first only a few dozen seemed to be responding then allaire dispatched two more shots and within half a minute nearly all the seats were filled the few who refused to comply with the demand were roughly deposited in their places by the nearest soldier or policeman allaires eyes swept across the rows of dignitaries many of them among the best and the brightest his country had to offer many of them his friends all of them now in grave danger rebecca and sam were together in the seats his staff had earlier reserved for them for a moment allaire held his wifes desperate gaze then he mouthed the words i love you and touched his finger to his eye and next to his heart before pointing it at sam it was a sign of affection they invented when their daughter was a child she and her mother in return made the same gesture to him allaire could not think of a time that he loved them more as the president panned the faces in the crowd a single thought would not let go never had he seen so much fear and yet the seven hundred had no idea just how afraid they really should be chapter day pm est allaire stood with his hands pressed firmly on the lectern trying to construct what he was going to say and how he was going to say it his eyes nearly unblinking gazed forward his mouth was dry he had always loved being a physician but after fifteen years as a practicing doc he felt as if he wanted to do more and turned to politics how many times over the years before he left medicine had he sat with patients and given them the horrible news that barring a miracle they were going to die from their illness he used to feel that because his sensitivity and empathy were genuine he was reasonably effective at it not this evening the crowds attention remained fixed on him the anxious quiet was beyond tense interrupted only by scattered volleys of coughing allaire knew it was time these people wantedneededexplanations but he felt strongly that if he disclosed the whole truth about the virus there would be no way to contain the ensuing panic whats happening a man suddenly shouted preempting allaire from the gallery does this have anything to do with genesis a second man called out yes he heard his voice say with forced calm yes unfortunately it does the first act of terror for which genesis had taken credit was the great new york blackout eight or nine months before the first day the terrorists had labeled it in a call to the fbi god said let there be light and genesis said let there be darkness something like that three men were brutally murdered during the sabotage of several substations and another hundred people were estimated to have died as the result of the threeday power outage no demands were made by genesis the second day creation of the sky was marked by an offhours explosion that destroyed a wing of the san diego air and space museum three killedhundreds if the blast were six hours earlier again no demands also no real suspects despite the most intense fbiciaatf investigation since the third day just two months ago represented the creation of dry land and the bringing forth of plants and fruitbearing trees on it the spectacular allglass national horticultural building was leveled by a powerful blast killing twelve and injuring fifty more now more than seven hundred including allaire himself and his wife and daughter had their necks in a noose it was the fourth day without warning the president coughed his chest tightened as panic washed over him he risked a peek at his palms praying that no red blotches or discs would be there is it happening already no his palms were unmarked and unremarkable he let out a relieved sigh which the microphone broadcast to all just a tickle in his throat for now just a tickle a woman seated in the gallery dead center to the president stood up clutching the hand of a boy no more than thirteen years old whom allaire presumed to be her son are we in danger the president inhaled deeply and exhaled slowly i dont have enough information to answer your question at this moment it is possible he went on choosing his words carefully that we might have been exposed to a pathogena virus as a protective measure until i have more information i am asking that everyone stay calm and more importantly that everyone remain seated i will speak more precisely about the situation when i have discussed what we know with my advisors until then as your commander in chief i have ordered the security forces here to use any measures necessary to keep you in the room and in those seats now please be patient i must review these developments with my advisors at that a dozen or so people leapt up and began shouting questions at once it was georgia senator saul kennistone who caught the presidents eye kennistone opened his mouth to yell something at him but a sudden bodyshaking fit of coughing choked back the senators words so it has begun allaire thought his concern must have shown why is he coughing someone shouted is that the virus as if answering the question several people around the chamber joined in the chorus of dry hacking coughs we are investigating allaire said over the noise that is all i can say at the moment now please in addition to my capitol police chief tomlinson agent oneil and vice president tilden the following are to come to the podium immediately for a briefing the president summoned white house chief of staff megan mcandrews department of defense secretary gary salitas health and human services secretary kate broussard homeland security secretary paul rappaport capitol architect jordan lamar and admiral archibald jakes chairman of the joint chiefs of staff dr bethany townsend allaires personal physician and longtime family friend was the last one called forward the room erupted again in an anxious commotion punctuated by continued sporadic coughing those occupying the floor area reserved for officials from the senate house supreme court the presidents cabinet and diplomatic corps obeyed the presidents edict and remained seated those individuals the president had called forward stood and made their way to the rostrum people in the upper gallery sections howeverthose nowunlucky souls who had scored a coveted ticket to the state of the union address as well as members of the press and broadcast network teamswere less compliant not a mass exodus allaire observed but enough people to draw his attention decided to head toward the exits the president watched with irritation and immense sadness as people were forcibly turned back by the guards stationed at all the doors one particularly aggressive man clawing at a uniformed security officer was whipped into submission by the butt of a pistol allaire gripped sean oneil by the shoulder sean please clear the area around us oneil engaged three agents to back people away from the group then he quickly returned to the potuss side weve got to make sure nobody leaves the house chamber allaire said urgently were doing that sir no i mean make absolutely sure sir dammit sean the president quickly composed himself and leaned forward to whisper this virus is viciously contagious if it gets out of here theres no telling what might happen have your people and the other guards immobilize anybody who tries to force their way to the outside use whatever restraints and force are necessary yes sir oneil tall and lean and emotionless in every way except for the alertness in his dark eyes delivered the presidents directive via secure radio allaire returned to the lectern he leaned forward until his lips brushed against the metal mesh of the microphone ladies and gentlemen please settle down please quiet down this instant it took several additional calls for quiet before the room settled into an uneasy silence all eyes were now directed upon him allaire made a furtive glance toward his wife and daughter in seconds the concern etched across their faces forced him to look away i must be very clear he said until we know more about what we may have been exposed to i cannot allow anybody to exit the house chamber i promise to share what information i have as it becomes available for now im requesting your cooperation and what if we dont the unidentified man shouted his thinly veiled threat from somewhere in the upper gallery what weve been exposed to could be highly contagious allaires amplified voice boomed out until we have more information i cannot risk a public health crisis to ensure public safety ive authorized the use of extreme measures against anyone who attempts to exit the building that is a nonnegotiable order from your president now please you must excuse me ill return shortly with additional information and our proposed next steps after i speak with my staff once more the room erupted into chaotic chatter white house chief of staff intense intellectual megan mcandrews was the first to approach mr president she whispered you neglected to include the speaker of the house mcandrews tilted her head in a nearly imperceptible gesture toward ursula ellis in her seat atop the tribune if i didnt call somebody allaire said with an edge either i dont need them or i dont trust them chapter day pm est ursula ellis assumed allaire had included her among the highranking officials he had summoned to meet with him it took some time for her to realize he had not perhaps she had misheard over all the commotion she wonderedeither that or the presidents gunshots had temporarily impaired her hearing vice president henry tilden sat beside ellis on the rostrum he was a tall gangly oaf of a man whom ellis knew would never make anyones list of the most intellectual politicians in the land henry did the president include me she leaned over and asked i dont think so ursula tilden said pushing himself up from his seat and carefully avoiding eye contact but i wasnt listening that closely please excuse me now ive got to go yes of course you go ellis thought go be the good lapdog that you are ellis remained seated in her designated chair looking she sensed regal and composed she had been a fourteenpoint underdog when she won the nomination to oppose allaire a throwaway many political pundits had called her persisting with that notion even when she had shaved a good chunk of that lead away by the time of the election one more month and she would have caught the bastard she had thought over and over again one more month she concentrated on maintaining an appearance of composure people were looking allaire had been an idiot firing that gun the way he did she needed to appear above it many out there had to be aware of the slight the man had just delivered to her she needed the power brokers and the doubters to see a woman impervious to the chaos engulfing thema true leader fearless in the face of impending disaster ellis glanced sideways at allaire the sight of him churned her stomach perhaps now the american people would see past the smoke and mirrors of their socalled leader perhaps they would see that for all his cries for cooperation and unity between the legislative and executive branches when push came to shove the speaker of the house was being left on the outside looking in well fine she thought while he was slinking away to meet with his yesmen she was where it really countedwith the people sooner or later that snub might prove to be allaires undoing those waiting for him to handle whatever was going on had to have seen how his color had gone pale how sweat dripped a rivulet of makeup down his botoxstiffened face how his hands shook the man oozed weakness and uncertainty the moment the election results were in the moment she had conceded ursula ellis had begun thinking about the election four years from then she had checklists in her study of her possible competition within her party and allaires none of them was all that formidable privately her advisors questioned whether this might be the time for her to step back from politics and resign her seat in congress to gather up and reform the scattered pieces of her campaign team but she had the foresight to anticipate a virtual dead heat for control of the house and had chosen to run for reelection to her seat while campaigning against allaire now here she was elected in her district by a landslide and back as speaker she had been guided in her decision to keep her seat by a persistent inner voice telling her the time was not right to pull back that gentle voice which had led her so unerringly in the past made it clear that god had plans for herplans to lead the country she simply had to stay in the limelight allaire surveyed the chosen ones he looked as if he were about to faint this is it ellis thought whatever was happening the president was not equipped to handle it sooner or later he was going to slipto make a profound error in judgment and when he did she would be ready to step forward in truth she felt certain her rival was misreading the situation altogether first though before she could stand in opposition to the actions he intended to take she needed information allaire was the consummate conniver what was he up to this time was this some sort of demonstrationa test like the civil defense interruptions on the radio did he really believe that seven hundred of the most powerful and influential americans were being affected by some virus if there was any truth at all to what he was claiming then people needed medical evaluation and attentionfood and water not threats and isolation but odds favored that the whole thing was some sort of scam allaires leadership skills were fraying hers were sharper than ever if there really was a virus she had the intelligence and charisma to bring the people together it was gods will that she was in this spot at this moment ellis observed that none of the presidents trusted advisors now gathered at the lectern showed any physical effects from whatever had been released by genesis none that was except for the head of the joint chiefs of staff admiral archie jakes who was trying unsuccessfully to suppress his nearconstant coughing where had jakes been sitting when the vapor released it would be interesting to find outpossibly very interesting her body tingled with what she playfully described to her staff as her spidey sense a little surge of neuroelectricity that helped her distinguish information which had value from that which did not her aide leland gladstone was a badger on any task he needed to search out other coughers in the chamber and figure out where they had been sitting during the little explosions childs play for the man who would have been her chief of staff in the white house and who still might have a shot at the position if things went her way ellis then turned her attention to the more pressing matter at hand something tremendous had just occurred inside the house chamberher chamber she might remind allaire election opponents or not the speaker of the house should have been a part of any closeddoor briefing she rose and smoothed out the creases of her formfitting black skirt she was a trim attractive brunette who had once been the homecoming queen at mississippi state careful not to call excess attention to herself she approached the president who had his back turned to her mr president excuse me allaire continued his exchange with gary salitas mr president can you give me some idea whats going on allaire either ignored the question or simply did not hear it over the swirling commotion ellis felt a rush of anger which she quickly parried she was not accustomed to being ignored by anyone the president included allaire continued on as if unaware of her presence now speaking in a hushed voice to his chief secret service agent sean oneil ellis strained to pick up some words but could not mr president would you like me to join the team for the briefing she said louder than before this time allaire turned ursula im glad to see you are you okay yes yes im fine thank you but id like to participate in the briefing mr president that is if you need me no i need your leadership here in the chamber ill keep you informed as things develop which means you wont tell me jack shit ellis thought allaire had turned and resumed his dialogue with oneil ellis stood behind the president burning with hatred you okay gladstone had materialized beside her thin and dark haired with ice blue eyes that at times gave ellis the shivers the man embodied what every congressional leader sought in an aidecharm good looks and a wobbly moral compass ellis led him away from allaire and the others im poed she said finally how should i be gladstone patted his jacket pocket well i assumed you would want the location of the explosions so far ive pinpointed seven of what looks like a total of fifteen or sixteen broken glass containers i should have the rest of them in a little while then assuming you want me to ill start filling in the seats around them absolutely as usual you are well ahead of the game from what i can tell so far theres no pattern theres always a pattern dear leland sometimes not so obvious but theres always a pattern to everything finish filling in that seating chart but keep your twoway radio handy until this situation is resolved and we are all outside waltzing down pennsylvania avenue were going to be mighty busy the speakers aide headed toward the gallery while ellis maintained her position not far from where jim allaire was about to retreat for the meeting with his group of sycophants the discomfort on the mans face was a tonic she started imagining herself sparring with him boxing gloves on bobbing and weaving searching for an opening what she needed most now to inflict some real damage was information and as the president turned to go she realized where she could find it quickly moving to the right side of the group she slid her hand around sean oneils arm and pulled him back toward her i dont have time to talk madam speaker he said the president needs me if i need you sean and i do you will make time for me oneil hesitated and then allowed himself to be led to a spot where they would not be overheard what do you want he asked in a pressured whisper simple i want to know what the president says in that briefing youre going to its classified if youre not there you cant know ellis smiled again and her thin lips disappeared inside her mouth we both know thats a bad strategy sean i am the speaker of the house the american people will expect me to know whats going on allaire is playing politics at a time of national crisis you should take that up with the president then sean turned to leave but ellis caught him by the arm suppose i also take up what you and that darling young white house intern were doing in the lincoln bedroom while the first couple was away on vacation im sure the allaires would love to see the security videosespecially the part where you so skillfully and lovingly snorted some sort of white power from between the sweet things breasts oneil went pale how how did you eyes and ears my love i use my eyes and earsand some wellplaced friends in fact over the years weve been working for the american people ive collected other useful tidbits about you as well the nasty custody battle with your ex over baby duncan for instance how do you think this sort of revelation will help your chances dear sean let alone your career oneil looked away ill get you what i can he muttered youll get me what i want sean is that understood oneil turned without a reply and rushed ahead to catch up with the president ellis watched until the group had disappeared through a guarded exit third the word echoed in her mind she was third in line to govern the most powerful nation on earth and all of a sudden the two above her seemed to be on very shaky ground chapter day pm est allaire led his team past the secret service agents guarding the mahogany double doors located directly to the right of the rostrum the corridor accessible only to members of congress and their staff had reinforced walls that dampened the din from within the house chamber near the end of the passageway the president used a keycard to unlock another wooden door sensors detected movement inside the pitchblack room and turned on several banks of overhead fluorescent lights allaire proceeded to a keypad on the righthand wall punching in his code he waited for the hydraulics to engage in seconds the wall opposite him slid noiselessly downward and disappeared revealing the hard room the array of communication equipmentsatellite phones wallmounted monitors radios printers radar imaging systems and laptop computersgave him a brief flare of confidence that his government possessed the power to prevail against any adversary then he reminded himself that this was no ordinary adversarythis was wrx in the hands of depraved killers and at this moment nothing existed inside this room or any other that could defeat that combination the large conference table in the center of the room would serve as their briefing area two cabinet secretariessalitas and broussardtook their seats along with allaires physician bethany townsend the vice president uniformed admiral archie jakes the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff the head of the capitol police force hank tomlinson architect of the capitol jordan lamar and white house chief of staff megan mcandrews oneil squarejawed and swarthy remained standing against the back wall where is paul rappaport allaire asked paul is at home in minnesota mr president mcandrews said tending to his daughter minnesota allaire groaned he had personally approved the trip yes of course he said sorry for this years state of the union address paul rappaport was the socalled designated survivor no state of the union address inauguration or other momentous occasion occurred without there being a dsreferred to by some as the doomsday successor the ds was the only one of the fifteen cabinet members officially in line to succeed the president who was deliberately not in the vicinity of washington dc he or she was chosen for the job by the military through the president emergency operations center or peocthe same unit with operational control of the hard room given that every member of the cabinet wanted to be near the potus during major events the chosen ds usually at or near the bottom of the chain had no desire to be the one selected paul rappaports appointment however was a logical oneone that the former governor had actually requested not only was the homeland security secretary a logical choice being the most recently established cabinet position but just a week earlier rappaports daughters condo had been broken into and ransacked while she was in the shower stolen were her purse wallet laptop computer ipad cell phone silverware and jewelry even worse the president had been informed her underwear had been removed from her bureau drawer cut up and spread out on her bed the daughter renee had a history of profound anxiety and depression and suffered a breakdown as a result of the invasion she had just been discharged after several days in a psychiatric hospital and was at her parents place allaire imagined that the flamboyant furiously patriotic rappaport protected by a small detachment of secret service agents was with his wife and only child at the moment watching what had been the presidents address and still unaware of how close he suddenly was to history sir i respectfully suggest we get on with this briefing said gary salitas allaires closest friend in washington allaire perked up he had been quiet too long lost in thought as the weight of evolving events descended upon him yes of course gary thank you sean can you give me an update on the mobile device roundup the secret service agent stepped away from his position against the hard room wall agents are collecting them as you ordered mr president its a difficult assignment though as you can well imagine many of those out there arent used to being told what to do i doubt the press people are being forthcoming in handing over all the phones they have we may have to resort to searching them allaire sighed the most probable scenario and an alarming one at that had word already spreading to the outside world via text messages phone calls broadcasts from network and cable television operators mobile units from outside the capitol and transmissions via the internetall reporting something epic happening at the state of the union but nobody knowing exactly what speculation would spread quickly to every country in the world from major cities to any remote village with even the slightest bit of communication technology crisis at the capitol it was likely that cnns producers had already ordered the graphics the best allaire could hope for would be to slow the spread of information and misinformation until he could work out a strategy as to how it should be presented and disseminated and how to prevent the reaction that would ensue from any perceived lack of leadership he looked over at salitas for suggestions we need to think bigger mr president salitas a graying mit grad said we should disrupt all communicationscellular landline internet tv broadcast for say a fivemile radius around the capitol can we do that we can try and still allow me to broadcast to the people with any luck do it salitas crossed to the communications center at the far side of the room and began making calls okay its time allaire said im going to brief you all soon ill share this information with the other victims out there victims hhs secretary kate broussard asked yes kate victims thats what we are now all of us he described the message on the teleprompter assuming the exploding glass containers in those bags and briefcases contained aerosolized wrx we must consider that every single person inside the capitol tonight has been exposed or will soon be exposed to one degree or another what on earth is wrx broussard said its a biological agent weve been tracking for some time now from his position across the room salitass eyes narrowed he gave what allaire took to be a look of warning whose biological agent are we talking al qaeda admiral jakes managed to ask between sudden spasms of coughing no genesis has taken credit for this one its a virus we know about though apparently they stole it why werent we made aware of this before what does it do im sorry archie i chose to keep all information about the virus in house until we knew more of what we had the microbe was ours it was initially developed at columbia university in new york we took it over and were working on it at a level four containment facility in kansas about nine months ago i pulled the plug on the project apparently genesis found a way to steal some well now that its been released how real is the threat to public health broussard asked once again allaire and salitas exchanged minuscule glances this is a flu variant allaire said it um attacks respiratory functions much the same way a flu virus would only more rapidly broussard a phd in immunology frowned so this is like weaponsgrade flu she said thats impossible its not a type a flu virus specifically allaire said assuming broussard would know that type a influenza was the only one of the three classes of the virus that had ever caused a pandemic vice president henry tilden spoke for the first time what can we expect symptoms spread outcome is this like sars tilden a former senator from alabama had come close to defeating allaire in the primaries before his first election and had been appointed as his running mate as a political concession to southern conservatives he was respected for his laconic wit and his cool under fire but like most of the vice presidents before him had all but disappeared from sight during his first term i dont know henry i intend to contact our experts at the centers for disease control hank tomlinson the sturdily built capitol police chief pushed himself to his feet and just how did somebody manage to sneak this virus inside the capitol and detonate fifteen weapons he asked there was only one entrance open and we had our most sophisticated screening equipment in operation in addition we did an inspection of every bag or briefcase well hank allaire said as head of the security unit here thats something i expect you to figure out yes sir tomlinson muttered he took his seat and kept his eyes fixed on his hands weve got to tackle this like any crisis situation allaire said and that means first things first i promise you we will overcome this challenge and well do it together what do you need us to do jim tilden asked while were in this waiting game for data about the virus we need to focus our efforts on two fronts people and communication the perception that the entire us government is in imminent danger will send the global economy into a tailspin we need to minimize that as much as possible what do you suggest craft a message henry you can use my speechwriters if you need them let the world know that were going to be okay but until were absolutely sure there is no immediate public danger of the virus spreading were going to err on the side of caution you can say there was an exposure to a highly contagious pathogen but our microbiologists are hard at work identifying it and breaking it down let the people know that were going to be okay but we need time to complete our thorough assessment got it tilden said seeming actually buoyed to have been given the responsibility allaire watched as the man furiously wrote down notes work with megan on this henry let me read what you have when youre ready well use connie lawson from nbc to break the story shes got the right demeanor to keep facts ahead of emotions admiral jakes raised his hand mr president i will mobilize he stopped to coughdeep and wet mobilize the military allaire finished for him jakes in his midsixties looked gray and almost glassyeyed broussard and mcandrew seated on either side subconsciously slid their chairs away an inch or two and glanced over at him with mixtures of apprehension and revulsion allaire nodded at salitas who ended a phone call and brought the admiral a cup of water i want to divide everybody out there into three groups each group will be relocated to a different room within the capitol complex to facilitate resource distribution admiral i would like you to be the leader for the c group youll mobilize in the senate chamber and set up operations there assign the other chiefs to help with each group and also the capitol police who will be in my group jakes asked gary and i will personally oversee the group designations well need a little time to complete the list uneasy looks were exchanged allaire sensed the team thought his chosen task was unbefitting a president in the midst of a crisis situation but they could not know that at the moment the assignment he had given to himself and salitas was the most important of all what should we do in the interim the admiral managed he coughed again a sheen of perspiration had materialized across his forehead make a list of supplies you think you will need allaire went on kate id like you to lead group b and henry will take the a group a group can stay in the house chamber and well move people assigned to group b into statuary hall confer among yourselves as to what you think well need for a twentyfour to fortyeighthour stay enlist help from the rest of the cabinet and anyone else you wish megan will act as my liaison ill leave it up to you to work out bathroom usage but its important that we dont mix the groups as we move people around why is that broussard asked for inventory control kate well manage our supplies by group size and we dont want people thinking they can freely migrate between them the health and human services secretary did not look as if she were buying allaires plan any more than his explanation of what they were up against yes jim she said through nearly closed lips sean oneil was instructed to mobilize the secret service agents to maintain security report back to me as you make progress megan please make an announcement that in twenty minutes ill address the house chamber at that time ill give an update on our status and share our plans to take care of everyone while were sorting things out the white house chief of staff nodded jordan and hank stay here for a few minutes you too doc the rest of you have your assignments stay calm delegate to others and remain in control of the situation you are the leaders here i expect you to lead good luck with the press of a button the hydraulics concealing the hard room kicked in and opened the wall gary salitas remained behind as well though he had not been asked the room emptied out and the hydraulic doors closed those asked to remain took their seats again the president sighed then inhaled deeply and exhaled slowly well my friends he began i need to start by saying that what i just shared in this room is not exactly the truth chapter day pm est angela fletcher had ridden only half of her daily ten miles on the stationary bike when the highdef broadcast of the state of the union address on her new sony went dark using the remote she switched channels on her cable box but got the same black screen on all the networks other channels those not broadcasting the presidents address seemed to be working perfectly the major networks however cnn msnbc fox news included were all broadcasting the same thing which was nothing at all from her perch atop the bike surrounded by a mélange of houseplants every one of which she could name angie turned her set off then on again and did the same with the cable box in that time the stations managed to display their version of a technical difficulty announcement letting viewers know they were working on the problem angie hopped off the bike and crossed her airy living room to the kitchen where she grabbed a bottle of vitaminenhanced flavored water from the fridge at thirtyeight despite her disciplined vegetarian lifestyle and deep knowledge of herbs and nutrition she knew her metabolism had begun to slow the changes in her hips told her so every day even though it was likely that she was the only one aware of them the bike and a set of weights were her way of battling back best of all for someone who struggled to sit through most movies plays and concerts the equipment allowed her to multitask to her hearts content email and riding cnn and lifting reading and pedaling unless she were asleep at the most five hours a night she always seemed to be doing something and something else at the same time that trait had been a constant source of dismay and even annoyance to her boyfriend bill collins but had been were the operative words now that collins was a thing of her past on her way back into the living room angie grabbed her blackberry to check email nothing about the loss of signal had arrived in her inbox just the usual digital mountain of pr pitches from some of the brightest minds in science they all wanted the same thinga story in her paper the washington post and more important for the papers respected science reporter angie fletcher to cover whatever latest breakthrough or discovery they felt needed covering angie tried the television again nothing new she had voted for allaire as had most of her friends and like them she had been looking forward to tonights speech she loved that his background was at least as much about medicine and science as it was about politics in addition his oratory skills could make a laundry list sound important so angie felt more than a little disappointed to be missing any part of the first state of the union message of his second term figuring that webcasts might be working she used her blackberry and tried cnncom and then her own papers web site both ran virtually identical headlines in bold lettering broadcast interruption at state of the union address utterly curious now angie checked but could not find any links to a more detailed explanation it had been six months or so since she had moved from georgetown to the refurbished brownstone in the highly desirable dupont circle area of dc her neighbor in b the unit directly below her onebedroom condo worked at the white house and angie considered asking if he had heard anything unusual going on at the capitol instead she decided to towel off and cab it she darted into the kitchen still clutching her blackberry then suddenly paused to grab a spray bottle from the counter to spritz her herb garden which seemed nearly ready to harvest at least the mint anyway the queen of add collins had called her more than once so what she thought racing into the bedroom to throw on a pair of slacks and a bulky fishermans sweater she hurried back into the living room and over to horace on whom she kept her coat hat and gloves the movers had said nothing about hauling an adult human skeleton but she did notice them exchanging uneasy glances when they unpacked him over the months she had dated collins a lobbyist for the insurance industry he continually found it odd that she had a skeleton in her living room and that her cluttered bedroom looked like a college dorm but she assured him that horace had everything to do with an innate curiosity for all things biological and not some goth fetish he needed to fear and that her bedroom was always impeccably neatjust not when he happened to be there collinss lack of appreciation for horace should have been a sign right from the start but he was urbane witty and handsome as hellclearly in the top ten of dc eligibles as her girlfriends had ranked him that was undoubtedly why she had hung on as long as she did although ultimately it was he who had decided they should see other people as tired as angie was of dating and as anxious as she was to connect with a mate for life and as aware as she was of the statistics on maternal age and fertility the breakup was a twoton weight off of her back she slipped her toasty peacoat off of horaces shoulders and grabbed the red wool cap from the top of his stand there was something going on at the capitol complex she could feel it her instinct for news was what made her one of the most soughtafter reporters at the post she understood that any story breaking on capitol hill would be covered by the political and national teams and would probably have nothing to do with her expertise in science and technology but the thought of missing out on an event unfolding in her own backyard was unacceptable and the sudden specific universal loss of signal from the state of the union screamed event having decided to spring for a cab she was searching for her purse underneath the piles of stuff on her kitchen chairs when her phone rang she frowned at the name on her caller id before she met bill it had been john davis chief of staff to one of the more powerful congressmen on the hill davis had pursued angie with such intensity that it made her at first uninterested and soon uneasy he had not called since her last plea just a few months ago that as nice as he was it simply wasnt going to happen between themespecially since she was dating someone else she let his call go to voicemail then he called again strange even for someone as persistent as john she thought he had to know she was watching the presidents speech in fact unless he had been fired he had to be at the presidents speech perhaps he had lost the signal and did not get put through to voicemail when he called for a third time she answered john angie thank god youre there davis said in a coarse whisper i didnt know who else to call it sounded as though he were afraid somebody might overhear john whats going on im on my way to the capitol right now to see why all the broadcasts have gone dead she located her purse grabbed the brush on the chair beside it and pulled it twice through her shoulderlength hairreddish brown that day and most of the time then she gathered it back in a ponytail and secured it with a scrunchie flashing for a pleasurable moment on how annoyed collins was when she wore it that way i dont think youll get within five hundred yards of this place davis was saying but i need your help i think i may have been exposed to something we all have we all what are you talking about im at the capitol and im talking about everybody at the state of the union address having been exposed to something biological a virus allaire said oh my god the news sent angies heart racing are you all right for now maybe but ive started coughing and im really freaking out we all are hang on a second she pulled on her peacoat and hat and grabbed one of the ubiquitous spiralbound notebooks that dotted the landscape of her life you still there davis asked im here im here now try to calm down and tell me whats going on i dont know it was some sort of biological weapon or something weve been told allaire said genesis has something to do with it damn john i can barely hear you can you speak up i cant i dont want to be spotted the secret service and capitol police are confiscating all our cell phones im guessing allaire doesnt want to start a panic is that why the broadcast went dark i didnt know it had with her phone tucked beneath her ear angie rubbed on some chapstick scribbled some notes in a shorthand only she could decipher and turned the television back on cnn was reporting only that something had occurred inside the house chamber and they were working hard to get more information someones grainy shaky cell phone transmission filled the screen angie heard sirens blaring in the background and watched with widening eyes as the commotion unfolding within the cameras view intensified she remembered having the same sickening feeling when the first reports of the attacks began trickling in something truly horrible was taking place now as it did back then where are you exactly john she asked what sort of attack was it is anybody hurt when did it happen slow down angie slow down are you sure it was genesis angie im afraid im going to die im afraid were all going to die angies heart beat faster i want to help you john just try and help me help you o okay how did the attack occur how was the virus delivered did you see it davis coughed angie shivered at the sound was that a symptom of the infection i saw it there were like misty plumes of smoke coming out of peoples bags and briefcases and purses from some sort of microbomb it sounded like massachusetts congresswoman dawn bloom two rows in front of me had one go off right beside her angie stuffed her gloves inside her laptop case and dropped in the chapstick half a dozen pens and another notebook whats happening now davis partially stifled another cough the president has ordered everybody back to their original seats hes blocked the doors with armed guards angie im really scared you know more about bioweapons than anybody i know what the hell could it be oh shit i think theyve spotted my phone im going to keep talking as long as i can john ill do whatever i can to find out and help davis coughed againdeep moist and racking john are you okay talk to me theyre here for my phone listen you bastards this is america we have laws you cant do this the line went dead chapter day pm est the small group remaining in the hard room exchanged surprised looks except for gary salitas whose attention remained fixed on allaire the friendship between the two men dated back nearly twentyfive years to the meeting of a select presidential commission on drug abuse in the inner city the meeting one of a number of such showcases to which salitas had been invited over the years was also among the more frustrating with each of the political and academic lights determined to impress or outdo the others in terms of their rhetoric and posture just when salitas had been wondering if he could endure the rest of the afternoon a lean angular man stood up without asking to be recognized and began to speak his name plaque read james allaire md cleveland ohio and he was angry he was angry that people were speaking of latin american cartels and minimum prison terms of deposing dictators and passing stiffer new laws of more presidential select commissions but not once had anyone mentioned the abject hopelessness of innercity children not once had anyone suggested a connection between drug use and classroom size not once had anyone offered the blueprint for a partnership between business industry and programs designed to provide every one of those children with a computer allaire spoke for less than five minutes that day but his eloquence conviction and the power of his words were unforgettable and by the time the physician from ohio had finished his remarks gathered his notes and strode from the room gary salitas had vowed to hitch his wagon to the mans star to this day not once had salitas regretted that decision i will explain as much as i can in a moment the president began first though i want to be certain you know jordan lamar he nodded toward the stocky babyfaced man several seats to salitass right jordans official title is architect of the capitol jordan this is my personal physician dr bethany townsend head of the white house medical unit weve met lamar said shaking townsends hand and making certain that she knew the fifth member of the group hank tomlinson the chief of the fifteenhundredmember capitol police force okay then allaire said between the two of them these men know every detail of the capitol complex from the surrounding topology to the nature and location of the facilities passageways and points of entry and egress as of this moment i am ordering a joint operation to be conducted between the capitol police board represented by jordan and hank and the military coordinated by secretary salitas it will be known as operation guardian eagle and its goal will be the neutralization of what genesis has done here tonight and what does that have to do with the military tomlinson asked the remaining joint chiefs of staff will assist us with guardian eagle but they will be strictly on a need to know basis and my orders will be transmitted to them through secretary salitas as of now the only people to be made fully aware of guardian eagle are seated right here in this room is that understood good gary im authorizing you to deputize any military national guard or other federal law enforcement officials you deem necessary fbi nsa ciayou have all of our personnel and resources at your disposal yes sir salitas said i want a secure perimeter established around the entire capitol complex station sharpshooters and flamethrowers facing every exit jordan will make sure you dont miss any use barricades to establish a secondary perimeter to keep the public back use force if need be to accomplish that understood the president turned away momentarily gathering his composure when he turned back his jaw was set his lips bloodless one more thing he said anybody who leaves this building and i mean anybody including every one of us is to be given one verbal warning and only one to go back inside then they are to be shot dead on the spot and their body immediately incinerated and disposed of as biohazard chapter day pm est shoot to kill incinerate the bodies allaire understood as did the others in the hard room that the president of the united states had just used his power as commander in chief to authorize the coldblooded murder of civilians disbelieving stares penetrated his defenses and for a moment he sensed he might be close to breaking down he flashed on a photograph of john kennedy during the cuban missile crisis from the many accounts he had read it seemed that the young president handled the defining event of his administration with a steely outward resolve judge prime minister nikita khrushchev correctly and save the planet misjudge the man and millions get consumed in a nuclear firestorm but this crisis wasnt about missiles this was about wrx and although president jim allaires decision to quarantine the capitol had the potential to save millions from a raging pandemic in all likelihood he and his family werent going to be among them if only he had quashed the idea at the very beginning if only he had simply listened to dr sylvia chens proposal and sent her away allaire hoped that he looked like a man of strength and assuredness if he lost control and the crowd in the house chamber started to surge toward the exits there was no telling what the virus floating in the air and taking root in their bodies would do in the outside world he could not allow that to happen he had to select words that would keep the crowd at bay he had to choose how much information to share and just how to say it but at the same time he had to trust someone kennedy had his brother robert members of the national security council and the joint chiefs of staff jim allaire had the people in this room the presidents physician an architect the head of the capitol police force and gary salitas who along with the president was the only one who knew the whole truth some of allaires newly formed inner circle still looked stunned at his order for an instant kill if they possessed full knowledge of the peril presented by the rogue virus and they were about to allaire had the utmost confidence that each of them would take exactly the same course that logic however offered only cold comfort hank im giving the capitol police full operational authority over our outer perimeter this place has got to be sealed and sealed tightly the virus were dealing with is highly contagious and infectious theres no telling what the consequences would be if it got loose tomlinson nodded as did jordan lamar with all due respect mr president tomlinson said you havent given us much information on whats really happening here ill do whatever is necessary to protect and serve our country but sir please we cant fight what we dont understand yes of course hank allaire again paused to solidify his composure what i am about to share with you goes beyond any security clearance for topsecret information im trusting you to keep this confidential to do otherwise could result in a panic with the potential for an incalculable loss of life can i trust you on this do i have each of your words the group exchanged looks in a silent poll you have our word sir tomlinson said allaire nodded for the first time since the previous group was assigned tasks and sent from the hard room the president directly addressed his personal physician dr bethany townsend dr townsend do you recall the kalvesta files bethany townsend petite with a pretty smile and weathered face creased her brow in thought yes of course she said that goes back almost two years you asked me to review the pathologists report it was a family of five if i recall no six a husband wife and their four children all of whom expired at some point in their sleep carbon monoxide had been quickly ruled out as a possible cause correct they lived in a house that we supplied for them in kalvesta kansas the husband army lieutenant colonel jeremy jackson worked at a topsecret level four biocontainment facility in kalvesta none of the joint chiefs of staff out there is aware of the existence of such a facility gary the defense secretary took up the narrative there was limited and tightly controlled operational knowledge of our efforts in kalvesta lieutenant colonel jacksons wife believed her husband held a position with the kansas department of wildlife and parks in reality he was part of a team developing a new biological agent for the united states government because of the military implications of our work i was the only cabinet member fully informed of kalvesta go on gary if word of this research got out prematurely we would have had a public relations nightmare on our hands the biological agent we were developing had that much implication for our national security and just what agent was that townsend asked her expression suggesting she had just come upon the answer to her own question wrx the president replied chapter day pm est dr bethany townsends expression was equal parts disbelief and fear are you implying that what killed the jackson family is the same biological agent that weve all been exposed to unfortunately that is exactly what im saying allaire replied both you and the pathologist failed to pinpoint the cause of death because we intentionally kept you unaware of project veritas but we did learn a great deal from your findings about how wrx attacks the body excuse me sir but veritas townsend asked veritas for truth even vice president tilden did not know about it although i was going to tell him at the time i decided to pull the plug on the project but by then after funding was stopped and the whole project was shutting down there seemed no need to tell anyone a little too late for the jackson family townsend said allaire bowed his head salitas sensing the president needed time to gather his thoughts spoke up the people at veritas conducted a close inspection of jacksons biocontainment suit and found a tiny opening by the wrist probably from bumping against a syringe or scalpel salitas said at the time dr chens team was working with a new strain of the virus trying to increase its potency and effectiveness that pinholesized leak in jacksons suit turned him into a carrier he went home feeling fine and spent the night with his family he infected all of them without his knowing he was a walking hot zone jesus hank tomlinson murmured the veritas team immediately destroyed the viral line and resumed work on an earlier strain they augmented it and controlled how fast it acted when administered but they never perfected it then the president shut down the program what happened to the jacksons tomlinson asked allaire looked at salitas through reddening eyes the defense secretary walked to the water cooler and returned with water for both of them allaire drank his cup dry in a single swallow then was able to continue they were tightly quarantined and treated as best our doctor knew how with massive doses of iv antiviral drugs but nothing worked they died in just a few days my god and that virus is what we have been exposed to that or a variant yes we were all devastated by what happened to the jackson family but we had to weigh that tragedy against the possibility of ending the war on terror ending the war on terror mr president just what does this virus do the police chief asked the target organs of the germ are a group of structures in the midbrain including the hypothalamus the anterior cingulate cortex the amygdala and the limbic system these structures in the gray matter of the brain influence many functions but taken as a whole they control the willthe ability to make voluntary decisions the uniquely human ability to lie when the microbe was first brought to my attention by dr chen a professor at columbia her animal studies had shown that cats infected with the virus would swim without resisting hardcore carnivores could be trained to eat a mix of vegetables and vitamins mortal enemies could quickly be taught to live in the same cage so since when did we get into the development of biological weapons since terrorists flew airplanes into the world trade center buildings gary salitas said returning to the table thats when and i wouldnt call wrx a weapon this country is pockmarked with cells of enemy combatants who dont feel much like sharing their plans with us and youre suggesting this virus will make them that was the idea allaire said with the liberal press holding a constant magnifier on our techniques of interrogation we have a very limited toolkit when it comes to extracting information from these individuals we were developing and testing the virus in hopes of making them share what they knew without resorting to more stringent measures or having to move ahead based on their version of the truth and for a time it looked as if veritas was going to be a success but even with the new strain there were still side effects salitas added what sort of side effects are we talking about here mr president bethany townsend asked her tone cool i had been assured by dr chen that the results from the new variant strain were most encouraging allaire said but as i read through her reports it became increasingly clear that the germ still had some serious problems it was unstable in terms of mutation and there had been no progress made in controlling how it spread from host to host in fact the data suggested that the highly contagious nature of the virus had gotten worse so thats when you shut down the program tomlinson asked in retrospect i wish that were the case hank even with the setbacks we still believed we had a silver bullet with wrx i kept vertias operational until the theft theft yes nine months ago a presumed terrorist working in the lab stole five canisters of the virus at least thats how many we recovered from a compartment in the wall of his basement when we arrested him shortly after that i finally ordered the project shut down did we have test animals at this veritas lab townsend asked yes mostly primates those were the research animals of choice for dr chen but she brought another virologist to kansas with hera scientist who was staunchly against animal testing and experimentation his approach involved the use of advanced computer models of the virus and various treatments he claimed his methods were capable of simulating with near ninetynine percent accuracy the nature of the viruss mutation patterns as well as the effect of different antiviral drugs ninetynine percent sounds a bit optimistic townsend said especially given that his methods didnt seem to work any better than chens so what are we all in for here ill debrief you all about our exposure and what we can expect in a moment allaire said but i can tell you that as far as contagion goes the penetration statistics are daunting bethany i know youre angry but i really need you if you can im putting you in charge of organizing our containment strategy veritas was headquartered in an underground facility the lab had levelfour containment and aside from the insider theft i told you about there were never any incidents gary will get you the contact information for the former director meanwhile get in touch with the cdc and anyone else you need and have them help you try to maintain some control over who you tell what to were going to need a whole bunch of containment suits and a safe way of getting food medication and personnel in here for half a minute townsend simply sat there then with painful slowness she stood and crossed to the communications center as you wish sir she said as for the rest of you allaire went on i need you to be patient be as calm as possible ive trusted you with this information because i think you can handle it and because i need your help we cant risk starting a mass panic our hope now is that we develop a way to neutralize the virus and contain it inside the capitol all our energy and focus must be directed toward those efforts and most importantly i need you to support me and my decisions one hundred percent allaire turned to architect jordan lamar all hell is about to break loose jordan this building is going to be our home for a while im counting on you to make it as comfortable for everyone as possible even though its the middle of winter im worried that with seven hundred of us the rooms are going to warm up fast from body heat so we might need to boost the airconditioning levels yes mr president gary i need you to help me make two calls yes mr president first get me paul rappaport in minnesota no problem and the other i need the warden at the supermaximum federal penitentiary in florence colorado chapter day am cst the guards riot stick slamming against his cell door intruded into griffin rhodess nightmare but failed to drive it completely away the recurring dream was especially vivid this time intense sounds and colors and pain like daggers thrusting through his eyes the dreadful ache was in his abdomen tooa powerful cramping as if his intestines were strangulating griff felt his bowels let go and knew the gush beneath him was blood marburg virus i have marburg virus let me die please just let me die he tried to cry out the words but there was no soundonly the terrible cramping griff pounded impotently on the wall by his head dr rhodes can you hear me dr rhodes the voice in the dream was a womansa kenyan physician named marielledr marielle she had been incredibly kind to him how long had it been how many days how many weeks more of the slamming against the steel cell door it was one of the guards favorite ways of tormenting him he was standing in front of his bathroom mirror now supporting himself on the edge of his rusted sink staring at the expanding bruises on his face and at his eyes it was marburg his horribly bloodred sclerae told him so he had feared becoming infected from the day his fascination with deadly viruses began now it was happening marburgmost likely the ebola variant hemorrhagic fever sweats unimaginable muscle aches blood spewing from the nose and gi tract blood in the tendons and the skin blood on the brain eighty percent death rate blood for years he had been fearing this encounter waiting for this attack or something like it for years he had anticipated the moment when his precautions would not be enough when living on the edge would prove disastrouswhen he would go from being the hunter to being the victim finally because of a stupid miscalculation outside of a jungle cave not far from kisimu on the eastern rim of lake victoria he was going to die and die viciously the best he could hope for before he was gone was to have the cave sealed and to have level precautions instituted at all the surrounding hospitals provided he survived long enough to do so the devastating cramps intensified now he was on his hands and knees in a field blood was pouring in two steady streams from his nostrils falling to the parched ground in thick angry drops in the distance he could see the outline of his lab a sprawling cinderblock monolith cutting a broad rectangular chunk from the azure african sky overhead airplanesized vultures circled one of them glided to the ground landing awkwardly and waddling across toward him intent on pecking at his flesh not yet dammit not yet once again his eyes began to throb griff had always wondered what ebola infection would feel like now he knew his imagination had hardly done the virus justice praying for death was about the best he could do dr rhodes dr rhodes can you hear me it is dr marielle i swear he opened his eyes did you see that the clanging on his steel door resumed echoing through the cinderblock hell of his solitary confinement cell which was worse the nightmare or his reality the vulture was joined by another then anotherhuge black shadows with fiery eyes drifting down to gnaw on him each bite brought painpain and more blood griff thrashed on his cot and tried to bat them away help help me the vultures were unrelenting now tearing away huge chunks of his flesh challenging him to wake up facedown on the bloodsoaked ground griff continued flailing at the mammoth birds the sudden clang of his cell door finally caused the nightmare to loosen its grip reluctantly the lurid images receded rhodes rhodes hey asshole wake up donald spinelli the huge heavylidded guard stood across the room by the naked toilet bowl impatiently smacking his riot stick against his own thigh griff rubbed his eyes turned away from the unadorned cinderblock wall and peered briefly across at the man then he rolled back onto his side again facing the wall utterly drained the nightmares arising from his battle against ebola werent an every night thing but even after a decade they still occurred frequently enough and as vivid and inexorable as ever the guard moved to the side of griffs institutional cot and slapped him with force on the bare sole of his foot unwilling to give the brute the satisfaction of hearing him cry out griff clenched his teeth against the stinging and gripped his heavy beard he had practice dealing with pain it would take more than a smack on the foot to get a reaction from him much more over the nearly nine months he had been in solitary confinement all of the prison guards had been abusive to one extent or another but spinelli had been the worst if physically possible there was no way he would give the sadist any satisfaction still it wasnt worth provoking him what do you want spinelli put on your sunday best rhodes youre leaving what just what i said youre out of here nine months in this cell with an hour a day walking in the yard alone and all of a sudden just like that im out of here this your idea of funny i wish its real straight from the warden whats going on i got no idea when you get out there he motioned to the small barred window overlooking the exercise yard why dont you ask the guys in that chopper chapter day am est senator harlan mackey had seen enough fear and chaos were erupting around him like mount vesuvius people rushing for the exits were being forcibly turned back and exactly where was americas leader now gone vanished into a back room with his disgracefully inept cabinet looking like the reincarnation of boss tweed the kentucky senator and majority whip would not tolerate hiliards gross mishandling of this situation one second longer mackeys wellknown mottono way no howapplied to this crisis the same as it did to any legislation he worked to defeat and how dare allaire violate the sanctity of the house chamberfiring off a gun as though he were wyatt earp taking over some lawless western town people were ill and from what mackey could tell they were only getting sicker they did not need jim allaire they needed medical care at least mackey could feel grateful that his sons math teacher had refused to reschedule an exam because of the mans inflexibility jack and his mother had passed up their pilgrimage to dc for the state of the union address lucky them many people had begun grudgingly to return to their seats although a number of others were still milling around the aisles and shoving toward the doorways demanding with escalating vehemence to be let out mackey wondered how long it would be before somebody got hurtreally hurtby one of allaires capitol police goons and what exactly had they been exposed to was genesis really responsible did they really pose a threat worthy of allaire holding the congress and so many others hostage if so why didnt they just quarantine the coughing people and let everybody else go the closest puff of smoke was many rows away from where he was sitting and mackey had yet to feel any symptom at all god knew at least a third of the chamber had that hacking cough now if mackey were in charge thats exactly what he would have done keep the sick away from the healthy goddamn allaire did the man think they were all stupid of course he did allaires arrogance defied all boundaries well if he thought harlan mackey would be a good little solider and sit tight inside a potential death trap then he grossly underestimated this senators resolve people continued to mill around mackey who decided then and there that he would escape this nightmare senator mackey senator mackey people continuing to converge into the center aisle yelling at the security guards coughing and crying made it hard for mackey to spot frost keaton a junior staff assistant from his office waving his arms and calling his name poor frost for his exemplary job performance mackey had awarded keaton jacks much soughtafter sou ticket keaton pushed his way through the crowd and typically seemed more concerned for his boss than he did for himself dumb kid whats going on senator keaton asked is it true that genesis is behind this i dont know son like you im waiting for the president to return im sure well all know something soon enough well i had some new ideas for our highway bill i guess ill just work on those while were waiting mackey felt a brief pang for the twentytwoyearold american university grad and his endless supply of optimistic energy are you worried keaton said me no son it takes a lot more than all this to worry this old farmer mackey flashed on the idea of taking keaton with him but just then the boy coughed are there more people coughing now the senator wondered if so he would have to move even faster look son you stay here im going to see if i can learn whats going on ill let you know what i find out for now just sit tight and wait for me to come back the young aide stifled another cough thank you sir he managed mackey served as one of ten on the capitol complex appropriations board the committee handled everything from human resources for the capitols extensive operational staff to routine maintenance issues few knew all the secrets of the capitol complex thanks to that committee mackey knew nearly every one of them every way in and most important every way out at least now those insipid hours spent haggling on that wart of a committee might prove to be worthwhile the speaker of the house ursula ellis had left her seat and was making her way around their partys half of the hall she was an incredibly capable woman and given another month or so she just might have won now hopefully she was mobilizing people to take a stand against allaire regardless of what position he took nobody was standing near the podium and the crush of people was moving in the opposite direction perfect mackey walked past the rostrum to a spot in the corridor twenty feet beyond the trapdoor beneath the carpeting was nearly invisible it had been constructed to reach a maintenance area on the next level down which housed the workings of the lift that provided wheelchair access to the tribune nobody noticed as the senator quickly descended the stairs and closed the door behind him the darkness surrounding him was nearly total he found the wall switch and located a dank sevenfoothigh tunnel dimly lit by a series of unadorned wallmounted fixtures running in an eastwest direction from the base of the lift mackey followed it to where he knew it would split into two passageways the longer of the two tunnels tiled better lit and cleaner would after some distance connect with a flight of stairs to a hallway linking the rayburn house building to the capitol a solid wooden door opened only from that side mackey suspected that the rayburn tunnel would be guarded at its entrance as many in congress used it to bypass the security lines in the visitors center instead his plan took him into the darker tunnel on the left moving slowly after five minutes he came to the door of an unmarked exit which he knew was only a hundred yards or so from the capitols first street entrance the architect of the capitol jordan lamar had at one point requested funds to upgrade the tunnel and the door but mackeys committee had tabled the petition and never gotten back to it cautiously the senior senator from kentucky pushed the door open the night was cloudless the air was cold but manageable even without an overcoat he would hurry up delaware for a block or two and take a cab to his condo in georgetown there he would pour a tumbler of jim beam and watch allaire embarrass himself in highdefinition he allowed the door to ease closed the hardware echoed in the still air as it locked he hesitated then took two tentative steps across the shadowed alcove nothing had he turned and looked upward at the window one floor above running along the rayburn hallway he would have seen a shadow silhouetted against the darkness but his concentration was fixed ahead another two steps still good suddenly from somewhere across constitution avenue a powerful spotlight hit him squarely in the face turn back and reenter the capitol at once an amplified voice called out we will not ask a second time squinting against the intense glare mackey reached behind him but he knew the heavy door was locked he turned back and took a single step toward the light his hands raised to shield his eyes wait he cried out wait its me senator harlan mackay from ken at that instant he was punched in the center of his foreheador at least that was what it felt like for a split second during the rest of the second the punch became a searing pain from somewhere out in the night he heard the crack of a gunshot at nearly the same instant he flew backward his head snapping into the metal door he was neurologically dead by the time his knees buckled although his heart was still beating as he slumped to the frigid pavement by the time an approaching team of three soldiers stopped thirty yards away senator harlan mackey was dead by virtually every criterion one of the soldiers aimed the nozzle of his ma portable flamethrower i know were not supposed to question orders he said to the sharpshooter next to him but i sure hope those guys have a damn good reason for what theyre doing without waiting for a response he adjusted his goggles and hit the trigger a prolonged brilliant spear of burning napalm sliced through the night into the inert body of the man they had just killed the corpses clothes vanished immediately and the skin beneath them boiled and bubbled and then charred the stench of burning flesh mixed with the powerful odor of the napalm for five seconds ten fifteen the stream of incendiary remained fixed on the blackening body the corpse of their victim was now ash wearing a gas mask the third soldier approached the smoldering mound and waited for it to cool enough then using a tapered shovel and a metal broom he swept up the senators remains and dropped them into a biocontainment canister another team would arrive shortly to complete the disposal without looking back the three men retreated and resumed their positions in less than three minutes the containment vehicle had come and gone and all was as it had been ursula elliss aide leland gladstone was no longer able to hold back the bile he whirled to one side dropped to his hands and knees and vomited onto the cement floor he was a suburban prepschooler with a degree from yale and had never even seen a dead person let alone watched one be murdered in such a gruesome manner ursula had known something big was about to happen she had noticed harlan mackey vanish behind the speakers podium do you still have your blackberry dear leland or did allaires robots take it from you ellis had asked i still have it gladstone patted his back where he had concealed the device underneath his white dress shirt and secured it in place using his belt can it record video it can better than most camcorders too follow mackey see where he goes i dont know what allaire meant by extreme measures and oneil didnt come back with anything useful all oneil told me is that russians or chinese may be behind the attack and that theyre preparing us for an extended stay supposedly whatever weve been exposed to is some type of flu virus not that lethal but presumably very contagious that sounds like useful information gladstone had said perhaps but oneil wasnt the last to leave the debrief and my instincts tell me theres more allaires hiding than hes sharing gladstone who knew the myriad tunnels of the capitol nearly as well as did ellis chose to follow the passageway one story above the one mackey had taken there was only one place the senator could be going camera poised gladstone knelt by the sill of the window and watched the heavy metal door swing open beneath him the wellknown distinguished mans death incineration and removal had happened so quickly and with such organization that the events had barely registered in gladstones mind while he was recording them now the aide stumbled back from the mess he had made and used the wall to push himself upward the military had murdered harlan mackey almost certainly on orders from the president gladstone wondered if ellis had known her colleague and loyal campaign supporter was in peril did she sacrifice him to satisfy her own curiosity about allaires true intentions he wondered regardless gladstones video was all the motivation hed ever need to maintain his devoted support of ellis and the speaker of the house would certainly know what to do with this new information and the video chapter day am cst move it rhodes as griff stepped onto the packed dirt of the florence federal prison exercise yard guard donald spinelli forced him forward using the butt of his nightstick and a single wellplaced jab against his lower spine griff stumbled but fierce winds from the whirling blades helped to keep him from going down dust shooting into his eyes stung like sandpaper in the months since griff had last worn his favorite pair of blue jeans they had gone from comfortably snug to barely staying over his hips the rotordriven winds plastered his plaid flannel cowboy shirt against his once wiry now nearskeletal frame the twinengine helicopter lifted off the yard touched down again momentarily it was clear to griff the pilot was in a rush and not about to stop the rotors during his virushunting days he had chartered helicopters from time to time back in africa but those were ragged machines better equipped for falling than flying this aircraft though reminded him of images he had seen of marine one with its dark green body and white top american flags emblazoned on the engine casings united states marine corps was painted in white on the choppers tail griffs gut had knotted as soon as he realized his removal from the socalled alcatraz of the rockies might be a military action it had been just over nine months since he had last been the focus of another military operationhis final moments of freedom until now so many changes his beard a tangled mess of black streaked with gray immediately collected a fine coating of prison yard dust he wondered if in addition to his dark memories of nine months in solitary confinement that dirt would be all he would ever take away from florence it had to be no matter what lay ahead he wasnt going back nine months chopped out of a life that had been built around doing the right thing and accepting the consequences for his decisions such as the ebola infection nine months during which there had been no human contact other than with guards bent on causing him pain nine months of confusion about why he had been imprisoned or what future if any he had in store nine months during which the only clue he had in that regard was the label terrorist griff had barely stepped inside the helicopter bay door when he felt the aircraft begin to lift a soldier dressed in wellpressed military camouflage handed him a jetblack flight helmet then guided him into an unpadded seat griff strapped himself in and took one last look out the helicopters oval window at florence shuddering at the gun towers and concrete block framed with barbwire now fast fading from view he wondered if anyone watching from inside except for the warden and a few guards even knew his name terrorist the builtin radio inside his helmet allowed griff to hear the soldier seated across from him over the engines roar dr griffin rhodes my name is captain timothy lewis with the united states marine corps by order of the president of the united states of america it is my honor to welcome you aboard this vhn aircraft tell the president that nothing he does is going to get me to change my vote the marine smiled i think youll get the chance to do that yourself sir actually now that i think about it i never got the chance to vote at all in fact i dont even know who won the election im sorry sir it was president allaire he won again by quite a wide margin too allaire griff stared out at the blackness of all the theater of the absurd scenarios he had lived through this military removal from solitary confinement in a supermax federal prison had to be the most bizarre but now learning he was up here at the behest of the president topped them all thanks for the info he said any idea why hes sent for me sir the president will be radioing in at oh two hundred hours eastern standard time my orders are to transport you to tinker air force base in oklahoma from there a plane will take you to washington dc washington what for sir thats for the president to explain for now just relax and enjoy the flight there are snacks on board if youd like some fresh fruit yes sir hostess cupcakes its possible ill take both plus some bottled water done the solider handed griff a bottle of dasani from a cooler and a butterfinger or heath bar if you have them griff added make that two of each surprisingly the captain filled the order right down to the cupcakes enjoy the trip sir he said setting a cardboard tray on griffs lap enjoy the trip those were the exact words another solider had said nine months ago right after he had kicked griff viciously in the ribs and then manacled him with a heavy pair of chained cuffs enjoy the trip it had been a quiet sunday night in kalvesta kansas when the front door to griffs house shattered open as usual he was at his computer poring over data in fact except for the rare occasions when he was playing bridge or chess online he was always poring over data his research centered about experiments in modifying viral mrnamessenger rna the thrust of his work was getting a particular virus to incorporate a foreign sequence of nucleotides when it replicated the result would be germs incapable of further reproduction the data based on a model he had begun developing years before in africa had recently started showing some serious promise best of all every bit of his work was done using cgicomputergenerated imagery and advanced data processing no live subjects that had been griffs longstanding pledge to himself no animals slowly steadily he was closing in on a potentially revolutionary antiviral treatment he could feel it simultaneous with the disintegration of his front door the power was cut to the house in total darkness griff could hear but not see his windows shattering suddenly flashlight beams cut swaths in all directions as soldiers military police and members of swat all wearing gas masks swarmed inside like ants on a sugar mound guns were drawn there was so much shouting that griff could make out little of what was being said that is until the soldiers came at him get down get the fuck down facedown now they pointed their weapons at him three soldiers forced him onto his belly a boot pressed firmly against the back of his neck driving his face against the oak floor that was when he received the first of many kicksthis one to his side his organs seemed to loosen as the air rushed out of his lungs where is it one of the attackers demanded where is what griff managed another kick this one harder the toe of a boot plunged between his ribs pain exploded throughout his body and he gagged for air tear the place apart the lights came back on two men forced griff to stay facedown all around him he heard the sounds of destructionglass breaking fabric ripping objects crashing every so often a solider would roughly pull his head up by his hair and demand to know where it was i dont know what youre talking about that was when they would kick him again always in the same spot maximizing the pain interminable time went by before a woman called out from his small partially finished basement ive found it captain ive found it griff heard footsteps racing up his basement stairs hands grabbed at him and yanked him up by his shirt he saw a petite brunette solider holding a green cylindrical metal canister bearing several biohazard decals on it impossible griff knew the canister well wrx it had come from the level containment zone of the lab where he was workingthe most secure containment area in their system he studied it for a moment unwilling to believe that it had just been retrieved from the basement of his house if the canister held the virus from level still growing inside its tissue culture then it also held deathhorrible slow inexorable death how many did you find solider the ranking officer barked five canisters total sir she replied they were in a cubby hidden behind the basement wall paneling secure him the captain ordered two soldiers standing behind griff pulled him upright and pinned his arms to his back the officer in charge then stepped forward and punched griff hard in the stomach not once but twice the room began to spin the soldiers holding his arms in place now had to prop griff up as well in addition they kept shouting at him demanding to know if they had all the canisters were there more than five he heard them say sylvia chen my boss speak to her i didnt take those canisters find sylvia shell vouch for me im just a researcher i another fierce punch to the gut cut off his words he dropped to his knees and retched soldiers surrounded him and dragged him outside into a crisp stardrenched kansas night again they rudely pulled his arms behind his back he cried out in pain handcuffs closed tightly around his wrists cutting into his skin too tight griff said too bad a solider responded they pushed him into a camouflagepainted hummer soldiers were seated on either side of him where are you taking me griff asked to prison the solider answered enjoy the trip nine months with no answers no explanations nine months of isolation and filth and abuse nine months of selfregulated pushups on a concrete floor and yoga positions in the grimy corner now suddenly an open cell door a final series of blows from one of the guards and a helicopter flight at the invitation of the president of the united states he might have felt exultant he probably should have but he didnt instead griffin rhodes had a sinking feeling that he might have just replaced one layer of hell for another sir i have president allaire on the sat phone captain lewis said hes ready to speak with you the marine passed over a bulky stainless steel case with a satellite phone inside griff had to take off his helmet to speak the constant churn from the rotors made it hard to hear but not impossible dr griffin rhodes this is president jim allaire the voice distinguishable despite the background noise said mr president griff knew all about allaires involvement with project veritas but only sylvia chen and a few higherups had any direct contact with the man griff suspected he might now come to regret having joined the ranks of those accorded the honor dr rhodes there has been a massive exposure to wrx allaire said griffs jaw tightened captain lewis apparently felt the tension and turned away to look out the window bad news could wait griff imagined him thinking where how bad we have reason to believe genesis is behind the attack who the president paused you dont know about genesis well i havent exactly been given a wealth of reading material for the last nine months understood i can explain that later where was the exposure it occurred during my state of the union address pardon yes you heard correctly in the chamber of the house of representatives fifteen separate exposures around the hall how was the virus released exploding glass cylinders widespread somehow the containers were inserted into purses and briefcases and then detonated probably by radio signal have you locked down the building yes tightly no one in no one out the chamber has been sealed and the building as well plus theres an absolute perimeter set up fifty yards outside the capitol one mana senator from kentuckytried to sneak out of a littleused exit he was taken out by a sharpshooter and his body incinerated griff breathed a deep sigh at least they had done that sir were you directly exposed its been five hours weve all been exposedor will be you authorized veritas you know about the progressive mental deterioration i know thats one of the reasons why i ultimately suspended the research and closed down the lab when about eight or nine months ago griff felt himself sink he had warned sylvia chen that the project was too dangerous the virus too unstable in terms of mutation he had warned all of them you know we dont have any treatment he said thats why im bringing you to washington dr rhodes i need you to come up with one griff respected allaires acumen for biology and physiology according to sylvia chen the president had not only read griffs lengthy scientific reports he understood them as well the president must have been aware of his slow progress toward an antimicrobial treatment for wrx which meant he also knew he was asking the impossible mr president before we go any farther there is something i need to know go ahead were you the one who authorized my arrest there was a prolonged pause we had evidence the president said irrefutable security film of you stealing canisters of the virus on which you were working under the provisions of the patriot act you were a terrorist what would you have done i am no terrorist and i stole nothing now tell me did you authorize my arrest will my answer affect your decision about helping us i cant help you because there is nothing i can do before you and the others are dead regardless of what you say i will do what i can but i want the truth the truth is yes yes i did authorize your arrest and i would do it again and the solitary confinement i was convinced you had turned i believed you were a terrorist and a severe threat to the united states of america i did what i thought was in the best interests of our country our plan was to isolate you and then eventually to torture me there were those close to me who wanted to do it immediately the president said chapter day am est allaire had done all he could despite his obvious contempt for rhodes the man was now en route to washington the first of two planned portable airlocks with connecting tunnels was in place boxes of supplies were now being sent into the capitol along a bed of metal rollers at last report the second tunnel was nearing completion the military continued to request expanded access to the capitol but allaire was keeping them at bay until griffin rhodes had a chance to evaluate the situation and provide a preliminary assessment the capitol would remain offlimits to anyone who wasnt absolutely essential using house chamber surveillance video allaire and salitas sorted out the group assignments faster than either thought possible they used the location of the fifteen aerosol blasts to define the breakdown group b those with moderate exposure numbered just above three hundred group a lowest exposure were allowed to remain in the house chamber there were sixty people whom allaire marked as having the heaviest exposure those individuals were assigned to admiral jakess c group they would be the first to die gratefully rebecca and samantha were as sylvia chens reports detailing how wrx spread from host to prospective host gave allaire the idea to establish the quarantine groups chen had presented compelling evidence that extended exposure to carriers with laterstage infection increased the amount of virus passed to a new host allaire had good reason to believe those with heavy exposure to wrx would speed up the progression of symptoms in people with less virus in their system the president understood that he was largely responsible for this disaster he should have pulled the plug on veritas sooner perhaps he should have taken more people into his confidence before authorizing the program in the first place he always felt his job was about being true to himself and standing up for what he believed in but this time he had been wrong his closest friend and advisor gary salitas had been wrong and worst of all given his background as a physician the scientists he had decided to believe in had been wrong they had convinced him that the power of wrx could be harnessedthat the adverse effects of the virus could be eliminated now by having supported their view he had in all likelihood signed his own death warrant as well as those of his wife and daughter and many many others the report of crusty harlan mackeys grisly demise had been a terrible jolt now death from the virus had a faceprobably the first of many at the presidents request gary salitas jordan lamar and dr bethany townsend remained in the hard room allaire strained to get his mind around the enormity of what lay beyond the door this wasnt the time for remorse and selfpity now more than ever he had to connect with what it meant to be presidential knowing his actions might be among the last of his administration the others watched and waited how much are you going to tell them the defense secretary asked finally i dont know id like to hold back on talking about mackey agree so long as no one starts making a big deal about where he is and even then i think we can just speculate what about the virus the president shrugged bit by bit might be best he said townsend looked at the two friends curiously but said nothing she had been the allaires physician since the man was first nominated and was widely respected for her candor with the media and her loyalty to the first family she had grown comfortable issuing warnings about rising cholesterol levels in the most powerful man on earth but in this situation she felt helpless she was a group a but how long before the horrific symptoms that claimed the jackson family materialized inside her she could not access the kalvesta kansas files from within the capitol but she could recall specifics from the case in gruesome detail townsends vision blurred as a bolt of pain hit just above the bridge of her nose another migraine they occurred infrequently usually under tense situations but nobody really knew about them or could it be the virus attacking her body in unexpected ways from now on every twinge every cough or pain would be seen as a possible harbinger of debilitation and death townsend had decided to resign her position as first doctor following allaires initial debriefing the revulsion she felt over biological warfare of any kind cast doubt over her ability to support the president as his physician his friend or even for that matter as a fellow citizen then as he spoke to her one to one and requested she remain with him in the hard roomhe knew her well and sensed her revulsion at his decision to develop wrx and he needed her scientific brilliance and insight as well as her deep compassionher anger began to lessen she had often tried to imagine herself in his position making gutwrenching choices on a daily basis that had the potential to affect millions even billions of lives in the end she had learned to think carefully before secondguessing his decisions gary whats our eta on rhodes allaire asked hell be arriving here at bolling afb at approximately oh six hundred hours mr president weve got a chopper standing by to bring him here good i want you to coordinate his entry into the capitol how are we progressing in getting ahold of the guy rhodes wanted that would be his former lab assistant salitas said consulting his blackberry forbush melvin forbush were ready to set up a call when rhodes arrives do we have anything on the guy do you think he was involved in the theft of the virus the answer appears to be no were checking into all that again right now and where is he hes still at the lab in kansas but we closed the place hes the only one there jim sort of a caretaker but why apparently no one else wanted to stay there were just a couple of dozen in the whole lab installation to begin with now with their only project shut down its just forbush we keep the place ready because we dont have that many level four containment facilities and you never know when we might need one what a mess we throw one guy into prison for bioterrorism and we leave his assistant in charge of the lab its just a shell of a lab sir i dont care i dont trust rhodes and if this forbush worked for him i dont trust him either thats understandable but rhodes is our best hope for finding a treatment or or a cure i believe thats true jim our best chance to survive this nightmare i understand salitas paused and pursed his lips jim if you believe he might in some way be responsible for the attack may i ask why you think hes cooperating the president glanced over at townsend and lamar then back at salitas i dont know that he is cooperating he said before i brought you in on all this gary i met in secret with dr sylvia chen the dragon lady i know smart woman wrx was her baby well in one of our first meetings she told me about griffin rhodes who was working in her lab developing a vaccine or an antiviral drug that would counter infection with the wrx virus go on some years before that he had been working in africakenya to be exact from what she told me he was a cowboy back then when it came to tracking down the sources of outbreaks of the deadliest viruses known to man fearless like the guys who ride bulls for a living he was also a computer whiz who frustrated people around him by refusing to use animals in his researchonly computer models well according to chen back in his africa days he was after the source of an expanding outbreak of ebola infection which was moving down a mountainside toward a densely populated village rhodes found a cave loaded with bat guano that tested strongly positive for the virus he brought up a crew and sealed several side openings to the cave then he dynamited the main entrance closed on the way down the mountain he came across a hut blood was everywhere inside it the whole family was dead from hemorrhagic fever everyone that is except one childa small girl cringing out back beneath a pile of refuse she was just beginning to show signs of the disease rhodes sent all the workers down to the village to avoid them being exposed then he carried the child five miles down to the hospital seven days later the girl died and rhodes developed fullblown symptoms of ebola i hadnt heard any of that salitas said my fault for neglecting to tell you the proof against him in the theft of wrx was overwhelming he stole that virus purely and simply we had videos of him doing it plus the pile of corroborating evidence you know about but in the back of my head i couldnt get rid of that story sylvia chen had told me is that why you opted against any kind of torture to find out who he was working with the president shrugged i dont know maybe from what i knew of the man and i had never met him facetoface i decided the only logical explanation for his actions was that he had gone crazy i couldnt bring myself to torture him for that remember that was before genesis surfaced i wouldnt have connected rhodes and them anyhow unless he is genesis so do you trust him now no i dont trust him how could i but were in real trouble gary hours days maybe a couple of weeks at the most people are going to start dying soon you know how contagious that damn germ is but i also know griffin rhodes is the only card we have to play yes sir now i want a team on the man at all times and i want you to organize it top secret small numbers the best we have from the moment he sets foot off that plane i want your people to be on him cant be anybody from inside though because weve all been exposed we cant count on anybody to be reliable for long townsend who had been silent finally spoke up excuse me sir i dont understand that last statement allaire and salitas exchanged looks ill fill you in more later bethany the president said but suffice it to say its why i need you here with me right now and why is that townsend asked thanks to that virus it is only a matter of time possibly very little time before i will no longer be mentally competent to be president chapter day am est dr bethany townsend turned and walked away struggling to regain composure before she could face the president again no more games jim she said finally no more halftruths and dammit no more outright lies as your physician and friend i expect full disclosure right now or consider this my resignation allaire encouraged his physician to take a seat and poured her a glass of water i agree promise bethany i need you to devise a means by which we evaluate my mental state by means are you talking about some sort of test i know from the kalvesta files what the virus did to the jacksons central nervous systems but i thought that danger had been taken care of are you implying that there are mental status side effects of this incarnation of the virus as well not exactly side effects after the jacksons disaster before we stopped the veritas project altogether the virus had been working perfectly you know what interferon is yes of course i remember the name salitas said and i know certain anticancer protocols use it but i dont remember what role it plays here interferon is a protein made naturally in the body townsend said its produced in response to certain infections and also to attacks by cancer cellsparticularly those cancers caused by viruses sort of like an antibody the president added only not nearly as specific and probably not as powerful think about cold sores or other herpes infections the outbreak happens then goes away but the virus is usually not completely removed from the body instead some of the germs remain in the skin or along nerve roots in a dormant state then a stress or other some factor awakens them theres an outbreak and the cycle is repeated again we believe that interferon is one of the natural chemicals that drives the virus underground so to speak it is manufactured in response to an outbreak got it salitas said so common colds might be good for us if they stimulate interferon production exactly townsend replied the interferon produced in response to a common cold could be protective against viruses that cause leukemia that possibility is still being investigated the president took over the explanation well it appeared as if the wrx virus was held in check or even destroyed by interferon and antibodies until it wasnt mutation townsend said in more of a statement than a question all of a sudden dr chen and her team just couldnt keep it in check it was as if the virus had become immune to interferon remember what i told you about their clinical trialsgetting cats to willingly swim across a pool or mother monkeys to stop feeding their young yes well just as chen thought the virus was under control her animal subjects mostly monkeys began to undergo a progressive neurological degenerationdementia erratic mood swings serious aggression weakness jesus townsend muttered shaking her head i cant believe this is happening there was no reversal once their animals began to come apart the virus continued to replicate and attack their brains death was due to seizures and central nervous system shutdown so you think were all headed for dementia and death i do and you want me to come up with a psychological test that will demonstrate when you are mentally no longer able to be president yes and what then gary is paul rappaport in a secure location now allaire asked salitas nodded hes being transported to the th airlift wing minneapolisst paul air reserve station on the north side of the minneapolisst paul international airport they have an encrypted line actually he may be there already good get ahold of him for me please yes mr president salitass return to formality was his way of asking bethany townsend if she was in or out in terms of unencumbered support for her patient mr president townsend said by way of response what can we expect with this virus now how will it manifest working that out is your second assignment though i want you to stay clear of group cchief of staff jakess group we have to assume theyll soon all be causalities how so anybody at ground zero say within ten feet of any of the blasts will initially suffer several hours of uncontrollable coughing vomiting dizziness profound headache loss of balance lethargy within seven to ten days the bleeding will start due to the destruction of clotting factors in that respect wrx is like the marburg hemorrhagic fever viruses specifically ebola massive bruising will develop along with bloody diarrhea the victims skin will begin to loosen and detach from the underlying tissues the sclerae of their eyes will turn bright red black soupy vomiting will hail the end death will occur from dehydration and hemorrhage anytime between ten and fourteen days after infection mr president group c is over sixty people is there anything we can do for themanything at all ive sent for the virologist who was in charge of developing a treatment for wrx hopefully hell be able to come up with something meanwhile dr broussard is arranging for every antiviral drug we have to be delivered here in large quantities you and she will be responsible for coordinating their administration its your decision but i would focus on groups b and a i dont think we have the means to kill this bug but maybe youll be able to slow it down what can we expect neurologically from what i got from dr chens report of her animals with moderate exposure there will be a period of progressive confusion and emotional lability followed by a loss of will and profound suggestibility that somewhat stable period will last for two or three days thats when the infection was supposed to subside after that neurologic deteriorationstaggering grunting salivating uncontrollable arm and leg spasms progressive dementia violence and finally grand mal seizures high fevers and death damn so the three of us are in group a gary is close to being a b but yes so how long have we got the president shrugged two weeks maybe three eventually death will be due to seizures and central nervous system shutdown so while im testing your mental status townsend said bitterly whos going to be testing mine mr president salitas cut in i have paul rappaport on the line allaire flashed on rappaports daughter the reason his homeland security secretary had asked to fill the role of designated survivor he had met her at rappaports swearingin ceremony she was a pale railthin somewhat mousy woman the people who had vetted the nominee reported her as having two past hospitalizations for anxiety and depression but allaire saw no reason her psychiatric history should lead to withdrawing his support for what was otherwise a nearly spotless résumé in fact if anything rappaports devotion to his daughter was a mark in the mans favor over the first four years the onetime governor of minnesota had been in the cabinet he had overstepped his bounds from time to time but by and large he had been a good and loyal soldier to the president allaire took the satellite phone from salitas set it on speaker and sat down on the highbacked oxblood leather chair at the head of the conference table mr president rappaport began is everything okay media speculation is that there was some sort of terrorist attack using a biological weapon the president gave rappaport a full briefing no halftruths no withheld information afterward there was only silence from the man allaire wondered if their connection had dropped you still with me he asked i am mr president im at your disposal and ready to do whatever is necessary there was a force behind his words a confidence that was actually startling to allaire whats next the president cleared his throat dr townsend will devise a test to evaluate my mental functionto assess if my will or intellect have in any way become compromised how long given my level of exposure two weeks maybe more maybe less what are you suggesting we do sir after the kennedy assassination lyndon johnson was sworn in aboard air force one when its time well send transportation out to bring you to the white house when its time when my physician says so and assuming no one ahead of you is in shape to succeed me you will take the presidential oath of office my god that is quite a lot to absorb mr president a man does what he mustin spite of personal consequences in spite of obstacles and dangers and pressuresand that is the basis of all human morality john f kennedy very good my friend lets hope your moment doesnt come but if it does i trust you to do what is right and just thank you for your confidence whats your security situation there paul i have two secret service agents with me and my family thats all not good enough allaire said you have twentyfour hours to get your family settled and safe by then i want your home secured as if it were the white house biometric scanners infrared perimeter alarms video surveillance the works ill get gary salitas to work on that for you well send a detachment of secret service agents out there asap no need for the security measures mr president rappaport said except for the secret service protection through my office of homeland security i have access to the best systems professionals in the world ill phone roger corum hes the ceo of staghorn security and has connections to all the major players in the industry hes already an approved vendor and hes done a lot of work for us very well good luck paul well be back in touch soon yes mr president and sir yes if the time does come i promise ill be a great president chapter day am est the vhn banked smoothly to the right and eased toward the ground griff sat motionless in a plush leather seat staring out at the granite buildings of dc this helicopter though the same type that had lifted him to freedom hours earlier had a fully finished interior and was clearly used for transporting highprofile passengers he was on the last leg of a journey from solitary confinement in a maximumsecurity penitentiary to a meeting with the president of the united states just another typical day griff had made the trip east from tinker air force base to bolling in an eerily empty cb transport plane flight time took less than three and a half hours from takeoff to landing with different military teams escorting him at each step of the twothousandmile threestop journey now with the beginning just ahead he pressed his forehead against the small portal window and allowed images of people and places to flow through his mind from the earliest days of his remembered life he had one and only one guiding forcethe desire not to be normal his parents were gray conservative hardworking midwesterners both of whom died earlyhis mother of cancer and his father in a construction accident that left griff and his older sister louisa set financially he was a rebel in schoola wiseass many called himwell coordinated but disinterested in sports brilliant but with a history of underachievement that was well on the far side of arrogance the boys respected and feared him because of his reckless disregard for danger and his body the girls with few exceptions kept their distance the cops only saw him as a troublemakera brawler who as often as not would end up in the er pummeled by someone twice his size then louisa died meningitis they told griff meningicoccal meningitis within one hour of her first symptom a headache she was in a coma less than thirtysix hours later without ever regaining consciousness she was dead she was twentyfour at the time he was seventeen griff watched the ripples sent across the reflecting pool by the powerful rotors escorted by several military aircraft the chopper had passed unhindered through restricted airspace touching down atop a cordonedoff area of frozen lawn between east capitol street and capitol driveway griff had studied maps of the capitol complex en route and knew they had landed near the entrance to the recently constructed visitor center emerging from the belly of the chopper his legs felt stiff his muscles ached and his temples were beginning to throb fatigue dehydration stress perhaps just the transition to freedom from twentythree hours a day for nine months isolated in an eightbyeight concrete cell he wondered what symptoms the seven hundred or so inside the capitol were experiencing certainly there would already be some coughing a good percentage of sylvia chens monkeys who had been dosed with wrx by aerosol had rapidly developed a dry hacking cough accompanied by an outpouring of mucus several of the animals had died even before the virus could have taken hold in their nervous systems probably from sudden airway obstruction but possibly from some sort of allergic reaction to the germs themselves several times griff had called the vet working for chen and insisted she treat the animals but the woman surly and arrogant admitted that although she was a dvm she was a specialist in pathology paid more to autopsy the subjects than to keep them going giant mobile spotlights illuminated the predawn darkness with enough wattage to turn midnight into noon a camouflage field jacket supplied to griff earlier protected him against the crisp morning air he rubbed at his eyes and reflexively tugged at his tangled beard hours earlier the flight crew on the cb had handed him a heavy scissors a package of gillette disposable razors and a can of shaving cream but he declined their offer the president needs to see the man hes made shielding himself against the wind from the rotors griff took in his new surroundings with interest and awe a mishmash of barriersconcrete blocks low steel gates wooden sawhorses and barrelsformed a secure perimeter along all the roadways bordering the capitol that he could see uniformed soldiers police officers fbi agents and combatready personnel from swat patrolled the makeshift perimeter their guns ready at periodic intervals there were sharpshooters standing beside the tripods that bore their longrange rifles well behind the soldiers and police the curious lined the perimeter in places standing five or even ten deep griff estimated the crowd to be a thousand or more with people still arriving the vapor from their frozen breath swirling in the rotors wash some had impressive cameras and appeared to be from the media others were using cell phones and camcorders to capture whatever might be transpiring history in the making if they only knew in addition to the military and the crowd several large trucks were offloading what almost certainly were cartons of provisions into a large tent power cords snaked across the lawn from thrumming generators providing illumination and heat griff took in the remarkable surreal scene juxtaposing it against the stark unadorned walls of his cell at the florence penitentiary where he had started this day he was impressed with the organization and the speed with which the military was responding to the crisis but he also knew there was no way they were going to wade in and out of this logistical morass without a disaster sooner more likely than later wrx was going to escape the crowd nearest to where griff debarked noticed him right away who is that the unibomber is there anyone else coming out of there nope hes it hes it maybe hes the prime minister of someplace i cant believe theyre going to let him in there without giving him a bath looks like the ghost of howard hughes griff battled back the urge to stop and tell the growing crowd that if they knew what was going on inside none of them would want to be within five miles of the place instead he pulled up the hood of his field jacket and trudged ahead flanked by a cordon of soldiers all wearing similar military camouflage behind him the rotors slashed to a stop ahead a tall ramrodstraight man bareheaded with a gray flattop emerged from the visitors pavilion he was dressed like the other soldiers but griff could tell right away he was brass dr rhodes im general frank egan head of the us northern command the man said extending his gloved hand his steely gaze remained fixed on griffs face clearly taking measure of him i am under orders from the president to get you inside the capitol complex and to escort you to the house chamber as quickly as possible well then escort away griff said weve had our best people here for a few hours now theres a staging tent set up over there for you and the others who will be changing into field biological gear they are racal spacesuits positivepressurized hepa superfiltered air supply with redundant battery power there are more on the way i believe thats what you requested griff nodded grimly and smiled inwardly at the fact that the highly technical descriptions were like something from a childs primer to him now no one who had been around him during the weeks following his sisters death would have ever predicted the transformation that was about to occur as his sullenness and oppositional behavior had intensified the powers in his high school met with his aunt and unclehis only remaining relatives they in turn brought in their minister and after that the police community relations officer who had done his best but failed to reach the brooding disenfranchised teen throughout the meetings griff had sat stoically staring at the wall or out the window saying little then after a threeweek absence from school spent sleeping on the basement couches of friends or in abandoned buildings that for years had been his haunts he suddenly marched into class and aced an exam in a chemistry course he had never attended is this the team who will be escorting me in griff asked egan pointing to the six soldiers who stood confidently at ease behind the general yes they are im guessing they arent biocontainment experts you are guessing right they armed does it matter allaire wants me to save the day but he doesnt trust me is that it i have my orders dr rhodes these soldiers are prepared to sacrifice their lives for this mission they will suit up and accompany you every step of the way griff just nodded the general surprised him though when his hard eyes suddenly softened dr rhodes he said i dont know what in the hell is going on inside but its an understatement for me to say that your being flown here as you have been is of the utmost importance to the people in there and to our country the president has shared with me some of where youve been for the past nine months and why all i can say is please do your best to help him and those people with him i will do that general griff said his mouth unpleasantly dry egan studied him i believe you will he said finally general one more thing yes i hate to be a pessimist here but you need to prepare yourself for the worst griff flashed on his work with project veritas specifically on his computer models which he had been working on for years in his efforts to steer clear of experimenting on animals his latest programs rendered flawless cgi animations of various combinations of the ribonucleic acid rna pattern of the wrx virus as well as other related rna viruses like sars and hepatitis c and many deoxyribonucleic acid dna viruses as well his programs the most promising of which he had code named orion could generate countless threedimensional combinations of the molecules that formed the backbone of the submicroscopic germs but they could not to this point at least develop a sequence that would effectively kill them at that moment however he did not need a computer simulation to tell him what he already knew within fourteen daystwentyone at the outsideeverybody inside the capitol would die in a manner as horrible as his worst ebola nightmare over the years before his arrest despite all the financial support and equipment he could ask for within the tight security of the veritas project griff had failed to uncover the missing link in his rna sequencing that would create an effective viral killdrug it was naïve of jim allaire to believe that within fourteen days the answer would suddenly appear looks like ive traded one cell for another griff said gesturing at his escorts think of them as bodyguards the general said is that how president allaire described them to you not exactly not ready to deal with egan and his militia griff turned and walked back toward the crowd immediately a second helicopter hovering two hundred feet overhead turned a powerful spot directly down on him the glare hurt his eyes guess theyre worried im going to run for it he said to no one in particular he slowed but continued walking away enjoying the sense of freedom however artificial behind him no one followed the spot remained onegan hedging his bets as griff neared the crowd which seemed to have doubled in size since his arrival people again began shouting hey crazy man you with the beard can you tell us whats going on here over here let me get a picture of you just one shot flashbulbs popped in the clamor and cacophony of voices suddenly one stood outa womans voice from somewhere deep within the crowd it was enough to make griff peer ahead looking for her but every minute was crucial and with the spotlight glaring off the sea of frozen breath there was no chance he turned and walked back toward where the head of the us northern command stood waiting as he reached the man he heard the womans voice once more above the din of all those voices shouting at him hers was the only one calling him by name chapter day am est griff lifted the vinyl flap of the camouflagecolored field tent and stepped inside at this point he decided there was no sense in trying to explain to the head of the northern command that he had a lingering issue with the military the walls of the deceptively roomy tent rippled with the gusting january wind there were seven tall metal lockers evenly spaced along one of the walls set against the opposite side was a portable sink and headhigh shelving unit stocked with armyissued towels portable gas heaters kept the space warm griff and his special forces bodyguards wasted no time getting undressed there was no banter no extraneous talk they exchanged their street clothes for green surgical scrubs folded neatly inside their lockers griff found it a challenge to pull the drawstring tight enough to hold the pants up around his depleted waist finally he pulled his field biological suit from the tightly packed locker and spread it out on the floor with wellpracticed moves he stepped into it feetfirst then slid his arms into the sleeves extending his fingers until his hands fit snugly inside the attached gloves you guys know to be extra careful with the hands right one tiny puncture could kill you we know how to take care of our gear came the terse reply i gotcha griff said raising his hands defensively the other soldiers eyed him coolly he reminded himself that to them he was a convicted terrorist in fact there would be no one he encountered this night who believed otherwise no bands no banners no ceremony proclaiming welcome to freedom griff i dont know how much experience youve had in a hot zone before he said this virus is lethal arent you the least bit curious as to what theyve thrust you into no one thrust us into anything the soldier to his right said we volunteered our orders are to shadow you every step you take and to protect you if anyone tries to to go ahead say it to take you out well im sure youll do great in there griff said just as im sure youre not all coming out alive griff pulled the flexible butyl hood over his head what little vapor condensed on his visor evaporated as soon as he got the papr breathing system running without a builtin microphone he had to raise his voice to be clearly heard even though the gloves and boots were essentially welded to the suit he still wrapped his wrists and ankles with tape none of the soldiers took that added precaution im taping up he said id suggest you do the same why one solider asked to shore up your weak points thats why the soldiers stared at him numbly i dont see any weak points wrists and ankles look this virus doesnt care how careful you think youre being it has one mission just like you do its mission is to find a way into your bloodstream locate the organ it was born to make its home in and replicate if it were a perfect organism it would use you up just enough to keep you and it alive forever it would be so much easier that way but this virus isnt perfect so it will kill you whether it wants to or not and in ways you cant even imagine the soldiers eyed each other finally one nodded griff tossed him the roll of duct tape im ready when you are griff said minutes later the seven emerged from the field tent and made their way across the frozen ground toward the visitor center entrance spacemen on the move as always the suit made griff feel mildly claustrophobic despite it being loosefitting and pliable he had no doubt that the sensation was brought on in part by the invisible assassins separated from him and unimaginably violent death by only four mils of vinyl he scanned the faces of the soldiers flanking him checking them through their clear plastic visors for signs of distress clearly they were tough and focused but then again none of them had contracted a level four virus like ebola or wrx before in all likelihood that fact would change before too long as they walked griff could again hear spectators shouting at them though his hood muffled their voices suddenly he heard the womans voice calling his nameonce then again but before he could locate the source general egan emerged from behind an armored troop transport vehicle he ordered the guards to halt a few feet shy of the portable airlock sergeant stafford youll keep me informed of your progress by radio yes sir the husky soldier who introduced himself to griff as sergeant chad stafford draped the bulky radio tethered to a lowhanging strap around his neck three others were handed ma assault rifles and two were given highpowered flashlights griff noticed that none of them was given a firstaid kit be sure to leave all this gear inside when you return egan said general griff said those weapons will just add to the risk of a suit puncture with all due respect dr rhodes ill be the judge of that egan said our orders are to keep an eye on you and a lookout for anyone who might cause you trouble following the generals order two soldiers guarding the airlock entrance stepped aside griff paused to make a careful inspection of the hastily built structure the unit had two distinct partsthe airlock and a connecting tunnel both were comprised of vinyl panels set upon heavyduty integrated aluminum frames that formed a transparent enclosure the airlock was large enough to accommodate all seven of them the tunnel however which was accessible through a vinyl door inside the airlock required them to walk single file to reach the entrance of the capitol the airlock met griffs standards for safety but only for a level or less microbe neoprene cell foam gaskets sealed the frametoframe connections ceilingmounted hepa air filters produced the optimum negative pressure airspace there were three portable chemical showers inside the airlock chamber itself which they would use to decontaminate before they could exit the rudimentary structure designed to allow entry into the capitol with the minimal risk of viral escape was not up to the safety standards of a bsl containment facility but despite his reservations griff knew the setup was better than nothing and best for these circumstances once inside the airlock he used the gauge he had requested to measure microns of airborne contaminate as soon as he got three satisfactory readings he pulled open the door sealing the airlock from the tunnel on the way out each of them would be required to take a twentyminute chemical shower following which griff would measure the air quality again three more safe readings and he would risk opening the airlock door for them to exit simple enough the visitor center entrance to the capitol should be unlocked sergeant stafford yelled griff could barely hear over the noise of the ceilingmounted air purifiers lining the tunnel walkway youll be met by the presidents personal physician and escorted to president allaire by his secret service people roger that one solider replied the team entered in single file no one spoke as they passed through the visitor center door once inside the capitol griff paused adjusting his senses to the new environment all was silent deadly silent after a delay of two minutes a team of four agents appearedtwo men and two women their expressions suggested they hadnt been briefed to expect the biocontainment suits or maybe it was griffs unibomber appearance wheres the doctor sergeant stafford asked detained people are starting to get sick weve got medicine and supplies coming in by tram to the house subway station griff turned to the agent ill need access to those tunnels so i can sample the atmosphere we might have to seal them off we have no idea about their air flow patterns what is this virus an agent said nothing good griff answered the agents introduced themselves but griff paid no attention to their names instead he studied them for signs of strain then he asked to check their hands chens test animals had reportedly developed bizarre patterns of redness on their palms as their infections intensifiedcrimson swirls or concentric targetlike lesions of the four agents only one of the men tall and angular had a slightly increased respiratory rate he could have been hyperventilating because of the tenseness of their situation or he could have been incubating virus it had been just over ten hours since the initial exposure why are you wearing jackets griff asked its hot inside these suits and we have fans going you guys must be baking were wearing shoulder holsters one of the women said the people in there are upset enough without having obviously armed guards parading about whats the room temperature no idea but its up there we just got the ac running again it already shut down on us once were trying to keep the house chamber and other rooms cool body heat wants to turn the place into a sauna well radio somebody right now and tell them to shut that ac off its bad enough there are openings around every window in this creaky old place were talking viruses here as in smallunimaginably small for most people and like i said we dont know about airflow or how the germ will spread lets not help it along through the ventilation shafts the secret service agent sent the order on via radio and the biocontainment team and their guides resumed their descent into hell they crossed a polished marble floor and then headed down a short flight of stairs into emancipation hall from there they passed the model of the statue of freedom and up some stairs before emerging into the great rotunda griff took little notice of the splendor of the dome lined by cream and goldcolored toruses with the brumidi frieze and stunning fresco at its top the way things were the great rotunda and the rest of the capitol for that matter had become nothing more than an ornate coffin they crossed under the dome in silence but from up ahead griff heard voices the clamor grew louder as the team approached statuary hall isnt everybody still inside the house chamber he asked visualizing the floor plans he had studied on the way across country weve moved some people presidents orders varied exposure levels no ones told us they just said who to move and where griffs containment suit was sweltering but still the scene in elegant statuary hall sent a chill through him entering between washington and jefferson the team stepped into a large twostory semicircular space crowded with people many of them were lying on blankets spread out across the richly polished checkered floor others were propped against the pedestals displaying the busts of heroes from each of the states in a bizarre unsettling juxtaposition those comprising the miserably uncomfortable assemblage were decked in their finest evening wear much of which had been ripped in response to the heat a civil war infirmary scene was griffs first impressionminus the bloodied bandages and handcarved crutches portable lighting augmenting that from the chandelier bathed the scene in an eerie glow there were several cots set up in a row along one wall bearing mostly older men and women with iv drips in their arms near them were several large trash cans filled to overflowing with rubbish and beside the cans were columns of cartons stacked five high with stenciled lettering on the side that read us army rations the voices fell into a deathly silence as griff and the others made their way into the room a number of the detainees haggard shirts open hair undone slowly rose to their feet and followed griffs movements with their eyes then without warning a small frustrated mob ten or twelve with madness in their eyes rushed him some clawed at his suit others tried getting at his mask whats going on a woman shouted tell us help us please who are you for gods sake do something get us out of here the violent reaction was totally unexpected one break in his suit one microscopic tear in the seal between his mask and hood and he was dead griff batted away at their arms the soldiers and secret service agents also taken by surprise delayed several seconds before finally wading into the crowd shoving some people aside and others to the floor the agents pulled their sidearms and two of the soldiers swung the barrels of their ms gashing open a distinguishedlooking gentlemans face a woman came at griff from the side her hair was matted down with sweat and her makeup had run rivers along both cheeks please the women begged i have a son a husband if its just a flu virus why cant we leave flu griff repeated is that what you were told yes griff clenched his jaw and pushed his way past the woman being led and followed closely by those assigned to protect him wait one of the soldiers behind griff said the group turned he was an african american with the broad shoulders and narrow waist of a serious weight lifter now the soldier stood motionless holding his right arm out the tape safeguarding his wrist had been torn away and the weld between the hand and arm was ripped exposing his skin im sorry griff whispered placing his arm around the shoulders of the man who had quite possibly saved griffs life at the cost of his own im really sorry without a word the soldier set his rifle down placed his helmet beside it turned and head high walked back into statuary hall for a time no one could speak lets hope youre worth it pal one of the other men said finally lets hope youre worth it the group was led down a hallway to a nondescript door just outside the house chamber the president is waiting for you inside an agent said griff inhaled deeply then exhaled and opened the door from his seat at the desk inside the small office james allaire rose for a time the two men stood several feet apart sizing each other up youre lying to these people im the goddamn president of this country i do what i feel is necessary to maintain order and protect the citizens im counting on you to save their lives you were wrong about me you know that im not a terrorist well then prove it chapter day am est the exterior of the ss trading co mirrored the other garages and rundown brick warehouses lining a quartermile stretch of k street in southeast dc reports of decreased violence in the notoriously highcrime neighborhood amounted to little more than the citys wellconnected economic council responding to a steady inflow of landlord payoffs homicides were up prostitution was up and tax revenues were down agitation was increasing to clean up the area in preparation for gentrification and sooner or later there would be a bigtime crackdown but not that night with every cop in dc summoned to the capitol patrols were essentially nonexistent and the street people were out in force teenage drug dealers and overthehill hookers strolled past the ss trading co without giving the building a second thought from the street they could not see the sophisticated array of satellite dishes set dead center on the roof beyond the massive steel sliding door painted a nondescript reddish brown two men sat at opposite sides of a folding table smoking cigars drinking coffee and playing cards the men one african american the other caucasian were dressed in military fatigues a naked bulb dangled from a cord suspended a few feet above them smoke drifted through the shaft of light seated to one side of the dimly lit space was a third man copperskinned and wiry with a oncehandsome face that was marred by a spectacular scar running from his forehead through his brow and down his right cheek he was paying no attention to the others instead wearing headphones he was fixed on a wallmounted bank of a dozen video monitors the images on each of the screens automatically changed every three minutes along with the sound associated with it a joystick enabled the man to adjust the angle and distance of the views projected by the concealed cameras positioned throughout the united states capitol building there were several of them he could zoom in close enough to read the number plates on the seats in the house chamber and he could rotate another pair degrees to observe the chaos unfolding in statuary hall there was room for a second operator at the bank of screens but at the moment one man was handling them by himself suddenly a speaker mounted on the wall just above the monitor bank crackled to life disrupting the quiet and actually startling the man whose name was alex ramirez ramirez an electronics expert who had soldiered in a dozen or more wars around the globe glanced up at the cameras he had installedcameras that were now monitoring him and the others in the ss trading company i dont pay you goofoffs to play cards a disembodied male voice boomed out get back in the garage and work on the equipment ramirez wheres fink the other men stopped playing cards and redirected their attention toward the monitors on which they were featured finks catching some zs in the back room ramirez said well wake him up the voice barked ramirez swiveled his chair around hey goofoffs on your way back to the garage can one of you guys go and wake up fink tell him its cain ramirez had recognized cains voice if you men follow orders he had said that first day youll be rewarded to the degree that matt fink discussed with each of you if you question our patriotism or refuse to follow any directives you will be permanently and painfully retired from this unit and from your life the wallmounted speakers became active again ramirez take manual control of camera nine and queue it up for fink cain said i want him to see whats going on the man spoke with the confident authority ramirez had grown accustomed to obeying over his years in various armies cain genesiscute as always ramirez chuckled at the notion of how his bibletoting godobsessed mother had she lived past fifty would have taken to his working for people who based their operation on the scriptures and in particular on genesis her favorite book of the old testament poor deluded old gal through a number of missions together ramirez had developed complete trust in his friend matt fink first though he had to survive nearly having his throat slit for making a casual remark about the mercenarys name it was my fathers name and his fathers name before him fink had said holding ramirez a foot off the floor with one hand and brandishing his huge knife with the other the first man i killed thought it was a good idea to make fun of it initially ramirez had doubts about this particular job for a time after signing on with genesis he kept those doubts to himself then the first payment hit his swiss bank account and his apprehension vanished like the darkness of the first day as long as those payouts continued he decided he would gladly light a frigging candle on his knees if thats what genesis wanted hows that mama matt finks heavy footsteps echoed in the spacious highceilinged warehouse as he strode over to where ramirez sat fink always slept lightly and never far away from a weaponmost often his bowie knife or his luger and at other times both the men liked to joke that sometime during a nightmare the giant would shoot himself and slit his own throat by the time fink reached the screens he was wide awake and fully alert he waved up at the camera hey there cain old sport whats up are you aware of whats happening at the capitol there have been no reports of any incidents that jeopardize our mission ramirez zoom camera nine in on the group in the biosuits they entered the building a little while ago ramirez pressed a button on his control panel the monitor labeled camera number nine flickered as the image autofocused on the targets the recording showed seven individuals dressed in biocontainment gear making their way like lunar explorers across the polished marble floor theyre military fink said we expected this would happen it does nothing to compromise our efforts six of them are soldiers cain replied but who in the hell is the one with the beard fink peered at the screen then leaned forward and took over control of the camera himself let me get a decent closeup of him fink said dont move that apparatus too much i dont want them to know theyre being watched until its time anything you say sport and stop calling me sport im from bleedin south africa wed call the pope sport and while youre working on that cain said can you guys explain to me how we lost visual of the president for over fortyfive minutes there must be a dead space where our cameras cant pick him up ramirez offered impossible cain shot back we had every inch of that building covered someone screwed up couldnt have been you ramirez muttered what nothing boss sorry if we missed something good now get me a shot through the visor of the guy with the beard fink continued to maneuver and position the camera until the bearded mans weary face came into better focus good very good cain said we can use facial recognition software to find out who he is if we need to we can even remove the beard fink well provide you with a detailed background on this man after we get a match i have a feeling i already know well be waiting fink said meanwhile i want you to get over there and mill around with the crowd bring two men with you ramirez will keep an eye on mr beardor maybe i should say dr beardand well be in touch when we know something for certain youve got it sp mr cain sir theyre wearing portable breathing systems that are battery powered sooner or later hes going to have to come out count on us to be there when he does fink said chapter day am est okay the way i understand it if i do my best to find a way to beat this bug im free whether i succeed or not no strings thats the deal the president said even though you still believe i stole that virus from my own lab the security cameras picked up several perfect shots of your face behind your visor particles from the floor of the deepest level of the lab were on your boots and we found the canisters hidden in a recently constructed compartment behind your basement wall the gym bag you used to transport the canisters was found in your bedroom closet it wasnt me griffs meeting with james allaire was in a conference room that did not appear on any of the floor plans griff had studied the president of the united states was one chair to griffs right at a vast mahogany table the secretary of defense gary salitas sat several places to griffs left next to dr bethany townsend and a man introduced as the capitol architect two secret service agents stood against the wall behind them presumably ready to save the president from the terrorist in the blue biohazard suit the rest of the room was empty griff felt his anger toward this man who had stolen nine months of his life simmering very close to the boiling point do we have any chance allaire asked clearly unwilling to enter into a debate around griffs guilt or innocence if it was the flu like youre telling all those poor people out there the answer would be yes but its not weve decided to share the true facts a bit at a time salitas said well a bit at a time i dont think theyre buying your flu story mr secretary griff replied look salitas snapped if youre going to be a wiseass easy gary allaire said he took a deep breath to reset himself and exhaled okay dr rhodes this is a real mess weve gotten ourselves into we dont have a hell of a lot of cards to play in fact at the moment youre about our only hope sorry if i sound a little out of joint sir griff said but i hope youll understand if at the moment youre not on my list of favorite presidents salitas made a move toward him and the guards responded in kind but allaire stopped them with a raised hand i understand he said tell me dr rhodes whenwhen you were put in prison how close were you to coming up with something that would kill wrx or at least keep it in check i would say i had a shot i had completed my computer model of the virus twice both times though something changed in the germ mutation precisely we were after reverse transcriptase one of the enzymes the virus makes to help replicate itself if we could administer a drug that would disrupt the formation of that enzyme we could possibly neuter the little buggers before they could reproduce just like taking your pooch to the vet why were you having so much trouble the virus mutates faster than ive been able to modify the transcriptase theres something missing in my sequencing but i hadnt been able to figure out exactly what when you pulled the plug on me did you know that the solitary confinement cells at the florence penitentiary are eight feet by eight counting the toilet thats less than the length of this table how long will it take you to figure out what you were doing wrong salitas asked his jaw nearly clenched did you know that aside from the guards calling me a terrorist while they were beating me with their clubs no one ever told me why i had been imprisoned no dime to make a call no attorney no hearing nothing enough salitas barked slamming his fist down gary please dr rhodes is angry with us he doesnt see our responsibility to the people of this country the way we do and at the moment thats okay we need him gary we all need him dr rhodes we need to be thinking if not when griff answered i have no real basis for guessing what this virus does in people weve had some contagion disasters with dr chens monkeys but never any leaks involving humans the exchange of queer looks between the president and his defense secretary lasted only a moment but griff caught it and wondered about it did they know something he didnt he filed the unasked question away allaire and salitas had already shown themselves capable of lying if they deemed it necessary griff felt certain they would not hesitate to lie to him my lab he asked whats the status your man melvin forbush has been serving as a watchman at the lab we just got ahold of him hes started getting the place operational we have a support team of cdc virologists being deployed to the vertias lab as well salitas said cancel them griff replied curtly i dont need anyones opinions but my own what i need are blood samples from twenty or thirty infected hosts all exposure levels between melvin my computers and the lab if it can be done it will be done its my work im the only one you need im afraid i cant allow that allaire said we have your lab notebooks im sure our scientists can do something with them in that case i want sylvia chen to head up the other team again an exchange of glances um dr chen disappeared two days after your arrest the president said we havent heard from her since we suspected she might have been an accomplice of yours but we still really have no evidence to support that have you had people out looking for her the fbi of course and are they still looking some are some a few officers are still on the case damn i just spent a significant percentage of my life locked in a concrete box while you stop looking for the one person who might ive heard about enough salitas exploded leaping to his feel and charging toward griff his cheeks were flushed the veins in his neck protruding gary dammit leave him be he has a right to be upset about this one im sorry dr rhodes sylvia chens trail was icecold and i needed every agent looking for genesis tell your pal there to spend a couple of days in solitary at the alcatraz of the rockies griff said then he can come at me provided he has the strength left to do so do you have any idea what this genesis wants is it a group or a person almost certainly a groupdomestic most likely no idea what their agenda is except to sow fear and discord religious fanatics maybe were betting some sort of fundamentalists so do we have an agreement or not griff doodled for a time on a sheet of yellow legal paper so youve got scientists to make sure i do the work he said finally and military guard dogs to make sure i dont make a run for it is that right yes thats about it allaire said im prepared to set you free no matter what the results of your research provided our people tell me you put in the effort a full presidential pardon and if i say no then ill put you back in prison and youll have the blood of seven hundred people on your hands while you rot there the force behind allaires words seemed to shake the room then i have one demand of you griff said since we really dont trust one another i want everything i do to be documented by a third partysomeone unassociated with your administration a reporter that way there can be no misunderstandings or covert efforts to change fact into fiction consider it an insurance policy on your word ill make some calls no need griff said get me angela fletcher the science reporter for the post allaire asked shes reported from hot zones before allaire and salitas silently conferred and agreed ill see if we can track her down griff flashed back to the scene outside the capitol the chaos of the gathering crowd and the disembodied womans voice that kept calling his name no need for that mr president he said i believe shes outside the capitol right now chapter day am est i knew it was you rhodes angie cried out i knew it griff was there as she entered the capitol through the airlock his military entourage a respectful distance away welcome to hell he said reaching out to take her gloved hands in his you know i almost didnt bring my binocs with me but at the last moment i threw them in my bag all it took was one good look through that visor of yours and i knew it was you despite the rip van winkle beard its a long story through the visor of her butyl hood griff could see that if anything angela fletcher was even more beautiful than the woman in his memorywonderful skin sensual truculent lips velvet deep brown eyes it was hard to believe it had been twelve years since they first met in kenya she must have been a baby if youre here she said things must be really bad worse than you can imagine she set her hand on his arm whatever they want of you griff i know you can do it im pleased to see youre back in the game the temperature inside his suit went up several degrees i know you can do it he had heard those exact words from her before first in africa then again years later on his houseboat in the keys i know you can do it she always had more faith in him than he did in himself he had never told her and probably never would but angela fletcher was the only woman he had ever loved the canvas backpack angie wore contained blood collection supplies strapped over one shoulder she carried a lightweight video recorder and a digital slr camera accounting for all the items griff had requested hows the suit kiddo he asked its a little tense in here but nothing i cant handle some claustrophobia at first is expected but nows the time to turn back if youre feeling panicked believe me no one will hold it against you least of all me im a reporter this is the story of the century im not going anywhere besides i might be able to help you already have you going to tell me the story behind that beard when we have time you ever draw blood i worked as a phlebotomist in college before i switched out of premed but i dont think i ever did it with bulky gloves on weve got the presidents doctor to do some of the drawing and well see if theres a corpsman here i can do the rest in case you couldnt guess a puncture in these suits is highly undesirable lets walk so what do you know about this virus angie asked and how did you end up here the last thing i remember was when i found you on that houseboat of yours vowing to the heavens that your ebola encounter had done you in and you were through with viruses things happen people change he said it had been just another day in an unending sequence of fishing naps and jack daniels when angie showed up on the deck of sanctuary the mosscolored sixtyeightfoot sumerset houseboat griff had bought at a drug enforcement agency auction and set up in a sleepy little marina in key largo seven years had passed since the two of them had first met in kenyasix years and nine months since griff with little explanation had ended their intensely passionate love affair and gone off chasing after the source of an outbreak of deadly lassa fever angie had come to africa on assignment to report on virus hunters for science times digest cowboys of the jungle the article would eventually be called she was young beautiful bright brash and ready for adventure the whole package it was difficult to say which one of them fell quicker or harder griffs sudden pullaway was nearly as surprising to him as it was to her although it didnt take him long to work out the reason after waiting more than a week for him to return or at least to make contact angie finally left for the states friends told him that she did so hurt and angry and never knowing why he had taken off the way he did griff was dozing on the stern deck of sanctuary when she came aboard carrying a houseplant and knocked on the wall of the cabin its not you its me she said couldnt you have come up with a little more inventive note than that griff felt his throat close creative writing was never one of my strong suits he managed grateful that there was a halffilled glass of jack daniels on the table i guess it wasnt she said its a little late i know but for what its worth im sorry she sat down next to him her scent was dizzying just a few months ago i was working on a story about an ebola accident and i heard from one of the cowboys i interviewed about what happened to you twerent nothin you married engaged you i like to sit here and fish and drink and watch the sun pass by women tend to want more out of a husband than that i think you were afraid you were going to die that was the reason you took off on me wasnt it almost i was never afraid of dying i was afraid of what my dying would do to you you didnt deserve that you might have let me in on the decision i didnt feel i could i was always going to lose angie it was just a matter of where and when and how much of me was left when the battle was over you once said you were going up against nearperfection i never quite knew what that meant but you do now i think so yes i should have been a matador ange he said absently tossing a pebble into the still water bigger opponents but youd have to kill the bulls and you dont kill animals id sing them to sleep they talked through the night and into the next day angie was working on an article for the post on researchers who were bypassing animal experimentation and testing but still getting answers griffs seminal paper on the subject was referenced more than any other by the time she had gathered her notes and prepared for the drive back to the airport in miami he had given her enough material for a whole series in between scribbling page after page in her remarkably illegible shorthand she had managed to clean the galley change the sheets catch a fish clean it and poach it accompanied by the contents of what seemed like a bunch of nearempty boxes and a mélange of refrigerator leftovers why have you stayed away from the lab for so long she asked packing her briefcase too dangerous them viruses never forget like elephants come on griff im serious people need you science needs you do you need me dammit griff dont make this difficult i love the memories of what we had i dont want to have to shut them out sorry you can get back to your research i know you can do it why cant you see how much you have to offer to the world i dont know i guess nearly dying has a way of getting inside a man every day while i was in africa i felt as if i were totally prepared for the inevitable i guess i wasnt you werent meant to spend your life this way if you need help then dammit go and get it take meds if you have to but dont deprive us all of what you have inside youespecially your fearlessness griff thought about her visit every day after she left he had promised to call her and let her know what was happening but he never did still the moment she stepped off his boat and drove away he had sensed something inside him begin to change ill take that backpack angie griff said the pack filled with bloodcollection gear was light but the decreased mobility of the biosuit made it cumbersome to tote angie followed him through emancipation hall with the soldiers close behind aliens on the move as they walked griff did his best to explain the circumstances leading up to this moment especially the nine horrific months he spent in solitary confinement for what was clearly a frameup her proximity to him was distracting even more so when she shared that not long after she left him on the keys she had finally accepted that she wasnt in love with her fiancé and had broken off their engagement so whats happened since then not that much ive become a paragon of serial monogamy but i remain eternally optimistic just like always griffs pulse accelerated as they neared statuary hall he became determined to share his feelings with her as soon as the time was right along the wall to their left racks of comfortable clothing probably from local department stores were being sorted by capitol police in preparation for distribution angie its not going to be a pretty sight in there people are very anxious some of them are already getting ill earlier a group of them charged at me and tore one of my protectors suits just stay focused and move ahead steadily if people try and get near you well stop them if she heard him she did not respond the moment they came through the archway bordered by the statues of jefferson and washington she fell off the pace and stopped just inside the expansive room angie dont get distracted now griff whispered urgently keep moving dammit keep moving but angie remained where she was surveying the frightening pathetic scene she took in the people sprawled out upon the floor and those slumped over with their backs leaning up against the wall then she knelt down beside one particularly distressed woman the woman in her forties and probably quite pretty was wearing a black evening dress that had been torn in places against the oppressive body heat in the hall her hair was disheveled and makeup was smeared across her face the large amethyst brooch that had held her neckline together had come open her back was pressed to the wall and she was sobbing uncontrollably seemingly without thought for herself angie knelt down wiped the womans makeup and perspiration away with a piece of cloth smoothed her hair and then to griffs horror dexterously refastened the brooch were here to do what we can to help angie said softly the woman regained an ort of composure im frightened she sobbed i know i know youre going to be okay whats your name emily emily wells my husbands a congressman from utah first term he was ill tonight and gave me his ticket well why not try and do what you can to help some of the others emily it will make the time pass more quickly im angela fletcher from the post this man behind me is a worldfamous virologist hes here to help figure this whole thing out angie took the womans hand be strong there are a lot of people working to get you out of here th thanks angie helped emily wells to her feet and guided her over to where several others were dispensing rations griff saw that some of those approaching them from the left were among the group who had come at him earlier quickly he led angie away but not before she could reassuringly pat several people on the shoulder and help one older disoriented man find a bottle of water the soldier whose biosuit had been torn moved in and helped control the angry frustrated crowd youre doing fine maam he said to angie in response to her unasked question about him remember what i said griff implored her as they retreated from the hall dont get distracted there are so many of them thats only one of three rooms were going to do everything we can to help them ange but you wont be able to help anybody if they tear your suit like they did to that poor soldier back there now lets go see allaire what did you tell him that got him to bring me in they were led into the waiting area by the hard room i told him that you were here as a neutral party to document my movements our deal is that even if i dont come up with anything hell pardon me provided you report that i tried my best im not exactly a neutral party dr rhodes does he know about us our past i mean no i just told him that our paths had crossed before and that you have the knowledge and awareness i need in addition to a public approval rating that is probably higher than his so he doesnt know a thing griff glanced over at the soldiers and felt confident they were too far away to overhear them nope believe me hes got more important things to worry about at that moment the hard room wall glided open and president allaire stepped out he looked worn miss fletcher my pleasure he said extending his hand and then introducing her to gary salitas ive very much enjoyed your work over the yearsespecially as an md and something of a science nerd thank you sir are you still seeing that insurance lobbyist collins right bill collins angie paled at the notion that the president would know such personal details of her life we stoppedumdating several months ago how did you your friend dr rhodes there became a person of interest to our government when he started working on a topsecret virology project then nine months ago when he was videotaped stealing canisters of the virus that was eventually to get us into this mess he became a person of what we call extreme interest we know more about him than he probably knows about himself and as you are a wellknown media person associated with dr rhodes we made it a point of getting to know you too well now angie said realizing that allaire was issuing a thinly veiled warning to both her and griff i find that just a little unsettling please dont worry ms fletcher knowledge about the people were dealing with is what keeps our government strong the professionals who are paid to do this for us are very good at their jobs if we had to we could probably pull up what dr rhodes had for breakfast on the day of your last birthday which happens to be allaire checked a sheet of notes on the table in front of him may twentyninth we also know about your time together in africa as well as your visit a few years ago to see him on his boat in key largo you were researching a story and stayed the night i dont like this griff said feeling his face hot and flushed beneath his hood allaire leveled a steely gaze at him rhodes i frankly dont care what you like or dont like to me until you prove otherwise youre a terrorist who for whatever reason has placed your interests above your countrys do you think you could have just picked someone to report to us and we would blithely invite her in here we know enough about ms fletcher to trust that unlike you she is likely to place the needs and security of her country above her own am i wrong about that ms fletcher no sir angie said with firm conviction no youre not what i report back to you will be what is happening but i want to say again how unpleasant it feels to learn my life has been investigated to such an extent by my own government objection noted allaire said dismissively okay then dr rhodes i hope ive made my point about the measures i am willing to take in the interests of national security with that in mind i am giving you one warning and one warning only if you want to stay away from the inside of that cell at florence then dont fuck with me again chapter day pm est the only virus poisoning the capitol ursula ellis believed stood on two legs with his hands resting on the house of representatives lectern she glared down at jim allaire from her perch atop the tribune and felt her hatred for the man shift into overdrive looking away she made eye contact with leland gladstone who was already in position on the house chamber floor her aide gave her a discreet thumbsup sign she tried to suppress her smile a nod to gladstone was the signal that his message had been received soon enough ellis thought soon enough allaire ordered the three hundred people held captive inside the house chamber to retake their seats and ellis delighted in seeing how his usually unflappable demeanor had waned he looked gray and pinched the mood in the room was reflecting his plummeting popularity i promised you an update as soon as i had information to share allaire said through the pa system at this very moment there is a team of specialists on site who are experts in all facets of the virus we may have been exposed to a senator jumped to his feet you said may sir is there doubt that weve been exposed could this all be for nothing the question rattled allaire who fumbled with his words before correcting himself weve almost certainly been exposed to something he said the nature of the pathogen however is still in question cultures and other attempts at nailing down the germ are under way ellis silently applauded the representative from south dakota for asking what she herself had long been thinking allaire prattled on halftruths and outright lies the biocontainment suits you have seen are being used as a precaution allaire said in response to a specific question in addition to examining some of you this team of specialists will be taking blood samples those samples will be used to assist in determining a timetable for our release we have to be certain there is no widespread public health threat before we give the green light to evacuate the capitol in the meantime were working on removing seats to provide for more adequate sleeping arrangements also i know the lines to use the bathroom have been long so well be providing portable waste facilities as well what about contacting our families my cell phone is useless what in the hell did your people do and why the man stood on his seat waving his cell phone defiantly the crowd cheered until he was quickly subdued by two secret service agents who clearly had not been told that transmission had been blocked on those cell phones they hadnt already confiscated ursula watched with pleasure as the agents pried the device from the mans grasp the mood inside the capitol was worsening everybody wanted outeveryone except perhaps for ellis who needed allaire to keep the crowd imprisoned inside politics dictated that the more people felt oppressed the easier they would be to turn it was her duty to expose the truth about this man and allaires mounting paranoia played perfectly in her favor i understand youre very concerned about your families allaire was rambling on were working on that issue but its going to take some time rest assured my white house staff is getting word out to your families as i speak informing them of the situation and sharing my personal commitment that we will resolve this crisis as quickly and efficiently as possible soon youll be able to make calls yourself were working on setting up a phone bank and bringing in medications for those of you who need them for national security reasons there will be limits on the sort of information you can share ellis cringed this was america dammit not some backwater third world dictatorship allaires wife and daughter sat center to the president on the chamber floor gazing lovingly up at him ellis wondered what their expressions would be in another couple of minutes i know this isnt the update that you wanted allaire continued i know you were hopeful i would say that the crisis has passed and we can now all go it is my deepest regret to inform you that is not the case it was time leland gladstone stood and raised his hand elliss heartbeat responded to an adrenaline rush mr president gladstone called out i found medication belonging to senator harlan mackey in the bathroom i went to give it to him but could not find the senator here in the house chamber has he been relocated to another part of the capitol sir ellis held her breath she wondered what might happen to gladstone in the aftermath of what was soon to follow whatever allaire might to do her aide ellis would make it her first priority to undo yes senator mackey has been relocated allaire said you can provide the medication to my physician dr bethany townsend and shell see that he gets it oh good gladstone said so the video i have isnt of senator mackey ellis bristled from the same sense of pride she felt whenever her own gifted children excelled at something special allaire took a staggered step backward but soon regained his composure what video here ill show you gladstone hit the power on the digital projector he had hidden underneath his seat he had found the projector inside a locked cabinet in the press gallery precisely where ursula said it would be sean oneil had provided her with the key and gladstone found cables there to connect the machine to his blackberry the stiletto of light filled a portion of the house chambers side wall the grainy image was of the capitols east exit walkway at night what is this what is the meaning of this allaire thundered his face reddened gladstone bore in in the initial confusion after the outbreak i somehow ended up on the second floor of the capitol i was taking some video of this ordeal when well when this happened gladstone pointed toward the makeshift screen which now displayed footage of a man stepping into the frame the man took a few steps forward his back was turned to the camera but the moonlight and glow from streetlamps lining the walkway bathed him in a dim light those who knew mackey could easily match the build of the man in the video to that of the senator mackey took another step forward and then paused and swung around so that he was facing gladstones camera the focus wasnt sharp but some in the chamber gasped at the man they knew was mackey he called out something but there was no sound on the recording the blackberry camera angle tilted down to capture the man trying and failing to pull open the locked exit door stop this at once allaire cried out several secret service agents charged down the aisle toward gladstone mackey took a step forward and raised his hands to shield his face just as the agents reached gladstone and the projector mackeys head snapped back a spray of blood exploded from a lemonsized hole that materialized on the back of his skull the picture bounced wildly and then went dark the agents snatched the projector from gladstone then looked sheepishly at the president for guidance ursula ellis took that as her cue to act she leapt to her feet and reached for her microphone mr president her forceful voice boomed out i believe it is time for you to tell us the truth chapter day pm est james allaire and his advisors had absorbed a direct hit flanked by secret service agents he left the house chamber to a chorus of appalled cries from those who had watched the murder of harlan mackey through the microphone he had promised to provide a full explanation but his words were nearly drowned out the moment he got clear of the lectern he ordered sean oneil to detain both gladstone and ellis for questioning it was a decision gary salitas staunchly opposed youre going to divide the people into camps by doing that salitas warned and not just by party affiliation if you isolate ellis youre just going to give her that much more power allaire grumbled under his breath well what do you suggest i do gary salitas reaffirmed his loyalty by placing a gentle hand upon allaires shoulder i suggest we figure out a way to explain what that punk just broadcasted but tread lightly here jim ursula ellis is not someone to be underestimated allaire grudgingly rescinded his order then he bit back his anger at the house speaker and returned with his team to the hard room there were other pressing matters on which they needed to focus so what youre saying hank he said to the chief of the capitol police force is that youve rechecked the official attendance list for possible fraud tomlinson nodded i have sir and you found no anomalies nothing out of the ordinary thats correct tomlinson replied and the security cameras youre suggesting playback showed no suspicious activity inside the chamber prior to the start of my address again tomlinson nodded yes sir there was no suspicious activity whatsoever allaire gritted his teeth he felt his anger at tomlinson growing and drew in several calming breaths wrx could cause erratic behavior and even serious aggression was he just upset at tomlinsons lack of progress or was he experiencing a physiological change he shuddered at the possibility subtly he checked for telltale markings on his palm nothing what would he do if they suddenly showed up well where does that leave us hank he managed these arent phantoms were dealing with here these are real flesh and blood terrorists we need to know what vulnerability of ours they exploited it may be our best way of tracking them down my team is open to suggestions mr president tomlinson said we want to catch who did this as much as everyone here cameras monitoring the space outside the hard room picked up the arrival of griff and angie along with the six armed men accompanying them allaire motioned for salitas to let the group inside griff and angie entered each carrying a box of what allaire assumed would contain the collected blood samples a sea of blue biocontainment suits followed griff and angie into the secret room for several tense moments the hum of breathing apparatuses punctuated an otherwise silent gathering whats the status of c group allaire asked griff griff turned toward the president though griffs face was partially obscured by his suits visor and thick beard allaire could see the distress brewing in the mans eyes theyre starting to show signs of respiratory difficulty and disorientation griff said no fatalities to report but its still early and admiral jakes allaire asked hes not well none of them are thank you griff hesitated a moment then added i heard about what happened in the house chamber i heard about a video allaire raised his hand not now dr rhodes he said were trying to figure out how these terrorists got the virus inside the capitol in the first place you know this virus best any theories how it could have been done ive been trying to figure that out myself griff said i have to believe theres a connection between genesis obtaining wrx and my being framed for the theft griff paused there he and allaire held an uncomfortable stare for a moment before he continued as to how they pulled this off well i have no good theories at this time the president rose from his seat and turned his back to the room allaire stayed silent while his mind worked feverishly to concoct a plausible scenario then he spoke aloud uttering a latin phrase one his medical school professors often quoted res ipsa loquitur allaire said he repeated the phrase twice more once with his back to the room and again after turning around to face them all what are you saying mr president tomlinson asked there were other confused looks res ipsa loquitur is latin it means the thing speaks for itself allaire explained in malpractice lawsuits prosecuting attorneys who successfully argue res ipsa loquitur are guaranteed a significant payday you see our court of law is based upon the premise that were innocent until proven guilty res ipsa loquitur turns that premise on its head it says because something happened and normally that something shouldnt have happened you the accused are guilty of causing it to happen therefore you are guilty of malpractice res ipsa loquitur jordan lamar appeared even more confused im sorry mr president i dont see how that helps us allaire turned his back again and walked over to a threefoothigh black metal filing cabinet he opened the cabinet which was stocked with justincase office supplies it helps jordan allaire said reaching inside the cabinet because it means that the attack speaks for itself it happened thats the given just like an attorney can argue that the patient entered the operating room for a toe operation and left with one leg missing allaire stood up still with his back turned to the room tell me he said what did genesis do that speaks for itself allaire turned around and though he had reached for something inside the cabinet he held nothing in his hands he waited for somebody to speak bethany townsend finally responded genesis placed the vials of wrx inside the bags of select persons attending the state of the union address she said exactly doctor the president replied he stood in the center of the room his arms folded across his chest thats precisely what they did the thing speaks for itself with that allaire lowered his crossed arms a wooden ruler measuring one foot in length slid out from where he had hid it up the sleeve of his suit jacket the ruler clattered noisily on the wooden table before settling with the inch markers up there was no triumph in allaires expression hank i want a full accounting of your security personnel i am sure youll find that one of them is missing tomlinson still looked puzzled what are you suggesting sir he asked allaire was patient somebody working our security checkpoint wasnt looking for contraband being brought into the capitol he said he was using his post as a means of bringing the vials inside and inserting them into the bags as he was searching them tomlinson lit up as the new realization took hold on it right away mr president he said quickly the room emptied out griff was the last to leave nice going he said turning back at the doorway i would have every inch of this place swept for cameras these people have been preparing for this for a long time dr rhodes how do you think i should handle the mackey situation you sure you want the opinion of a terrorist doctor you and i are up against it enough without clawing at one another like this we need to call some sort of a truce griff studied the man who seemed to have aged years in just a few hours in that case griff said i would consider separating what you know from the customary rules of politics hard as it may be that means no more lying allaire held his gaze ill consider it he said finally chapter day am est despite his smoldering anger at being denied due process following his arrest in kalvesta griff grudgingly had to admit admiration for james allaires ability to remain composed in the face of monumental decisions some years ago griff had reviewed a journal article analyzing the nervous systems of professional tennis players the hypothesis of the paper was that given the normal rate of nerve conduction and the speed of a tennis serve the serve would have been in the screen behind the receiver before he could react and return it and yet return serve they didagain and again the conclusion of the researchers was that the speed of nerve conduction in the top players was some sort of anomalya mutation perhaps watching allaire operate wondering about the often historic consequences of his actions and decisions griff found himself speculating if the mans nervous system functioned differently than the physiologic normals of the world while those with normal decisionmaking processes were deciding what to do the president of the united states had already done it at allaires order a quiet but thorough search of the capitol had been conducted the sweep disclosed cameras concealed in every roomat least two dozen units in all but none in the hard room allaires counterattack began with architect jordan lamars casual brush past griff it took several seconds for griff to realize a note had been pressed into the palm of his glove all correspondence from me will come through lamar ja one by one each of the presidents team received instructions the hard room would be the only safe area for communications but that space was to be used only for emergencies cameras would either be dismantled or left on as decoys doc one of the early notes read we must assume genesis knows who you are and why weve brought you here you are now a constant threat to them stay away from the house subway line until we tell you thats going to be your way out of here and back to your lab ja griff felt his stomach drop he had entered the capitol complex fearing and not trusting the president now it appeared he was the target of genesis as well not safe he wrote back no decon zone risk outside exposure help us make it safe many lives at stake military will help ja a team headed by salitas discovered six cameras expertly concealed inside smoke detectors in the hallway outside the subway the stateoftheart video equipment was providing a window into the supply delivery route running from the underground entrance into the capitol complex allaire ordered half of the cameras inactivated and the rest redirected and left in place none of them was to be in a position to record any unusual increase in activity the cameras were not the only discovery made during the next few hours hank tomlinson had been unable to locate one of his officers a fiveyear veteran of the capitol police force named peter tannen tannen had been assigned security detail at the breached checkpoint and was now assumed to be a part of genesis the fbi was dissecting the mans life with the intensity of their investigation suspicion already was that he might no longer be among the living griff and angie slipped into the subway tunnel their mission was to get out of the capitol and back to the lab at kalvesta griff glanced over at a nearby wallmounted clock and made a mental note of the time following the initial exposure twentyeight hours in another fortyeight the first fatalities might be reported he did not need a clock to tell him that the deaths would continue until there was nobody left in the capitol to die the military team with him was special forces trained to be first responders following a bioterrorist attack before the operation got under way griff briefed the group on the dangers of wrx were used to working with anthrax one of the operatives said at the conclusion of griffs brief presentation this shouldnt be that different if you get infected with wrx youll wish it were anthrax be careful but work as rapidly as you can two hours later the team leader for the special ops unit approached griff in her blue biocontainment suit he could see through her visor that like himself she was drenched in sweat were ready for your inspection she said whoever that angie is shes a hell of a worker i know they were well ahead of the timetable good enough he said nodding his approval of what was really impressive work in amazingly little time the special ops team had created a reasonably safe fully functional decontamination zone between the house side of the capitol and the subway line connecting the complex to nearby office buildings he overheard one of the soldiers say that they had just built a doorway between life and death time to head for kalvesta he wrote to allaire a lot of people are counting on you the presidents return note read dont let us down angie materialized beside him howd we do she asked the special ops people want to adopt you thanks they were ready to walk through fire for you more and more youre reminding me of that cowboy in kenya that i took such a shine to her eyes seemed to light up the space behind her visor are you ready to decontaminate he asked are we ready to go as soon as allaire says we are lead the way simple griff said first were going to take an ultraviolet bath he pointed to an area that contained several large saucer lights mounted on tall metal stands the lights were plugged into a running generator what will they do angie asked kill any virus still clinging to our suit from there well shuffle into the portable airlock griff gestured toward the clear plastic cube erected beside the entranceway separating the capitol from the subway line wont bad air get out when we go in the airlock is negative pressurized griff said so that poisoned air from the capitol wont leak out into the tunnel and whos gonna drive the train the system here uses a driverless car to shuttle members of congress and their guests between the capitol and the rayburn building griff said one less person to decontaminate are you going to be the first through no you are griff said why me well all the women are going first whys that after the light bath youre going to take a chemical shower then youll need to strip naked there will be a change of clothes waiting for you on the train youll put your biocontainment suit in the red toxic waste bags provided and leave them on the capitol side of the airlock you couldnt set up a divider huh angie said i told the team that to save time wed just turn our backs anything for our country angie squeezed his hand and left to join a group of three women at the ultraviolet bath station chapter day am est griff was the last person to pass through the airlock he came through naked but rather than feel selfconscious his thoughts were keyed on the seven hundred people imprisoned in the building he was leaving this was already hell for many of them it was going to get much worse he reflected on the remorselessness of genesis whoever they were death at power stations in new york death in a museum in san diego death in a public garden in dc and now death on a truly grand scale his own passions ran deep in many areas but none were even close to being intense enough to kill for he could intellectualize terrorism but he had never really been able to understand it and now he had been placed squarely in the path of the extremists to whom cause was everything and killing was nothing even if he somehow managed to survive even if it all came together for him in kalvesta genesis might be damaged but their hatred and their cause would endure they would come up with something else some new demonstration of their commitment and resolve to accomplishto accomplish what and along the way more people would die the best he could hope for was to stay alive and try to disrupt their plan this time griff stepped onto the waiting train and angie facing away handed him a towel and a set of hospital scrubs were going to have to get some meat back on those bones doc you peeked well i did yoga and calisthenics almost every day while i was locked up in solitary but i guess my equation for staying in shape was missing useful nutrition when we get to kansas ill handle the cooking for the past few years ive been on a chinese kick youll love it theres more calories in those bean sprouts than you think there were times when i considered chowing down on one of the guards ugh she made room for him on the bench next to her and instantly he felt stirred by her closeness griff tell me something she said given the status of your research when they arrested you do you think you can do this i was getting pretty close to something useful that may be why they came after me but at best what were facing is a long shot ive been running through some hypothetical figures while i was waiting for the shower i came up with a two percent chance of solving the design problems that were there when the militia came and hauled me away two percent doesnt sound like much okay make it three ill be restarting cultures from the blood samples in those containers in addition allaire said he was having a line of the virus flown up from the cdc where they have it in storage when you come up with something im going to have one hell of a story when you get started beefing me up with your cooking be sure to stir in some of your optimism the team was relieved to be free from the biocontainment suitsespecially it appeared to griff those who finally got to cradle their assault weapons in ungloved hands were ready to roll sergeant stafford radioed in moments later the fiberoptic backbone controlling the automatic vehicle operation engaged and the fully enclosed trolley moved silently ahead the car came to a gentle stop at the rayburn building subway station and the doors swooshed open ive never been to kansas angie said just imagine lake victoria in kenya and the lush jungle surrounding it and the cries of countless wild beasts and then flip the scene over to the reverse side stafford and the other soldiers surrounded griff and angie and led them through a maze of corridors and stairwells on their way to the surface once outside griff took a grateful breath of the cool early morning air and held it until he needed to exhale the capitol was to the north of them now even from a distance griff could tell that the crowd levels outside the barriers had increased substantially as had the military presence maintaining some semblance of order there were three tenperson vans waiting with their engines running the vans had black tinted windows and griff assumed they were bulletproof too how many are coming with us griff asked stafford eight thats a lot of vans for eight people two are decoys lets go move it the side doors to one of the vans slid open and griff and angie were the first inside one of the soldiers carelessly swung griff one of the refrigerated cases containing the blood samples easy with that griff admonished the man unless you want to be responsible for finding out just how dangerous these bugs really are the solider just grunted and continued loading gear into the van there was heat in the van but not enough to enable griff and angie to remove their camouflage field jackets angie slid in beside griff and pressed her body against his he took hold of her hand she glanced at him curiously but made no attempt to pull away i heard allaire mention something about a second team working in tandem she said is that true were not exactly working in an atmosphere of mutual trust as the guardians here will attest theres a bio level four facility in alaska someplace allaire has enlisted my assistant mel forbush to set up a datasharing network between us as long as they dont slow me down it wont be an issue thank you for asking them to send me with you i dont trust allaire to keep his word and he doesnt trust me not to bolt youre like the proctor the last soldier stepped inside and the van door slammed shut stafford sat in the front passenger seat his radio pressed to his lips were moving stafford said launch the birds he lifted a pair of highpowered nightvision binoculars to his face griff felt suddenly edgy whats going on he asked angie seemed to sense it too her grip on his hand tightened stafford passed the binoculars back what am i looking for angie asked the doctors decoy stafford said my what griff hes right angie said as she fiddled with the focus theres a man thin bearded i can just make him out getting into a helicopter what are you talking about the driver shifted the van into gear and the quick acceleration pushed griff back into his seat they were headed toward canal street the two other vans split off and headed in opposite directions on c street griff stiffened he did not need binoculars to see the black silhouette of the chopper rising above the treetops after takeoff stafford what in the hell is going on presidents order stafford said we use this protocol or something like it to protect him now its been instituted to protect you when it comes to saving the country we dont leave things to chance barely able to breathe griff kept his gaze locked on the helicopter as it grew smaller on the horizon suddenly a trail of fire burst into view seemingly from out of nowhere and began to chase the climbing chopper god no griff whispered no he screamed the word there was an explosion and a patch of dark morning sky erupted into a bright ball of fire the van shook from the force of the explosion griff watched through the window as fiery pieces from the helicopter fell to earth like meteorites chapter day am est griff stared at the contrails of black smoke streaking the spotlit sky jim allaire and his advisors had created a decoy of him and now that man was dead i want to speak to the president griff demanded now stafford did not bother to turn around nor did he respond to the request griff rose from his seat pushed past angie and yanked open the vans side door they were traveling at forty miles per hour along empty roads that police cars and motorcycles had cleared of traffic cold air swept into the cabin other armored vehicles had joined in their procession including an ambulance and a usss electronic countermeasures suburban which was following several car lengths behind sergeant the driver called out to stafford keep driving chad stafford said drawing his sidearm and turning in his seat griff what are you doing angie shouted griff was clinging to the frame of the open door barely able to fight the rush of air get the president on that radio now he screamed he held on his body partway outside the moving van his long tangled hair snapped about like an unfettered sail in high winds get back inside the van this instant thats an order stafford commanded one of the soldiers scrambled over angie and grabbed griff by the collar but the husky young man was lacking the leverage to pull him back inside get me the president on that radio or i swear to you ill jump stafford motioned the driver to slow dont slow the van down griff yelled out dont do anything but get me allaire on that goddamn radio okay okay pal stafford said just pull it together and come back inside that was a tough one none of us expected it ill get you the president griff allowed angie and two of the soldiers to haul him back to his seat he was hyperventilating and shaking the van pulled to the curb and stopped stafford turned back until his face and griffs were inches apart he had holstered his sidearm the president considers you an enemy of the united states he said i have orders to kill you if you try to escape dont give me the pleasure griff snatched the radio away there was a brief silence followed by a burst of static what is it rhodes james allaire snapped nobody told me you were sending a double out like that because thats not your concern that man and and the pilot just died because people thought it was me two pilots the president corrected did you think this is some sort of game rhodes i cant stand the killing you set them up to die you knew what was going to happen correction we suspected thats why we left some of genesiss monitors in placeso we could feed them whatever information we wanted them to have i dont believe this now pull yourself together rhodes youre not the only one appalled by death we all are you have your job to do we have ours do you want to come back here and watch seven hundred more people die do you no well then never forget that these people were up against are resourceful and well financed enough to pull a missile out of the trunk of their car and shoot down a helicopter the war on terrorism is just that a war because its a war people die we didnt choose our enemy here they chose us our only hope is that the casualties our people sustain will ultimately have some meaning right now whether or not that happens whether or not there is meaning to those deaths depends on you is that clear if your plan is to sacrifice more people to keep me alive count me out regardless of what you think or why you had me thrown into prison im just not in the business of killing thats why those men and women are there along with you now you have your job to do i suggest you keep your concerns limited to that the connection went dead griff sank back into his seat the van accelerated angie set her hand on his knee they have no way of knowing the number of lives youve saved she said softly or the personal risks youve taken to do it but that was my life at stake and my choice to risk it griff turned away and stared out the window the men in that chopper made their choice as well stafford said and what did sacrificing their lives accomplish griff asked clearly genesis knows who i am and they probably know where im going so what did giving up those men accomplish stafford turned to him you really dont know enlighten me genesis isnt after you anymore rhodes thanks to those men and their heroism the enemy thinks youre dead now you damn well better pull it together and do your part chapter day am est hey buddy can you spare some change the panhandler had set up camp on the front steps of the ss trading co matt fink had to suppress the urge to kick him across the street instead he tossed a dollar onto the urinesoaked blanket that was probably helping to keep the grizzled old man from freezing to death ive had a good day fink said hands on hips and im feeling generous but if you dont take your lazy begging ass somewhere else ill crush your windpipe and watch you drown in your own blood grinning the giant watched as the beggar wheeled away his rusted shopping cart then he used an electronic key to unlock the massive steel sliding door that concealed the electronic center and warehouse of genesis his eyesight adjusted to the dim interior alex ramirez his bodybuilders shoulders bulging beneath a cutoff sweatshirt sat in front of the bank of monitors most of the screens were black so how many cameras do you figure they got fink asked they missed a few but i think theyre still looking mens room actually two in the mens rooms and the two in the ladies rooms are still operational i told you theyd be among the last to go fink guessed that percent of the cameras ramirez and his workmen had installed over the two months leading up to the state of the union address had been discovered by the increasing surveillance sweeps and had been rendered inoperative it had been finks idea to place equipment inside the washrooms a brainstorm that netted them some serious dividends not only were those units still operational the conversations they recorded provided the intelligence that cain had used to order the missile strike fink had done the rest i wanted that shot ramirez said as if reading his mind ah it was a thing of beauty my friend absolute perfection i promise you the next one whatever it may be meanwhile get me cain where are the others still disassembling the pickup out back one shot one hit now thats what i call perfection you think anyone saw the launch doubtful by the time the bird was in the air i was back under the tarp we drove along business as usual the streets were largely empty too everybody is either outside the capitol or home watching it on tv im holding you to your promise fink one of these other jerks can work the monitors i need some action for emphasis ramirez reached down beside his chair and hoisted a fiftypound dumbbell half a dozen times ill make sure cain knows fink said this little success should have him pleased as punch it does cains voice crackled from the wallmounted speakers ah cain old sport good to hear your voice fink considered elaborating on the complexity of what he had done especially given the short lead time to plan but he knew cain would have been unimpressed he had worked for the man long enough to know that success was an expectation did you have strong visual of the target cain asked dead on fink said beard thin hes the bloke we saw arrive in the marine chopper all right heavily guarded too right until he entered the helicopter then he got aboard alone and the bird carrying him lifted off from the south lawn just as you told us it would we were in position prior to liftoff and engaged without incident nice work cain replied that man had the potential to be a serious fly in the ointment fink chuckled you pay for the best you get the best we have a couple more pieces of business on our plate the first of them involves our inside man from the capitol his names tannen the president knows now that he was working for us none of this would have been possible without him thats true cain said but now im afraid hes become something of a liability funny coincidence fink said punching his cohort on the deltoid señor ramirez here was just telling me hes starved for action in that case you guys work something out tannens stashed in a motel six south of alexandria hes expecting a ride west he has a place in the smokies and a cousin there whos going to help get him out of the country youll both split tannens share once hes dealt with sweet ramirez said no hill without gravestones no valley without shadows fink said quoting a south african proverb he had learned from his father you said there were other pieces of business its time we moved to phase two and let the president know what our demands are in exchange for a truce and maybe even the treatment for that virus i thought there was no treatment for that virus as long as allaire believes there might be were in a good position and now thanks to that shot of yours his options have been greatly reduced in fact i believe that at the moment were now the only hope he has if theres anything we can do to get those demands to them just say the word well as a matter of fact there might be before the cameras and listening devices went dead ramirez there picked up enough chatter to know that the chaos inside the capitol is increasing he also sent me enough audio and video segments so that we are certain president allaire has picked himself up an enemya serious powerful enemy who is bent on bringing him down once you two have taken care of that business at the motel six get back to me were putting together a package that weve decided to get to that person from what youve seen do you think you could get close enough to send it inside the capitol i believe so fink said right now the chaos inside the building cant be any worse than the chaos we encountered outside thats all we need excellent the package should be waiting when you and ramirez get back from virginia mind if i inquire who the package is for fink asked for several seconds there was silence the mercenary feared he might have overstepped his bounds cain paid his salary and those of his men but the man made it clear at the outset that genesis would share information only on a needtoknow basis and would respond harshly to any employee who questioned them well cain replied finally youve done well by us fink and you too ramirez our new allytobe and spokesperson provided we can get her to cooperate will be ursula ellis the speaker of the house quite a looker that one fink said i know exactly who she is chapter day pm cst the corrugated steel hangar was carefully constructed to conceal the entrance to the kalvesta biosafety level facility in one of its previous incarnations the massive quonsetstyle structure had been part of an air force training center the government left behind the skeletons of a few decommissioned aircraft to convince any trespassers who snuck by the small security contingent that the facility contained nothing of any great interest griff and angie walked briskly across the hardbaked clay and gazed at the newly installed chainlink fencing the perimeter was guarded by a team of heavily armed military personnelthe third such security checkpoint through which they had passed the setup was nothing like the sleepy installation where less than a year ago griff and the rest of the veritas team had sought to establish a biologic pathway into the will center of the human brain how in heaven could genesis have snuck the virus past all these guards angie asked they couldnt is my guess griff replied but back before my arrest there wasnt this level of security in place in fact there was hardly any security at all he pointed past stafford and his squad to a squat concrete building that stood in close proximity to the hangar that was our topside security we had one guard on duty at all times and there was a collection of sophisticated electronic monitoring inside but that was it so at least now were safe i think these troops are here as much to keep track of us and to keep us penned in as to keep anyone from getting at us especially now that genesis thinks youre dead griff assured himself that there was no levity in angies remark and then nodded at some point he had vowed he would learn about the men who had given their lives to foster the deception that he was dead perhaps their families could use some help anxious to sever the connection to his decoy griff used up an hour of the flight to kalvesta cutting off his beard and then shaving his face clean now the wintry afternoon breeze felt strange on his skin angie had given the transformation her approval still handsome after all these years she said as the pair neared the hangar several of the soldiers standing guard tensed the army corporal in charge stepped forward and introduced himself first to griff next to angie and last to stafford and his men do you know where melvin forbush is griff asked the man i was told that hed meet us topside forbush has sent up word he will meet you in the lab sir hes been below ground since we arrived here we havent even seen him yet griff laughed and angie gave him a puzzled look melvin is as good a microbiologist as youll ever find he explained but he is also how should i put it a little eccentric oh i love eccentricat least i usually do will i love melvin i suspect you might i do hes an absolute fanatic about his work but hes even more of a nut about hollywood melvin is inevitably only one of two placesworking on his equipment or watching movies im not surprised he hasnt been above ground listen corporal i know my way around and also the biosecurity protocols sergeant stafford and his men will wait around here they worry about us so you can assure them that this is the only way in and the only way out of the lab before stafford had the chance to respond the corporal nodded toward the security guard the razorwire gate slid open on a track and griff and angie entered the hangar a building about the size of two football fields set side by side the ground beneath the arcing metal was hardpacked dirt frozen solid by the kansas winter however where once the hangar was a huge nearly empty shell now it was filled with military vehicleshumvee battle buggies jeeps transports two ambulances and a tanker the trucks were parked in rows along the hangar walls and two more vehicles pulled in through the rear entrance while they were watching i guess allaires taking this all pretty seriously angie understated impending death has a way of spurring people to action kalvestas dramatic busy transformation was ironic given the size of the microbe at the center of it all when griff first arrived from new york with the team from sylvia chens lab the bl facility had been a tawdry oasis in the high plains desert consisting of a dozen or so bungalows spaced along some illdefined dirt streets a rutted landing strip and a dilapidated basketball court of course the real story of the place lay in the gleaming laboratory far below the surface the ingress to the lab was unchanged since griffs forced departure mounted on the wall beside the hangar entrance was a kronos time clock the corporal swiped his security card through the clocks reader slot instantly a rustspeckled cessna t tweety bird secured by wheel chocks and parked in the center of the space began to move the aircraft once a trainer for the usaf glided aside along with the perfectly camouflaged ground beneath it to reveal a flight of circular steel stairs that descended fifty or sixty feet to a grated metal landing and elevator bay impressive angie said only the beginning griff replied on the way down to the landing their footsteps echoed off the polished steel walls the elevator was small griffs stomach knotted up the way it did whenever he was inside the claustrophobic atmosphere of what he used to refer to as a human incubator in his world of killer germs a healthy fear was a vital tool for staying alert and therefore alive the elevator traveled slowly the foot journey down took thirty seconds they exited into a long fluorescentlit corridor with a sevenfoot ceiling the hum of powerful airconditioning and purification units echoed throughout the space the smooth whitewashed concrete walls were unadorned save for several framed safety posters each a reminder that death was never farther away than a moment of inattentiveness at the end of the corridor was a closed steel door painted fire engine red and stenciled security checkpoint one in white lettering there was a sixinch wiremesh porthole in the center to one side another sign warned that the door was alarmed and that access through it required authenticated biometric scans how many of these checkpoints are there angie asked three or four depending on what you count theres this one which leads to several cool zones including offices and our library down the hallway beyond another doorway things get serious theres a pair of parallel secure portals leading to the kitchen the kitchen our cheery name for the wrx laboratory suites and tissue culture incubators where the beasties get cooked up exactly one floor below the kitchen on the very bottom level of the facility also secured off by one or two doors is what i call hells kitchensylvia chens animal lab twenty or so monkeys and some cats i almost never went near the place because i hated it so much and because none of my research involved her animals but the space is empty now i assume if its not then hell would not be a strong enough word angie pointed in the direction of a security camera fastened to the ceiling above a hand and retinal scanner is that the camera they used to film you stealing the virus she asked griff nodded one of them there are stateoftheart security cameras throughout this place dont ask me how they got footage of me though because i havent got a clue will the system let me in the security system requires identification to enter and to leave the lab but melvin is a superstickler for details so hell probably unlock the door from the inside and then get us passes look there he is oh one warninghe hates being called anything other than melvin griff motioned to the porthole beyond it angie saw a tallvery tall actuallygangly man in a kneelength lab coat advancing toward them there were no more than six inches between his unruly mop of auburn hair and the ceiling melvin completed his biometric scans and the door separating them opened with a loud click at six foot six or so the virologist had to hunch to pass beneath the metal threshold without hitting his head he was cleanshaven with rounded childlike features and thick tortoiseshell spectacles i once suggested that melvin try growing a mustache just to make him look a little more professorial griff told angie his response was that unless he could grow the exact one that daniel day lewis had as bill the butcher in the gangs of new york it was simply not worth the effort i might call that eccentric hes also a bit unpredictable a mastery of social skills has never been one of his strengths typically even though he and griff had worked shoulder to shoulder for years forbush did not open his arms for a welcoming embrace instead he offered a somewhat tepid handshake good to see you my friend griff said id like you to meet angela fletcher shes a reporter from the washington post here to write about our efforts forbush took hold of angies outstretched hand but rather than shake it he rotated her wrist in various directions carefully studying it nicole kidman he said finally narrow hands long fingers i can show you some stills from her films and youll see that your hands and hers are a near perfect match angie laughed thanks melvin shes one of my favorites especially in moulin rouge and to die for she was nominated for an academy award for that yes actually no she won an oscar in for the hours sorry dont be i know a lot about the movies so if someone gets something wrong i just tell them then if they keep thinking theyre right i just show them film can be doctored but it really doesnt lie so if i say im right i always am he handed out specially coded access cards so are you two ready to create your biometric profiles i already have one griff said no you dont right after they took you away everything that said you existed vanished then dr chen disappeared not long after that but you stayed the truth is i didnt have anyplace to go you and dr chen were the only ones who could have written a recommendation for me believe it or not in the past prospective employers have thought i was strange griff set his hand around the taller mans shoulders your kind of strange is a good kind of strange melvin im glad to see you again after it was clear neither you nor dr chen was coming back sam her animal guy and i sold her animals to other labs and sam got a job with one of them then i just cleaned up and accepted the governments invitation to stay around i just now found out where youve been no one would ever tell me all they would say was that you had stolen wrx i knew that wasnt possible well ill tell you it wasnt pleasant either the president had me thrown into solitary confinement at a federal prison in colorado now he wants you out here working again go figure you have the spirit to fight back but the good sense to control it forbush said your eyes are full of hate thats good hate keeps a man alive it gives him strength im not even going to try and guess what movie thats from griff said benhur actually jack hawkins playing the slave master quintus arrius melvin youre amazing angie said glad you think so ms angela this man here understood me hes the best im sort of figuring that out how anybody could think he was guilty of stealing our virus is beyond me i tried to tell them that it was impossible but nobody would listen what was impossible griff asked his interest suddenly peaked you being the one to steal the wrx cultures i told dr chen and the others why it never could have happened the way they said i even showed her proof that it wasnt you but she didnt do anything about it then when she disappeared so did anybody i could raise the issue to i dont understand melvin griff said what do you mean you showed her that it wasnt me just what i said i brought her to my theater and showed her why i know you didnt steal the virus well everybody thinks that i did i realize that knowing im a good guy is enough to convince you it couldnt have been me but you cant show somebody a persons character thats true forbush said with a wry grin but i can show them the film and like i said film can be doctored but it doesnt lie chapter day pm cst after all they had been through griff was obsessed with the need to reopen his lab and get to work but there was no way he could put off seeing exactly what evidence forbush believed he had he felt sickened by the notion that his friend had tried unsuccessfully to convince people that he had been framed but he wasnt surprised had the president simply not cared or were the people who had set him up that good hate keeps a man alive it gives him strength as forbush led him and angie down the passageway to the lounge area griff felt his bitterness and anger grow how deep did the conspiracy to get him away from veritas go if allaire was in any way involved he had better hope that griff never found out forbush had his choice of bungalows outside the hangar but it seemed as if he spent little time in any of them instead he had converted two small underground offices into a sleeping area and a rather sophisticated movie theater outfitted with five stadium seats and an antique popcorn machine the seventyinch movie screen dvd player and stateoftheart home theater projector were as forbush put it enlightened gifts from the united states government you mean they bought this stuff for you griff asked well define bought i filled out some paperwork and marked certain items as research materials it took some time but ultimately they shipped me exactly what i ordered and when i leave government service uncle sam will get to watch movies and make popcorn the pork barrel cinema angie said we should have a marquee made up just dont put a photo of it in your newspaper so do you want me to pop up some buttered corn or do you just want to see what i have i cant believe this griff said slumping into one of the chairs in the front row nine months in a goddamn cell be tough angie said what goes around comes around forbush extracted a video from the middle of an entire wall of hundreds of carefully aligned video and dvd cases then he held up the cover gaslight have you seen it i know the word griff said its a verb and it means to sabotage someones life to make them think theyre going nuts and this is where that word came from ingrid bergman won the best actress oscar in playing the naïve singer charles boyer sets out to drive crazy its about things not being as they look on the surface he extracted the tape from the case i give you the surveillance video from security cameras twenty through twentyfour it was never nominated for a oscar but it could have beenfor best special effects does it say why they chose me for the leading role griff asked glumly no i cant explain why they picked you forbush said but i think i have a good idea who played you he worked his way around to the projector and queued up the video angie locked her fingers in griffs as an image of the lab appeared on the wide white screen ive spliced a couple of camera views together forbush said the timings in the lower right nine months griff was thinking nine months of my life gone images of the sadistic florence penitentiary guards flashed strobelike through his mind at the bottom of the surveillance footage was the fuzzy lettering of a date and time marker that indicated the recorded events occurred some nine and a quarter months ago at a few minutes past midnight since this is a silent film ill provide the narration forbush offered from his seat behind them and to the right for ms angies benefit what were looking at here is footage from the wrx culture lab actually melvin griff said ms angie knows this stuff shes written pieces about hot zone virology including a couple about me angie stood up and pointed to a large cabinet on the right side of the scene whats this she asked thats one of the biosafety cabinets we use to work with hot agents forbush answered no i know that i mean this incubator or whatever it is next to it forbush sounded genuinely impressed thats big bertha we custom built her to mimic a human host in various stages of wrx infectionbody temperature natural defenses that sort of thing so youve got virus growing in some sort of nutrient bath incubating in a way that simulates the host organisms response amazing well griff said when your boss is the president and youve got dr sylvia chen running the show research expense is never a big concern okay audience forbush broke in in our next scene youll see griff enter the lab security access logs will document that it was him even though it wasnt how did you get this melvin griff asked we dont archive surveillance video after i learned about your arrest i archived the footage myself forbush explained i wanted to see with my own eyes what they said youd done it wasnt until i watched it on the big screen twenty or so times that i figured out what was wrong the video showed an empty lab for two more minutes before someone dressed in a white biocontainment suit entered the frame the suit was bloated from air pumped through an attached yellow hose that descended from the ceiling the intruder moved like neil armstrong on the moon now with his back to the camera we cant tell who this is the only clue that its griff is the canvas bag hes carrying thats my bag all right griff said but thats not me in ten seconds you might think otherwise forbush replied as soon as the tenth second ticked past the suited person turned and faced the camera directly griff and angie uttered gasps of astonishment it was easy to see griffs face through the hoods clear plastic front shield if this was a double it was a perfect one how in the hell did they do that griff asked how did james cameron make all those beautiful tall sexy blue navi in avatar how do you and i manage to recreate human rna out of thin air mesmerized they watched as griff carefully removed tissue cultures of wrx from the incubator and placed them inside six seamless aluminum canisters those canisters are custom designed to permit safe transport of cultured virus from one lab suite to another griff explained we can sterilize the outsides without harming the virus for the first few viewings i wondered why you didnt do anything to disable the cameras forbush said then i realized you didnt have to it would be perfectly normal for you to make this specimen transfer the next sequence cut to griff still carrying the black canvas bag but now dressed in his street clothes and on his way out of the lab he traveled through a maze of concrete corridors before he came to a stop at security checkpoint two the video showed him place his hand upon the biometric scanner and ended when he opened the security door to exit is that it griff turned to melvin and asked i thought you said you had proof you show that in a court of law and im gone for good what do you mean forbush asked that is proof proof positive griff and angie exchanged bewildered looks i dont get it griff said an edge of irritation in his voice what youre telling me you didnt see that look again forbush reran the last minute of footage he froze the frame just as griff set his hand on the wallmounted biometric scanner i still didnt see anything griff said forbush sighed do you know that there are people like me who live for finding goofs in film and trust me when i say theres not a movie without them hollywood even hires continuity specialists to make sure that if a character is wearing a hat in one shot shes got the same hat on the same way if theres a change in the camera angle so you found a goof that clears me more than a goof he said look at the screen where i froze it what do you see my hand on the scanner griff replied which hand melvin asked him my left griff said it happened so fast i wasnt even looking for it youre righthanded thats your primary hand thats the hand your security profile was built from the scanner is set up so that either hand can be placed in the indentation in other words it has two thumbs since the mold is to the left of the door a lefthander would just set hisor herleft hand in place but a righthander would have to step across the indentation to set their hand in it we each scan one and only one hand when we are creating our security profileour dominant hand you couldnt have possibly exited through that checkpoint using a lefthand scan which means it wasnt griff carrying that bag angie finished for him no but it was somebody forbush continued whoever did this probably used other security footage of griff to cobble together a perfect digital forgery its really flawless well except for that one little gaffe and you showed this to sylvia griff asked oh yeah i showed her i didnt come right out and confront her though confront her about what angie asked sylvia chens biometric profile shes one of the three lefthanded primaries that we have in the system i would bet the thief was her maybe thats why she disappeared griff said the president told me that at one point there were dozens of fbi agentsi think he actually said hundredsout looking for her maybe its worth trying some more angie said does sylvia have an office down in the lab forbush nodded wed have to suit up but i can take you in there a couple of agents have already searched there though if neither of them were women we ought to look again why most women have a special talent built onto their x chromosomes the talent to find things if we want to find out whos behind genesis that office is the first place we should look chapter day pm cst griff had gone ahead to get his lab operational and had left angie and forbush to get started in sylvia chens office angie held her security card up to the reader and the red light above the palm scanner turned green standing off to one side forbush next had her set her hand on the opaque plate that initiated the biometric scan sequence as she was waiting for approval angie suddenly found herself imagining sylvia chen approaching the door from the other side carrying griffs canvas bag and knowing that she was setting up an innocent man who had been her friend and coworker for years prison possibly torture the woman had to have known angie thought she had to have known what was in store for griff who paid her to do it why where had she disappeared to a sweet computerized voice announced biometric scan approved for angela jane fletcher guest pass sevenohseven security level alpha hotel alpha please proceed to iris scan angie set her chin in place and readied herself who supplies all this equipment anyway she asked through clenched teeth the scan failed and a loud warning buzz followed please clear the optical scanner and try again the voice demanded you cant talk during a scan forbush said the algorithms that handle the matching are very precise keep your chin pressed in and your head as still as possible sorry angie repositioned herself the equipment comes from different vendors forbush explained staghorn security from indiana handles the ordering and then puts the system together and installs it if every one of the companies dealing with the government were as efficient and detailoriented as staghorn half the national debt would probably vanish those guys know what theyre doing and they know how to do it this time the scan worked and angie lifted her chin from the cup what about the cameras she asked those came from staghorn also maybe we should talk to them if they know the equipment inside and out perhaps theyll have some idea how genesis and sylvia managed to pull off the scam the computer graphics dont seem like they would be that easy to do if you know how you know how forbush replied matteroffactly griff is in his lab right now after we go to sylvias office maybe hell show you what he does in that arena you really care about him dont you i trust him if thats what you mean hes genuinely concerned about people i suppose youve already picked up on the fact that sometimes i have trouble um getting along with others he and i have never had one disagreement forbush considered his words for a moment then added quite seriously even though im smarter angie waited on the other side of the door for the man then headed down the corridor toward the cool zone of offices and beyond that the kitchen data transferred wirelessly to a computer chip automatically unlocked the next secure metal door with a loud click do you know the staghorn folks melvin ive done some work with them nice people smart anxious to please i would imagine that sometimes youre not so pleaseable you imagine correctly as they approached the hot zone changing area angie sensed an increase in the tightness in her chest in spite of herself she was beginning to panic they were two hundred feet underground approaching the area where less than a year ago dreadfully powerful microbes were being developed including a virtually invisible germ that would soon begin killing scores of people in the capitol is there any living virus left down here you mean in the kitchen i suppose its possible we dont take any chances besides griff has those blood samples from washington hes suited up working on them now to reestablish tissue culture lines the band around angies chest grew stronger her breathing felt strained i need a minute melvin she said dont be embarrassed we all feel claustrophobic and endangered from time to time down here especially when we stop to think about how few particles of wrx it would take to kill us that makes me feel much better good forbush said clearly missing her sarcasm you said you wanted to start with dr chens lab office youre going to have to suit up ive done that before so you know that breathing in the suit takes some getting used to yes the air can feel like molasses at first i understand and well have to talk real loud to be heard over the air compressors melvin lets go change on the other side of the lockers then go through the security door ill meet you in the kitchen this is the door to the locker room once you pass into the first staging area the light above the locker room door will turn green willing herself to calm down angie pulled on the door handle it was difficult to open negative pressure forbush said helps keep any loose virus particles from before forbush could finish the explanation angie clenched her teeth yanked the heavy door open and stepped inside dont forget to remove all jewelry forbushs voice continued through a speaker on the wall and remember to tape your wrists and ankles this is a little like the lab in michael crichtons the andromeda strain but not exactly arthur hill played dr jeremy stone in that one one of my favorites hes canadian not dr stone but arthur hill several years before angie had written a threepart story on the autism spectrum disorder called asperger syndrome unless her research was way off base melvin forbush was a poster child for the neurological condition delightful but at times exasperating she had written often brilliant yet frequently unaware or out of step obsessed with details provided they are interested in the subject he and i have not had one disagreement forbush had said about griff it was another tribute to the man already hard at work in the lab ahead of herthe man charged with saving the lives of the president of the united states and seven hundred others angie had never fallen in love with the same man twice now she found herself wondering twenty minutes later she was ready dressed in a biocontainment suit she exited the locker room and entered the next staging area which glowed purple from ultraviolet lights finally she entered the airlock to await her guide the rush of air after she connected her hose was initially like going ninety in a convertible with the top down are you doing okay he asked im fine this is what my brain feels like most of the time i sort of like the rush as angie waited once again her thoughts focused on sylvia chen griff had given her a capsule summary of the woman and her life born in china and brought to the us by her mother at a young age now speaks with minimal or no accent no mention of her father graduated from yale at twenty phd from columbia at twentysix tenured by age thirtyeight briefly married no children tireless researcher driven by ambition passed over for what would have made her the youngest department chief at columbia and so took her research on wrx to the government author of literally hundreds of books articles and scientific papers the antigriff in terms of her belief in the importance of using animals for her researchprimarily chimpanzees or other smaller primates nevertheless she had great belief and trust in griff and his work an opera buff and chess master meticulous serious intense owned a black porsche and in the wide flat spaces of southwest kansas drove it extremely fast coveted a nobel prize and had hitched her wagon in that regard to wrx but believed it was bad luck to dwell on that desire the airlock door opened and closed depositing forbush behind her together they entered the hot zone identified by a wallmounted placard as the kitchen do you want a tour forbush offered later maybe i want to see dr chens office and lab i tell you its already been gone over several times then this shouldnt take too long next to the placard were detailed instructions on how to handle an exposure event beside the instructions was a sign reading simply black zone with an arrow pointing straight down explain she said we never used it but its a small bunker down below near the animal facility with a couple of beds and a tv if you get exposed to wrx thats where you would go to die nice sort of like the submarine in das boot chens office down the hall favor melvin can i do this myself i suppose what do you think youre looking for i have no idea something anything ten minutes just give me ten minutes miss marple pardon agatha christies detectivemurder at the gallop murder most foul thats who you remind ten minutes melvin she thanked him with a pat on the shoulder sylvia chen had gone to great lengths to insert some hominess into her windowless space the walls were whitewashed plaster with either chinese artwork or bookshelves filled with scientific tomes there was a wooden desk in the cornerperhaps walnutand incandescent lamps designed to mimic natural sunlight the largest painting framed in black was an appealing watercolor of angel falls in venezuela and across from it was a small table featuring an inactive water fountain made of bronze the floor was footsquare offwhite tiles largely covered by a circular oriental rug in rich blues and reds after a slow inspection of each wall and shelf angie stood in the center of the rug and closed her eyes sylvia chen was there this was a woman who cared desperately about her appearance and her surroundingsa woman who needed to be appreciated when forbush returned angie was seated at chens desk gazing first at one wall then at the next are you done yet miss marple not yet im just getting a sense of sylvia not much here is there more than you might think angie said over the rush of air in her helmet griff appeared to forbushs right like what he asked oh hi there doctor hows it going looks like were live weve got virus and weve got cells to grow em in and the two seem to be getting along so let the games begin angie said have you budgeted any time for sleep do you think those people in the capitol are sleeping point made ill pick you up some maximumstrength nodoz at the commissary as soon as they build one you were saying theres more to this room than one might think like the way that table over there is turned at a fortyfivedegree angle to the wall and the reason chen chose a circular rug and not one with corners i still dont get it forbush said melvin how much do you know about feng shui chapter day pm cst griff made his own cursory exam of sylvia chens office but saw nothing more unusual than a supremely organized uncluttered workspace you need to look with your mind not your eyes angie urged griff stood with his faceplate nearly touching hers to hear above the constant rush of air flowing into his pressurized suit okay educate me i would say that my life has been an endless series of phases some of them dont stick like racquetball and scuba and contra dancing some of them do like vegetarian cooking and pilates my feng shui period only lasted until i realized i was far too scattered and disorganized to ever pull it off but knowledge is never wasted and by the time i stopped my adult extension classes and daily studies i had learned a great deal griff and melvin followed her over to the framed picture of angel fallsthe tallest waterfall in the world feng is wind shui is water its a taoist explanation of nature that stresses the importance of energy flow the simple idea of the scienceand like most things chinese it can be examined on any number of levelsis that a clear energy flow improves fortune health and happiness energy griff said got it for instance this room is divided into zones i can tell without a compass that this is the north wall of the office because of the water elements chen has placed here she gripped the back of a narrow chair positioned directly beneath the framed picture and pulled it a few inches away from the wall this chair and the blue throw pillow on it feature the colors that best energize this zone griff pointed to the adjacent wall which was also the entrance into the office what zone is that he asked thats the east zone the inside of the office door is painted green you know i actually remember her saying that the color of her door helped her to think better forbush said no surprise this area is characterized by the wood element green colors dominate and improve optimism contentment and spiritual growth ill bet you got an a in your course griff said actually i almost got kicked out dr huang the instructor said i needed to sit still during class or i couldnt stay griff set his gloved hands on angies shoulders and turned her to him all interesting he said but i dont see the relevance and ive got a lab to get up and running we want to know where sylvia might be right if shes still alive forbush added well the office layout and décor tell me that she adheres to at least some traditional chinese beliefs angie turned to chens desk and held up a framed fivebyseven photo thats sylvia griff said believing he had answered the question angie was about to ask although i am sure it was taken some years ago instead angie pointed to the other woman in the photograph an elderly chinese woman dressed in a white floralpatterned blouse and black skirt how about her griff shrugged no idea its her mother angie said facial structure eyes im virtually sure of it so angie pulled the photograph out from the black frame and held it up so that griff could see the date and time stamp the digital camera automatically applied to the print this was taken four years ago griff shifted impatiently listen angie im fascinated by all youre saying and i dont want to sound rude but weve got to focus on getting some experiments started where are you going with this if chen is alive i would bet dollars to donuts that shes going to be near her mother thats quite a leap from a painting and a chair how could you conclude that traditional values the motherdaughter bond is strong in most cultures but its especially so between chinese women and their mothers is that it actually no angie said listen griff i know you guys are in a rush but i think theres something here where angie summoned them across to the bookcase the dominant element in the west zone is metal silver and gold colors and the metals themselves enhance this zones energy griff stooped to examine some of the titles i dont see how books like pathogenesis in clinical virology would improve anybodys health he said unless that person had just contracted marburg forbush quipped laughing unselfconsciously at his own dark humor angie pulled out books from the bookcase glanced quickly at the covers and instead of shelving them tossed them aside one by one hey ange slow down there might be something sharp that could puncture your suit what are you looking for anyway this angie exclaimed holding up a tall thin volume with a colorful cover griff read the title aloud the power of peach recipes fit for kings and emperors i dont get it me neither forbush added given the other titles and the relevance of almost all the books to chens work this one is out of place theres no other one like it here go on griff said suddenly interested the peach is symbolic of long life and plays a significant role in feng shui one by one angie turned the pages of the cookbook fumbling because of her gloves as she neared the middle a trifold brochure slid out and fluttered to the floor angie picked it up with some difficulty unfolded it to its full width and held it up for griff and melvin to read riverside nursing home and heres a letter from them written three years ago thanking dr chen for her inquiry what are you thinking griff asked im thinking sylvias mother might well be a resident in this facility and if sylvia is still alive shes somewhere near this place or at least she visits there how do we prove that griff asked we dont have phones or even internet access unless were being monitored i wouldnt try that anyway too dangerous especially if were the only ones who suspect this might be where sylvia is until we know who genesis is and how they knew to blow up that helicopter its unwise to trust anyone but ourselves you two have to stay in this lab but i dont melvin i need your help in sneaking me out of this place your wish is my command forbush replied where to the nearest decentsized airport she pointed to the address on the back page of the brochure im going to new york city chinatown to be precise chapter day am est with the bang of her gavel ursula ellis called to order the first meeting of the newly formed united states house special committee on the death investigation of senator harlan mackey ellis possessed profound knowledge of congressional history and could not recall an instance where a special committee resolution had been drafted and voted on in such a compressed timeline most unusual too since president allaire had endorsed the committee that could ultimately destroy him ellis reflected on the formation of the special committee and the moment when allaire in all his arrogance agreed to allow it to happen the president had returned to the house chamber after a lengthy absence conferring with his cronies his face drawn and the color of fog the mood in the hall was bordering on hysteria some members of the legislative and judicial branches were demanding to see the video of mackeys death again but as the presiding leader over nonlegislative house activities ellis acted within her authority to deny the request the video had served its purpose and to rebroadcast it would offer no gain she had already gotten what she wanted jim allaire was on the ropes what are we going to do about this ursula allaire had asked they sat facing each other behind the rostrum allaire in the vice presidents chair and ellis seated across from him in her own well mr president youll need to be more specific than that you know damn well what im talking about allaire snapped on the house floor a cordon of secret service agents sean oneil among them blocked access to the rostrum and ensured a private exchange between the two adversaries sir there was evidence presented inside this chamber that suggests you may have condoned or even ordered murder well obviously thats not the truth and you know it all i know is what i saw on that videorecording ellis said answer one question for me mr president go on did you authorize the militarys use of deadly force allaires eyes narrowed no he had said well then id like to form a special committee to establish independent corroboration of that claim i assume youll vigorously endorse such a measure unless of course you have something to hide sir and just how do you propose going about organizing such a committee ursula simple mr president ellis had said her tone syrupy with confidence at my last count we have two hundred and eighty voting members of the house of representatives all confined by your orders here inside the house chamber you have not made it clear whether or not i have access to the ones who are not here and your point constitutionally speaking whether or not we get the others that gives us a quorum to conduct business allaire went from calm to livid in a blink you want to hold an official house vote in the middle of this crisis are you insane with all due respect sir if your intention is to maintain order youll need to reestablish trust i believe this is the best way to proceed in doing that let me get this straight allaire said the purpose of this special committee of yours is to investigate me ellis could almost feel the mans desire to wrap his hands around her throat the notion made her smile oh not you specifically mr president the committee will focus on senator mackeys tragic death naturally id expect your full cooperation when the committee calls key witnesses to testify under oath yourself included and if i refuse my support ellis did not hesitate to respond although given the jubilation she was feeling it took effort to maintain an outward expression of gravity in that case she said id request that the house judiciary committee consider evidence of wrongdoing the constitution does grant us the authority to impeach you for high crimes and misdemeanors id say that murder falls under the former of those transgressions wouldnt you agree ms ellis allaire said given the threat to our nation posed by these circumstances what you are doing borders on treason we have only one constitution sir and i will be only one of those committed to protecting it the anger on allaires face had quickly yielded to stoicism conduct your hearing and call your vote he said youll have my support thank you mr president leland gladstone crafted the first draft of the resolution to form the special committee ellis edited much of it still she was impressed that her precocious aides prose demonstrated a remarkably mature acumen for the craft of politics multiple possible interpretations for every statement copies of the resolution were made in the media room and were distributed to each voting member then ellis called the quorum together the measure passed with near unanimous support ellis appointed herself chairperson which did not violate house rules given the committees lack of a legislative agenda her next task was to select the fourteen committee members from a candidate pool of more than five times that number the resolution called for equal representation from both parties though elliss presence ensured that deadlocks would be broken in her favor she purposefully picked several allaire loyalists after they turned against their beloved leader which ellis was confident they would the shockwaves sent through his supporters would be that much more profound access to nearby meeting rooms was not permitted so elliss newly formed select committee met in a cordonedoff section in the upper gallery despite the frigid temperature outside body heat was threatening to convert the chamber into a sauna and of course not only were the windows locked shut but the airconditioning had been disabled shipments of utilitarian clothing had finally been distributed throughout the three groups and as a result morale was slightly improved before we commence with committee proceedings i want to personally thank each of you for putting aside extremely valid concerns for your own health and safety to focus on vital congressional business ellis began i would have not pushed to create this select committee had i not believed it was of the utmost importance to the health and safety of our most pressing responsibilitythe welfare of the citizens of the united states through your courageous vote youve shown your support in the most significant of ways silverhaired barbara crain a manyterm representative from delaware whose ashen complexion cried out for fresh air spoke first to be honest madam speaker any action at this time is a welcome distraction we are feeling impotent and stifled here many nodded agreement and ellis graciously thanked them all again she kept her attention focused on the body language of allaires hardliners and asked gladstone to do the same as she expected they initially appeared ready to stonewall progress and vociferously defend allaire to the end their postures would change soon enough just a procedural note ellis said my aide mr gladstone will be compiling complete and detailed reports of all committee activity however under the open meetings and hearings rule clause two of house rule eleven weve voted these proceedings will remain closed therefore ill remind this committee to refrain from recording any of what is discussed here a congressman from ohio overweight and perspiring profusely scoffed we dont even have anything to record with allaires damn nazis have made sure of that that led to a volatile exchange ellis banged her gavel to reestablish order a reminder that we will conduct this committee with established house rules for special investigative committees the chair recognizes herself for five minutes to deliver an opening statement ellis had written out her remarks but could have easily recited them from memory today we are faced with one of the greatest and gravest threats our country has ever known i am of the opinion that this is a threat from within by within i mean not only from the terrorists calling themselves genesis but from our own government and yes from the president himself it will be the business of this committee to ascertain the validity of my disturbing claim let us begin with an examination of the facts such as they might be genesis a known terrorist organization has allegedly penetrated our extensive stateoftheart security to infect us with a virus of some sort how did they accomplish such a feat without assistance from the very forces assigned to safeguard us why have we been prevented from participating in the response to this devastating attack why is the executive branch of our government not giving us the legislative branch the chance to do the job for which we were elected ellis paused and let her gaze linger longest on several of the staunchest allaire supporters gladstone checked his watch and held up two fingers to signal ellis the number of minutes she had spoken as the gentleman from ohio sadly pointed out she continued under presidential order you no longer have phones to contact your own base of support why is that let me ask how many of you have a major university in your congressional district half the hands were raised and dont these major universities have scientists there are vast resources at our disposal that could assist in ameliorating this crisis and yet were denied access why again ellis paused she had learned that a question often carried more persuasive weight than a claim of fact i propose that there is more to this situation than meets the eye i further propose that by an exhaustive exploration of senator harlan mackeys tragic and horrible death to which we have all borne witness a new truth will emerge this select committee must act with the interest of the country above the interest of any individual or any president we need to know what genesis has demanded not only with this terrifying attack but with those that preceded it surely such demands have been voiced surely president allaire must know what they are why has he not shared this information with the people through their duly elected senators and representatives this committee must be prepared to deal with any and all possibilitieseven charges that the president of our country has chosen to keep us in the dark as to what genesis wants and has resorted to murder to protect his selfinterest by keeping those secrets from us does any member have an opening statement a deeply entrenched allaire supporter raised her hand i have a statement the chair recognizes the congresswoman from kentucky ellis said youve raised some interesting points madam speaker that have perhaps altered my thinking our dear colleague senator mackey appeared to have been executed for simply stepping outside if this virus does not pose an extreme risk to the populace as the president so asserts why did senator mackey pay such a steep price for what would seem to be a minor transgression what are you suggesting ellis asked as a way of urging her on im asking of those present at this proceeding who believes this virus represents a minor health threat a majority of hands were raised in that case she continued we should be able to shortcut this investigation simply by getting somebody on this committee to volunteer to leave the premises and walk the same path senator mackey took president allaire assured us the shooting was accidental we believe the virus threat is negligible a quick trip outside should prove both claims quickly so said ellis replied do we have any volunteers willing to take up the congresswoman from kentuckys suggestion not a single hand went up this time if you doubted the importance of our committee before perhaps those doubts have now been erased there was movement to elliss right she turned to see a secret service agent approaching carrying a large bulky manila envelope these are closed proceedings ellis said im sorry but you are not permitted here my apologies madam speaker but this package arrived for you with our last supply delivery im in charge of package security so i had to have it scanned but i did not feel the need to open it its apparently from general egan himself so i thought you might want it right away much appreciated im sorry to have snapped at you the agent handed ellis the package nodded to apologize for the intrusion and left in the direction from which he had come ellis studied the delivery it was a padded envelope sealed with clear plastic tape the outside markings she recognized as official us army insignias and it was stamped urgent in bold red lettering ellis banged her gavel one time the chair recognizes her right to call a thirtyminute recess ellis rose and maneuvered past the members of her select committee to this point the hearing could not have gone much better as far as doing any significant damage to jim allaire she was still feeling her way along but the man was lying and concealing vital information and she was far too much of a pro not to keep probing until something in his shaky façade gave way she knew who general paul egan was but had only met him briefly at some sort of official affair almost certainly he wasnt an allaire supporter whatever it was she sensed this package could only be good clutching it she headed off in the direction of the ladies room chapter day am est ellis took in a sharp breath as she read the text on the display screen of a handheld messaging device that had been carefully enclosed in protective wrap it was as thin as a blackberry but somewhat larger the display on the screen was sharp the device prompted impossible she thought there was no way genesis could have gotten ahold of her personal banking password she purposely typed in an incorrect code and the device immediately refused to proceed she then typed in the correct numbers and was directed to two typed sheets carefully hidden between the bubble wrap of the envelope and its manila outer shell printed on the first sheet were the words genesis demands ellis took the package into a stall and secured the door on first reading the demandsradically antiestablishmentbordered on the absurd but ellis pushed aside her initial impression by reminding herself of the brilliance the organization had displayed thus far as well as their unbridled ruthlessness she typed the response appeared less than a minute after she pressed send ellis reviewed the sheet of demands again and then sent a message which read simply the device buzzed in her hand after genesis returned a reply ellis typed this time there was no immediate response can this all be some sort of trick on allaires part she had after all threatened him with impeachment could he be trying to set her up as one willing to negotiate with terrorists it was possible if allaire wasnt behind this then why were they reaching out specifically to her ellis warned herself to tread softly until the picture became clearer if the message were really from genesis then allaire had not only ignored their communications but kept them secret as well if so he had placed everyone in the capitol in mortal danger suddenly the device buzzed in her hand ellis did not need genesis to explain the potential impact of her being the one to end this crisis she was more than fit to lead the country it was her destiny to do so what genesis was offering was the path to that inevitability she thought of william jennings bryan who wrote destiny is not a matter of chance but a matter of choice at that moment her choice was to prove that the opportunity indeed was for real ellis typed interesting ellis thought but the exchange proved nothing were she to confront allaire with specifics about the virus it might only confirm that she had taken his bait she needed more certainty than that to proceed ellis typed she wondered how allaire assuming he was behind this sham would respond not only was that an interesting response but a most unexpected one as well ellis knew all about the helicopter disaster the explosion shook the chamber walls and incited some panic among an already jittery group nothing about the explosion will derail our plans for a rapid resolution to this challenge allaire had told a meeting of the leaders of congress ellis wouldnt believe him until she had questioned sean oneil it took a little prodding but finally the agent revealed that the explosion had killed a pilot copilot and a decoy of the virologist who had been chosen to develop an effective treatment for the virus that was threatening them clearly the president had nothing his ironfisted quarantine was born out of panic which meant that harlan mackeys death was no accident ellis tensed this was genesis who was contacting her she felt absolutely certain of it if they were to provide her with the cure she would assume the stature of a savior destiny ellis studied the sheet of demands again they were ridiculousover the top under normal circumstances any lawmaker championing a bill with these provisions would be committing political suicide but these were hardly normal circumstances genesis had organized the legislative demands into three broad categories national security immigrant rights and privacy the national security mandates called for the immediate cessation of unchecked spying on ordinary americans as well as the abolishment of the patriot act and a rewrite of the ecpa the electronic communications privacy act the impact of such a bill would be profound it would make it illegal to monitor communication on the internet wiretapping in all but the most extreme cases would be abolished and the legislation currently in committee to establish a national id program would be scrapped who are these people ellis wondered again in addition to the security demands they called for the dismantling of the immigration and naturalization service ending all discrimination against immigrants along with sweeping changes that would essentially erase our borders with mexico and canada they also insisted on the installation of consumer privacy protections which would make surveillance camera footage a civil rights violation unless it was related to preventing robbery this was truly toxic legislation but what we have all been exposed to was equally toxic as well these demands were coming from genesis ellis concluded and although she did not personally support any of their proposals given the circumstances and the stakes she could champion the effort nonetheless flexibility was at the very heart of good politics once she was sworn in as president the country would see only a heroa hero who had done what their elected leader could not ellis felt another jolt of adrenaline her mind danced with images of her taking the presidential oathimages of such vivid and glorious detail that she believed for just a moment they had actually occurred genesis sounded as if they had the resources to make it happen she had to take the ride there was however one glaring problem that still needed to be addressed she typed the exchange that followed occurred in rapid succession genesis ellis genesis ellis genesis chapter day pm cst matt fink had been a pilot in the south african air force before he became a mercenary opting for more closeup work and much more money now he banked a sharp right turn extended the learjet xrs landing gear and then rechecked his instrument panel for any needed course corrections he slowed to knots and extended the wing flaps to decrease the aircrafts stalling speed the lear was a joy to fly compared to the stiffer jas gripen fighter he had piloted in the service clear skies and no strong crosswinds made for perfect flying and a bright kansas sky gave fink a clear view of the runway he repositioned his headset microphone to continue the arrival sequence with air traffic control at the garden city regional airport garden city tower lxj is eight miles out entering a left downwind for the visual threetwo fink said lxj is cleared to land runway seventeen winds threefourzero at five to ten cleared to land lxj fink repeated the instruction the wheels touched down with barely a bump and alex ramirez who had passed the flight from baltimore in the copilots seat stood with the aircraft still in motion ill head back and get the weapons and gear ready he said the cessnas waiting for us fink answered i want to be airborne within an hour the two men had worked together for years and had handpicked the team for the genesis job ramirez whod had his face cut nearly in two in rwanda was sharp and dependable and the absolute best with any sort of electronics or any kind of garrote he was also a vicious infighter who had disposed of the capitol security guard peter tannen quietly and efficiently thus earning himself this trip to kansas fink taxied to a smooth stop at the location assigned to him by the controller then he powered the engines down and confirmed the cockpit radio was off as well cain expected him to check in and that conversation was not one he could afford to inadvertently broadcast to garden citys air traffic tower he made contact with his employer through a hightech pushbutton phone weve landed at garden city regional ready for phase two he said seconds later he heard a beep and cains baritone voice whats your eta to kalvesta were forty miles west once we get the paperwork done we should have our first visuals of the facility within an hour very good cain replied youll be able to send me photographs yes cain let me go in i know i can get to rhodes and finish this once and for all negative cain said this is a reconnaissance mission only we dismantled our surveillance of the facility after the lab was closed down i need to see how its been resurrected before we make our next move but i promise you fink youll get your chance soon enough we cant have rhodes messing things up at this stage roger and out the mercenary snarled and returned the phone to the front pocket of his fleecelined flight jacket the blown missile strike at the capitol wasnt totally his fault but he was the one with the visual and he was the one who pulled the trigger he took great pride in his nearperfect record of mission successes he would wait for cains kill order but not for too long ramirez had unloaded the duffel bags of equipment and weapons and was waiting for fink on the tarmac when he deplaned stay here sport the older man ordered ill go sign for the cessna five minutes later the killer was seated in a small woodpaneled office in an outbuilding near the air traffic control tower the portly rental agent across from him jim kinchley according to his desk plate turned down a small portable television that was broadcasting the latest cnn news report from the capitol crazy stuff happening out there kinchley said crazy fink agreed well i got your fax and was able to get started on the paperwork just need to finish up the rental agreement is all the documents fink had used to rent the learjet from baltimorewashington airport included his own pilots license with the name changed and a master forgery of one for ramirez who couldnt fly anything more complex than a paper airplane but was needed to fulfill the requirement for two pilots only one would be needed now for the cessna skyhawk this was a stealth operation and fink took every precaution to ensure there were no mishaps so mr keegan the agent said how long will you be using the oneseventwo i dont know fink replied does it matter have to put a specific time on this here form well then put down two days fink fixed the man with a baleful look that made him agree to the vague answer without objection mind if i ask what sort of business youre in kinchley quickly pointed to a line on the rental agreement its required you see another hard stare debt collector fink said with the papers signed and an inspection completed he taxied the aircraft over to where ramirez was waiting the cessna was airborne fortyfive minutes from when they had touched down not wanting to burn fuel on a long ascent fink leveled out at four thousand feet and proceeded on an easterly course that took him over a barren flat patchwork of square and rectangular brown fields flecked with snow the kalvesta facility came into view forty minutes after takeoff ramirez peered through the lenses of his highpowered brunton binoculars and made some initial observations while they were still several miles away ill need to get closer to take any useful pictures but from what im seeing weve got ourselves a mini fort knox he told fink lots of manpower lots of guns and lots of fencing fink retrieved his phone to report that initial assessment to cain when his cockpit radio sparked to life unidentified aircraft you are flying in restricted us military airspace alter course heading twosevenzero and maintain at least ten miles from point north thirtyeight degrees three minutes thirtyfour seconds west one hundred degrees seventeen minutes eleven seconds it was not a smart move to have passed so close clearly with so much at stake including his own life allaire was moving quickly fink altered their course without hesitation roger that and all apologies he said into his headset was unaware of any military activity here changing to a heading of twosevenzero as instructed thank you aircraft and have a pleasant day fink switched the radio to intercom mode cursed out loud and then spoke to ramirez via their headset microphones for now is right there sport he said were going to have to make this a ground operation no problem ramirez replied with the binoculars still pressed to his eyes the cessna completed its sharp turn to course correct and again leveled off ramirez no longer had visual of the facility that was now directly behind them but moments later he tapped fink on the arm because something else had caught his attention take a look ramirez said passing over the binoculars the heading change had put the cessna directly above a red ford taurus that was pulled over on a particularly barren stretch of road just five miles from the entrance to the kalvesta facility fink piloted the plane with his knees as he studied the scene below through the binoculars you see ramirez asked fink nodded not a lot of traffic on this road at this hour he said or any hour i would bet not every day you see somebody being helped out of the trunk of a car either not every day ramirez agreed doesnt look like she was in there unwilling either not if after you get out of the trunk you jump into the front seat like she just did fink handed the binoculars back to ramirez can you get a plate number from here he asked i can fink took out his phone cain its fink you read me im here cain answered can you run a license plate for me give me the numbers fink kept the taurus in view while he recited the plate numbers to cain the taurus had pulled back onto the road and was continuing west on route a few minutes later finks phone beeped the car is registered to the kalvesta lab tech melvin forbush cain said whats going on fink explained the situation follow him the nofly zone tells me enough about security getting to rhodes is going to take some planning roger that fink increased the planes altitude but not so much that he lost sight of the car as it traveled past garden city and turned south onto us anything of interest on fifty south fink asked ramirez checked his map and said the only thing between here and cimarron is garden city regional airport well then fink said it looks like well be returning the plane sooner than we planned chapter day am est angies odyssey from denver was something of a nightmare engine problems delayed the flight for several hours and then canceled it altogether by the time she arrived in midtown manhattan it was nearly eleven in the morning she used the time before her noon meeting with sliplitz to buy some toiletries makeup a large giants tshirt and a pair of yellow sweatpants which she packed inside the carryon she had borrowed from melvin she slept in short bursts on the flight from denver awakening damp with perspiration from dreams reliving her clandestine departure from kalvesta the adventure began with a problemmelvin reported that all vehicles leaving the compound were being inspected after scouting the search procedure for more than an hour he came up with a plan based not surprisingly on something he had seen in a movie the key was timing in fact she and melvin practiced their maneuver half a dozen times in a secluded corner of the parking area they were down to less than ten seconds beginning to end when she finally proclaimed they were as good as they were going to get first angie holding an armload of blankets as an excuse in case someone stopped her concealed herself against the wall of the bungalow closest to the main guard post melvin positioned by the hood of his taurus waited for the trunk to be checked and closed and then began coughing violently and crying for help academy awardworthy he would later call his performance my asthma melvin called out pounding on the hood im choking inhaler in glove compartment help me the soldier conducting the inspection set aside the mirror he had been using to examine the underside of the car and raced to melvins aid at that moment angie moved quickly across the fifteenfoot space separating the bungalow from the rear end of the taurus keeping low she unlocked the trunk with melvins spare key and opened the trunk eighteen inches then she shoved in the blankets and followed them through the small opening damn she murmured reverently when she felt the car accelerate and realized that melvins plan had worked six miles in the trunkthats what melvin told her it would be six short miles before he felt comfortable they would be clear of the facility and any patrols and he could get her out and into the passenger seat despite being propped with pillows and the blankets and having tested the space out angie felt the gnawing pangs of claustrophobia set in the moment she closed the trunk from the inside there had to have been a better way she was thinking one moment i can do this she was thinking the next her discomfort would have been even more acute had she known that five minutes out forbushs cell phone had lost any signal by the time they had passed what angie felt had to be the sixmile mark her drymouthed anxiety had mushroomed into an airhungry panic she began to hyperventilate he forgot the deal melvins going to drive the whole way with me in here she tried calling him and then lit her flashlight which had only a brief calming effect next she pounded on the trunks underside nothing the car motored on jarring her from side to side as her breathing grew even more rapid and shallow at one point they slammed in and out of a huge pothole snapping her teeth through the inside of her cheek more time passed and she began imagining terrible thingsbeing buried alive and smothered to death being kidnapped and even raped when forbush finally released her from the trunk she learned that they had traveled less than two miles when they hit the huge pothole nothing near the five miles she had guessed never again was all she could think as forbush helped her to her feet and into the passenger seat never again angie fought back the urge to call griff they had little doubt that nearly everything they did at the lab was being monitored she shuddered at the notion of how compressed her world had become the constant scrutiny the airlocks the elevator the biohazard suit the trunk the claustrophobia of what had recently been a carefree existence in one of the most fascinating cities in the world had actually shaken her confidence she expressed those feelings to melvin who did his best to be supportive but there were obvious limits to the mans ability for empathy for now she would have to gain strength from griffs final words to her i believe in you in contrast to the sleepy garden city airport the terminal at jfk was a near gridlock of travelers angie was jostled by several of them as she followed the signs to ground transportation one of them a lean and swarthy man wearing sunglasses had been on the flight from garden city to denver as well as on the flight from denver to new york he muttered an apology as he passed her then hurried away a cell phone pressed to his ear from a small television set embedded into the back of the cabbys seat angie watched the latest fox news report from the capitol the broadcast reporter was a sharply dressed woman in her late twenties and behind her were hundreds of television cameras from other news outlets jockeying for the most eyecatching shot despite the reporters complete confidence in her story angie knew the information she was reporting was woefully inaccurate allaires pr machine had done a masterful job categorizing the virus threat as flulike and explaining the extensive security measures as precautionary only angie turned the volume off unwilling to listen to any more misinformation she knew the truthhell she had the story of the century to report all she had to do was direct the driver to any of a number of media outlets in new york and in no time shed be given her choice of plum jobs and probably a sevenfigure book deal as well but the country was at stake and for the first time in her professional life she opted for perpetuating a lie over printing the truth when she arrived at her midtown destination angie paid the fare plus tip in cash genesis had found ways to frame griff and to bypass the security system at the state of the union address there was no reason at this point to underestimate their resources creativity or viciousness it was hard to believe her credit card transactions were already being monitored especially given that genesis had no reason to know who she was or how she was involved with kalvesta but there was no sense in taking chances angie had never lived in new york city but she always felt at home there once on broadway she located sliplitzs number and rang the buzzer to apartment e seconds later she heard the intercom click on da said a mans voice gottfried its me ah zis gloomy day is suddenly brighter replied the heavy german accent angie quickly opened the outside and inner doors entering the dreary foyer before the buzzer shut off she walked up to the third floor carrying her small suitcase rather than bouncing its wheels against every stair her energy was returningthe fog that had slowed her down following the horrible ride from kalvesta had lifted she was back on the job this was what she lived for her add personality was made for the frenetic unpredictable world of reporting the man who answered the door to e was short fat bearded balding and he had told her over the phone recently divorced for the fourth time of all her professional contacts gottfried sliplitz had proven to be one of the most useful when they first met sliplitz was an analyst with the health and human services agency in rockville maryland angie was researching a story about salmonella contamination at a local drug manufacturing plant and sliplitz was a source within minutes of her concluding their first interview the affable german professed his love for her to prove it he falsified documents that gave her unprecedented access to plant employees and corporate records the story of greed gone bad and public safety ignored was nominated for a pulitzer prize it didnt win but she came close to winning a jail sentence for contempt of court for not giving up her contact at the hhsa she knew never to turn on a sourceespecially one like gottfried sliplitz as a result of that code she had come perilously close to jail for contempt on several other occasions as well now she needed the mans help again and with his adoration for her still in bloom he was more than willing to oblige you look vonderful liebchen can you come in for a while gottfried asked his eyes begging the way a puppy might plead for a pat thanks for the offer gottfried but i dont have time were you able to get me what i need i am chief analyst for ze new york city department of health and mental hygiene gottfried said big step up from rockville good money too strange name though it could have been vurse ve are also responsible for dog licenses developmental disabilities und std prevention to name just a few he extracted a manila envelope from a drawer and handed it to her with these papers you are officially an investigator in our department angie kissed sliplitz on the cheek and hugged him youre the best gottfried i promise soon as i can ill make it up to you on a date she smiled at him ive just started seeing a terrific man besides i need to keep our relationship professional think of what could happen if we turned sour i would lose a dear friend and an invaluable resource ill take ze risk but i wont look i have lots of friends i can hook you up with she promised just not right now you break my heart she kissed him again on the cheek luckily you heal quickly between us right nobody knows about this between us sliplitz confirmed angie gave the man a final embrace before she departed as she headed down the staircase she passed a man on his way up he was wearing dark sunglasses and grunted a greeting as he brushed past her once on the street angie flagged another cab as they pulled away headed downtown the driver of the town car parked behind them set his cell phone aside and followed chapter day pm est angie stepped from her cab into a world as far from the rolling plains and bison ranches of western kansas as imaginable chinatown the lower manhattan neighborhood featured pungent odors tightly packed shops and apartments cracked sidewalks brick buildings with redpainted fire escapes doubleparked trucks casually blocking traffic and nerveshaking noise from blaring horns and a dozen active construction sites storefront signage was in chinese with a smattering of english subtitles many of the goods displayed in windows underneath neon signs were unlikely to be found in any other part of the city fruit stands fish markets and shops selling knickknacks to tourists lined the narrow winding overcrowded streets angie stood in the entrance of a redbrick building she guessed might have once been a tenement there was no sign identifying the nursing home although she confirmed the address was the one on the brochure she had found in sylvias office she pressed the only button on the buildings facade and a highpitched voice on the intercom said something in chinese department of health and mental hygiene angie said holding up her fake id badge to the security camera installed overhead the photograph laminated into the card was one gottfried sliplitz had taken from her facebook page there was a lengthy pause before the door buzzed she entered into a cramped poorly lit hallway dominated by an ornate rickety wooden staircase that ascended steeply in front of her the unmistakable odor of cooked fish and salt drifted down from the floors above stepping into character angie hid her suitcase behind the stairwell she looked around for an elevator but saw none curious surely a nursing home had to have one eschewing the stairs she headed down the hallway which turned once to the right and ended at a heavy metal door that was locked it was possible there was an elevator somewhere behind it but that made little sense perhaps the nursing home had been merged with the building next door and that was where the elevator was finally she returned to the front hallway and trudged up the steep stairs still wondering how a nursing home could exist without some sort of transport for disabled and wheelchairbound residents as she ascended the sound of voices grew louder she stopped on the fourth floor where the chatter was the loudest the odor the strongest a small sign nailed to a shuttered door read riverside beneath its corresponding chinese characters angie paused to catch her breath then knocked a haggard middleaged chinese woman responded she had short dark hair streaked with gray and wore a black blouse with a swirling orange floral design angie held up her health and mental hygiene identification card and was suspiciously invited one step inside she felt slightly foolish at having come so far on such little evidence if she were wrong about the riverside she would be flying back to garden city by morning does a mrs chen reside here she asked the woman shook her head shouted something into the space behind her looked quizzically back at angie and shook her head again angie wished that she had the picture of sylvia and her mother to show but griff had warned her that the chemical and ultraviolet decontamination process required to remove it from the kitchen would have ruined the image altogether may i come in she asked the woman nodded spoke again in chinese and then motioned for angie to enter they stepped into a narrow oakfloored hallway that featured rows of doors with numbers but no glass presumably residents rooms extending in both directions it was more dormlike than any nursing home angie had ever visited but the corridor was also remarkably clean and fairly free of clutter several walkers and wheelchairs were pushed up against the wall plus an empty hospital bed provided the only visible clue as to the buildings function angie followed the woman until they came to an open brightly lit common area there were two dozen or so elderly chinese women and men seated on couches and easy chairs or clustered around foldout bridge tables many of them were talking seemingly at the same time some of the residents were playing gamesbackgammon cards and mahjong others were watching television a few were simply staring off perhaps at their memories angie scanned the room for sylvia chens mother lack of any possible candidates continued to erode her confidence in her conclusions about the place had she put gottfried at risk for nothing melvin too suddenly the nonlinear thinking of her add which had so often helped her break a story seemed childish misguided and even worse potentially dangerous a stunning young chinese woman approached from across the lounge requested her credentials and examined them with care hello ms donna prince she said finally in perfect english my name is wu mei please call me mei i am the floor manager and duty nurse in charge my aunt told me you are looking for someone yes im looking for a woman her family name might be chen i have reason to believe shes a resident here we have several chens living here mei said with a brief laugh it is a very common chinese name perhaps if you could be more specific again that photograph her daughters name is sylvia if that helps im sorry she said is there some sort of problem we have reason to believe mrs chens daughter may have come in contact with a very contagious virus and then visited her mother here angie said retelling the story she had conjured up during the flight from denver we are searching for both the mother and the daughter ill need access to all the rooms in this facility goodness mei replied setting her hand to her lips in a show of genuine alarm nothing like whats happening in washington i hope possibly we need to find these women to do some blood work ill be happy to help you look mei said this floor is for our lowacuity residents higheracuity patients are on the upper floors i appreciate your cooperation it will be noted in my report right this way mei led angie back to the stairs pardon me wu mei but i went to take your elevator up here and could not find one on the first floor i wondered how you transport your residents from floor to floor and down to the street mei did not reply immediately and in fact kept walking to the stairs the silence was awkward suddenly the nurse stopped and turned could i see your credentials again please she asked angie felt herself go cold her backup plan which probably could have been her first choice all along was simply to tell the truth but with the fbi failing to find sylvia chen and genesis eerily prescient some sort of deception seemed called for now it appeared she had been caught she handed over her id the young nurse looking genuinely distressed scanned it briefly and handed it back we have one she said gloomily at the back of the building but we dont use it very much and i believe my aunt and uncle who own this place have had a longstanding arrangement of some kind with the building or the nursing home inspectors please please dont say anything about it in your report the elevator is very old but i have heard my uncle say that the cost to replace it and the structural support around it would force them to close down and there is really nothing like this place for our chinese elders i understand angie said you have nothing to worry about from me oh thank you thank you so much i was going to walk you up to the sixth floor why dont we ride instead angie kept the visage of sylvias mother clear in her mind as she followed mei down the hallway and to the right the elevatortruly ancientwas precisely where she had guessed it would be mei lifted the wide double doors and angie stepped inside the darkened car turning around and then instinctively backing a step toward the rear wall stop dont move any more mei cried out in alarm she pointed behind angie at a gap of about two feet between the steel elevator floor and the wooden back wall immediately angie took a precautionary step forward mei closed the doors then used a key to engage the motor the car clattered to life and traveled slowly upward with angie wondering how close this lift might be to the original one built by otis in the midnineteenth century how long has riverside been in business she asked since the nineteen forties my greatgrandparents opened the place because too many chinese were forced to send elderly parents to facilities that did not respect our traditions the elevator came to a hard stop and angie momentarily lost her balance mei turned the key once more to lock the system then lifted open the door and motioned for her to follow they started with the room closest to the elevator and immediately angie felt a jolt of excitement her search was over seated on a small vinylcovered chair in the corner of a stark space illuminated by light coming through a small grimy window and also from a bedside table lamp was a woman probably in her eighties but as angie introduced herself knelt down and studied the womans deeply etched face at closer range her certainty faded as quickly as it had come she could be sylvias mother angie thoughtbut just as probably she is not the eyes the vague expressionthere was something about them that made angie now feel that her initial reaction had been wrong thats mrs li mei said not bothering to move away from the woman she is one of our alzheimer residents she drifts in and out of lucidness but as a matter of fact she does have a daughter who visits go on please well first of all her daughter has been badly scarred by a fire and keeps her face covered so i really cant describe her thats all right angie said feeling a nugget of suspicion materialize around what seemed like something of a coincidence lets keep looking mei said three floors and sixty room checks later they were back where they had begun and youre sure that nobodys offsite angie asked visiting with family out shopping mei shook her head not at so close to dinner and no i checked the books after we finished in the rooms at the change of shifts all of our residents are on the premises angie felt a wave of frustration wash over her what now she asked to see mrs li one more time but the visit was again unproductive the woman was significantly older than the one angie remembered from the photograph in chens office for a moment li seemed to brighten at the mention of the name sylvia but just as quickly the glimmer went away well i want to thank you again for your cooperation she said youve been extremely gracious with your time if i come across anybody named chen with a daughter sylvia ill be sure to contact you ms prince thank you angie said though she knew the phone number on the business card sliplitz had made for her would connect to a nonworking number back to kansas angie retrieved her suitcase and stepped outside into a biting late afternoon wind she searched for a cab saw that none were coming and trudged off in the direction of houston street where more were sure to pass she crossed the alley dividing riverside and another brick building which brought her in front of a chinese restaurant it was only then that she realized how long it had been since she had last eaten the aroma wafting from the modestsized place beckoned her inside even at this hour the restaurant was busy mostly with asiansthe indicator angie had always without any hard evidence come to associate with quality authentic chinese food there was an open table near the kitchen she maneuvered through narrow gaps between chairs and dodged the hustling waitstaff on her way to a seat how will griff take the news she was wondering in one inspired burst she had failed to find the only link to genesis and the ultimate proof of his innocence it was still worth it she said aloud though her words lacked conviction lost in thought she did not notice the waitress standing beside her table the woman turned over angies teacup and filled it from a steaming metal pitcher angie glanced up and her breathing stopped the waitress was professor sylvia chen chapter day pm est you wish something drink or you like order sylvia chen said in a heavy accent she was railthin with dark eyes that were nearly lost in shadow but angie had no doubt whatsoever that it was she her uniform a black dress shirt and black slacks was a size too large the nametag above her breast pocket read simply bao sylvia angie whispered please dont react i know who you are and i know why you are here i need to speak with you i came from kalvesta to find you the steel pitcher in the waitresss hand began to shake dollops of brown tea splashed out from the spout and stained the white tablecloth no understand chen said avoiding any eye contact stop it angie said harshly this is urgent the color drained from chens face her body stiffened no please her eyes were wild with fear as she made a furtive scan of the restaurant either she was searching for an exit or perhaps even more terrifying to her angies accomplice easy angie said please dont call attention to yourself im not here to hurt you are you police military the words were said softly the accent was gone no im not trust me are you them are you genesis the woman kept trembling im a reporter with the washington post the capitol has been quarantined griffin rhodes has been asked by the president to develop a treatment for wrx im helping him keep a record of everything that he does we know about how he was set up before and we know you were involved the president has gotten him out of prison and reopened your lab there is little time people are dying from the virus chens knees buckled as though mention of the past had placed too much stress on her joints angie reached up supported the woman by her arm and encouraged her to sit down chen refused straightened up and pointed to the menu on the table is there any chance that you were followed she asked i dont see how angie said i flew in from kansas earlier today via denver genesis is very resourceful i should never have agreed to cooperate with them but they knew all about my work and they knew that their financing was the last chance i had to keep my research going they are also very dangerous i am a loose end for them now all they want is the virus they dont care about controlling it they tried to kill me but i escaped and came here if they find me i assure you both my mother and i are dead i can help you sylvia thats why i came to new yorkto help you and to see if there is any way to control the virus im working with griffin rhodes at your lab hes out of prison you said yes hes been out for just a few days that is wonderful news listen stay here study your menu angie did as she was asked but went on red alert in case chen bolted the phd scientist went to service a table of four then returned im going to ask you again is it possible you were followed i know the people who are after you are resourceful angie replied so i suppose anythings possible but i really dont see how chen looked unconvinced how did you find me the brochure in the peach cookbook was all angie needed to say did my mother tell you i was here in the restaurant i didnt find your mother where does she live riverside i thought you knew that on close inspection the woman i thought was your mothera woman named lididnt look like her angies puzzled expression seemed to clarify the mystery for chen ah li is the name i made up for her her real name is chen same as mine chen su you went looking for the woman in the picture on my desk yes angie nodded i checked every patient in riverside do you know how alzheimers disease can ravage the body alter the appearance i do how long has your mother had alzheimers its been progressing for several years she still floats in and out and is sometimes quite lucid but it is getting worse the woman in the photograph in my office is the woman i want to remember this is what my mother looks like now chen fished out a picture from her pocket and handed it to angie then she went off again to take orders when she returned she set a steaming bowl of some sort of seafood soup in front of angie this is the best thing on the menu she said especially on a cold winters day like today i hope you like it you just came in here by chance then i was starved and this was the closest place to the riverside mei the nurse there said the daughter who visits mrs li was badly scarred by a fire when i go there i am wearing a hat my face is covered by a scarf my hands are hidden by gloves i lie to protect my mother and myself you have to help us angie said chen paused for a time i know she said finally she took another nervous look about the restaurant and even glanced several times out the front windows droplets of perspiration had appeared like condensation on her brow so you will help us ive done terrible things the virologist said in a shaky voice i did not know they would do this the attack on the capitol how could i have known what were you told would happen do you know who these people are do you have any idea how we can stop this chen shut angie off eleven oclock the restaurant will be closed she said it is too busy here for the rest of the evening too dangerous to talk now come into the alley at the back of the restaurant red door with chinese lettering on it knock three times so i know it is you i have some papers that might help ill tell you everything that i know then eleven oclock angie said chen nodded grimly turned and vanished through the swinging kitchen doors chapter day pm cst sleep griffs eyes stung with a persistent gritty burn that he knew only sleep could relieve he felt desperate to rub at them to coax some moisture out of the tear glands but the plastic face shield on his biosuit made it impossible and the forty minutes it would take to remove his helmet massage his eyes and get suited up again were an unacceptable waste of time relief would have to wait the same with sleep thirtysix hours straight now since his last nap gratefully the concentration involved with his work eased the time along his limbs felt leaden and his joints ached inside the bulky protective suit every twenty minutes or so he took a brief walk through the kitchen to sylvia chens office and back to his own perhaps he had gone without sleep this long during his months in solitary confinement but it was hard to track time in such an utterly monotonous place here more than two hundred feet underground he had the added reminder of wallmounted digital clocks in every room he took a break went online and looked up the record for continuous sleep depravation eleven days by a seventeenyearold student in the sixties guinness had subsequently closed the category for fear of causing serious health problems in those attempting to get their bit of immortality although no adverse effects were reported in the high schooler back to work griff adjusted the electron microscope until it projected crystalclear images of wrxs submicroscopic world onto an attached television monitor despite the screens highdefinition resolution he had to strain to keep the image in focus fortyfive minutes slid by he rose from his chair but knew it had been too long his knees had gone to jello and he stumbled twice before managing his brief walk ill just close my eyes for a few seconds he decided just a few seconds griffs head dropped forward onto his arms and in moments his thoughts began to fade then just as suddenly they reappeared centering about horrific images from the capitolsnapshots of people whose lives he had vowed to try and save as if he were at the wheel on a longdistance drive he snapped his head from side to side until he produced a jet of renewed consciousness that did the trickat least for the moment if he had to stay alert for another thirtysix hours he would do it it had taken several hours of painstaking effort to get his lab operational again but things seemed to be working remarkably well the computers had sparked back to life and were picking up where he had last left off some ten months ago cultures of the blood brought from the capitol were cooking in cell lines melvin had prepared wrx was a hearty rapidly multiplying microbe and after several hours of growth they were able to move samples of the virus from the incubator to the electron microscopes airless vacuum chamber griff proceeded to collect data from those samples which he then input into his software application from there he could simulate the response to variations of his antiviral treatment the end result if successful would be a new approach to interfering with wrx replication during the early days in sylvia chens lab at columbia flushed with a series of successes he had nicknamed his program orion in honor of the legendary great hunter of greek mythology griffs orion had only one mission hunt wrx to extinction without harming the host for now orion was computergenerated but if griff could map out the right rna design it could be synthesized in a lab or even inserted into a cell line for a time the excitement surrounding his work was dizzying then the failures began in every computer simulation he ran wrx battled his creation with the same lethal ferocity of the gods assassin scorpius the scorpion who eventually felled the great hunter orion this scorpions lethal weapon mutation wrx was as quick as it was deadly from a germ with effects limited to the deep central nervous system suddenly there were computer indications of disastrous damage to tissue cultures grown from blood and gastrointestinal cells as well again and again griffs attacking protein seemed close to working but in this battle orions near successes were still the equivalent of abject failure the missing link he knew might be something as close as a minor rna sequence modification or something as distant as orion the constellation no matter how close the breakthrough was according to griffs models the result for the infected host remained the samedeath another stroll through the kitchen and he shifted his attention from the television screen of magnified wrx virus to sylvia chens laboratory notebooks which were laid open and stacked atop one another on the stainless steel table beside the electron microscope he flipped through pages of notes dictated into a computer program or written in his former bosss small irregular hand but as with the images generated by the microscope exhaustion blurred the words hed come to the last of the threering binders and was flipping through old lab notes searching for anything of interest to his work when one report in particular caught his breath the report titled simply the macaque incident and dated a year and a half ago detailed the most horrific account of animal testing griff had ever seen a simple protocol mistake by an animal keeper in hells kitchensylvia chens animal labinfected thirty rhesus monkeys with exceedingly high doses of wrx their decline stunningly rapid was captured on video for later study chens documented account was disturbingly graphic and evoked in griff memories he had long wished to forget it was his policy never to go near the animal lab unless he positively had to but the cries for help from the caretaker had brought him down there he tried to help the animals with a variety of antiviral drugs and even one of his more advanced serums but there was nothing he or anybody could do to save them he could still hear screams of dying monkeys some so sick that they used their rapierlike nails to slice their own bodies to ribbons trying to scratch the virus out the disastrous macaque incident notwithstanding sylvia chen remained convinced that her work with primates held the answer to terminating a wrx infection before the microbes could mutate griff constantly considered incorporating elements of chens research findings with his own but could not bring himself even to appear to endorse her methods now as much as it sickened him to read through her notes he knew they might contain useful nuggets that could help uncover orions missing piece griff had read a survey in which percent of the general public accepted the use of animals in medical research so long as that research involved serious medical conditions and all alternatives had been fully considered before sacrificing the experimental subjects he argued that wrx was a weapon without any true medical gain to be had he also pushed his own methods as a viable alternative chens only concession was to keep him employed and provide him a platform for proving or disproving his hypotheses forbush entered the lab and set a box of pipettes on the counter by the stainless steel sink after sylvia vanished the fbi wanted to take those notebooks he said two guys who looked like michael douglas and harvey keitel searched her lab and office they hated the biosuits and ended up knocking over just about everything that wasnt screwed down when i told them they couldnt take anything out of here they were really upset they read the notes in sylvias office but i dont think they got much out of them how about you there are things here and there that might be useful but i just dont know if i want to study them it makes me sick to have to relive that monkey disaster now that you mention it my friend you really do look a little sick can you take a break griff rejected the suggestion even though his stomach felt hollow and his body as though novocain had been pumped in as a replacement for his blood weve got to push ahead melvin he said at least for a few more hours then maybe ill take a short break good idea when you walk youre starting to look like boris karloff in frankenstein arms out front forbush dramatized the remark thanks melvin griff said you know ive been wondering what if sylvia had the wrong animals how do you mean she tested on rhesus monkeys but never on chimpanzees partly because she knew i would have drawn the line at that and left the project their immune system is closest to our own i wonder now if that would have made a difference i can get the chimps forbush said just say the word it may take a little while though the notion of working on chimpanzees soured griffs stomach even assuming melvin could procure the animals reasonably quickly griff would have to abandon orion to chase another pathone that could prove costly in terms of time just to satisfy some swata scientific wild ass theory would it be worth it chapter day pm est the alley behind the sechuan hop smelled of rotting vegetables frozen towers of cardboard boxes stacked taller than angie stood abutted two dumpsters overflowing with garbage and refuse dense overcast and the buildings themselves obscured any moonlight and steel fire escapes protruding from the buildings made the narrow passageway seem even more foreboding angie pulled the red knit hat she had bought from a street vendor down over her ears to shield them from a biting wind at precisely eleven oclock as instructed she knocked three times on the cold steel of the restaurants alleyway entrance on the second knock the door budged on the third it swung open several inches grating on rusted hinges angie took a cautious step inside and glanced about the basement which was minimally lit from a source ahead and to her right no one was there to greet her she was unwilling to close the door any further sylvia angie called out nothing she was forced to clear her throat to speak again sylvia are you here but for the wind down the alley the silence was absolute floortoceiling metal shelving stocked with dried goods and restaurant supplies created the feeling of claustrophobia that angie had recently found so disturbing ahead of her the shelves split to form three narrow aisles two of which were dark angie took a tentative step down the center one then another ahead she could now make out a bare lowwattage bulb suspended on a short cord a shaft of light from the bulb cast a long distorted shadow across the cement floor angies heart was hammering now she sensed another presence in the basement she wanted to leaveto simply turn and run instead she took another step forward sylvia sylvia please are you there the shadow ahead seemed to waver slightly angie could make out the shape of long arms and fingers as frightened as she was she was also transfixed please she said her voice now little more than a whimper she took another half step toward the shadow then another pausing to listen and to check between the shelves on either side as well as behind her she had reached the end of the aisle the shadow extended almost to where she was standing although a shelf blocked her from seeing the source jaws and fists clenched she peered around the shelving then she gasped sylvia chen was hanging by an electric cord wrapped around her neck the toes of her black work shoes pointing down were several inches off the concrete the other end of the cord had been tossed over an exposed pipe and then secured to a nearby steel support column the scientists head was bowed obscuring her face angie moved numbly to sylvias side and took her hand her skin was warm could she still be alive she lifted sylvias head using two fingers underneath her chin immediately the flash of hope gave way to anguish and revulsion angie recoiled at the sight of the dead womans tongue protruding out between her lips sylvias face was swollen and dark and even in the gloom angie could see that her bulging eyes were spotted red with burst capillariesa sign she knew of strangulation she swallowed back a jet of bile and allowed sylvias chin to drop back against her chest calming herself with deep breaths angie examined the method used to hang the woman the overhead pipe supplied the leverage to hoist her off the ground the knot around the pipe seemed expertly done was she strangled before she was hung two thoughts occurred to angie at that moment first that this was murder not suicide there was no chair or box sylvia could have used somebody powerful had to have pulled on the cord to lift her off her feet the second thought sent a chill through her when she first stepped into the basement and listened shed had a strong sense that she was not alone instantly angie was overwhelmed by the need to get out of the building and into the alley she whirled and dashed back up the aisle she had made it halfway when the heavy steel door ahead of her swung shut chapter day pm est before angie could react a man emerged from the shadows beside the door and stepped into the aisle blocking her path he was tallsix feet or moreand thin but broad at the shoulders even in the dim light she could tell that his aquiline face was probably handsome at one time now dominated by a huge jagged scar running down his forehead across his eyebrow and over his cheek it was utterly terrifying he wore a black leather jacket black watch cap and black leather gloves dangling loosely from his right hand was a meat cleaver what little light there was glinted off its broad blade welcome to hell senorita fletcher he said his perfect english tinged with a hispanic accent react angies mind screamed now she swept her arm across the shelf by her shoulder sending a barrage of cans and cartons flying into his chest belly and groin the impact wasnt much but the surprise gave her what she neededenough time to whirl and bolt back down the aisle no chance senorita the man called out in a singsong voice angie screamed for help frantically wondering where she might find another way out if there were a stairway she would have to pass by sylvias body to find it help she screamed again someone please help i promise it will be painless for you senorita the man called from behind her dr chen was kind enough to part with her papers now i just need a few answers from you thank you for leading me to her by the way ive been with you all the way from kansas and now i feel as if we are sort of buddies he was close angie turned her head to gauge how close and slammed into sylvias body the womans corpse swung away then back striking angie and dropping her to one knee she cried out and scrambling to her feet shoved chen at the killer who was now near enough to connect with the cleaver had he chosen to do so instead he stepped to one side of the aisle twirling the weapon like a drummers stick they were no more than three feet apart even in the deep gloom the grotesque irregular scar stood out like a lightning bolt there was nothing in his expression that suggested it was worth trying to negotiate enough he said we need to talk your friend sliplitz understood he answered my questions you do the same and i promise you wont feel any more pain than he did you son of a bitch believe it or dont senorita fletcher you are not the first one to call me that now cradling the cleaver in his right hand he took a half step toward her and reached out for her arm angies response was immediate she swept her fist overhead shattering the lightbulb and throwing the basement into absolute darkness in the same motion she grasped one of the metal shelving units bringing it crashing down on the man the killer grunted and cursed and angie felt certain he was on the floor instead of turning to run she leapt forward stepping on boxes and the shelving and stomping on what might have been the killers chest then holding her arms out to her sides to maintain contact with the shelves she moved ahead as rapidly as she dared back toward the steel door one step through the blackness then another behind her she heard the man throwing aside the debris and working himself out from under the shelf the door had to be directly ahead angie was trying to visualize which side the handle was on when she slammed full face into a steel support beam she heard the bone in her nose shatter blinding pain exploded through her head instinctively she wrapped her arms around the post keeping herself from going down her nose filled with blood tears flooded down her cheeks at that instant the killers hand closed on her ankle fueled by adrenaline angie kicked frantically and connected the grip on her leg vanished dazed she plunged ahead two more steps and she hit the steel door forehead first snapping her neck back another blast of pain more dizziness and nausea more tears she slowed momentarily then fumbled blindly for the door handle again she felt the mans hand shoot out through the darkness and close on her ankle but in that moment her own fingers closed on the door handle she jammed the handle down immediately the door yielded and she was in the alley which was only marginally better lit than the basement had been glancing over her shoulder she saw that her pursuer was on his hands and knees he had clearly lost some of his composure his lips were pulled back in a snarl angie charged ahead the killer scrambling to his feet might have gotten her right there had he not slipped and fallen heavily into a puddle of garbage mixed with freezing slush still with the man quickly regaining his feet angie knew the chase was almost over she was too far from either end of the alley to make it help she screamed someone help me please her cries were swallowed by the dense winter night a fire escape seemed her only chance the way up to the nearest one was the builtin rungs on the side of one of the narrow dumpsters standing no more than eight feet away gasping for breath angie grasped the top rung and hauled herself up until she was standing on the rim of the dumpster six feet from the ground and another six feet or so from the steel ladder at the base of the slatted stairway end of the line senorita the man said breathing heavily he reached for her ankle but just as he did angie took a single deep breath and launched herself upward the cold air and her winter jacket held her back making the difficult leap almost impossible she was certain she had missed and was already wondering what she could possibly do next when the fingers of her right hand hit against the edge of the lowest rung of the fire escape ladder and curled around the metal there was no way she would be able to hold on for more than a second or two but that was enough her weight began to pull the rusted ladder down far enough so that her feet reconnected with the rim of the dumpster she adjusted her grip hooked the fingers of her other hand around the icy metal and pulled with all her strength in what seemed like slow motion the ladder swung down her foot was on the second rung when she felt the killer clawing at her leg once more this time she pulled away easily and climbed upward toward the first landing she screamed and screamed again for help aware that any misstep now would mean her death to her dismay the windows on the building remained dark and closed by the time she reached the first landing the man was on the ladder the windows facing the landing were barred from now on it would be stairsslatted freezing metal that would make every step treacherous at the secondfloor landing the windows werent barred she considered and quickly abandoned the notion of smashing one of them and trying to climb or dive inside someones apartment the killer was way too close and two people had already died because of her keeping her hands in contact with the railing she pounded upward past one landing then another blood sprayed from her nose with every frozen breath she pawed at it with the back of her hand and coughed it from the back of her throat still the distance between her and the killer seemed to be widening perhaps his sodden clothes were slowing him down perhaps he was hurt perhaps it was all those hours she had spent on the stationary bike god but she missed her apartment her dizziness was getting more intense and her breathing was growing more difficult but she could hear that her pursuer was laboring also she was reconsidering smashing a window when she looked above and saw movement a woman was poking out from one of the windows on the next landing help me angie cried out to her please the woman slipped back inside the room but the narrow window remained open angie dove through it landing awkwardly hitting her already battered forehead and smearing the hardwood floor with blood a wizened woman stood in a corner illuminated by a small bedside lamp angie suddenly realized where she was riverside shed explored the place just hours ago she knew the room and she knew its occupant it was chen susylvia chens mother chapter day pm est mrs chen hide youve got to hide angie heard the killer on the landing it had been a mistake to lead him in here now she had to lead him away to her right the aged woman stood placidly her alzheimers disease apparently shielding her from the terror of the situation go chen su ordered suddenly go quickly angie hesitated then raced from the room at the moment she heard her pursuer climbing through the window she not here not here she heard chen cry out shut up old woman the man snapped not here not here not here chens room was at the end of the sixth floor nearest to the freight elevator the long corridor to the other rooms was totally deserted angie headed for the elevator hoping to use it to escape as she reached it and pulled the doors apart she remembered that mei wu had used a key to start it counting on the relic had been a dumb idea in the first place i said shut up the killers furious words echoed out into the hallway a moment later angie heard the woman get slapped and fall to the floor she sickened at the sound it had been wrong to put chen su in harms way now it was time to end it it was time to surrender before the poor woman or anyone else got killed angie took a step back toward room then she stopped even without the key the elevator could be of use angie took a single step inside the perilous gap in the floor at the rear of the car was as she remembered there was a second slap from room followed by the sound of the armoire doors being yanked open not here she again heard chen say no one here no one here angie set her red knit cap on the floor of the car a foot from the gap then she grabbed one of two wheelchairs resting against a nearby wall and ducked around the corner beyond the elevator looking back toward room a moment later the killer emerged dragging the old woman by her hair come out senorita or i kill this nice lady right here right now he said scream and she dies too angie kept perfectly still then she heard the man laugh end of the line he said angie could hear him moving toward her and the elevator chen su was still continuously whimpering not here not here angie took a chance and craned around the corner enough to see that the killer had let the woman go and was now approaching the gloomy elevator car with little caution at the door he paused scanning inside then he spied her bright cap and stepped in toward it angie hesitated just a beat then she swung the wheelchair around the corner and began a sprint toward the car the man was on one knee picking up the cap and then peering over the edge of the gap in the floor he turned when she was just a few feet away but he was twisted and off balance and his reaction was far too late the wheelchair slammed into his midback and he went down a second ramming and he was into the gap at the last possible moment the fingers of his gloved left hand gained a hold on the edge of the steel floor then as angie watched from above he swung his right hand up and those fingers tightened over the rim as well glaring up at her not saying a word he swung one leg back and was able to gain purchase with it against the brick wall of the shaft he pushed himself up one inch then another now one hand was over the rim and flat on the floor of the car even at such a disadvantage his scar was menacing angie had never physically hurt another human being let alone murdered someone dizzy and battered she stared down at the man good or bad she was thinking there had been far too much killing already far too much death the killers leg continued to give him support now his second hand was fully on the steel floor inching forward angie wondered how she could control him if she helped him up where did you put sylvias notes she asked no notes she had nothing the mans expression softened it was as if he had gotten a read on her and knew she did not have it in her to kill another inch angie knelt on one knee and stared into his eyes trying to match his fierce defiant expression with one of her own tell me again she demanded where are the papers at that instant chen su appeared by angies side dark blood trailed from the corner of her mouth without hesitating she cried out and began stamping on her assailants hands again and again with surprising force wait angie cried but it was too late the mans right hand dropped to his side one final blow and his left hand went as well the killer made the sixstory fall without uttering a sound an awful thud from below punctuated the silence chapter day pm cst would it be worth it griff asked himself not surprisingly he began thinking about his sister louisa and the promise he made to himself after her death he knew from the moment the meningitis claimed her that he would dedicate his life to hunting cures for deadly microbes he would become the orion of the cdc or nih or whatever lab would have hima oneman crusader against death at the time he never considered animal testing taboo how many primates or sheep or cats or canines or purebred white rats would equal his sisters life but then louisas doga spirited mixed breed named moonshineforever altered his thinking at louisas funeral moonshine probably more golden retriever than anything else sat vigil on the stairs outside the church with the unexpectedness of her mistresss death no preparations had been made for the threeyearolds care but griff knew the animal was happy well trained and his sisters greatest love my future husband will simply have to share me louisa would joke whenever questions arose regarding her devotion to moonshine after the funeral there was no question griff would take the dog as his own from almost the moment moonshine and griff returned home she was different her appetite diminished then soon all but vanished she drank only minimally became lethargic and never wanted to play for long eventually when her weight loss became obvious and alarming griff took her to a respected highly recommended veterinarian the vets diagnosis of depressive disorder both shocked and saddened him at the time griff had no idea canine depression was a real condition but even more distressing it hurt him to realize that moonshine missed louisa as much as he did and that there seemed to be absolutely nothing he could do about it what can i do to help he had asked the specialist on a return visit the danger of death is very real the doctor explained youve got to find a way to make life fun for her again and so griff tried he bought her toys he took her to the dog park near his house every night he handprepared gourmet food and even tried antidepressants prescribed by the vet but nothing he did slowed moonshines dramatic deterioration more and more he feared for the dogs life that was when he called andrea bargnanilouisas best friend who had moved away a year or so before i dont know what i can do andrea a teacher had said i saw moonshine almost every day when i was living here but since i moved ive only seen her every couple of months you were louisas closest friend maybe if you just came by for a day or so andrea moonshines going to die from this im certain of it when the teacher showed up at the house the dog reacted almost immediately she picked her head up and barkedonce and then again it was the first bark that griff had heard since the funeral and the joy in the sound was apparent within minutes the shiner as louisa called her was up on all fours her tail flicking wildly she nuzzled against andreas legs and tried to climb into her arms as though she could not get close enough griff had no doubt at all that louisa was somehow alive in the animal andrea felt the same thing even though at the time she was living in a small apartment she gladly agreed to take the dog and so andrea bargnani adopted moonshine were it not for the holiday cards that reached griff every year after that regardless of where in the world he was working he might have lost contact with the two of them but reach him they did for the first two years the picture on the front of the card showed only the woman and the dog soon after that a man named jack debuted in the photoa tall broadshouldered man with kind eyes and a wonderful smile not long after that came a card with a baby boy then one with a girl but the shiner remained the star of every mailing her coalblack eyes sparkling for the camera her rich tawny coat glowing and her mouth open in what had to be a smile griff began what became a tradition every year on the anniversary of louisas death he would sit with those cards and two glasses of red wine one glass he would drink the other he would cast into the sky of wherever he happened to be with the ritual came the renewal of his vow to respect the connection between man and vertebrates griff looked over lamentably at melvin is it time to break that vow ive spent my entire career believing i could battle any virus without killing animals in the process griff said do you think sacrificing primates will help us identify that missing piece griff hesitated before he answered i dont know he said if it were guaranteed to make a difference griff cringed at the question and looked away given the situation how could i not he asked its tantamount to murder either way but id feel too great a responsibility not to do everything possible to save those people but at this point there are no guarantees thats the problem so we have to choose where to put our faith computers or innocent animals i wish i could help with the decision forbush said it would be easy if we had unlimited time as it is setting up another hells kitchen animal facility even a partial one will take at least three or four days griffs insides were knotted he still desperately wanted to rub at his eyes and to have his thoughts focus he stared at his gloved hands his teeth clenched do you want me to get the chimpanzee order going forbush asked no griff said with sudden renewed determination i still believe my computer program is the fastest and most accurate way forward i believe youre right so we work griff said and we keep at it until we figure out why orions not doing the job ive programmed it to do chapter day pm est residents on the sixth floor of the riverside nursing home eased open their doors and shuffled out into the dimly lit hallway their collective chatter began as a murmur but soon escalated into loud rapidfire exchanges more room doors opened in response to the heightening racket more elderly men and women milled into the corridor some carried canes some made their way with walkers angie emotionally and physically spent sank onto the freight elevators unsteady wood floor her head was beginning to throba pounding bass drum behind her eyes monitoring each heartbeat chen su braced herself against the car wall opposite her the older womans expression was unrevealing her eyes seemed vacant angie wondered how far the terrible events of just minutes ago had already slipped from her consciousness mei wu came racing through the crowd two male orderlies followed her into the elevator carrying flashlights which they directed down into the shaft they said something in chinese and mei let out a gasp which she quickly cut short her hand over her mouth the response to death at riverside angie assumed was seldom louder than a sheet drawn over a face are you okay mei asked angie managed a nod although her vision was drifting in and out of focus youre covered with blood are you cut just my nose i think its broken oh my i will check you over but i think we should get an ambulance you dont look well with the orderlies help angie rose unsteadily to her feet and used their shoulders for balance weve already called the police mei said do you think you can speak to them about what happened here ill try my best and mei ill also do my best to see to it there are no repercussions from that gap in your elevator after all it did save my life before tonight angie felt secrecy was her best hope for safety but genesis had found her despite all her precautions she needed to speak with griff and possibly with the president as well would it help in any way to keep sylvia chens murder a secret if so the fbi had to contact the nypd quickly without any notes from the former head of the veritas project angies mission to new york had been worse than a failure how much should the police be told now griff or allaire would arrange a military escort for her back to kalvesta but first she had to do something that she dreaded mei i need a moment with ms mrs ms li you need to speak to ms li yes can you join us i may need you to interpret ms li speaks perfect english i will still need you once back in room blotting blood with a hand towel mei had brought her angie closed the window then she took hold of the frail veined hand of the woman known there as ms li and motioned her to sit next to her on the bed thank you for saving our lives angie began squinting against the now unremitting pounding behind her forehead that was a very bad man who has hurt and killed many people you acted bravely a very bad man chen su echoed i have terrible news angie said terrible news angie studied the womans face and could see the transformation more clearly now there was natural aging of course where fibers had weakened and skin given way to gravity but the ravages of latestage alzheimers were hauntingly evident there were abrasions on her elbows the skin of her fine face clung to her bones like translucent paper the disease was progressing her life the way fastforward speeds through a dvd the woman looked ninety though she was probably twenty years younger than that you have a daughter the woman gave no response sylvia angie said are you sylvia angie breathed deeply mrs chen sylvia your daughter is dead again mei wu stifled a gasp you are certain she asked i am positive mei i will tell you the details later there was no recognition from chen su not a twitch or any hint of tears to come the man who died in the elevator is the one who killed her angie went on i am very sorry about sylvia in fact there was much else angie was sorry about starting with the papers sylvia promised but could now never deliver would they have helped find the cure for wrx would sylvias knowledge of genesis have been the key to stopping them one of the orderlies appeared at the door and spoke to mei the police are here she said to angie they want to speak to you angie stood unsteadily then she sat back down and embraced the older woman you and your daughter will be in my thoughts and in my prayers chen wu she again rose awkwardly but managed to stay upright then without warning sylvias mother got up from her bed her body trembled as she crossed to her scarred maple dresser with some effort she pulled open the top drawer from inside it beneath some clothes she extracted a fine wooden box inlaid with mother of pearl cut in ornate patterns she handed the box over to angie and said a single word sylvia angie thought momentarily about explaining her daughters death again the vacant look in the old womans eyes told her not to bother instead angie opened the box inside was an envelope there were four words penned on the envelope in neat almost calligraphic printing angie stared at the writing uncomprehending the delay was longer than it might have been had she not taken such a battering to her face and head but half a minute passed then all at once she knew unseen by the others her lips tightened in a ferocious grin yes she thought oh god yes she gazed down at the writing once more recipes from the kitchen chapter day am est the situation was getting more chaotic and more dangerous the virus had been responsible for two deaths in statuary hall and word was several more people were on the brink throughout the capitol morale was in terrible shape tempers were fraying and confidence in the leadership of james allaire was slipping away by the hour ellis was putting as much pressure on the man as she could manage she had landed some decent punches but she knew she hadnt done enough to put him down for the count she needed to get the genesis bill through congress and she needed to put both allaire and tilden out of office there was a way she was thinkinga piece of film that would sway the masses time was slipping away for all of them no more waiting leland gladstones hands were shaking as he scanned the genesis document and then handed it back to his boss he and the speaker of the house were seated in a quiet corner of the gallery level for a time gladstone remained silent his mouth slightly agape and his gaze fixed on the floor so what are you struggling with the most leland ellis asked patiently my being in direct contact with the terrorists or are you having trouble coming to grips with being the aide and possibly the chief of staff of the next president of the united states its all seeming like a dream one minute its business as usual were all dressed up preparing for the presidents state of the union address and the next were locked in here working to get him out of office and take over ellis grinned well certainly this is no worse of a nightmare than when we lost the election hardlyespecially when we were coming so close please dont get me wrong madam speaker i believe in you and i am on your side all the way i have been since the day you hired me surely you know that of course i do leland this is the ultimate lesson i could possibly teach youtrue politics in action its all about flexibility about being ready to change course if necessarybeing prepared to reach out at any moment and snatch the brass ring these new developments of representing genesis and their demands will in no way impact the work of our special committee in fact they make our efforts that much more important gladstone still had a forlorn look how so he asked his voice muted have you lost faith my leland no its just these demands genesis wants you to support youll be disgraced if we try to introduce this bill to congress ellis smiled once more suddenly her brilliant young aide looked very much his age im sure she said when congress learns that if they dont vote for this bill theyll all die mocking me will be the furthest thing from their minds im still not completely certain i understand gladstone said averting his eyes with all due respect madam speaker are you sure you know what youre doing here ellis understood why the question had been so difficult for him to ask the child who loses faith in the parent also loses hope she placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder leland i have never been more sure of anything in my life why do you think it was me whom genesis singled out of all the members of congress and the cabinet locked in here why was i the chosen one i dont knowbecause youre the speaker of the house i suppose nonsense ellis glanced cautiously about the vast chamber aware of the danger should they be overheard in every direction she saw only idleness helplessness and ennui people fidgeted in their seats frustrated bored and restless some had converted blankets into makeshift pillows and were leaning against the person next to them clusters of dignitaries congregated together but fatigue and mounting fear had sapped much of their energy and dampened what had once been animated chatter into nothing more than scattered whispers to ellis they looked like the living dead which according to genesis they were they picked me because its my destiny to lead she responded finally and with your help the world will soon see the mistake they made by not choosing me over allaire in the first place by my help you mean by my drafting this bill that is precisely what i mean leland as soon as you have completed that task ill introduce it to congress and well get it voted on and passed but but even if you get the bill through congress allaire will never sign it into law gladstone said isnt that a prerequisite for genesis giving you the antidote ellis patted her aide on the knee his political acumen was in many respects far beyond his years but in other aspects he was still a babe in the woods thanks to the power genesis is about to give us our special committee work is going to be fasttracked soon well have enough proof to impeach allaire even assuming you can get allaire out of the picture vice president tilden will step in and veto the bill just the same well you just leave the little stumbling block of henry tilden to me ellis said i assure you he will be an impediment easily overcome so you plan to impeach allaire for mackeys murder ellis grinned that i do my friend mackeys death and how about seven hundred plus counts of attempted murder and you believe the threat from this virus is as grave as genesis claims it is ellis pointed a finger at gladstone to emphasize that the issue he had hit upon was a significant one ive been pondering that very question myself she said let me ask you something why do you think allaire had us all separated into groups to help manage the distribution of resources during the quarantine period gladstone replied quickly ah dear leland that explanation sounded lame to me when allaire tried to foist it on us in the first place and it sounds as lame as a threelegged hog now assuming it is just another one of his lies i ask you to reason out why we were sent to different rooms gladstone had to think only briefly assuming the threat is real and allaire knows how deadly it is then he might be attempting to control the spread of the virus now youre cooking leland and how would that best be done for the first time gladstone firmly met elliss gaze with his own by separating out the most severely infected elliss expression was that of a proud teacher toward her star pupil do you recall she said how i asked you to map out where the explosions had occurred and who was sitting in each area of course lets look at that list gladstone stretched his long legs to extract several folded pieces of paper from the front pocket of his tuxedo pants then he handed the sheets to ellis the speaker carefully read them over folded them again and returned the stack to him you have about forty names here she said those are the ones i could get people at the center of the blasts including those seated next to in front of or in back of each ground zero and tell me do you know the present location of archibald jakes or senator cogan ellis picked two names from gladstones list that she had personally seen take a hit i believe theyre in c group have you had any contact with c group no gladstone said and do you know where group c is currently residing from what ive heard theyre in the senate chamber but thats just rumor and not something ive confirmed in that case i think i should go and confirm it for myself is your blackberry charged it is gladstone said thanks to your standing up to allaire i still have it you look troubled leland what is it youre not allowed to leave this chamber how do you plan to get across the capitol complex to the senate ellis favored gladstone with a mischievous smile because of sean oneils um not so minor transgressions i still have my hand cupped around his balls i think its about time i gave them a good hard squeeze chapter day am est from the recesses of the upper gallery ellis watched sean oneil patrol the aisles of the house chamber he looked ill at ease and avoided any eye contact with the anxious faces that he passed perhaps feeling as if he were being held responsible in some way for their plight ellis felt some pity for the man he was at once prisoner and jailer neither of them very enviable positions at least amid this mess she had a purposesome control and power over her fate soon enough though oneil would have some purpose as well and once allaire and his vice presidential toady were put in their places once she was president she would reward the secret service agents assistance by keeping him on staff pledged to take a bullet for her the speaker descended the carpeted stairwell to the chamber floor level approached oneil from behind and tapped him on the shoulder he spun around reaching for his gun easy cowboy she said maybe its time to switch over to decaf oneil glared at her next time you come up on me like that dont expect me to stop we need to talk ellis said im busy right now oh doing what the president asked me to make some observations and report back to him observations check and see how people are holding up oooo sounds important what do you want i told you to talk please ellis motioned to a dark corner where she felt assured theyd have a modicum of privacy oneil grumbled an unintelligible protest but followed her anyway okay the agent said when it seemed they were safely out of earshot of others what do you want to talk about where is archibald jakes ellis asked the navy chief of staff is there another i dont know are we going to be difficult sean that depends are you going to keep trying to talk to me i have a web browser on this blackberry ellis said waving the device in her hand at waist level so that only he could see do you have any pictures of your kid i can bring up i love children you know had some myself once upon a time you are really a bitch its so nice how we can work together for the greater good and still make time to share our personal lives as well you keep my son out of this oneil growled ellis made a tsktsk sound her expression one of mock sorrow i am sorry sean she said but unless you cooperate that is simply not an option look heres the deal i need you to get me egress from this chamber a passage that is presently denied to me and then and then take me to wherever jakes is holed up the agent considered the request i want your word never to mention my son again but i said never goodness this is a snippy side of you i never knew existed all right then you cooperate and get me to archie jakes and i wont say another word about your kid oneil mulled over the pledge for a second time jakes is in the senate chamber he said finally i thought you said you didnt know where he was i lied i know it rubs off from allaire so get me in there not that simple i dont have the key a key you mean to tell me the head of the joint chiefs of staff is locked inside the senate chamber yes along with the rest of group c tell me sean have you asked yourself why that might be no youre either very trusting of your president or dreadfully uncurious both my job is to guard not question well if you want that job of yours to continue i suggest you get me inside that room i cant do that oneil said cant or wont does it matter youre a really dreadful liar sean way out of your league here i know you have a key to the senate id bet my right arm on it thats how certain i am go to hell do you know about my recently formed special committee i do youre investigating mackeys death mackeys murder thats right which means i will be having a whole lot of interaction with our dear president which means plenty of opportunities to let my knowledge of your extracurricular activities in the lincoln bedroom slip out perhaps if he and i mend our fences enough hed even grant me a temporary reprieve from this lovely chamber to retrieve the photographs of you and whateverhernameis that i stashed away in my office safe for a rainy day dear agent oneil how could you not know that everything that happens in the white house is recorded one way or another oneil grimaced and said i want those photographs of course you do but either you get me into that chamber or allaire and the judge preceding over your custody battle get first looks ellis watched the agents jaw muscles tighten come with me he said in a coarse whisper they circled in front of the rostrum and headed along the passageway leading across the capitol at a doorway two agents stood guard both looked extremely capable oneil introduced ellis to them jill he said the president asked me to escort speaker ellis to the senate didnt come over the radio the woman replied well he asked a while ago but i forgot until she just reminded me lots going on the other agent commented easy to forget last night they ordered the security detail off the senate doors now they just do a walkby every two hours any idea why ellis asked nope orders are orders i guess as far as i know the only one whos been going in there is dr townsend the presidents doc thats strange what isnt around here the guard said i wonder what shes looking for well thanks scott oneil said he led ellis forward a step but the guards remained in place and exchanged questioning looks do you mind if we take a look at your hands jill asked theres noting there oneil said thats one of the things the president has had me looking for he held out his hands palms up and motioned for ellis to do the same whats this all about she asked beats us the agent named scott said but secretary salitas has us checking anyone who comes this way agent oneil do you know whats going on her expression was serpentine ellis held her palms up for the guards oneil shrugged were looking for some sort of red patterna circle or swirl if we see anyone who has it one palm or both were supposed to send them to salitas interesting ellis said interesting whens the next walkby supposed to happen fifteen minutes right when our shift ends thanks you two well probably be back before you leave the two guards stepped aside and allowed the speaker and oneil to pass ellis quickened her pace they descended to the first floor of the capitol complex ellis was accustomed to the stairwells and corridors bustling with activity but the only footsteps she heard now were their own the odd silence evoked a childhood memory of being locked inside a museum after closing time they followed the house connecting corridor through the crypt where doric columns helped support the huge central rotunda and then passed into the senate connecting corridor finally they ascended to the senate chamber itself outside the door was a cardboard sign printed in neat magic marker that warned authorized personnel only to the right of the sign hanging on a coatrack inside a small plastic ultraviolet chamber was a single blue biocontainment suit the chamber bore a label written on tape that read dr b townsend only one suit for one person ellis said dont you think thats a little strange no i think thats a lot strange oneil replied explanation townsend doesnt want anyone else going in there except her probably so but why the suit shes been exposed the same as the rest of us could it be that the risk of exposure inside the senate is even greater than in the rest of the building a padlock connected the ends of a thick steel chain that was looped between the semicircular brass pull handles of the chambers double doors ellis flicked a manicured finger toward it im not doing this oneil said the problem with you dear sean ellis replied with icy calm is that you cant think without orders i need to see exactly whats going on in there and why these people have been locked away so heres my order to you open that goddamn door or i swear to you ill make ruining your life my fulltime occupation reluctantly the agent took out his key and inserted it into the padlock they could hear sounds coming from inside some of what they heard sounded like coughing but mixed in with those sounds were what might have been screams then they heard a noise that was even more distinctiveand getting louder somebody on the other side of the door was clawing at the wood i dont think we should be doing this oneil said again i only need a minute in there sean ellis demanded turn the damn key and so he did chapter day am cst griff was asleep at one of the two tables in the small library when he was roused by a gentle hand on his shoulder he shot upright flailing to maintain his balance his hand caught two tall stacks of reference books sending them flying standing beside him forbush looked down with undisguised concern you fell asleep he said the understatement of the day griff replied thickly i seem to remember you pledging to check on me every fifteen minutes i did you must have just passed out griff nodded and caught a glimpse of his haggard reflection in the dark glass of the nearby videoconferencing system his beard was making a rapid reappearance not unlike the ground cover after the eruption of the mount st helens volcano but his sunken cheeks and hollow eyes were most disturbing exceeding even what he remembered from his time in the alcatraz of the rockies the videoconferencing system had a direct link to the capitol and allaire was expecting an update from griff in the morning the news griff planned on sharing would not be well received did you at least find anything useful in these reference books forbush asked maybe griff said no matter what it was worth getting out of that suit even for a short while still i need more time to think just like russell crowe in a beautiful mind he was always thinking too didnt he turn out to be insane that all depends on your definition of the term terrific somethings missing melvin im thinking if we could give orion a nudgemaybe from an adjuvant of some kind that boosts the immunologic response would an adjuvant be toxic possibly but certainly no less toxic than whats already inside those poor souls in the capitol before forbush could respond the fax machine in the corner of the library beeped that it was receiving a transmission who could possibly be faxing us griff asked forbush crossed to the machine it could be from ms angie i gave her this number with instructions that it would be the safest way to communicate with us really are you sure a fax transmission cant be intercepted by genesis melvin turned back to him and shrugged as sure as i can be where theyre concerned he said theyre a shifty bunch so how can you be so confident i found a phone number on the internet that supposedly will produce a short tone if the landline is bugged and a longer one if it isnt i checked and according to that program at least the line was clear thats putting a lot of faith in the web griff said sometimes boss we reach the point when faith is the only thing we have left good quote what movie is that from the one im going to produce when i win publishers clearing house forbush was chuckling as he gathered the fax pages from the printer tray then abruptly he stopped griff this fax isnt from angie its about her griff leapt up and crossed the small library in two steps the logo on the fax cover sheet was from the riverside nursing home in manhattan read it out loud forbush said his expression uncharacteristically grim griffs throat tightened at the first lines of the note handwritten inside the cover sheets comment box my name is mei wu i am the duty nurse at riverside nursing home in new york city this is regarding angela fletcher who is in the hospital the rest of the note was typed on a computer before ms fletcher collapsed griff read she admitted to forging health inspector documents to gain access to our residents she was desperate to find a woman named sylvia chen she believed chens mother was a resident here i am sorry to inform you that sylvia chen is dead i only know that ms fletcher said she was i have no details on that ms fletcher was being chased by a very bad man when she sustained a head injury from which she eventually lost consciousness we had her transported by ambulance to lower manhattan hospital i have no update on her condition at present the man chasing her died in a fall down our elevator shaft before she collapsed ms fletcher was given a box by a resident here whom we knew as ms li it now appears that ms li is actually sylvia chens mother chen su inside the box was an envelope labeled recipes from the kitchen with some papers apparently belonging to sylvia ms fletcher regained consciousness long enough to ask me to fax these pages to you she believes this information might be critical to your work and to what is happening in washington dc you can reach me here if necessary dr rhodes you should know that despite deceiving us ms fletcher acted with extreme bravery and saved the life of chen su i will never forget her melvin weve got to get a call to lower manhattan hospital in new york i wouldnt advise that forbush said assuming the man who was after ms angie in new york was with genesis weve got to believe the leak to them was somewhere here in kalvesta what should we do that depends on what griff asked on whether or not you have any friends in high places allaire i believe were set up for secure communications with him why not go that route put yourself in for a raise melvin listen let me finish looking at this stuff from sylvia and then well get ahold of allaire and see if he can insert himself on angies behalfat least make sure shes getting the best care from the best doctors poor sylvia mixed up with the wrong crowd and so desperate to succeed in her work i wonder how she died with all those people looking for her and none of them finding her i sort of thought she might have fallen on hard times hopefully angies okay and can tell us what happened griff flipped to the next page in the stack chens lab reports followed a very consistent format and griff did not have to study the pages long to know that they were in fact written by her but the contents of the reports were not associated with any experiments that he had ever seen the same title was printed on the upper right of every page the certain path the test subjects most likely monkeys were each identified in a code griff had never seen before the reports one sheet for each animal included basic information about sex cage number viral dose route of administration and antiviral treatment as well as the dates and times of each run sylvia knew that griff had drawn the line at her performing experiments on chimpanzees but she also knew that he seldom set foot in the hells kitchen animal facility was it possible she had somehow managed to sneak some chimps into her lab if so why had she taken the results away from the kitchenespecially when they did not seem to have been any more successful than the rest of her primate work and how did she get the sheets of paper through the sterilizing showers and uv lights the questions gnawed at griff the recorded results noted clinical signs along with quantity of virus injected or given by inhalation in every instance but one speed of death was directly proportional to the size of the inoculum these could have been any number of chens past lab reports what made them so special the answer to this and griffs other questions was on the final page as he read them he felt his blood turn to ice the test animals were identified not only by code but by first initial and last name griff grabbed a legal pad and wrote down the identifying code of each test subject then the name beside each name he wrote sylvias recorded result dwm s coughlin m deceased dbf g anderson f deceased dbm t geffman m deceased dwm l warshalski m deceased dwm m scheffer m deceased dwm j r davis m robotlike he handed the page to forbush who scanned the names with the same disbelieving expression as griff this is terrible he said with his characteristic lack of excessive emotion if its true melvin then its worse than that the certain paththe certain path to a cure i guess thats what the title on each page must mean griff could only stare down at the report i know sylvia was desperate to keep the program going he said but i never would have dreamed she was this desperate no more monkeys forbush said with a shrug no more monkeys griff echoed she took the leap and somehow began experimenting on people and they all died assuming she just neglected to mark that in next to j r daviss name they all died leaving us with one huge unanswered question where could these subjects have come from and i guess one other huge unanswered question forbush added where did she do the work chapter day am est ellis checked that gladstones blackberry was powered on and set to capture video she was keyed up and tense in all the best sense of the words jim allaire had kept her in the dark long enough it was time she documented what was really going on and just how much they all had to fear from this virus beside her oneil looked as if his legs were about to betray him his complexion mirrored the white of the marble floor inches away the clamor and the scraping sound on the other side of the door continued the secret service agent uncoiled the length of chain securing the senate chamber doors the steel links slid through his hands and clattered into a heap at his feet ellis cupped her ear and listened against the door nothing she said i have no idea what that sound could have been but its gone now i think youre crazy to go in there we dearest we are going in there and were going to be quick about it too in and out with a little video in between that will be all i need judging from dr townsends containment suit over there these people are infected with something pretty horrible whatever it is weve been exposed too but im betting that whatever it is these poor souls got a mega dose its time to see just how much your boss has been holding out on us all dont you want to know i mean it is your life too i dont know oneil i promise you if we stay only a minute just enough time to let me gather the video i need well both be fineespecially if we hold our breath now lets go oneil sighed and pulled the door open the first thing ellis noticed as she stepped forward into the main aisle of the senate chamber was the smell it was a foul stench of blood bodily waste and vomit unlike anything she had experienced before her throat immediately tightened as her gag reflex kicked in she wondered if the standing fans installed throughout the room were somehow keeping the powerful odor from escaping through the door cracks the room lights were on full and what ellis saw as she fumbled for her camera made her cry out in fright the golden damask above the marbled wainscot was stained with blood and fecal matter white marble busts of past senate presidents normally set in bowl niches in the gallery level were either smashed missing or lying on the floor but even more disturbing was that the one hundred mahogany senators desks had been ripped from their footings and thrown aside replaced by a number of cotsat least twenty or twentyfive of them mostly occupied and many by people she knew now barely recognizable to her some of those in the chamber wore the comfortable clothing that had been delivered to the capitol but there were a few othersthe most debilitatedwho were still wearing what remained of their tuxedoes and designer gowns they were lying listlessly or vomiting congealing blood into blue plastic buckets wired to the bedframes some were writhing in pain others were propped on one elbow moaning piteously for half a minute ellis stood transfixed the purpose of her mission forgotten she heard a terrible shriek and turned in that direction the senior senator from missouri a genteel dignified man in his seventies was pressing his hands on either side of his head groaning for the pain to stop blood from a nosebleed or perhaps his stomach stained the sheet beneath him he screamed again and slapped at his expansive abdomen as though trying to put out a fire burning inside then suddenly he turned his head and vomited into the bucketblack blood thick as oil ellis managed to raise her camera and pan the scene this was not the flu nor was it any other virus she could imagine weve got to get out of here she said her voice barely able to form the words oneil was rooted many of these dignitaries were also people he knew well finally he managed a few baby steps back toward the door ellis stayed close to him then they turned to run but admiral archibald jakes had materialized in the center of the aisle and was blocking their only way out he was a grotesquerie his stained dress whites were ripped in many places the rows of service ribbons over his left breast had gaps resembling a hockey players teeth the sclerae of his eyes were bloodred his cheeks were sunken and his lower jaw was in constant motiona gnawing skull the admiral lifted his hands to prevent oneil and her from passing and ellis gasped his palms were a swirl of crimson concentric circles giving the appearance of having had the design branded on on the surface of the swirls were hundreds of tiny raised blisters many of them broken and oozing home please take me home jakes moaned his voice was a coarse whisper and his breath was foul admiral whats going on in here oneil managed to ask whats happening to you whos helping you all dying were all dying each word the admiral spoke emerged like a hiss of steam why did you do this to me no it wasnt us oneil said it was genesis its some sort of virus you lie you lie ellis sensed movement behind her and turned to see that others in the room were now gathering behind her like zombies blocking their only retreat from jakes some of them had been friends and colleagues of hers for many years all of them were illterribly terribly ill it was also impossible not to see the bright red patterns on their palms admiral jakes please oneil pleaded let us by well get you help i promise the navy mans eyes were wild no help you lie you lie jakes drove forward with surprising quickness and wrapped his fingers around oneils throat the secret service agent batted jakess hands aside but in an instant the admiral lunged again clawing at his face drawing blood stop oneil shouted die die like me jakes continued flailing at the much younger man blood from the angry gouges ran down oneils cheek soaking his shirt collar ellis screamed as the small crowd began folding in around them at that instant the scene was frozen by a gunshot smoke rose from the pistol at oneils waist the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff dropped to his knees then toppled in slow motion onto his back staring sightlessly at the high ornate ceiling a scarlet stain instantly began expanding from the bullet hole in his jacket the advancing crowd pulled back as the pistol in oneils hand smoked the stench of gunpowder merged with the other odors in the room lets go now he barked at ellis clutching her blackberry the speaker grasped oneils coat sleeve and allowed herself to be dragged outside the senate chamber the dying men and women were again moving in when oneil pushed the doors closed ellis looped the chain tightly through the handles and leaned against the doors with all her strength as oneil snapped the lock then gasping for air exhausted and rattled the two of them slumped against the wall the din and scratching from within had resumed but with a difference somewhere amidst the mob on the other side of the door lay the body of the chief of the united states navy ellis checked her phone she had recorded everything chapter day am cst rhodes can you hear me loud and clear listen angies been hurt genesis somehow followed her to new york and tried to kill her i havent called the hospital where she is because i really dont trust that this line is secure it doesnt seem like anything is down here i want you to have the fbi find out where she is and send some people to watch out for her im not giving you the details but send some men over to the riverside nursing home theyll know where she is and what name shes been admitted under but do it quick and make sure she has the best doctors what in the hell is she doing in new york ill tell you soon i dont have time for this right now okay ill call you back twenty minutes later the video conference was renewed weve got her allaire said shes in the icu subdural hematomathats bleeding between the skull and the brain i have people on the way over there now surgery i dont think yet some subdurals dont ever require it shes in a good hospital for trauma but ill get a neurosurgeon over there right away thank you sir i really appreciate that so whats going on there the situation is getting worse here by the minute allaire said what have you got for us unfortunately i still have lots of questions and few answers but were working around the clock the highdefinition video transmission put allaires raddled appearance in sharp focus dark stubble on his characteristically cleanshaven face made his ashen complexion and gaunt expression all the more disconcerting griffs own image as it was shown to him in a small square at the screens top left corner looked no less bleak than allaires whats your status the president asked as of this moment angies made more progress than i haveor you for that matter what do you mean she figured out that sylvia chen might be in new york and she was right only genesis must have somehow picked up on where she was going dont ask me how they knew they seem to know everything they sent a man after angie and tried to kill her what about chen did angie actually find her griff nodded i believe so but shes dead i have no details yet as to how or when the guy genesis sent is dead too it seems as if angie managed to take him down before she lost consciousness we need to id that body asap i assume the new york police have it ill alert the fbi right away it might be the break weve been looking for to figure out whos behind all this she was supposed to be there in kansas watching you why couldnt you have let me get the fbi on this griff could feel himself beginning to boil dr allaire he said with forced control angela fletcher risked her life for you and the others in the capitol she just accomplished in a couple of days what all those fbi agents couldnt do in a year lets leave it at that i just want to make sure that shes protected allaire calmed himself with a deep breath but his eyes flashed of course he said remember what genesis has accomplished so far its like theyre everywhere allaire sighed audibly the fbi will be at ms fletchers hospital room within the hour and i want enough rhodes how are you progressing with your work griff brushed a knot of matted hair from his forehead he tensed as he readied himself to break the news im afraid at this moment im not much closer to a solution than i was before my arrest this virus is from hell maybe we should rename it genesis because its always a step ahead of us with griffs weak attempt at levity allaire snapped his pallid complexion turned crimson in a blink his mouth contorted teeth bared glaring at the camera he snatched up a glass of water from the hard rooms conference table griff watched with growing astonishment as the man with his finger on the nuclear trigger cocked his arm back and then sent the glass shattering against a wall you cannot fail allaire screamed his face a foot from the camera do you hear me rhodes do you frigging understand me i can put you back in prison right now right goddamn now ill get someone else down there someone who has a clue give me some promise some positive results or ill destroy you do you understand me his body was shaking his eyes wild with rage sir griff pleaded please calm down you need to calm yourself gary salitas stepped in front of the camera and griff watched him place his hands on allaires shoulders the president grabbed his defense secretary by one wrist and rotated it until the man cried out in pain and released his hold bethany townsend suddenly burst into view followed by a pair of secret service agents with the camera angle and all the commotion it was impossible for griff to follow the action when the bodies cleared townsend was leaning over the conference table looking directly into the camera the slightly built physician was breathless and flushed dr rhodes we are going to have to reschedule this call she said the president is in no condition at the moment to continue secretary salitas and i will see to it that ms fletcher is looked after wait wait griff heard allaire shout from off camera moments later the president returned to his seat townsend hovered close by as did the agents allaire was still hyperventilating but quickly his breathing slowed and his color became more sanguine he straightened his tie and used his hands as a combsmall gestures but enough to restore some of his lost demeanor rhodes im terrified my outburst is just the virus at work he said in a panicky whispered voice its happening in small pockets in both a and b groups irritability beyond what should be expected under the circumstances uncontrolled outbursts arguments even fistfights sir can you please hold your palms up to the camera griff breathed a relieved sigh when he saw they were unremarkable were running out of time rhodes allaire continued its getting worse but i dont have to tell you that do i chapter day am cst the presidents infection was becoming manifest griff had no more doubt about that fact than he did about the trouble his own work was in the man was brittle and irascible talking to him was like playing catch using a ticking bomb for a ball no sir griff managed you dont have to tell me how serious this all is you mentioned a and b group any update from c allaires expression turned doleful his face etched by regret weve had some deaths there he said weve implemented increased biocontainment safety protocols to allow medical personnel continued access to the victims in c but im afraid its too dangerous to allow that to continue the people in there are sick and many are going mad everyone in c group is going to die its a given now were praying for you to save the rest of us we did have one significant development griff said allaires voice became immediately energized what is it griff had made the statement without much thought he now decided on the spot not to reveal what hed learned of sylvia chens secret experiments for all he knew allaire might have authorized them for now he angie and melvin were alone in this fight it was the only way they could ensure there would be no more leaks or attempts to sabotage their efforts whats the news allaire demanded again some of my work is having a little effect on the computer model of the virus were going to experiment with adding some adjuvants those are chemical boosters yes exactly i am looking to see if we can pump up the immunological response of our current treatment good allaire said keep the people at the cdc in the loop they might have suggestions for adjuvants that could help ill do that do you have any specific chemicals in mind based on our results so far there are some possibilities griff said i have melvin doing research were not wasting any time on sleep do you want more help i dont have time to bring them up to speed and i dont have the facilities how much have you told the media and the people there in the capitol about wrx i actually i havent told them anything at all they still think were dealing with a variant of influenza at least most of them do not good griff muttered what mr president maybe the crowd would be a little easier to deal with if they knew the extent of what youre dealing with once again allaires expression began to morph the tension in his voice rose rhodes he said why dont you let me do my job as the president while you do your job as virus man and find a treatment for whats killing us from his spot by the door forbush suddenly cut into the conversation as if he was unaware that it was going on griff ive been thinking rhodes whos there allaire snapped griff held a finger up to his lips to quiet melvin then he pointed to the videoconference monitor its me melvin mr allaire forbush said clearly unimpressed that he had just interrupted a private meeting between his boss and the most powerful man on earth griff stifled a grin no wonder he enjoyed being around his friend as much as he did this is about the list of names melvin said ignoring allaire completely ive been searching for death certificates but i think thats going about it the wrong way what death certificates the president demanded what are you talking about melvin is working on dr chens animal death reports griff said with theatrical exaggeration she gave each animal a certificate so we can easily reference them it was hardly one of forbushs strengths but griff hoped his assistant would pick up on his expression and allow the lie to hold still he turned his back to the camera so that his assistant alone could see him put his finger to his lips after ten seconds of uncertainty forbush saw the light and nodded that he understood mr president griff said im not sure youve met melvin forbush before grinning broadly forbush bent low put his face eight inches or so from the camera and waved hello to the president with the fingers of one hand allaire seemed to calm down a notch mr forbush he said i want to thank you personally for your dedication and service to the country its a job forbush said im doing my best and no matter how exhausted dr rhodes is hes doing his best too good allaire responded now both of you get back to it because the way things are right now you both need to do better than your best with that the screen went dark well that sure went swimmingly griff said sighing i guess id be a little tense too if someone told me i didnt have much time left you didnt say that its not what you say that counts melvin its what people hear an hour passed griff spent most of it staring across the small room at nothing in particular his exhaustion seemed overshadowed by the feelings of impotence at not being able to get more out of sylvia chens recipesher notes on what appeared to be experiments performed on human subjects hey there forbush said from the doorway are you ready to get back to work griff sighed and stretched the tightness from his neck and shoulders yeah im ready good because i told the president of the united states you were trying your best im suffering from brain lock melvin that happens when i get real tired its like im incapable of looking at a problem from more than one perspective thats strange my problem is that i always see problems from too many perspectives speaking of which yes one of the perspectives ive been thinking about that i almost forgot to mention has to do with sylvias list of names did you connect with any of them no forbush said but ive been wondering if maybe the names in chens lab reports could be bogus bogus a code within a code do you think the president knew anything about these tests i dont know what to think griff said forbush pulled over a chair and sat down beside him well something has been bugging me about the reports he said go on its the heading on each page the certain path why does that bug you i assume its just sylvias way of saying this is the certain path to making wrx a workable agent and keeping the lab in operation maybe have you ever seen the movie dead men dont wear plaid steve martin griff quickly recalled i think i saw it but maybe ive just seen clips it came out a while ago in to be precise carl reiner directed it and cowrote the script with martin and george gripe who died a few years later from an allergic reaction to a bee sting we can probably do without the trivia right now melvin in case you couldnt tell were sort of at a serious dead end well theres a point here okay sorry dont let me take my grouchiness out on you you dont deserve it but the good thing is i can handle it forbush said so youre forgiven in advance but listen griff in the film martins character is investigating the disappearance of rachel wards father a scientist named dr forrest played by george gaynes this helps us how griff asked forbush held up a hand to urge patience hey easy does it he said in the movie business delivery is everything sorry griff said again before he disappeared dr forrest leaves lists of notes that martin keeps on finding throughout the film one list he titled friends of carlotta and the other he called enemies of carlotta go on the big break in the case comes when philip marlowe whos played by footage of humphrey bogart from the big sleep tips martins character off that carlotta wasnt a person it was a placean island off peru griffs impatience gave way to intrigue so so what if the certain path isnt chens way of suggesting that she was on the right track but an actual place griffs eyes narrowed he pulled his laptop computer over opened a web browser to google and typed in quotes the certain path he clicked the first link in the resultant set then leaned back in his chair to study the page moments later a look of astonishment washed over his face well ill be he said griff turned the screen to forbush and used the computer mouse to highlight two lines of text the highlighted words read the certain path mission wichita kansas chapter day am cst the certain path mission web site was a simple design featuring a photograph of the building and some modest graphics its mission statement was prominently displayed at the top of the homepage drug addiction and alcoholism can be cured but only by walking the certain path according to the web sites about us section the ministrys founder brother xavier bartholomew was a recovered alcoholicaddict himself it says here brother bartholomew was on the verge of death griff said drugs had drained him of the will to live and then he heard a voice and it saved his life and guided him along the certain path to health and purpose let me guess melvin said god spoke to him and told him to open a ministry to help other addicts get clean have you been to this web site before ive just seen a lot of movies melvin said and as often as not the characters in those films arent who they seem to be is there anything on brother bartholomew that he wouldnt want posted on his web site like dirt griff asked if thats the same as skeletons in his closet griff did another search tracking a sequence of links in the search results for more information seems like we have enough dirt for a landfill he said after a short while he opened a youtube video of a wichita tv news report the videos title was an obvious attempt at tongueincheek humor the not so certain path the reporter was an attractive blond woman with a short stylish hairdo and a scrubbed cornfed glow griff turned up the volume on his laptops small speakers deb rosen reporting from the certain path mission in wichita where the ministrys founder brother xavier bartholomew has been arrested and charged with multiple counts of assault and battery the charges against bartholomew stem from a complaint filed by this man karl larson who came to the certain path ministry seeking treatment for his drug addiction the video showed an unshaven man in his fifties with tangles of grayblack unwashed hair and murky eyes that supported the label underneath his picture homeless drug addict the shot cut back to the reporter at the ministry mr larson deb rosen said claims that brother bartholomew offered him help for what he said was a decadeslong addiction to narcotics and alcohol but what brother bartholomew was offering turned out to be anything but helpful the video swung to karl larson the street person responded to the reporters queries in a gruff raspy voice i thought the certain path was about praying and stuff larson said but after a little while i couldnt do the meditation and the hours and hours of praying and no matter how hard i tried i couldnt stay clean and sober thats when brother bartholomew began to beat me he put me in a cell in the basement to keep me away from the booze and drugs then hed beat me on my back and butt with straps and ropes and even canes sometimes hed tie me up he told me it was the only way to get the demon out we may be homeless and desperate but we still got pride and we dont deserve to be beaten like dogs even though as brother bartholomew says over and over its for our own good larson held his tattooed arms up to the camera to show they were bruised and scarred the next shot cut from the drifter back to the outside of the ministry where the camera followed the reporter around the perimeter of the aged redbrick building with a red neon sign running down one corner that read simply mission according to prosecutors mr larson was not the only addict subjected to brother bartholomews unusual brand of aversion therapy the next transition showed the outside of a police station the bottom graphic identified the officer interviewed as lieutenant erik olsen of the wichita kansas police department we have several alleged victims of xavier bartholomew who have come forward to file complaints the matter is under investigation so i cannot comment further at this time and yet in another twist to this story of good intentions gone bad deb rosens voice said from off camera not all of the addicts who have sought out brother bartholomew for help have been treated as karl larson allegedly was the man in the next shot looked to be everything larson was not he was brighteyed cleanshaven well dressed and smiling the undergraphic identified him as paul silasky recovered alcoholicaddict i would have died if it werent for brother bartholomew silasky said same for a lot of others too i tried everything na aa you name the twelvestep program and i did it nothing worked for me until i found brother bartholomew i dont consider the certain paths way a punishment its a path to freedoma way to life the segment finished with the reporter across the street from the mission the graphic shown in the upper right corner of the screen was a photograph of brother bartholomew a man in his fifties with a round cherubic face and a horseshoe head of silver hair absent in the front down past his shoulders in the back he wore a bright floraldesigned shirt underneath a heavy dark brown wool monks robe chains of brightly colored beadsturquoise reds and bluesdangled around his neck some of the necklaces had ornaments attached but none were of any religious symbol that griff recognized community activists social workers and other mental health professionals have been uniform in their condemnation of the certain paths alleged methods the reporter said some are opposed to the ministry and its soup kitchen remaining open to the public in the meantime brother xavier bartholomew is free on bail and back at work a trial date is projected for sometime next year bartholomew and his attorney declined our requests for an interview youtube faded to black griff pointed to the stats that showed the video had originally been uploaded four years ago and over that time had amassed only views guess a video about abusing drug addicts isnt going to sweep the world griff said certainly not like all those dancing overweight cats with ten million views apiece forbush replied i think i need to try and find brother bartholomew and get some answers for ourselves whats so important melvin asked because if were right and chen was experimenting on people i would assume that the subjects were referred to her by bartholomew its possible whats possible for a man of the cloth to go bad in night of the hunter robert mitchumone of my favorite actors incidentallyplays harry powell a serial killer and selfproclaimed preacher who has love tattooed on the knuckles of one hand and hate on the other then theres reverend phillip shooter in hot fuzz and of course cardinal richelieu in all the three musketeer movies and spinoffs those are just for starters now that i think about it theres melvin i get the point i want to know how these people were chosen where they were treated and what was done to them and most of all i want to know what happened to j r davis was he just some sort of clerical error on sylvias part or is he still alive griff held up daviss lab report distinguished from the others in the fax set by a result that did not conclude with the word deceased could bartholomew be in jail forbush asked that news report was from a few years ago griff surfed the web some more it says here the case against him was dropped a few months before trial that was about two years ago doesnt say anything about the ministry closing down and allaire cant know about this melvin asked allaire might have orchestrated all of this griff said i dont know the man well enough he doesnt trust me anyway what if he ordered chen to conduct human experiments youd think he would have told me if he knew chen was dosing people with the virus but im just not sure if hes involved he might decide im going to use this stuff against him or else hell think im just setting it up to give me leverage to bolt for now melvin nobody else can know about thisat least not until we know more ourselves its better to ask forgiveness than permission can you sneak me out of here the way you did angie what about our work orion our experiments griff rubbed at his eyes what experiments are we going to continue melvin he asked his voice cracking the ones that arent working the ones that never had a chance to work i was on this job for years at columbia then here before they arrested me find a way to keep wrx from killing peoplethat was my original assignment and i failed a lot of scientists fail thats just the way it is we fail and we fail until one day we shift gears and change direction and something works so now im being asked to do in a week or two what i couldnt accomplish in years you tell me what im leaving we could lose a lot of time it could be the end of the line for the people in the capitol im telling you melvin its the end of the line already ive done everything i can think of if this j r davis really did survive his wrx infection then we might have something we might have that change of direction forbush sat pensively for a while then said i dont believe we should take the chance of trying to sneak you out in the trunk why not i think angie and i were lucky now that we actually did it i would bet eight out of ten times wed be caught maybe they were under orders to let her go so she could be followed now that you mention it that seems possible i lied to the guards about a critical experiment being in jeopardy unless i got to town for some supplies we didnt have so they might have been in a rush plus i do asthma attacks well because i actually have it the guard was rummaging through the glove compartment for my inhaler when angie slipped into the trunk so the trunk isnt going to work what else what about the exhaust system griff saw the possibilities immediately how many of the ventilation ducts have surface access outside the wire only one forbush said we have a dedicated singlepass air exhaust discharge for the kitchen ventilation system that pumps hepafiltered air to the surface it was intentionally installed far from occupied buildings and the other air intake vents its interlocked with the other subsurface supply and exhaust fans to prevent positive pressurization in the kitchen labs how wide is that vent shaft big enough to fit you inside if thats what youre thinking thats what im thinking but not a heck of a lot bigger in diameter than that plus from what i recall after it leaves the kitchen the duct makes a pretty intense vertical rise there are not many sharp bends in ductwork or long horizontal runs because those put a lot of strain on the exhaust fans on the plus side the discharge is well outside the perimeter of the base so nobody would see me exit not even if they were using searchlights how do i get in first you have to be suited so thats going to make the work harder what tools do i need a screwdriver and ratchet should do it youll have to remove the prefilters first then the hepa filter from its housing clear the bags from the safety and cinching straps and such the blower too piece of cake thats some cake is the exhaust system alarmed it is but i can shut that down how long will it take me from the kitchen to the surface forbush pondered the question twenty minutes i would guess youre going to have to shimmy your way to the top that will be the hard part keep your hands and feet pressed to the sides of the duct and inch your way up sounds tough if you slip youll fall like you were on one of those giant water chutes you could twist an ankle or break a bone when you hit bottom in which case youd never get back up to the safety grate you dont sound very optimistic that depends on how well you kept yourself in shape in that cell give yourself thirty minutes instead of the twenty i said theres a ladder bolted into the duct at the far end that should help griff checked his watch i have a couple of things i want to finish in the lab ill be ready to go at two this afternoonno make it three thirty itll be almost dark then if it takes me longer than we think i dont want you waiting around in the dark in the middle of noplace can i just climb out at the other end the safety grate is heavy you wont be able to push it off without a winch pulling from the other side do we have one of those in the machine shop i think i should be able to attach it to the trailer hitch on my taurus then its settled griff said meet me at four oclock by the grate the intercom system buzzed its shrill alarm it was loud enough to be heard even inside spacesuits and it happened whenever somebody surfaceside wanted to speak to someone below all of the phones subsurface had an instant pushbutton connection to the topside communication post rhodes here griff said into the phones receiver rhodes its sergeant stafford hows it going down there lets just say that if this were easy everybody would be doing it not me the soldier replied ive already seen what that virus can do listen an unexpected surprise visitor just flew in he wants to meet with you right away who is it griff asked rolling his eyes at forbush im really busy its the guy who unless you can deliver is now just a few heartbeats away from the presidencyhomeland security secretary paul rappaportour designated survivor chapter day am est the tension evident in bethany townsends expression made ellis uneasy there was a look of concern about the presidents physician that the speaker simply did not understand or trust did townsend know about her sneaking into the senate chamber could she be aware of her role in the murder of archibald jakes if so why was townsend the one confronting her and not allaire something did not add up and ellis was never in the mood for surprises even more disturbing was that townsend had come accompanied by henry tilden at the physicians request they had convened at the rostrum where their conversation would not easily be overheard given that ellis had clearly declared her continuing enmity for allaire and her belief that he was lying to everybody and using the situation for his personal and political gain the visit from his personal doctor was unsettling as soon as possible ellis vowed she would have to take control of the situation tilden was a dimwit but townsend was sharp and given their limited contact over the years something of an unknown commodity we have a serious situation townsend began that seems rather obvious doctor ellis said so i trust you are not here to rehash old business i do have new concerns madam speaker townsend replied and they revolve around president allaire ellis her spirit suddenly taking flight looked on gravely mirroring tildens worried expression thanks to her connection with genesis and her nearly disastrous encounter with group c she knew specifics about the virus and its horrific physiological effects was allaire suddenly infected had he fallen victim to his own creation that had to be it destiny had taken her firmly by the hand is there something wrong with the president tilden asked i was with him just a few hours ago we were discussing supply shipments he seemed fine to me anxious but fine ellis was pleased that tilden had been excluded from whatever was going on but she was hardly surprised clearly allaire considered him as much of a dimwit as she did i too thought he was doing well townsend said but now theres been an incident again ellis felt a rush bad things should happen to bad people she was thinking what sort of incident tilden asked the president went into a rage during a video conference with the virologist who is working on the antiviral treatment do you know what set him off ellis asked thats the strangest thing of all townsend replied nothing really did it it was like a switch had been thrown even the president admits that his outburst was disproportionate to the issue being discussed the virus ellis thought it could be stress but she sensed it was infection then she realized a downside to allaires getting infected that she had not considered her thoughts opened on the horror she and oneil had encountered within the senate chamber the lethal insanity of archibald jakes the blood the sickness and stench fouling the room the wretched sounds of suffering if allaire was succumbing to the same malady then this virus could be spreading faster than genesis had led her to believe it would so does allaireexcuse me president allaireknow youre speaking with us she asked i mean you are his physician is it appropriate to be discussing his medical status with us he doesnt know that im speaking to you about this townsend admitted but i have another duty to perform that exceeds my obligations to any privacy standards duty ellis already knew what was coming she had to hold on to the side of her chair to keep from floating the twentyfifth amendment to the united states constitution townsend said are you suggesting the situation is so dire that we must consider forcibly removing the president from office ellis asked of course she now knew that was exactly what townsend had come to discuss still it was meaningful to her to hear the words spoken aloud i have not approached president allaire about transmitting to vice president tilden our president pro tempore of the senate and yourself a written declaration that he is unable to discharge his duties but this is a matter we discussed soon after the virus was released ellis knew the mechanics of the twentyfifth amendment verbatim tilden along with either congress or the cabinet and principal officers of the executive branch could remove the president from office with a simple majority vote the presidents personal physician held tremendous influence in determining how people would vote what are you proposing we do dr townsend ellis asked barely able to keep a tremor from her voice the stars were aligning for now nothing townsend said but mr vice president you are second in line to ascend to the presidency and madam speaker you are third i felt it was my obligation to inform you both of the situation as you henry may be called upon to take the presidential oath of office tilden grimaced in an honest display of remorse ellis did the same but her apparent dismay was anything but honest lets pray it doesnt come to that tilden said i suggest that we meet at least every two hours on the hour so that were all on the same page townsend said if the situation with the president worsens between checkpoints i shall simply summon you both back to the rostrum and we will decide a course of action from there agreed agreed both said the meeting adjourned and ellis set off to locate gladstone her mind was on the biocontainment suit she saw hanging by the senate chamber door she regretted now not putting it on as she had subjected herself to a high concentration of infected air hopefully she would not manifest signs of infection until she had shepherded the genesis bill through congress the video on her blackberry of group c and the guarantee from genesis of a treatment should be enough to drive the legislation home in no time before she could locate gladstone she felt a vibration against her ribs the genesis messaging device secured there with masking tape was buzzing for her attention ellis made a hasty change of direction and returned to the ladies room where she felt it safest to read and respond the message from genesis was simple and to the point they wrote ellis typed back genesis ellis genesis ellis stared at the messaging device she knew what find a way really meant she was third in line for the presidency soon to be second more than just her ambitions were at stake now she had put her life in danger simply by setting foot inside the senate chamber now she needed the treatment of course there was a way ellis wrote chapter day am cst sergeant stafford equipped griff and forbush with down parkas for the short walk to the bungalow where rappaport was waiting for griff it felt splendid to breathe fresh air again one of the greatest pleasures of going down was a deep appreciation for the little things after coming back up the sun was a pale disc in a placid sky it would be nearly set by the time he escaped from kalvesta on his way to the certain path mission in wichita wind from the south whipped across the flat frozen landscape and sent griffs hands scrambling for the lining of his jacket pockets his footsteps crunched on rime as he and forbush trudged past the same model vhn whitehawk helicopter that lifted him out of the florence prison yard just a few days ago isnt that the presidents helicopter forbush asked no its just the same model griff said his voice etched with worry but if we dont figure out an antiviral treatment it could be the new marine one for president rappaport they entered the topside bungalow that functioned as the facilitys conference room the sharp wind whipped the hinged door closed behind them a portable kerosene heater in the corner of the room sputtered and gurgled while keeping the rectangular space at a serviceable sixtyfive degrees griff left his parka on hoping that the secretary of homeland security would get the hint that there was work to be done below ground four peoplethree men and a womansat waiting at a long foldout table in the center of the room griff figured the two men and a woman standing nearby were rappaports assigned secret service agents husky sergeant stafford and three of his team brought the total number present to a bakers dozenjust above capacity for the space a thin man with graying temples sharply dressed in a tailored suit rose from his seat at the table griff hardly a newshound had never seen photos of any of the cabinet he assumed the man who moved like an athlete and looked patrician bred was paul rappaport the former governors bearing and sharply defined features had griff trying to recall the exact words to creedence clearwater revivals song fortunate son griffin rhodes griff said my associate melvin forbush griff took a step forward to shake hands two of the agents intervened blocking his path weve got to search you first sir the woman said groaning inwardly griff dropped his parka to the floor and lifted his arms for a patdown a second agent swept him with a handheld metal detector melvin who had a dreamy expression that griff took to mean he was imagining himself in any number of movie patdown scenes was subjected to the same treatment all clear one agent said to rappaport the secretary then met them in the middle of the room griff extended his hand rappaport took it for a moment griff could see mistrust in the mans gray eyes im not the bad guy here griff said in a near whisper i know what you believe but i also know your history rappaport said so you know that i was framed the secretary did not smile i know that you were arrested for stealing the virus he said and i know that youre the man president allaire has tasked with saving our government makes me think of the fox guarding the henhouse griffs expression was one of extreme displeasure angies heroism and current plight continued to dominate his thoughts along with his impending escape from the lab to wichita in addition griff had sylvia chens human experimentation and his own continued failures with orion adding to his emotional cocktail his ability to control his simmering anger was hanging by the strand of a spiders web mr secretary what is it you want from me he said did you just fly a thousand miles to put me in my place rappaports grin held no mirth well what i want dr rhodes is to make absolutely certain you are doing what you have promised to do i am ready to become president if i must but id prefer it not come to that pardon my saying so mr secretary but to my sense at least that statement isnt exactly oozing sincerity thats your interpretation rhodes as secretary of homeland security its my sworn duty to protect the president and this country if that includes monitoring you and your work here and it does then that is just what i shall do if my sworn duty involves taking over for president allaire then that is what i will do but at the moment all i care about is seeing to it that you do everything in your power to save those poor unfortunates in the capitol in that regard i want to know exactly what you are doing down there in that little hole of yours because let us be honest with each other yes lets i dont trust you so ive gathered i have brought with me some folks who will make absolutely certain i can keep a very close eye on you and your activities rappaport turned and motioned to one of the men seated at the conference table behind them the man stood slightly taller than rappaport and appeared equally as fit he wore a blue blazer over an oxford shirt the jacket had a tenpoint buck emblazoned on the pocket unlike rappaport he was interested in shaking griffs hand im roger corum he said ceo of staghorn security technologies forbushs expression suddenly became that of a child viewing a fireworks display wow thats so great he said with his typical enthusiasm as he gave corums hand a prolonged vigorous pumping ive been wanting to get in touch with you guys about some security tape i have from the system you upgraded a couple of years ago talk about a lucky break rappaport interrupted before corum could reply clearly the secretary had no interest in communicating with griffs associate i asked roger to accompany me here as a personal favor i will allow him to explain our intentions why dont we all sit first corum said his speech gently southern and his manner much more agreeable than rappaports if its okay with you i prefer to stand griff said because if were standing this meeting will be shorter and every second were not working is another second were not working understood corum said secretary rappaport is interested in monitoring the activities down below in real time since it is impractical for him to be physically present there he has asked that staghorn install stateoftheart communications equipment to allow him and through him the president to remain in constant voice and video contact with your team by my team you mean mr forbush and myself because thats all we have corum smiled genuinely at the image ive worked with teams of a hundred that are probably not as effective or efficient as the two of you he said dr rhodes what well do is replace some of our existing cameras and equipment with newer models that allow for encrypted wireless streaming over a secure satellite network that way we can broadcast your activity to any location on earth you wont get a signal that far below ground forbush said true as things stand corum replied presently the cameras are hardwired to the hub in the communications building here at the facility well replace that hub with our newer model as well with the cameras connected to the new hub well be able to transmit signal from the building to our satellite network which brings me to our next effort videoconferencing we have that already griff said but you dont have mobile conferencing corum took out a device from his blazer pocket that was no bigger than a cell phone this is the txmobile communicator we developed it for uncle sam its a handheld private networked videoconferencing system inside the casing is a standalone sophisticated gps tracker built into a disc thats not much bigger than a silver dollar it will allow us to pinpoint your exact location even underground you want us to carry that gadget around like some sort of parolee ankle bracelet griffs disgust was evident rappaport stepped forward i expect you to do what you are told rhodes he said well perhaps youve forgotten mr secretary but what ive been told to do is save this country not answer to you dont get so high on yourself rappaport replied this country will continue on no matter the outcome of what you do in a worstcase scenario it will be incumbent on me to form an interim government and i promise you well emerge from those ashes stronger and more resolved to combat terror than ever before by that do you mean all the personal freedoms youre going to revoke forbush blurted out griff shot his friend a stunned but simultaneously appreciative look ive read up on your policy positions forbush then went on the walls and moats between the us and mexico the wiretapping the computer monitoring the cameras the profiling the that is sheer nonsense rappaport said speaking at least as much to the others in the room as to forbush i am not going to take away any freedoms granted by our constitution i am committed to protecting this country and the american way of life and if doing so requires stronger security at the borders more use of surveillance technology photo id cards profiling and an expansion of the patriot act in any way necessary to combat terrorists like genesis then that is exactly what i will do excuse me if i dont concur griff said personally dr rhodes i dont care if you support my political philosophy or not now youll both carry this device and you will answer whenever i request a conference and if i refuse griff asked i shall inform the president of your subversive behavior rappaport replied succeed or fail you could end up spending the rest of your life back in that prison cell so you dont really have a choice do you griff resisted the urge to reiterate his no hidden catches deal with james allaire as well as the urge to tackle the homeland security secretary to the floor and show him knuckletojaw what true subversive behavior felt like instead he indicated the two people still seated at the conference table so are these your install folks he said to corum the ceo smiled visibly relieved for the change of subject staghorn is not in the business of manufacturing any of the technology we sell corum said were more of a consortiuminternational general contractors for security if you willwhich is why ive brought with me the ceos of two of the foremost companies in the worldcompanies that will be providing us with the equipment to get this job done he gestured to the woman first this is marguerite prideaux from paris marguerite is with securetech a french company in our vendor network and next to her is colin whitehead ceo of matrix industries of new jersey yes that matrix the woman approached griff and extended a fine slender hand she was a darkhaired beauty dressed in a fashionable pantsuit she had an aura about her that announced her european heritage as though it was a perfume she wore from griffs arrival she had kept her intelligent oval eyes fixed on him her fellow board member was a cadaverously thin man in his forties with the crimson spray of rosacea across his cheeks he coughed twice as he came forward and griff could see the top of a camel cigarette box jutting out from the breast pocket of his shirt his nose was bulbous and pockedpossibly from too much drinking griff shook their hands impatiently forbush gave each a far more enthusiastic greeting so which of you can help me with my problem he asked what problem is that colin whitehead replied partially stifling another cough i have proof that the security videotape showing dr rhodes here stealing the virus from our lab has been forged i was going to contact staghorn to get some expert opinion as to how that could have been done but now here you are right on our doorstep griff shot forbush a disapproving glare there was no time for this melvin we have those test tubes in the centrifuge we need to extract no we dont forbush said cheerily i took those out hours ago well we have to run the test again in another three hours three hours from now melvin the exchange between the two was handled with all the elegance of a rugby scrum but finally forbush seemed to key in on what griff was trying to say right three hours we have testing to do but griff i can be quick we need this you need this if you want to prove your innocence roger corum saved the moment wed be happy to look at whatever you have to share melvin were here for a few daysuntil the install is complete anyway rappaport took a step toward griff you had better not be planning anything rhodes he said im planning to work i am not stupid you think i didnt notice you and melvin here trying to have a sidebar conversation in front of us roger i want very much for you to meet with this fellow about the video footage since he asked so politely i will be contacting president allaire and letting him know we are here and on top of the situation dr rhodes i also intend to tell him that progress is being made tell him whatever you wish as soon as i am finished with the president and some other business we are all going to take a trip down to the lab why would you want to do that griff asked focused on the ventilation shaft and his upcoming thirtyminute crawl through darkness to the heavy grate beyond the installations fenced perimeter i mean soon enough youll have your cameras and recording devices in place to keep watch over me i want to see for myself what it is you are doing down there rappaport answered coolly and more importantly i want to make sure that you are down there doing it chapter day pm cst griff lay prone on the floor of the kitchen with a spin ratchet a screwdriver and a flashlight beside him working with any sort of tools in a biocontainment suit was like swimming in molassespossible but certainly no fun the targets were the screws securing the slotted front grate of the ventilation shaft the heavy screwdriver turned awkwardly in his gloved hand falling again and again most of the lab equipment in the kitchen was specially designed for the decreased mobility of bl laboratory work and the extra effort and concentration required to maneuver the tool had griffs heart racing droplets of sweat condensed on the inside of his faceplate reducing visibility in the already dimly lit workspace but turn by turn he was making progress two screws out now three one to go the groove of the final screw was nearly gone and the body was stripped making the already difficult task nearly impossible griff needed some sort of lubricating spray but there was none the five minutes he and melvin had allotted for this phase of the escape had already taken triple that how ironic to have the fate of the country hinging on a tiny bit of rust the notion brought a rueful smile griff had overheard stafford say that patrols along the roads bordering kalvesta were being increased in response to the secretarys unexpected arrival any delay on his part risked melvin being spotted by one of those patrolsassuming of course that melvin ended his staghorn meeting in time to make their rendezvous with his anxiety escalating griff brought in a small hammer and chisel to loosen the stripped screw for want of a nail the shoe was lost he said to himself tapping on the chisel to the rhythm of the proverbial poem for want of a shoe the horse was lost another try with the screwdriver griff figured he could change the angle of the blade to improve the leverage for want of a horse the rider was lost the handle shook as griff strained to turn it the shank slipped free of the mangled screw head and he felt the blade tear across the fabric of his suit hyperventilating and fearing the worst he checked the puncture the suits several protective layers seemed to be intact for want of a rider the battle was lost griff tried another approach gripping the sides of the vent with his gloved hands and twisting the already loose metal plate as he pulled home run the troublesome screw budged then creaked a fraction of a millimeter then suddenly turned for the moment at least the kingdom was saved the prefilters removed easily enough but the much larger hepa filter looked to be a serious challenge the angle required to use the spin ratchet on the stainless steel bolts seemed designed for a contortionist sweat continued dripping down griffs brow and stinging his eyes until he was working nearly blind to make matters worse again and again his elbows displaced his flashlight he finally managed to unplug the connectors powering the fan and held his breath despite melvins assurance he still worried about the alarm the loud rush of air being sucked up the vent stopped suddenly the only sound was his heart pounding in his ears an inch at a time he worked the cumbersome fan free from the aluminum duct the razorsharp edges of the filters metal casing were a continuous threat to the integrity of his suit but he handled them well finally he took in a single deep breath and pulled until the heavy filter came free of the duct he let it fall to the floor of the kitchen with a loud satisfying crash buoyed by a second wind he removed the remaining componentsblowers and bagswith a great deal less effort now it was time to get rappaport out of the picture in a short while a powerful animosity had developed between the two of them rappaport was convinced of griffs guilt and lack of patriotism and griff was uncomfortable around the mans arrogance and selfassuredness in addition more and more thoughts were taking shape regarding the fact that until it became clear why genesis was undertaking their reign of terror paul rappaport seemed to be at the forefront of those who would benefit from it griffs joints ached from his having stayed so long in such an awkward position he crossed to the wallmounted control panel for the kitchens environment status systemits ess his goal was to make the place seem even more potentially lethal than it already was of the three buttons on the panels front face the green one was lit and the yellow and red ones were not griff keyed the input code required to change environment status and with a push of a button the kitchen went from a green safety level to yellow the yellow status alerted topside communication of a potential exposure risk in the labs nothing too alarming like the total evacuation and shutdown mandated by red but nothing they would risk rappaport being exposed to either it would certainly buy some time how much griff had no way of knowing he went back to the ventilation shaft and used his maglite flashlight to penetrate the darkness of the metal tunnel scanning for sharp edges between duct joints that could slice open his suit before he cleared the hot zone fortunately the engineers had injected sealant between the joints the passage would be relatively smooth with thoughts of angie and of what might lie ahead in wichita he set the flashlight down he would need both hands free to work his way up the steep rise at the far end of the system detaching the air hose from his suit he positioned himself facedown on the metal and snaked his way into the blackness space in the duct was unpleasantly tight griff worked forward in a military crawl the shaft was roughly the diameter of the opening in an mri machine his back scraped against the top of it every time he arched his hips the darkness was now total and the accompanying claustrophobia was becoming oppressive his helmet and face mask made the situation even more difficult and unsettling breathing through his nose eyes closed he wriggled ahead feeling for any incline breathe in breathe out breathe in breathe out the tube seemed interminable the air stale then just as he was wondering if melvin had given him misinformation about the course of the system he sensed an incline beginning at first the rise was subtle griff opened his eyes but he was still engulfed in absolute darkness breathe in breathe out suddenly the incline became more severe the shaft bent upward at an angle that was at least fortyfive degrees instantly the rhythm griff had established disappeared movement ahead and upward became awkward and required every bit of his strength without the air hose to help cool him his suit trapped much of his body heat he kept himself wedged in the shaft moving through the blackness only a few inches at a time fatigue became a serious problem the climb was far more difficult than he had anticipated he fought off the increasingly desperate urge to try crawling backward to the opening visions of giving upof just stopping and dying therebegan to dominate his thoughts he drove himself ahead by remembering the guards at florence beating on the soles of his feet and calling him a traitor and a terrorist he allowed his mind to relive the electric totalbody pain and the blood of his ebola infection the rise in the shaft increased griff slid backward frantically he pressed his palms against the metal finally managing to regain his leverage again he shimmied ahead his arms shaking from supporting what amounted to his full body weight still he managed to inch higher he guessed the angle of the shaft to be at least seventy degrees now angie the guards louisa rappaport the cell allaire africa he was nearly upright now wedged in place but able to use his knees for support and thrust as melvin had warned this part of the ascent was like rock climbing but nothing had prepared him for the consuming blackness his forearms were on fire ive beaten ebola ive outlasted florence i can do this tears of pain mixed with the sweat and salted his lips he kept his gaze fixed upward searching for the end then suddenly his glove hit metalthe rung of the ladder above him the utter darkness had given way to the gloom of dusk he bent his head back as much as space would allow and saw the squares of the access grate silhouetted against a darkening sky one rung then another finally his fingers closed on the heavy steel grate as melvin had warned there was no way he would be able to shove it aside clutching the ladder to keep from falling back down the shaft he cried out to the world overhead melvin forbush are you there get me out of here melvin for gods sake help me griff feared the suit was muffling his cries he let go with one hand and slammed the base of his palm against the grate nothing then he heard a motor engage an instant later one edge of the heavy obstruction was lifted by a hook he hadnt noticed and the grate was dragged clear of the opening dizzy with exhaustion griff tried to lift himself out of the shaft but the strength wasnt there a pair of hands reached down and grabbed griff by his wrists melvin forbush lifted him clear of the shaft disconnected his helmet and pulled it off gasping griff flopped over onto his back and squinted up at the fading light his chest was heaving desperately sucking in the wintry air forbush next unzipped the biocontainment suit underneath it griff was wearing only scrubs and booties he felt a wave of frozen air envelop him stinging his skin his sweat instantly cooled forming a chilling sheen that grew colder every second now out of his suit griff began shivering you made it buddy forbush said you made it yes he did a deep voice said from behind his friend good job sport bloody good job a huge man emerged from the far side of melvins taurus and slashed the gangly lab assistant across the back of the head with the barrel of a submachine gun forbush dropped like an anvil and lay on the frozen ground rolling from side to side moaning and pawing at his head the behemoth leveled his gun at a spot between griffs eyes welcome to the world above dr rhodes he said you and i have some business to discuss chapter day pm cst matt fink pulled a tangle of rope from the open trunk of the taurus and tossed it by griffs feet tie him up he ordered melvin had made it unsteadily to his knees through the gloom griff could see blood cascading around one of his ears and down his neck shit forbush said you didnt have to do that i said tie him up how did you know we were here griff asked stalling but also desperate to learn the answer genesis had somehow been aware when angie left the compound now it appeared they were once again a step ahead ill ask the questions here the man said now do as i say or i swear ill shoot this jerk in the eye why do you need me to tie him up what do you want with us do i look like someone you should be fucking around with sport youre going to tell me where you are headed and why or things are going to get mighty painful for both of you griffs teeth were beginning to chatter he rubbed at his arms to keep his circulation going the icy wind was cutting through his thin scrubs like a scalpel didnt he bring a jacket for me he asked i i need one my patience is wearing thin sport now do as i say and youll get your jacket dont do it and watch your friend here die a painful death while you become an icicle griff quickly surveyed their surroundings to the west was the laba series of tiny lights on the horizon perhaps a quarter of a mile away to the north and east the flat frozen ground was interrupted only by the scattered silhouettes of rolled hay the south however held some promise in fact the distant farmhouse outbuildings and enormous barn told him precisely where they wereon the vast cahill barb ranch home to one of the largest herds of bison in western kansas during his initial time at the lab he had actually driven past this field a number of times once he had stopped to walk to within just a few yards of the magnificent beasts before a ranch hand on horseback warned him that even though herds of wild bison had given way to ranchbred the animals were still fast unpredictably temperamental and at two thousand pounds with horns hooves and a massive batteringram head more deadly than a grizzly ive had it with you rhodes the man was saying youre a wise guy and you dont care what happens to your pal here well maybe you care about what happens to yourself he jammed the muzzle of the submachine gun with force into griffs kidney sending him down to one knee just as quickly griff was up refusing even to rub at the spot who are you he asked searching for an opening any opening through which to attack or to run im a bad man sport thats all you need to know he said pressing the muzzle against the back of forbushs head for emphasis like the killer who had tracked angie to new york this was a professional griff knew with certainty that there was no way either he or melvin was going to leave this place alive griffs vision had adjusted to the gloom and he could see a portion of the bison herd itself huddled together against the cold his best chance likely his only chance was to find a moments break and to run weaving in that direction are you genesis he asked tie him the fuck up i wont do it griffs shivering was becoming more intense he had to do something while he was still able but before he could make any move the huge man charged at him lowering his shoulder and driving it hard into griffs sternum griff heard the popping of his ribs separating from cartilage or breaking the pain was explosive the fury of the surprise attack lifted him off of his feet and sent him flying backward onto the rockhard ground he landed heavily gasping his lungs unable to take in air through dizzying pain he rolled onto his stomach and forced himself onto his knees then he glared up at the figure towering above him death for melvin and for him was getting closer the mans temper and intense anger were the only weapons they had left ive had it with you sport he said you can just stand there until you freeze solid ill enjoy watching teeth clenched griff maneuvered one leg underneath him and was working painfully on the other when he saw movement from behind the man melvin the gangly virologist was a specter blood smeared across his face rising up behind their assailant like phoenix from the ashes the wildness in his eyes shone through the mounting darkness like lasers okay ill do it griff cried out grunting around the words but still heightening the distraction ill tie him up ill tie him up at that instant with the shriek of a banshee forbush leapt onto the mans back his hands clawing frantically at his face his fingernails digging into his cheeks the giant swung his body around but forbush held his grip like a rodeo cowboy on a bull the submachine gun fell griff dragged himself toward the weapon but the man kicked it out of reach then in a blaze of motion he pulled an enormous hunting knife from his boot nooo griff screamed in a single practiced move the killer drove the blade up and back into the taller mans shoulder still forbush held on yelling for griff to run then bellowing and stumbling awkwardly the man whirled and buried the knife almost to the hilt at the base of forbushs neck blood spewed from the wound forbush screamed released his grip and fell limply griff was on his feet now staring in disbelief at the scene melvin lay motionless blood pulsing from his neck and pooling beneath him griffs eyes clouded over he felt weak and disoriented immobile and unwilling to believe his friends wound was mortal get the gun griff heard the words in his mind as if melvin had hollered them the gun two agonizing strides and griff had the submachine gun in his hands he whirled and aimed at the center of the mans chest his index finger pulled the trigger and the assailant who was clumsily trying to stand dove to his right in evasion the gun did not erupt griff aimed at the mans back and pulled the trigger once again nothing griffs experience with guns was a single unpleasant session many years before at a firing range with a friend and his target pistols now he panicked had the gun jammed was there a safety he needed to release either way griff knew his ignorance was about to be lethal the man was back on his feet no more than ten feet away clutching the heavy knife griff glanced down at melvin who was unmoving and silent his eyes wide open and staring unblinking at the blackness dark blood was pooled on the frozen ground beneath his head for a moment griff stopped caring he wanted desperately to charge the beast who had perhaps killed the most harmless gentle man he had ever known he wanted the whole thing just to be over finally with the man moving unsteadily toward him griff took a single step backward and looked to the south the plains there were divided by stretches of woodpost fencing that extended in every direction the distant farmhouse seemed unlitfive hundred yards away he estimated maybe farther his chest was throbbing mercilessly but he could no longer feel the painful cold in his feet still clutching the useless weapon he shambled awkwardly across the field the solid frostcoated ground was pocked with divots that made every step a danger the surgical booties made traction even worse now from behind him griff heard footsteps crunching on the frozen ground the footfalls were steady but uneven suggesting the assassin might be limping but they were also getting closer youre a dead man rhodes the killer bellowed from behind him this knife is going to love finding a resting place in your heart chapter day pm cst the running had brought an electric pain back to griffs feet still he drove ahead his booties had torn away but traction in his bare feet was no better every step was treacherous his injured ribs made each breath agony and now it seemed he was unable to draw in enough air a strong gust of wind caused him to stumble and twice he nearly fell the uneven ground was as great an enemy as his pursuer he could afford one fall perhaps two he knew would cost him his life he was closing in on another fencethree roughhewn rails sixty inches or so high with posts spaced every twenty feet beyond the fence was a tightly packed herd of bison and some distance beyond them his only hope the barn suddenly he was lurching and stumbling downhill the land had dipped into a shallow frozen swale that he had not seen there was no way his aching legs could keep up with the decline and he fell tumbling over and over to the bottom skin vanished from his exposed elbows and knees his final graceless landing drove his damaged ribs together with the force of a thunderclap ignoring the intense pain as best he could he staggered up the other side of the slope at the top he risked a glance backward to his astonishment he had kept his injured pursuer somewhat at bay and had what he estimated to be a fortyyard lead the barn though still some distance away seemed possible jets of frozen breath from his mouth and nostrils filled the air in front of him his lungs burnt mercilessly thirty feet to the fence now twenty griff looked behind again trouble somehow in the brief span since he had last checked the man had cut his advantage in half and was hobbling much less now unlike griff his breathing did not seem labored the fence came up suddenly griff slowed but could not keep himself from skidding awkwardly into the sturdy rails he cried out as his torn ribs raked across one another his hands reflexively grasped the top railing sending the submachine gun spiraling away there was little consideration of trying to retrieve the useless weapon scaling the fence with two free hands was going to be hard enough griff stepped on the lowest rail and thought for a moment that his frozen foot was going to snap in half then he folded himself across the topmost rail and flopped over landing on one badly scraped knee the gap between him and the man who was going to kill him had narrowed even more it wasnt going to be long directly ahead of him now was the herdseveral dozen bison statuelike except for the bursts of frozen vapor from their nostrils unpredictable more deadly than a grizzly hooves horns head the wranglers warning resonated in his thoughts as he neared the closest of the majestic beasts there was a slight stirring among them but no other movement their heavy breathing seemed to mirror his own griff moved stealthily past a huge bull keeping his hands tightly against his sides risking another glance backward he saw the silhouette of the man bending over the spot where the submachine gun had landed moments later the weapon was in his hand and he was carefully climbing over the fence for a short time the night was eerily silent save for the snorting of the bison the steady swoosh of the wind and the blood from griffs own heart pounding through his ears the restlessness of the herd seemed to be intensifying as he made his way among them their grunts grew louder as if they had begun communicating with one another a few had dropped their enormous heads to graze at what pockets of straw remained scattered about or perhaps as some sort of signal to the others always though it seemed as if their eyes were upon him easy guys easy a number of the larger animals swung their heads up as griff passed daggersharp horns turned in his direction dark faces concealed by dense curls of shaggy hair followed his movement among them easy the bisons hooves began shuffling beneath their short powerful legs several of them started to shift from side to side the grunting seemed louder the plumes of vapor more intense then gunfire erupted griffs antagonist was on one knee just past the shallow swale at first it seemed to griff as if the bison werent going to react he was a few feet into the herd ahead of him and to his left still some distance away he could see the barn there was another volley from the submachine gun then another griff swore out loud clearly he had overlooked the safety when he had control of the weapon at that moment one of the larger bulls toppled over a second snorted loudly several more animals shifted away from the fallen beast all of them seemed to be milling and bellowing at once then the herd began to charge directly toward griff bullets continued crackling through the frigid air another bison keeled over the hoofbeats of the herd became deafening vapor spewed out from flared nostrils like steam from fastrunning trains griff was knocked to his left by the flank of a passing cow and then slammed to the ground by another he scrambled between hooves expecting any moment to have a oneton animal crush his skull or finish the damage in his chest time slowed to a stop as the bison thundered past legs and hooves brushing against griff but none of them connecting directly dust beaten upward from the wintry ground filled his nose and throat choking him the hoofbeats resonated through his chest like cannon fire he imagined the huge killer laughing as he released the safety on his gun and laughing even harder when he decided to use it to start a stampede from not far away there was another burst of gunfire a huge animal dropped dead in front of griff and rolled over ending motionless with the top of its enormous shaggy head resting against griffs chest instantly the speeding bison parted like the red sea to avoid the dead bull griff pulled his knees up cringing in a fetal position he burrowed into his savior as tightly as he could manage then through the corner of his eye he saw the stampede suddenly shift direction the herd was pounding away from the spot where he and the dead bull lay and racing toward the fence they were also he suddenly realized headed in the direction of the man who had been firing at them over the exploding hooves he heard the chatter of submachine gun fire resume then as the last of the animals sped past him he thought he heard the man scream with difficulty he rose and lurched toward the barn his feet and the muscles in his legs were on fire fatigued breathless and freezing he had no chance to recover when he slipped on a patch of ice he slid facefirst across the frozen ground gashing his face and sending blood cascading down his cheek cursing he managed to regain his footing but it was becoming increasingly difficult to do so the scene before him was grim ten bison lay dead or dying on the frozen ground the remaining animals had stopped running and formed something of a wall between him and his pursuer griff peered into the darkness but could not locate the man then through an opening in the herd he spotted him lying facedown the gloom made it difficult to sort out whether he was dead or alive or whether he still had his weapon but in seconds both questions were answered in ponderous agonizing slow motion the assassin worked his way to his feet even through the distance and the darkness he looked battered and broken his left arm dangled uselessly at his side when he took a step toward the barn he was dragging his right leg still he remained upright stumbling forward a step at a time griff could almost see the determination on his face he could also see the powerful submachine gun dangling from his right hand the angle down to the darkened farmhouse was cut off the barn built on a broad flat table of land was griffs only chance the structure was quite large and seemed to be well maintained on either side like the towers of a medieval castle stood steel grain silos each at least three stories high gasping griff made his way toward the two large front doors if they were locked or chained he was dead from behind him came the chatter of gunfire several bullets snapped into the barn he was ten feet from the double doors when his heart sank there was a heavy chain across them in addition to a plank of wood death was closing in griff hunched down as best he could and zigzagged toward the corner of the barn blood was flowing from his cheek as he ducked around the corner there was a door the smooth knob some sort of bone or plastic was unyielding any moment now it would be over with a burst of adrenaline that took him completely by surprise griff rammed his shoulder against the weathered wood the door burst open he cried out as pain exploded from his midchest and his momentum carried him stumbling into the interior of the barn dim light through a long row of windows was the only illumination surrounding him were stacks of hay bales extending to the back wall and forming in places natural staircases ten to twentyfive feet high he could hide behind the bales or griffs pursuer tripped against the doorjamb giving him a few precious seconds of warning his respirations filled the barn reacting more than reasoning griff carefully made his way up one of the tallest of the hay staircases halfway to the top his fortune took a turn a longhandled fourpronged pitchfork was wedged in one of the bales griff slid the tool out and used it as support to ascend to the top the giants labored breathing seemed to obscure the sound of his movement you stupid fool the man shouted into the darkness you think you can stop me he sent a short hail of bullets into the roof nothing can stop me i saw some blood by the door you hurt bad if youre not you will be im going to shoot to maim you not to kill you then im going to use the knife i used on your friend to gut you bit by bit until you tell me what i want to know or until you die it really doesnt matter from his hiding place griff listened to the mans footsteps as they scraped unevenly across the barns wooden floor drawing closer he forced his breathing to slow as he visualized his adversarys position it was time griff peered over the edge as the giant cautiously approached he could see now what devastating damage the stampeding bison had done to him his parka was nearly torn off exposing a fractured forearm where jagged white bone jutted through his skin it seemed quite possible that his leg was broken as well the dramatic wounds would make him slow to reactor at least slower griff gripped the pitchfork and shifted his weight preparing to climb over the top of the hay bales and slide down the other side ready and now he pushed off the highest bale screaming as loudly as he could the man whirled and raised the submachine gun ripping off a wild burst that totally missed the dark shadow flying down at him the pitchfork with all griffs weight behind it struck home across the center of the mans chest its lethal tines penetrating through skin muscle heart and bone before exiting through the back the force drove him backward onto the strawcovered floor and pinned him there blood erupted from his mouth he tried to say something but succeeded only in spewing up more blood seconds later he was dead the long handle of the pitchfork still pointing at the ceiling quivering griff took the knife and the submachine gun which he fired successfully into a hay bale just to prove to himself that he could then he checked the professional killer for the id he knew would not be there and spent a few moments gazing down at his lifeless battered and broken corpse i only wish it had lasted longer he said viciously chapter day pm est vice president henry tilden shifted from one foot to the other he was standing in the middle of an orderly food line that snaked along two walls of the house chamber ellis watched the man from halfway across the hall watched and waited more people than ever were coughing now she noted some coughed just a little bit as if they were trying to clear a bothersome tickle from their throats others including the presidents wife and daughter were suffering from a more persistent wet hacking ellis made eye contact with gladstone who was some fifty people in line behind tilden a slight nod from her and gladstone abandoned his place he walked past tilden and without offering an apology or explanation cut in front of supreme court justice alfred bauer in the past and at times during the current crisis ellis had witnessed the crusty bauer lose his temper usually without much provocation minor offenses such as loud talking or even snoring had been triggers enough to set off the already agitated elderly judge ellis was counting on bauer losing his cool one more time you cant cut the line young man ellis heard him say to gladstone gladstone in response turned to bauer and just as they had rehearsed said you cant make me leave youre not the allpowerful justice here gladstone then turned away from the man and resumed his waiting i dont tolerate that sort of disrespect young man bauer snapped i frankly dont care what you tolerate or dont tolerate bauer took the bait and pushed gladstone in the small of his back elliss aide stumbled forward he waved his arms wildly in the air pretending to lose his balance and crashed into the man standing in front of him then he executed a quick side step to his right and the man into whom he had fallen responded with an angry shove into bauers chest the justice countered with a wild errant punch that missed his target but grazed across a congresswomans jaw the ensuing melee exploded like a match on gasolinesoaked rags having predicted every moment of the scenario ellis listened to the escalating shouting and startling profanities from men and women many of them with impeccable pedigrees she watched as more people joined in pushing and shoving and calling other combatants names well teach you the right way to brawl she was thinking the way we do it in the deep south punches were now being thrown boxed dinners were flying like missiles a congressman was repeatedly kicking a fallen reporter in the abdomen and head pentup frustration and anger in all likelihood fueled by wrx burst forth like an oil well gusher secret service agents quickly rushed in to quell the mayhem several of them became enmeshed in it others extracted allaires wife and daughter before they could become victims of the increasing violence capitol police and more agents came together to pry apart several small pockets of fighting noses were bleeding now as fists continued to fly congressmen and women were on the floor along with other dignitaries cowering or flailing with their hands and feet i cant take this anymore ellis heard somebody scream stop hitting me i didnt do anything to you shouted another ellis and gladstone grabbed tilden by the arms before any secret service agents could get to him come with us she yelled into his ear theres a problem with president allaire dr townsend wants us right away tilden nodded and allowed himself to be guided out of the house chamber into the corridor that would lead across the capitol to the senate wing as ellis had predicted the guards who had been posted at the doors had rushed in to help quell the fight the screaming and racket muted once the exit doors closed behind them ellis was not the least surprised that her tactics were working perfectly it was probable that no one had noticed them leaving whats going on tilden asked there was confusion and panic in his voice and expression ellis wondered if he was reacting to the riot or to the notion of becoming president probably both she decided how in the hell had he ever made it so high townsend is waiting for us by the senate chamber she said weve got to hurry why there tilden asked you saw whats going on here townsend couldnt meet us on the rostrum and she couldnt risk getting together anywhere near the president hes become paranoid about being removed from office his doctor used the word dangerous to describe him thats her word not mine ellis held up a metal tube ive got the documents rolled up in here that townsend has prepared for us to sign ellis and her aide walked the vice president at a brisk pace according to the information that oneil had provided allaire was in a meeting with salitas and would be there for at least an hour if oneil were wrong about that and by accident they bumped into the president she would have to think fast but she was totally capable of doing that and besides it was unlikely the man would venture into this wing especially given the diversion gladstone had started in the other nice they led tilden to the senate chamber following the same route that ellis had taken earlierdown the west grand staircase across the house connecting corridor into the senate connecting corridor and finally up the east grand staircase she knew that all patrols to this side of the capitol had been stopped per allaires ordersmore useful intelligence from oneil perhaps there could be room for him in her administration after all ellis quickened her steps to separate herself from tilden gladstone dropped back when the senate chamber door came into view she dropped the metal mailing tube to the marble floor it landed behind her with a loud resonating clank fumbling to retrieve it she kicked it so that it would roll toward tilden and away from the door ill get that the tall vice president said bending down ellis stood in front of the chamber door blocking the door handles from his line of sight there was a plastic bucket by her feet the lock and chain that had once secured the doors were now coiled inside it gladstone had done his job well he always did before he started the food line riot he had gotten the key to the senate chamber lock from oneil along with a blue plastic temporary handcuff in the few moments tilden was retrieving the metal tube ellis cut the plastic ties securing the door using a knife she had purloined from the food service by the time tilden reached her with the tube she had already kicked the pieces of the temporary handcuffs under the door if townsend is right she said youll be taking the oath of office in a few hours gladstone readied himself as ellis held her breath and pulled open the doors tilden hesitated at the threshold clearly taken aback by the commotion and the stench but it was too late gladstone shoved him brusquely into the vast room and ellis quickly closed the door behind him then she slipped the tube through the door handles they could hear tilden screaming and pounding from inside open up for gods sakes ursula open the door help hey let go of me let go of me dammit no patrols no guards no worries with gladstone holding the tube in place and keeping his shoulder hard to the door ellis pulled the chain from the bucket and looped it through the handles the door bucked as tilden still crying out continued to push against it from the other side and then quite suddenly his screaming stopped chapter day pm est ellis gave her aide a decent head start and then followed him back to the house chamber her thoughts were consumed with how close she now was to taking over the reins of leadership for the most powerful nation in the history of the planet the house chamber itself had degenerated into chaos there were clusters of people facing off against one another exchanging verbal threats childish insults and furious looks rows of sleeping cots which had taken the place of many of the rows of chairs were tipped over and their bedding ripped and tossed about the floor was littered with food cartons and was slick to walk on from spilled drinks but even in the din of that commotion ellis could still hear people coughing she had prepared a simple explanation for her whereabouts if pressed but she found the door through which she had reentered the chamber unguarded capitol police and secret service agents were still too busy with crowd control some had their weapons drawn though most of the security force looked bewildered and incapable of restoring order ellis knew exactly how to rein in the unruliness it was time to bring her bill to the house floor the time had come to expose america to jim allaires unforgivable lies ellis felt she had proved herself every bit the leader that allaire was not she had proof now that harlan mackey had been executed because of the lethalness of the virus surely the president had other options for dealing with the aging senator but those options would have required him to admit his deception in doing so he would have made it clear to the american public that he did not trust them and in doing so they would learn that he was not trustworthy himself in contrast to allaire ellis had solid reasons for what she was doing negotiating with genesis and locking vice president tilden inside the senate chamber were justifiable acts under these extreme circumstances she was born to lead and leadership not only demanded sacrifice but a willingness to change the rules of the game she had done what needed to be done true leaders she knew were the ones who made the hard choices and never looked back after a time at the rostrum working on details and watching the melee finally wind down ellis summoned gladstone to her side her aide was pale and blearyeyed never robust he was starting to look frail his weakened state was understandable given the hours he had spent crafting the bill and incorporating her edits to say northing of the stress of working to elevate her to the presidency are we ready she asked him i believe so her aide said ive made copies of the bill for every voting member and their aides but only those who are in the house chamber im assuming groups b and c are out of the equation you assume correctly ellis said and i used version twentythree of the bill is that correct as well yes it is well done now have you been able to locate jordan lamar as architect of the capitol we need his support to make everything happen as ive planned i havent tried to find him yet gladstone said but i dont believe that will be necessary i want those television cameras turned back on leland our dear mr jordan is the only person with the authority to defy the president and restore those transmissions its essential the american people be made aware of the truth they must see with their own eyes the reason why i have been negotiating with genesis gladstone peered over elliss shoulder im saying it wont be necessary to find him he explained because it appears he has found us ellis turned to see lamar bethany townsend and the president heading toward them all three looked gravely concerned we havent seen vice president tilden in over an hour allaire said without a greeting have either of you seen him elliss eyes narrowed no i havent she said not for hours leland you nope he was in line here when all the craziness started but that was the last time i saw him well keep your eyes out hes on treatment for high blood pressure ellis tried to make eye contact with townsend hoping she might bring up the meeting the three of them had but the physician looked away enough is enough ellis decided president allaire she said as long as youre here i think you should know that ive had a change of plans regarding my committee i hope that change involves your disbanding it the president said actually my current plan is to seek cooperation from the committee on rules in hopes that they will grant privileged status to a special rule for a specific legislative measure that i intend to bring to the house floor for consideration allaire looked appalled ive had enough of your antics ursula he exclaimed were involved in a deadly crisis of unparalleled scope and you have been nothing but an impediment to resolving it ellis urged herself not to become rattled well im afraid mr president that the rules of the house preclude your displeasure from interfering with permitted congressional business besides you are in no position to be combative with me that will only cause you trouble just ask your dr townsend here allaire turned to his physician concern drawing a shadow across his face what is she talking about bethany townsend shuffled her feet and struggled to make eye contact with the president i have some serious concerns about your ability to control your emotions townsend responded especially your temper she paused to give ellis a venomous stare i witnessed your outburst myself and as is my duty to the country i brought my concerns to the attention of vice president tilden and the speaker of the house why would you do that allaire asked with the sting of betrayal evident in his voice you know what infection with the wrx virus can do to any of us it could become incumbent on them to initiate the proceedings by proceedings allaire said now straining to remain calm you mean my forcible removal from office townsend nodded somewhat sheepishly you demonstrated behavior that you yourself had warned me about sir elliss inward smile broadened yes mr president she chimed in you never told most of us but you warned dr townsend and your inner circle about the true dangers of this virus isnt that correct what are you talking about allaire demanded why the virus ellis said saccharinely im talking about the dreadfully lethal virus you called the fluthe virus that is going to kill us all unless somebody does something drastic it is not always lethal allaire countered oh the fuck it isnt ellis held up gladstones blackberry no thanks to you but i know just how goddamn lethal this virus is i saw what group c has become i even photographed it a primitive rage twisted allaires expression ellis took a cautious step backward you had no right going into that room he said i am the president it is my job to make decisions that are in the best interest of this country telling the whole truth about wrx would have caused a panic here and on the outside that would have endangered everyone i could not take the chance of triggering a pandemic wrong mr president i have the inalienable right to life same as every man woman and child whose survival youve so callously put at risk jordan lamar looked concerned what is she talking about jim he asked you told us the virus wasnt that dangerous he lied to you jordan ellis said he lied to us all and what i propose we do is turn those network television cameras back on and show the american people exactly what it is that were facing just what are we facing ursula the architect asked a certain and horrible death thats what but this legislation i plan to present will guarantee us the delivery of an antiviral treatment allaires jaw fell slack his look was of total dismay and disbelief youre mad he said absolutely mad a no vote to what im proposing would be no different than putting a gun to our heads and pulling the trigger dont listen to her jordan allaire insisted she doesnt have the facts she cant deliver what shes promising is it true sir lamar asked did you lie to us i did what i believed was rightfor all of us for the first time there was little conviction in his voice the virus is going to kill us ellis repeated i have proof i can show you and it will be a horrible death jordan but i tell you again ive secured us an antiviral treatment how allaire shouted at her how is that possible ursula when the only person who could deliver a treatment is working with us we pass my bill and genesis will deliver the antiviral treatment they got the virus they have the treatment allaire went pale what have you done he managed ive cut a deal with them she said this billtheir billfor our lives and before you say we dont negotiate with terrorists i want everybody to see what is going to become of us jordan get this video to play for everybody inside this chamber and i want to simultaneously broadcast it to the american people no more lies no more deception the time has come to do what must be done lets get that broadcast going jordan dont allaire exclaimed our scientist is getting close hes nearing a breakthrough whatever thisthis madwoman has been promised by the terrorists is a lie im telling you the truth there is no treatment yet no cure you will severely impede our ability to operate if you undermine my authority here give me the blackberry lamar said to ursula i want to see the video myself jordan no but lamar snatched the device from elliss outstretched hand and turned his back to keep the president from taking it away the architects shoulders slumped as he watched the horrific recording ellis could hear the tinny audio track sounding through the blackberrys mono speaker she heard the grunts and the screams the sound of vomiting the gunshot mr president what have you done lamar asked jordan dont do it the president said again i am the architect of the capitol sir if i wish to broadcast chamber activities the rules governing this facility permit me to do just that you will be committing a treasonous act allaire warned lamar shook his head grimly then that will be an action of which we will both be guilty mr president he said madam speaker ill arrange for the broadcast lamar turned on his heels and quickly walked away come back here allaire cried out come back here this instant the president grabbed the armrest of a nearby chair and with surprising ragedriven strength yanked it free splintering the wood holding the armrest aloft he took a menacing step toward ellis his face was contorted with anger the arm holding his makeshift weapon was shaking then suddenly he dropped the club and gazed with horror at his hands ellis and the others immediately saw what was upsetting him so his palms were now marked by an intricate design of circular swirlslines the color of blood chapter day midnight cst battered and aching as much in his heart as his body griff kept a vigilant lookout for police on his fourandahalf hour drive east to wichita it was doubtful his disappearance from kalvesta had been discovered yet but as a precaution he drove the speed limit used his turn signals and adhered to all the rules of the road getting stopped for even a minor traffic transgression could lead to questions and questions especially the way he was looking would lead to problems after cleaning up the scene of two violent deaths at the cahill ranch griff drove through the night stopping at a twentyfourhour truck store for some clothes and to clean up the trip was lonely and anguished angie was in a new york hospital and now his dearest friend was deadgone from his life forever who was the man who had ambushed them and killed melvin how had he known of their plan was there anything griff could have done to anticipate and prevent it mile after mile passed and still the questions remained unanswered making the tragedy of melvins terrible death even more painful was what griff had done with his friends body when he returned from the barn to melvins side he futilely checked him for any hint of life then utterly worn out he sank onto the frozen windswept ground and wept finally he changed into the parka and jeans that melvin had brought for him patrols around the lab would be more frequent with rappaport on base as quickly as he could manage he emptied melvins pockets and as reverently as he could lowered the body over the edge of the steep ventilation shaft then with a silent prayer he let go next he drove melvins taurus around until he found the killers cara nondescript rental with an agreement in the glove compartment that almost certainly was obtained using forged papers the keys were on the floor a trip back to the barn to stuff the giants body into the trunk and he left the car hidden in a secluded grove of cypress trees it would be found at some point and an all points bulletin would probably be issued but hopefully not until long after he and brother xavier bartholomew had done their business as griff used the winch to resettle the heavy gratethe tombstone for his closest friendhe was thinking vengeance the death of melvins killer wasnt nearly enough he wanted genesis he wanted them badly he would hunt them as intensely as he had hunted outbreaks of marburg virus and he would do whatever was necessary to bring them down highway ks was largely deserted griff drove with the car radio off preferring silence and memories of his quirky assistant to news about the capitol eventually the lights of downtown wichita came into view he imagined sylvia chen driving along this same road two years before her research at the time he knew was foundering and the rug of secret federal financing was about to be pulled out from beneath her it was hardly a stretch to envision the scientist frantic to keep her research afloat arranging a meeting with a bogus saver of souls that would lead to desperate decisions and horrific choices she was going to accelerate solving the problems of her troubled but potentially remarkable virus by testing it on humans once again at least to the extent described in her recipes from the kitchen chen had failed to control her creation all of her human subjects had diedall that was except possibly for one it would have been disaster for her it was hardly a stretch to imagine that soon after her failure she had entered into a deal with the devil calling itself genesisa deal that would lead to the theft of her virus the frameup and jailing of one of her scientists and finally to her violent death and the impending deaths of hundreds more now it was time to learn exactly what she had done here in wichita whom she had done it to and perhaps most important what if anything she had learned seething griff followed directions to the certain path mission that melvin had printed out and left on the front seat of the taurus streetlamps shimmered like disco balls in the night reflecting off the still water of the arkansas river the height of most of the office towers in the sleepy downtown would have been lost in other metropolises but griffs impression of the city as announced on several signs was that this was a nice place to live a nice place to live unless you happened to stumble into the certain path mission looking for help he drove past a tall highway billboard offering prayers for the government and all the victims of the capitol tragedy the certain path mission was a square twostory stone building tucked away in a quiet neighborhood on the outskirts of wichita a sign on the front lawn lit by two spots and fenced by a circle of neatly trimmed shrubs bore the ministrys name beside the sign stood a small stone statue of a native american woman whose bronze eyes gazed reverently skyward it was just after midnight griff worked his way around the building perimeter and tried to peer through the evenly spaced windows it was hard to imagine the selfproclaimed cleric living anywhere other than in the mission there were no interior lights on that he could see so after a moderately calming breath he shrugged and rang the front doorbell above him and to his right a security camera looked down impassively he had no qualms whatever about waking the brother from all he could tell this was a bad man who had done some very bad things after a minute he rang a second time the heavy oak door creaked open xavier bartholomew rubbing sleepily at his eyes peered out from the blackness griff had no doubt that the gesture belied the fact that the man had checked his security screen before opening the door you look worn and weary my brother bartholomew said his voice a rich bass have you come to purge yourself of the poison festering in your soul i have griff said are you brother bartholomew i am hethe beacon to the certain path his temper on a knifes edge and his patience nearly gone griff forced open the door with his knee and moved quickly past the man who made an unsuccessful attempt to block his entrance brother bartholomew staggered back a step his sleepy expression now one of alarm he was in his early fifties and had on a heavy hooded wool cassock cinched at the waist with a tasseled cord and wellworn birkenstock sandals his oily hair was streaked with gray and pulled back into a tight ponytail which was tucked inside his robe his eyes were dark and narrow and he reeked of stale cigarette smoke and cheap cologne the tawdry furnishings in the foyer and the adjacent living room reflected the man perfectly through the dining room griff could see the chapelrows of mixed folding and kitchen chairs beneath a chandelier that had probably come from a yard sale you are blessed my friend for you have found the certain path bartholomew said quickly regaining his composure i will be happy to counsel you but to begin your journey a sacrifice is required he pointed to a large wooden bucket dangling from a frayed rope that was knotted around a ceiling support beam a whitewashed placard lettered not that meticulously with a sharpie was nailed to the side of the bucket cast your bread upon the water and your return shall be manyfold its always about the bread griff thought i have come a long way to see you he said solidifying his position with several steps toward the living room i have questions that need answering bartholomews wariness returned i see that life has dealt you some cruel blows he said gesturing toward griffs fresh bruises and scabs for now whatever you have in your pocket will suffice to start you on your journey of healing later we will determine how much of an additional sacrifice is required for your cure i am prepared to make a donation to the mission brother bartholomew but only if the answers to my questions are satisfactory now the cleric was on allout red alert exactly what sort of questions are you talking about he asked questions about a scientist named sylvia chen bartholomew paled you a cop nope private dick nope then get the hell out of here brother bartholomew grasped a vase from the top of a small credenza and swung it at griffs head griff erupted ignoring the heavy ache in his chest he blocked the attack sending the vase to the flagstone floor where it shattered bartholomew turned to run but griff snatched ahold of his hood he had not fought anyone since high school but he hadnt felt such fury in at least that long he twisted bartholomews arm behind his back and lifted it toward his shoulderblade then he used his knee to propel the man with force against the stone wall at the rear of the foyer he had never had any martial arts training but every angerdriven move seemed natural with bartholomews arm still pinned to his back griff applied his forearm to the nape of the mans neck pressing his face flush against the wall then leaning in close so he could be heard at a whisper griff growled into bartholomews ear is there anybody else here yes yes there is bartholomew managed the selfproclaimed minister was breathless and shaking with thoughts of melvin griff lifted the mans arm even higher up his back numbed by adrenaline the pain in his own damaged ribs was barely noticeable bartholomews arm was reaching the snapping point no more he cried im alone im alone please let go of my arm its going to break griff relaxed his grip slightly the letup in pressure was enough for bartholomew who countered with surprising quickness and unexpected strength he twisted his body hard to the right breaking free of griffs hold on his wrist then he ducked and turned separating himself from griff entirely without hesitating he dashed through a set of french doors into the chapel and headed toward the back of the mission griff now short of breath but hardly short of determination cursed his stupidity and drove on after the man there was a fire door on the far side of the chapel and bartholomew was now just a few feet away from it but there was no way griff was going to let him get there he left his feet and dove at the back of bartholomews legs buckling the mans knees and sending him skidding across the hardwood floor knocking the chairs about like bowling pins air exploded from the brothers lungs but in seconds he was on his feet again charging toward the fire door on all fours griff caught him by the ankles pulled him to the floor and wrestled him to his back then straddling his chest griff punched him in the faceonce then again blood burst from bartholomews nose and his body went limp painfully griff worked himself to his feet then grabbed a box of tissues off a windowsill and tossed it down to the man tell me about sylvia chen he said breathing heavily i dont know who that is bartholomew my best friend was just murdered because of her mess with me about this and i swear ill punch your teeth in im that angry griff cocked his arm again and his adversary flinched okay i knew her bartholomew remained on his back what did she want with you she she promised she could help me cure drug addiction she told me her system would work and and she said shed pay me to cooperate with her what exactly did you do griff said as he hoisted bartholomew off the floor by the shoulders of his robe i said what did you do we tested something she was working on he said tears began to stream down his red swollen face im not a bad person i wanted to help she was a scientist and she said that she had a treatment she wanted to try out on on some of my tougher clients she said that together we could save many addicts from their misery the man was weeping piteously now but griff would not make the same mistake by lowering his guard did you supply her with people griff was shaking with anger i i did where did she conduct these experiments tell me dammit let me go bartholomew said in a shaky voice and ill do better than tell you hows that ill show you he said chapter day am cst griff kept bartholomews arm pinned tightly against his back and followed closely behind him im not going to run again bartholomew pleaded promise i shouldnt have run in the first place you you surprised me is all please youre really hurting me and im not taking any more chances bartholomew fell silent and led griff through a pair of dimly lit corridors and down a small flight of stairs that ended at a heavy oak door the surrounding walls were concrete bricks painted gray and in need of cleaning youll need to let go of my arm if you want me to take you downstairs ill let go griff said but you need to know that you are in even more of a fix than usual hows that you and sylvia chen are partly responsible for the sickness and death that are going on at the capitol shes dead murdered try my patience now and i wont hesitate to hurt you and im willing to bet that nobody will do anything but cheer with difficulty bartholomew looked over his shoulder he appeared genuinely surprised youre talking about the president he asked griff tried to read through the mans words did he have any idea whether or not the president was involved with what sylvia chen had done at the certain path mission it seemed almost certain that the answer was no allaire at least in terms of this aspect of chens work was probably innocent from now on griff decided if he needed the mans help he would seek it out he would also as soon as possible share his growing suspicions with the president regarding paul rappaport those experiments you helped chen with had nothing to do with drug addiction griff said it was part of a biological research program that i was involved in im a scientista virologist just like chen the virus we were developing that you helped her try out on people here is what the terrorists released during the state of the union address oh god i heard on the news that it was just some sort of flu not anything you know that its lethal dont you dont you the cleric bowed his head then he began to cry ive done such terrible things he said such terrible things his voice trailed off and his body was racked with each sob griff had to remind himself that brother xavier bartholomew was in all likelihood a sociopath capable of turning on emotion like he would a faucet if you cooperate and tell me everything i want to know i promise to speak up on your behalf understood bartholomew nodded dispiritedly griff let go of him and took a cautious step backward ready to react shaking the feeling back into his arm the man withdrew a black string necklace that was tucked inside his robe dangling from it was a large antique metal key that looked straight from the set of a horror movie he unlocked the heavy door with a clank that resonated off the walls then after a hard tug on its ornate handle the door creaked open the passageway behind the door was a spiral stone staircase that was dimly lit by a light glowing from someplace below are there many places like this in wichita griff asked there may be but ive never heard of one apparently the man who built this place was a littlewhats the wordeccentric ill bet i could come up with a few words that were more appropriate bartholomew started down the staircase and griff followed warily the stairs were narrow and so steep that griff used one hand to keep his balance the heavy bonechilling air grew mustier as they descended the smooth sidewalls became exposed rock suggesting that the original excavators had left the stones exactly as their tools had unearthed them eccentric indeed the stairs finally ended at a surprisingly large circular room with three dark passageways extending off of it like the spokes of a wheel hanging on the walls of the room secured there by metal spikes driven into the stone were implements of torture and painwhips batons wood rattans shackles and chains the space kindled memories of his cell in the alcatraz of the rockies what is this place griff asked believe it or not it used to be a wine cellar then i transformed it into what many of my acolytes call the center of all things is this where you beat people it was aversion therapy reserved for only the hardcore addicts and alcoholicsthe ones who had failed at everything else including aa whatever you might have heard i had many many successes okay is this where you conducted youraversion therapy not here bartholomew flicked a wallmounted switch that illuminated the passageway directly in front of them a string of tiny colored christmas lights on a long cord hooked into the ceiling lit the way bizarre macabre alarming disgusting griff searched his vocabulary for the most apt description and found all of them wanting bartholomew ducked to pass underneath an archway and motioned for griff to follow the vapor of their breathing now hung in the chilly air and the musty odor was more overpowering the further in they traveledthe smell of fear and of death griff shuddered ventilation was minimal beneath his parka he had begun to perspire the corridor opened into a square rooman antechamber of some sort there were stone alcoves built into three of the rooms walls each alcove had a wooden door with a small barred window in the upper center i conducted my mission work here bartholomew said sometimes i kept my brothers and sisters here for days without food sometimes if necessary i would beat them the key was to weaken their wills the terrible irony of the mans statement hit home with force griff reflected grimly on the day he first met with sylvia chen at her office at columbia university and on his decision to move to new york to work with her on the microbe she was developing the key is to weaken their wills it seemed possible she had said those exact words your brothers and sisters he asked bartholomew now those who came to me for salvation your prisoners you mean they could leave any time the doors werent locked they asked for this treatment only after they failed at aa and many other programs griff ran his fingertips over one of the doors and tried to imagine what it had been like for bartholomews tragic sisters and brothers how do you explain these locks he asked bartholomew looked remorseful i added the locks at sylvia chens insistence he said explain she came to me with an offer she had researched me well and she knew about my arrest and my ensuing financial troubles she offered me a way to get back on my feet and continue to help people at the same time so she paid you griff vaguely remembered a visit to kalvesta a few years before from a bureaucrat with one of the government accounting offices he wondered now if chen had juggled her books to cover this black site operation he also wondered if the president was in any way involved she paid for everything bartholomew confirmed the equipment that was brought in everything what equipment there were airlocks and partitions and showers and all sorts of things that i didnt understand she wore a biocontainment suit when she worked down here if such a suit is what i think it is she wore one all the time and the people she worked onyour clients they were bottomofthebarrel alcoholics and drug addicts they drifted in for a meal and some prayer and often they stayed they were lonely men and women no family no friends like i said bottom of the barrel correction griff was thinking youre the bottom of the barrel you and sylvia chen so the brothers and sisters dr chen worked onthey all died griff forced back a fresh surge of anger they did how many of them were there altogether i dont know six seven eight greed in actionfinancial and scientific griff felt utterly repulsed what did you do with the bodies he asked we have a large furnace down another passage heats the whole building we cremated the bodies in the furnace then eventually discarded the ashes in a steel drum i dont know what chen did with the drum why are you telling me all this now griff asked tears streamed down bartholomews flushed cheeks because ive been secretly praying that youd come he said between heavy sobs i was too weakwilled to kill myself believe me ive wanted to and ive triedmore than once so i prayed that somebody would find out the truth and come to free me from my sins i guess that person is you griff detested and pitied the charlatan with equal vigor his intentions may have been honorable at one time his methods and his avarice however never were according to my information not all of the subjects involved in chens experiments died bartholomew nodded oh now that i think about it thats true one of them escaped i had given in to chen and started coming down here and wearing those biocontainment suits as you called them i was inexperienced at working in those horrible things and didnt set the lock properly on his cell chen blamed me for the mistake why didnt the guy turn you both in after he got out of here griff asked that wasnt ol jrs style he looked out after jr and no one else besides he was already wanted for robbing a convenience store someplace at gunpoint the man had a heavy habit i mean heavy habits like that need constant feeding what do the initials stand for bartholomew did not answer immediately his cards were almost played out and griff could see him trying to calculate some sort of deal griff could no longer hold back his anger he lunged at bartholomew seizing him by the front of his robe and slamming him backward against the stone wall tell me his name he rasped johnny johnny ray davis he called himself jr though like the guy from tv griff felt his pulse begin to race the blank space beside the mans name in chens notebook was no accident it was certainly possible that he had escaped before being exposed to the wrx virus but then again do you know whether chen ever gave jr the virus griff demanded bartholomew hesitated and griff slapped him across the face with all his strength then he lifted his hand to do it again my patience is gone you fraud answer me a trickle of blood had formed at the corner of bartholomews mouth even in the dim light griff could see his handprint in scarlet on the mans cheek he he was here for more than a week so i suppose he got the virus in fact im sure he got it and he didnt get sick not so far as i know he was well enough to pick the upstairs lock and then steal a bunch of stuff from my desk before he took off jesus griff whispered his heartbeat now a jackhammer do you know where he is bartholomew looked at him with feigned bravado whats in it for me your life griff snapped fiercely grasping the man by the throat bartholomew managed a nod of surrender and griff let up hes in prison el dorado correctional facility now aint that a kick he escapes from this cell here and winds up in el dorado whats he in there for i said whats he in there for griff could see the end of what resistance remained in the man murder double murder in fact bartholomew said bastards there on death row chapter day am cst the el dorado correctional facility situated east of the town of el dorado was a sprawling complex of brown cement buildings seemingly designed to compete with its desolate surroundings following brother bartholomews admissions griff had contacted the president it was time to trust him beyond funding sylvia chens research griff was convinced that james allaire had no connection with the way she had conducted it allaires response to griffs report regarding the certain path mission and j r davis was to galvanize all the resources at his disposal clearly the man understood that time was running out for all those in the capitol now griffs military escort organized in amazingly short order passed through two perimeters one made of chainlink fencing and the second of tightly strung wire both were topped by razor wire griffs limousine driver checked his watch normally takes forty minutes to get here from wichita he said through the partition we did it in just a little over twenty overhead three apache helicopters hovered kicking up dust while their crews kept watch in all directions the el dorado security team met griffs black armorplated limousine at the gate and then escorted the caravan into the correctional facilitys main parking lot a moving wall of humvees flanked each side of the limo ambulances and police cars along with a fleet of motorcycles also participated in the transport team that was filling most of the available parking spaces in the expansive prison lot clearly dr james allaire was not a president of minimal action especially when his life and his familys were at stake griff stepped onto the tarmac and shielded his eyes from the early morning sun and the choppergenerated winds a swat team joined with the military police and the correctional officers from the el dorado facility griff suspected that their orders were to safeguard him from assassination it was good to see that allaire was finally giving genesis their due the circle of armed security surrounding griff parted to allow a lone man to approach he wore a dark suit and had thinning hair on top and an ample belly below his face featured a neatly trimmed gray and brown beard the man shook griffs hand vigorously and shouted to be heard above the helicopters whirl warden jay tobert dr rhodes he said welcome to el dorado well get you processed and with the prisoner as quickly as possible i hope youve had a chance to review the files that you requested griff nodded hed been given the faxed pages by one of the mps and read all about johnny ray davis on the drive to the maximumsecurity penitentiary charged with the shooting death of a husband and wife during a failed carjacking davis was sentenced to die despite an initial plea of innocent the evidence included in the file was irrefutable forensics and ballistics linked davis to the crime several reliable eyewitnesses sealed the case for the prosecution griff swallowed hard as he glanced at the stone walls and steel bars it was one thing to be reminded of time done in prison but something far worse to be back inside one regardless of the reason the familiar feelings of hopelessness and despair returned as though they had never left reception is waiting for you the warden said well go to the tower east building first to get you cleared then well be heading over to our commons building thats where youll meet davis griff followed tobert while the battalion of security followed him looks like youve got some friends in pretty high places tobert understated on their walk to tower east when griff just nodded the warden continued to fish for information not every day the president of the united states calls me to request special access not every day griff echoed i understand that the wichita police arrested this bartholomew fellow on his way out of town again griff nodded he tried to run he said guess he panicked after i made the call to washington i imagine youll be hosting him here at some point we do good keeping our prisoners where theyre supposed to be havent had a successful rabbit since i became warden good thing too because if johnny ray ever busted out of here wed have a heck of a time catching him whys that boys a natural runner tobert said id guess he could run straight to california without stopping or getting winded guy never gets tired jogging in the yard and i mean never well i dont know whatll happen to bartholomew now that hes in custody griff said but i hope it isnt good griff also hoped that allaire would follow through on his promise to investigate paul rappaport that part of their short phone conversation had been anything but pleasant he had called the presidents emergency number from bartholomews cramped cluttered office at the certain path mission rappaport shows up and melvin is killed griff had said to allaire murdered by someone working for genesis explain to me how genesis knew about our plan i cant allaire said but you had no right jeopardizing our objective by sneaking out of kalvesta rhodes youve gone rogue on me and i dont like it one bit pardon my saying so mr president but i dont much care what you like what i care about is what you do and i need you to do something for me what allaire said two things actually i want you to treat rappaport as a suspect have him watched put a tail on him wiretap his phones get ahold of his computers put the cia nsa fbi and any other letters you can think of on him put a dossier together that will detail what hes had for breakfast every morning for the last ten tears im convinced its him and somewhere along the line well find that hes tipped us off to that hes the force behind genesis he did this to become president you think he arranged to have his own daughter robbed while she was taking a shower allaire asked you think he would arrange to traumatize her by cutting up her underwear and spreading it across her bed just so he could get me to appoint him the designated survivor anybody who did this to you and the others at the capitol is capable of anything griff had replied the setup for the release of wrx has been going on for a long time the whole genesis thingthe blackout in new york and those explosionswere just a prologue leading up to the state of the union ill think about it was all allaire had said whats the second thing have sergeant stafford go out with some men to the ventilation shaft to retrieve melvins body he was a hero if you ever get out of this he deserves a congressional medal of honor or whatever the civilian version is of that consider it done now get to that prison and this time keep me posted about what youre doing griff was replaying that conversation in his mind when he was startled by a loud buzz he stiffened at the sound the heavy metal door unlocked and the noise stopped its hard coming back to prison huh the warden commented evidently aware of griffs history you have no idea griff said well thankfully youre right about that griff went through the screening process without incident and followed the warden into the prison yard the helicopters continued to circle overhead like the buzzards in his recurring ebola dream crossing a patch of barren ground they entered the commons building the corridors there were quiet and deserted ive got em on lockdown for as long as youre here tobert announced proudly thanks im sure that wont win j r davis any popularity prizes he can take care of himself truth is i think most of the guys are scared of him the warden opened a door marked attorneys room and motioned griff to follow him inside griff was surprised to see only a foldout table in the center of the room with a plastic chair on either side but no plexiglas divider to separate the lawyers from the convicts he took a seat at the table facing the door four guards stood behind him the door buzzed and then opened three more guards entered escorting a man in an orange prison jumpsuit his ankles and wrists were shackled two of the guards assisted the convict in getting seated faded tattoos of women covered the outsides of both his arms his jetblack hair was buzz cut his narrow face horselike and his upper lip had been gashed at some point and sutured carelessly so that the edges of the vermillion border did not meet the result was what amounted to a permanent sneer but the most striking feature of johnny ray daviss countenancethe one that struck griff almost immediately were his eyes the right one was sky blue and the left was chestnut brown chapter day am cst johnny ray davis griff asked though hed already seen photos of the paleskinned convict its jr whore you davis had an odd twang that griff placed somewhere between midwestern and creole griffin rhodes griff im a virologist davis stiffened a fearful expression chipped away some of his toughguy persona you with that woman from the mission in wichita i was at one time shes dead now good i tried to get those fuckers busted for what they done to me he said her and that bogus preacher i called the police but i couldnt leave my name it werent just me you know there were others too but the police aint much for listenin to the ramblins of a junkie know what i mean hey you got a smoke sorry then how about you send someone to get me some the killer already knew that whatever was going on he had some leverage griff warned himself not to underestimate the man he turned to the warden who had felt it was in his best interest to remain in the room and oversee the most important prisoner visit of his career can you do that griff asked him cigarettes marlboro reds davis clarified youll get what you get the warden snapped a guard exited the room to get the smokes without his needing to be prompted griff leaned across the table what did they do to you jr he asked in a low sympathetic voice griff could see the gears turning in the convicts head davis was clearly not ready to give away anything for free whats this all about the man asked i need to know what happened to you at the certain path mission griff said why its important whats in it for me special privileges griff said it was the first thought that came to his mind the warden gave him a disapproving glare that wasnt part of any discussion i had he said impatient and exhausted griff glowered back at him im sure the federal government will find a way to subsidize you for any added cost or burden the warden grinned and so did davis federal government eh davis said you mean like the president thats right so it aint just rumor what isnt davis sat up straighter and tapped his feet on the floor in a quick rhythm rumor going round the cells is that the president himself personally arranged this little meeting who told you that tobert demanded griff decided in that moment that in any clash of character or intellect between prisoner and jailer his money was on the prisoner hey easy there warden davis said the cons and guards talk we learn things they learn things so is it true did the president send you he did this have anythin to do with whats goin on in washington davis read the surprise in griffs expression we got newspapers in the library you know not all of us are as dumb as we look some of us can even read it is about the capitol davis looked contemplative as he traced the scar on his lip with a nicotinestained fingernail special privileges huh now tell me what happened at the certain path mission davis fell silent he stared at griff through his two differentcolored eyes and remained silent until the guard returned with his cigarettes and an ashtray lit the smoke and handed it to him the convict jostled with his irons to slip the butt into his mouth then he took a long hard drag and exhaled a plume in the wardens general direction they tested on me he said the lady in a white suit like a spaceman i mean spacewoman sprayed stuff in my face she injected me too and almost every day she drew blood outta my arm did she tell you what it was she injected said it would help me get clean off drugs davis said but it didnt take the cravins away none once i heard her and that fake asshole monk talking about burnin bodies but the police didnt think much of my report like i told you that chinawoman and the monk are the ones what should be sittin here not me did they do any other experiments on you she asked me stuff what kind of stuff davis thought for a beat she gave me a stack of cards he began each card had a number on it from one to ten or sometimes a shape like a star or a circle then shed tell me to pick up a card and study it i werent allowed to show her the number see but she asked me what it was sometimes she told me that i had to lie about it like if i had a four id tell her it was a seven or something you see go on griff said youre doing great but then shed ask me if i was lyin to her well of course i were lyin to her davis said with a laugh she told me to that were the instruction but heres the rubthe real weird part sometimes she said to me that if i admitted to lyin about the number shed burn my arm with a solderin iron so you were supposed to tell her that you werent lying about your card number even though you did thats right davis said simple no im not lyin its really a seven so dont burn me and what happened when she asked if you were lying i was sort of woozyhalf asleep if you know what i mean but i do know that i told her the truth i mean the real truth i admitted to her when i uz lyin and i admitted to her when i werent davis looked down at his cigarette clearly upset at what he was remembering you admitted to lying even though it meant youd get burned davis turned his wiry arms over and showed griff a series of crisscross scars that covered both forearms and extended nearly up to his biceps the scars were almost certainly burns griff felt his stomach turn and his heart begin to race this was it did you even try to lie to her every time davis admitted i knew how bad that damn iron burned but shed ask me johnny ray tell the truth now are you lyin to me about that number sometimes id shake my head no but then id answer yes and then shed burn me and we did it over and over again davis clearly distressed by the memories asked the guard for another smoke griff could only stare at him not only did he survive his wrx exposure but the virus in his body had actually worked on the will center for all of chens shortcomings the test she had devised was truly brilliantbrilliant and elegantly simple johnny ray davis lacked the willpower to lie even though he knew the consequence of telling the truth would be extreme pain then griff felt a knot developing in his gut he knew that he desperately needed this mans blood he needed to study it to figure out what had allowed him to live when all the others had died but he also knew using daviss serum would be tantamount to the most egregious violation of his own code he had committed his lifes work to testing on computer models not animals but orion kept failing him and time was running out to make his program work he needed to feed it better data and the data that he needed was coursing through the arteries and veins of the man seated across from him did it matter that johnny ray davis was a convicted double murderer did it matter that griff wasnt the one who had exposed him to the virus and tested its effects sooner or later every drug intended for use in humans or animals needed to be tried in humans or animals where should the line be drawn help me louisa help me know i need your blood griff suddenly heard himself saying davis treated the request the way he might a tendollar cigarette trade how much blood he asked all of it davis coughed out a thick cloud of smoke and stubbed away the last embers of his marlboro hows that possible he asked its called plasmapheresis griff explained well replace your blood with a substance called albumin and where necessary a fresh supply that matches your blood type hospitals do it all the time whats this for you tryin to figger out why im still alive yes thats exactly what im trying to figure out why do you think i didnt die if i had to guess yeah if you had to guess youre heterochromic griff said im hetero what your eyes theyre two different colors its a genetic marker often accompanies other genetic deals thats why i need your blood i need to see whats different about itwhat else beside the gene for your eye color because to be honest you should be dead my sisters eyesre just like mine im not surprised well aint that just a peach davis said you need my blood but you cant just gut me like a fish to get at it can you no i cant but what youre really sayin is that the president hisself needs my blood i have paperwork youll need to sign to authorize the transfusion griff said not so fast amigo davis answered you know that im innocent the bastards are gonna fry me for a crime i didnt do griffs mind flashed on the photographs of the brutally murdered husband and wife that were included in the case file he had reviewed im not here to judge you jr he said im here to take your blood well i thought you should know that i uz innocent before i tell you what its gonna cost you want money davis laughed sharply and lit another smoke no you stupid prick he said i want you to call your buddy mr president and get him to issue me a full presidential pardon you can have my blood all right but ill be a free man before i give you one innocent drop of it chapter day am cst the kitchen was like a ghost town griffs biosuit was isolating enough when melvin was around now it merely enhanced his inestimable sadness and loneliness each procedure felt like the last one he would be able to perform even with the crisis in the capitol and the ticking bomb of wrx thoughts of angie were the only thing keeping him on task after chad stafford and his men had retrieved melvin from the ventilation shaft and returned to the compound griff had spent some time alone beside the plastic bag containing his friends body his family in west virginia had opted for cremation and a memorial service sometime in the future griff promised melvins sister and mother that if the president survived the crisis in the capitol he would be there to honor the man who had done so much to save his life now he knew that he needed to have the help of his gangly oddly obsessed soulmate one more timeas motivation to press ahead with the analysis of johnny ray daviss serum and the incorporation of the new data into the program he had named after orion the hunter griff barely spoke on the army helicopter flight from el dorado back to kalvesta he kept running the led zeppelin song dazed and confused over in his mind it had been thirtysix hours since he left the labthirtysix hours of minimal sleep of watching his closest friend be murdered and of being battered in body and spirit dazed and confused the president had taken almost no time at all to pardon davis for his crimesproof of how critical things had gotten for the seven hundred waiting in the capitol for news that they might not die griff had left the now exconvict at the hospital where hed undergone the plasmapheresis the legacy of wrx grisly death after grisly death and now a double murderer set free paul rappaport was still at kalvesta and was there to greet griff when he deplaned the two men shook hands but griff did nothing to hide the coldness he was feeling youre genesis you son of bitch he thought i know you are rappaport appeared relatively calm were counting on you rhodes was all that he said as griff started his journey downward youre counting on me to fail griff said to himself but win or lose im going to bring you down and when i do theres going to be a photo of melvin forbush in your coffin sergeant stafford coordinated the security detail assigned to cover griff and barked out instructions that kept his team on constant alert stafford and some troops accompanied griff down to the lab level because of the exposure risk they guarded only the entrance to the kitchen not the kitchen itself griff passed into the restricted area alone carrying with him in a large cooler lined with icepacks six liters of johnny ray daviss anticoagulated blood carefully griff decanted some plasma into four test tubes and set each tube in one of four wells of a large centrifuge the instrument whirled in excess of three thousand revolutions per minute separating cellular debris from the serum seven hundred lives rested on his finding an elusive antigen or some unusual enzyme in that serumsomething that had allowed davis to survive while others exposed to wrx had died seven hundred lives were running out of time griff used gel electrophoresis to separate the treated serum into dna rna and protein molecules for further analysis police forensics used the technique to amplify dna for their criminal investigations but griff was interested in every component of the serummost specifically something unique to jr davis hours passed frustration and apprehension grew fatigue became a mortal enemy then suddenly it was there interleukin daviss serum contained ten times the normal level of the protein interleukin ten times the norm griff checked and rechecked his technique and his calculations he felt a vibration at the base of his neck and down his spine he knew the sensation well it occurred whenever an idea had begun to take hold and grow what exactly was it that the warden said about davis griff tried to recall the man could run straight to california without becoming windedsomething like that never gets tired jogging in the yard never it had been a simple offtopic conversation that griff had nearly forgotten about but suddenly when viewed in a different context that comment took on an enormous new significance griff knew a great deal about the il protein it was secreted by tcells and functioned in part to stimulate the bodys response to traumaburns tissue damage and such he was also aware that il for reasons still unknown became elevated during periods of physical stress he conducted some quick research on the internet and found a study of fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis that linked patients with the differentcolored irises to elevated levels of il in the blood the fuchs variant of heterochromia was associated with viral illness probably measles griff began to wonder what would happen if he added an adjuvant to oriona biochemical booster that amplified il production but which one more research online more poring through his grad school notes and his files of articles bless you melvin for keeping everything in order bless you old friend one possibility kept arising antisense oligodeoxynucleotides more commonly called odns the odd name was also known by geneticists as negative sense sense and antisense proteins were increasingly being used to battle complex diseases such as aids asthma and even muscular dystrophy in theory a synthetic strand of the nucleic acid could bind to messenger rna and effectively alter its behavior griff powered up his computer he modified orions programming to include an odn adjuvant that stimulated il production from the bodys lymph nodes and spleen in his program griff magnified the production of il until the levels cranked out by the body treated with odn matched those found in daviss blood ten times the norm side effects of the treatment were not a concern with a wrx infection the only thing worse than the inevitable death were the days that preceded it adding the antisenseodn adjuvant to his orion program took more than four hours griff had barely eaten or slept in two days still with the excitement of the discovery he found that his focus was sharp his brain was pulsating with possibilities work baby come on deliver for papa when the programming was complete griff sat in silence for a time with his finger poised above the return key set to execute orions run sequence images of the capitol and jim allaire tumbled through his thoughts along with those of angie and melvin and louisa and even moonshine finally his jaw set he held his breath and pressed the key orion was programmed by griff to terminate computation the instant it failed no reason to waste computing time processing a deadend treatment the longer orions program processed the greater the probability of success over the years of working in sylvia chens lab griff had run thousands of simulations that churned through thousands of preprogrammed assumptions subroutines and over a hundred thousand lines of complex code in all that time orion had never run for longer than ten minutes griff watched the digital clock on his computer monitor as it counted the time two minutes passed then three then five griff could feel the adrenaline rushing through his circulation eight minutes nine at the tenminuteandzerosecond mark orions program terminated with the abruptness of a racecar hitting a wall griff knew without having to read through the output what had happened his system had failed once again four more hours griff tweaked the levels of the adjuvant to drive the il levels from ten times normal up to thirty always in increments of five he ran a test for each change that he made every time orions treatment simulation failed and always at the tenminutezerosecond mark beneath his suit griff was sweating profusely now he was exhausted to the point of delirium but time was continuing to spill away for the people in the capitol he refused to quitto believe that he and the system he so believed in had failed then like a lantern approaching through fog an idea came to him what if il levels were just a part of the solution what if there was something unique in daviss serum itself that would make the treatment work griff altered orions programming so that in addition to the antisenseodn booster it incorporated an exact replica of the dna rna and proteins found in daviss blood then once again his eyes fixed on the counter he initiated the program once again orion began to synthesize a blocker against the growth of the wrx virus at the nineminute mark griff felt a tremor of anticipation begin at nine minutes and fortyfive seconds he began to hyperventilateshort shallow rapid respirations he closed his eyes waited for as long as he could stand then looked at the timer eleven minutes and fortyeight seconds and orion was still running in all it took twentyfive minutes for the program to complete griff flushed with excitement waited for the output to compile when the data finished processing he sank into his chair hed been so conditioned to expect failure that when success finally had occurred he did not exactly know how to feel angie was the key if she had not succeeded in new york none of this would have been possible because of her they had an antiviral treatment he wished he could call and tell her but with rappaport listening in he wasnt certain the idea was a good one then griff began to wonder orion had worked at least according to the computer it had worked the data said the drug would be a success but he had no empirical proofno infected subjects that he had cured what should be done next the laboratory had an extensive supply of biological and synthetic agents to work with he checked the reagent case and confirmed there was enough antisenseodn on hand for him to perform at least one test then he asked himself if he really needed a test to prove that his treatment worked wasnt his computer model proof enough wasnt that the point of his work hadnt he found a way to develop and test drugs that spared animals from the agony and torture of experimentation he studied orions output files again imagining himself standing at a crossroad but unlike the crossroad immortalized in song and story griff suspected the devil was waiting for him regardless of which direction he chose he closed his eyes and waited for the answer to come soon his thoughts became filled with noise it took time for him to recognize the hideous soundsthey were the screams of monkeys dying in hells kitchen from an accidental overdose of wrx in that moment griff knew exactly what he had to do he stood up from his workstation his legs were barely functional from sitting for so long he carefully retrieved living wrx virus from the cultures that melvin had maintained and used a syringe to mix the virus with a hundred milliliters of saline solution in theory his computer models alone should be enough proof that he had succeeded in his heart though he knew that was not enough perhaps one day orion would be used to jumpstart a movement that would reduce or better still eliminate animal testing in both virology and other areas of medical and product research but for now the certain path to an antiviral treatment no matter what his computer spit out was to work with an infected host moving as in a dream griff disconnected his air hose and unzipped his biocontainment suit he removed his helmet and gratefully wiped the sweat from his face then he set the syringe down on the table and prepared a single dose of orions theoretical antiviral treatmenta mixture of johnny ray daviss serum and a powerful il boosting adjuvant he had the perfect test subject to prove all of his theories and validate all of his work he had himself chapter day midnight cst griff knew that calls made from the phone system in the kitchen were being monitored around the clock but he didnt care rappaport was about to learn that there might have been a breakthrough but griff would figure out what to do about that when it became a certainty he moved the intercom over to his workstation put it on speaker dialed for a longdistance line and called angies cell phone if she didnt answer he would try a call to her nurses station to get a message to her to call about a family emergency his biocontainment suit lay crumpled in a ball by his feet win or lose the die was cast two rings and angie answered she sounded as if she might have been sleeping griff glanced up at the wallmounted clock it was twelve fifteen in the morning kansas time one fifteen eastern hiya lady griff said leaning back and savoring air that wasnt coming into a helmet via a tube greetings from the heartland griff ive been hoping each call was you allaire and his doctor have been in touch with me and theyve sent specialists in and put some guards outside the door and in here but i was wondering when id ever hear your beautiful voice again you dont sound like youre speaking from behind a mask though where are you whats going on you got news griff smiled at the phone wishing she could see how happy she was making him the rocketfire questions continued always the reporter he held off answering for as long as he could content just to listen to her the elevation in his spirit confirmed two things he already knew he loved her as much as ever probably more and he was right in needing to hear her voice before he injected himself with the virus angie griff cut in finally tell me how youre doing you sound okay im fine really tired is all that may have something to do with that im not sleeping regularly instead i drop off for twenty minutes here and twenty there but no real rem sleep if you know what i mean i do yes when this is all over were going to this south pacific island thats covered from one end to the other with mattresses i read about it in national geographic sealy serta tempurpedics all the best brands any word on a discharge looks like today sometime this afternoon i want to get back there to you guys i miss you both so much angie read griffs silence almost immediately somethings the matter what is it more silence griffs eyes begin to well and he wondered if he was going to be able to speak its melvin he finally managed hes dead now the prolonged silence was from angies side of the line tell me she said after a while griff shared an abbreviated version of the events following her injury up to the plasmapheresis on j r davis oh im sorry griff she said when he had finished i am so sad and so sorry what a terrific fellow he was i know how close you two were and im glad you got the man who killed him thanks as soon as we can well go visit his family in west virginia he looked over at the loaded syringes on a metal tray by his desk it seemed almost wishful to be talking about their future i do have a bit of good news he continued tell me tell me thanks to you and melvin i believe weve done it according to orion ive got a workable antiviral treatment he had hoped there would be more exuberance in his voice but angie understood and the excitement in her voice filled in for his lack of enthusiasm oh griff thats wonderful i knew you could do it i knew it griff hesitated it was time to tell her i still dont know for certain that my conclusions will work not surprisingly angie sensed what was coming i dont understand just that all i know at this point is what orion has told me and he looks suspiciously like a computer there was prolonged silence griff what are you going to do she asked finally he could hear the apprehension in her voice i need to be certain that im right ang he said we have a limited supply of daviss serum hes probably someplace a thousand miles away by now the people in the capitol are in serious trouble and its getting worse fast if we go there with what i have and orion is wrong for whatever reason theres no time to come back here and fool around griff i dont like where this is going i need you to be with me angie i need you more than you could ever know griff please im going to dose myself with the virus and then im going to give myself the treatment no there has to be another way if it doesnt work then ill leave you my notes and the serum i dont trust anybody but you with this information youll come to kalvesta with another research team and pick up where i left off maybe therell still be some people left in the capitol we can help try it on an animala monkey a chimpanzee if youre wrong youll die but im not wrong griff said what do you mean i dont understand he sighed all these years ive been telling everyone who would listen that computers can supplant animal testing its been my mantrathe one thing since my sister died that allowed me to work in virology ive thought about this ang its time to trust the program ive spent so much of my life developing its time and its right now please i need you to understand i i do understand she said griff could hear her crying for a time he cried with her its going to work he said it has to i love you griff she sobbed ive loved you since the first day we met i love you too angie he said just think about that island in the pacific all those palm trees growing up through those doublethick pillowtop mattresses hammocks too griff picked up the syringe filled with wrx and saline hammocks too he said all over the place he had premixed the antiviral treatment based on the data from his only successful orion test he and orion had calculated there would be enough serum for seven hundred and thirty doses what are you doing talk me through it griff angie said please talk me through it im cleaning the puncture site on my arm with alcohol im fine honey i love you ive got a vein a real good one i love you griff everythings going to be all right tell me everything is going to be all right im in everythings going to be all right you told me on the houseboat not to just sit there drinking beer and fishing you were right this is where im supposed to be doing something that matters okay im going to inject griff here it goes griff slid the needle into the bulging cord snapped off the tourniquet and depressed the plunger since he had chosen to go the iv route using a large concentrated quantity of virus symptoms would not take long to develop griff took in a few deep breaths could it be that his chest already felt tight was that anxiety or was the virus already taking hold griff talk to me its in he said im doing fine how long will you wait twenty minutes then ill inject orions treatment twenty minutes god what am i going to do for twenty minutes we could tell ghost stories he suggested not funny just sit with me angie just breathe into the phone just say something every now and then be with me be my lover be my friend thats all i need griff closed his eyes and listened to every sound that she made the rustling of her hospital bedsheets the beeping of some machine in the background her sighs her sobs his chest was getting tighter there was wheezing now too he could hear it and feel it breathing deeply and deliberately through his nose he picked up the syringe containing the antiviral serum orion had been pleased that j r daviss blood was ab negative griff wondered if that was related in any way to the interleukin excess and the heterochromia linked genes perhaps talk griff talk to me angie demanded its in ive got the treatment inside me we just need to wait now want me to call you back you big jerk how long do we wait a couple hours i suppose close your eyes angie ill wake you up ive got my phone plugged in so i can stay on the line i wont fall asleep its okay if you do griff sat at his desk staring at the black plastic intercom and wishing it were she his eyes felt heavy but he suspected it would be impossible for him to sleep the tightness was no better but it did not seem much worse for an hour they spoke only intermittently they talked about melvin mostly and what angie had been through in chinatown and they talked about africa somewhere in the second hour angie fell asleep they had been quiet for a stretch and then griff heard the pattern of her breathing change instead of waking her he just listened an irritation had developed in his throat and he cleared it with a small cough he didnt want to think about the scene when he first arrived in statuary hall at the capitol but there was no way he could stem the flood of images he wondered if by now he should have been feeling sicker he continued to listen to angie as she slept it was nearing five in the morningsix angie time griff took his vitals on the hour no change he reached for the pen and notebook where he kept those records something about his hand caught his attention something that had not been there just a short while before trying to will what he was seeing not to be so he turned his hands over and held them up his heart sank suddenly the tight band around his chest intensified and his breathing became more labored covering most of each palm not unlike the bullseye symbol for the popular department store were intense slightly irregular concentric scarlet circles everything okay darling angie asked dreamily i think i fell asleep yeah ang griff said still staring in utter dismay at his palms everythings fine chapter day am cst the sharp knock on paul rappaports front door awakened him from a fitful sleep time was running out for the seven hundred in the capitol he felt certain he had been dreaming about how he would have handled the disaster had he been in jim allaires position but he couldnt recall any of the details with the possibility of starting a pandemic very real would he have made the heroic choice allaire had madeessentially opting to sacrifice himself his family and many many of his friends and supporters in exchange for keeping the country and possibly even the population of the world safe unless the rebel rhodes came throughand rappaport strongly doubted that was going to happenit would not be long before the call came summoning him to dc to assume the presidency his mouth went dry at the prospect come in he called pulling on a terrycloth robe janet fox the secret service agent covering him on the graveyard shift slipped inside she was dressed for the high plains winter in ski pants and a furlined parka but still looked cold mr roger corum and two others are here to see you sir she said they say its important and confidential ive taken them next door and sent for backup to help me check them over that wont be necessary janet im afraid we have our orders about that sir straight from the top oh i understand do what you have to do i wont get in the way hopefully things will get better at the capitol soon sir hopefully so but i dont see it happening rappaport had showered brushed his teeth and brewed himself a cup of coffee when fox returned he wondered what could be happening at this hour that was so important to the staghorn people at last report five or six hours ago corum and his technical crew were making rapid progress and would probably finish establishing their stateoftheart security and monitoring system by the end of the day the final task would be the most importantinstalling monitoring cameras inside the kitchen if rhodes failed the system would still be put to good use one of rappaports first acts as president would be to beef up the kalvesta facility as the jewel in his administrations bioterrorism research and counterinsurgency force that division of his newage army would be only the beginning of an allout war to secure national borders keep out illegal aliens and quash terrorisma comprehensive approach that would dwarf all such efforts to date allaire had done a halfdecent job battling a complex problem but paul rappaport would go down in history as the president who made it safe to live in america after janet fox assured him that the officials from staghorn security were clean she led them in and directed them to the conferencemonitoring area set up in one of the large front rooms in less time than rappaport believed possible corum and his team had mounted three digital touchscreen maps to the bungalow walls the maps allowed the homeland security chief to track threats against the united states from any number of terrorist organizations domestic or international in the room across the hall there were several computer workstations and two satellite phones one of which had a dedicated connection to the hard room at the capitol marguerite prideaux and colin whitehead followed corum to the conference area each carrying a mug of coffee their expressions were grim whats going on rappaport asked once the four of them were settled in around his small table we were in the process of getting the communication hub online with the new monitoring equipment corum said when one of marguerites workers picked up a transmission from the laboratorys intercom phone system here have a look corum handed rappaport a stack of printedout pages the three security experts waited patiently while the secretary of homeland security read when he finished with the transcript rappaport set the pages facedown in front of him what do you make of this he asked pallid cachectic colin whitehead answered for the group he was an ivy league intellectualyale rappaport thought he remembered we arent sure whitehead said weve had to shut down all laboratory video feeds in order to get the new board and the updated equipment installed all we can monitor for about another three or four hours are conversations within the various rooms down there and also the phones a coughing jag cut whiteheads explanation short rappaport heard the mucus rattling in the mans chest and grimaced ivy league or not he detested smokers the stench was bad enough but he found the weakness of the habit even more reprehensible once his antiterrorism program was underway with all that it entailed he would turn his attention to shoring up borders and intensifying the war on drugs included in that war would be a jihad against smoking and smokers marguerite prideaux picked up where whitehead had left off her french accent was pleasing to the secretary as was her shapely body and her selfconfidence it seems the virologist working at this moment down below us believes that he has a cure for the infection in your capitol building she said and he has now intentionally exposed himself to the virus to prove it and do you believe from this conversation you recorded that he has a cure corum spoke up again we unfortunately dont have the video to confirm what is going on in the lab right now but the answer to your question is yes he sounds quite confident actually i can still call down to rhodes yes of course the intercom will reach him in any room and because he might still be helmeted and wouldnt hear as well over the rushing air lights will flash all over to tell him theres a call you people think of everything rappaport said competition is fierce in our field prideaux replied we must stay always one step ahead i feel exactly the same about politics the secretary said chuckling listen for the time being im going to assume rhodes is onto something but hes as slippery as a greased eel and i dont trust him im going to call down on the intercom and see if i can get some information from him meanwhile see if you can get the video monitors working in the lab ahead of schedule i dont have the least desire to go down there and put on one of those biosuits if rhodes survives what hes done ill have to confirm it and then get in touch with the president getting a direct look at him will help chapter day pm est angies headache was not nearly as bad as the doctors had predicted it might be there was a mild throbbing above her eyes where the fracture was but nothing moreat least not yet as instructed in the fax from griff she had taken the subway from the station across the street from the hospital but switched trains four times twice to backtrack to previous stops at each station angie subtly surveyed the crowd for anybody whom she had seen before her throat was dry and tight and her heart beat like a drumline but still she maintained what she thought was a calm measured exterior in a previous incarnation as an investigative reporter she had learned a good many tricks of the trade of how to follow or avoid being followed some of those she employed now convinced that she was alone she finally took a cab from columbus circle to penn station and boarded the acela the express train to washington the firstclass car was nearly full but she had managed to get a single separated by a table from another single the instructions in the fax had been explicit in every respect but reading it left angie concerned after their long loving early morning on the phone together she had expected to get a followup call from griff telling her that things were still going well with the treatment he and his computer program had created instead a few hours after their conversation had ended she had a surprise visitorwu mei the stunning young charge nurse from the riverside nursing home mei was overjoyed to find angie ready for discharge and shyly handed her a small box of chinese candy and a manila envelope containing the fax griff had been meticulous in his preparation and had clearly chosen this route of delivery as the one he could trust more than any others the cover page with the fax explained that this was an emergency and that wu mei was to be called immediately to bring it to angie fletcher at lower manhattan hospital to angie he wrote that communication from now on would be facetoface only no phones no texting no email her job was to deliver the fax to general frank egan at the capitol who would then bring it in to president allaire and return with orders for her until she reached egan she would essentially be on her own the fax was specific enough especially given that griff knew that one or two people at the nursing home might read it still there was a coldness to his writinga detachment that made angie uncomfortable something was wrong either with him or around him she could feel it in her heart he hadnt called her back and after saying any number of times over the phone that he loved her there was not one word of concern caring or encouragement the end of the fax asked allaire to call him after reading it something was wrong with him the acela was smooth and fast and several times during the trip to dc angie actually dozed off the fax was on her lap in a briefcase she had bought in a leather store near the hospital at griffs instruction she had purchased a couriers security chain and had it attached from the handle of the case to her wrist general egan was waiting for her at the capitol minutes later she was assigned two fbi agents to babysit her until he was done meeting with president allaire one of them was a hot gumsnapping africanamerican chick in a miniskirt and thighhigh boots and the other was a stocky brunette wearing jeans hornrimmed glasses and a backpack and looking to be no more than twenty the two agents settled in with her at a nearby coffeeshop an hour passed then two more the undercover fbi agents were clearly accustomed to waiting they chatted read and even napped at one point over the phone they reserved a room for angie at a nearby hotel a while later they took her out to buy a small suitcase some clothes and some toiletries finally general egan summoned them back to the capitol then the head of the northern command dismissed her bodyguards and brought angie into his small but wellequipped field office first of all tell me she said is griff all right theres something about the way he wrote that fax that makes me think theres trouble no one said anything to me about there being a problem youre a lousy liar angie quickly concluded why arent you telling me the truth griff was sick she concluded the antiviral serum had failed and he was ill or worse damn him for not telling me damn him damn them youve read the fax ms fletcher egan said so you know what the president is planning to do at our safe house i think the idea is brilliant i want to be there when it goes down we discussed that possibility and im afraid the president has rejected it then you let me go inside there and speak to him myself i understand youve been in the hospital with quite a nasty head injury im going to be there she said pointedly ignoring the inference we can put you in the surveillance van it will just be a couple of blocks away genesis murdered two dear friends of mine and now the man i care more for than anyone in the world may be sick im going to be there in that safe house when griffs plan starts unfolding and when this whole thing is over im going to tell the stories of melvin forbush and gottfried sliplitz and most of all of griffin rhodes you tell president allaire i deserve that egan looked somewhat bewildered then he excused himself and left the office griff was ill she thought as she sat there grim and angry the serum hadnt worked the way he anticipated and now he was sick but he was determined not to go down without taking paul rappaport with him they had to let her be there angie was working through her response to being turned down by allaire when egan reentered his office okay ms fletcher he said taking his place at his small desk youre in its your story now heres what youve got to do chapter day pm cst the intercom conversation with griffin rhodes was about what rappaport had anticipatedas icy as the kansas morning and as informative as a weather report yes his computer program seemed to have succeeded in creating a program for an antivirus treatment and yes he trusted his work enough to try it out on himself now there was nothing to do but wait he would be running tests on himself throughout the day and as soon as he was confident things were still going well he would notify rappaport as well as the president and finally yes he was aware that time was of the essence that was all rhodes was impossible to deal with frustrated and anxious rappaport did an hour of calisthenics and weights caught up on some correspondence and wandered over to the staghorn headquarters to check on progress with the video monitoring there were technical delays he was told before their people could be suited up and sent into the hot zone another four hours corum told him maybe five marguerite prideaux made him some tea but then had to leave when one of her team reported on the technical problems rappaport returned to his office and called to check in on his daughter who was still living at their home and was absolutely paranoid about the secret service presence there she was also upset that the latest series of meds werent working and she wondered if she should be back in the hospital after terminating their conversation as quickly as he could rappaport decided to check in on rhodes again he was crossing to the intercom when the satellite phone on his desk chirped announcing an incoming call he quickly pushed the key sequence required to connect with it then he put it on speaker and set his feet up on the desk secretary rappaport he announced paul its jim we need to talk rappaport felt himself tense is this it i may have some important news for you as well he said allaire went on as if he hadnt heard a few minutes ago i called dr rhodes to check on his progress and you learned that he had dosed himself with the wrx virus you know sir ive been preparing a report for you a few hours ago staghorn technologies intercepted a lengthy unauthorized communication from the kalvesta labs to the cell phone of angela fletcher the reporter who disappeared from here shes in manhattan i know allaires voice had a weakness to itan odd quaver as if he had aged at that moment there was a knock on rappaports door excuse me for just a moment sir he said someones at the door come in one of the dayshift agents stepped inside and announced that roger corum was there that he had been checked over next door and that it was important rappaport nodded to show him in the head of staghorn entered holding up another transmission its roger corum sir the ceo of staghorn security i suspect what he is there for has something to do with why im calling mr corum is this regarding the conversation i just had with dr rhodes yes sir it is i have a transcript of it in my hand remarkably quick work rhodes said there was no safe line down there in the lab i guess hes right just leave it there mr corum the secretary can read it over after weve spoken yes mr president corum mouthed the words good luck and backed out ive been told staghorn has highest clearance allaire said yes sir i feel strongly that they can be trusted with whatever is in this transmission excellent gary will brief you allaire said youre on speaker after a beat the secretary of defense took over paul you holding up all right very worried about you all gary with good reason but there may be a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel one that isnt an approaching freight train go on i may be repeating things you already know but at oh one hundred hours griffin rhodes ran a successful computer simulation of his antiviral treatment program named orion following that simulation rhodes intentionally and very bravely injected himself with a high concentration of wrx virus to prove that it would work on those of us who have been exposed here in the capitol did the treatment involve the blood he came back with from the inmate at el dorado exinmate salitas said president allaire pardoned him the bastard wouldnt cooperate if he didnt i would have done the same thing you did mr president thank you allaire said hes the only known survivor of a wrx exposure salitas went on rhodes mixed his serum with a chemical called an adjuvant thats used to boost the level of a specific blood protein and was the treatment a success it was not salitas said flatly within hours of dosing himself with a purposely massive amount of virus rhodes developed shortness of breath cough and curious markings on his palms that we know are symptoms and a sign of midstage infection good lord rappaport said were in a very dire situation paul we believe most of the population in group c is now deceased locked inside the senate chamber group b in statuary hall is worsening and the president who is in group a is showing signs of viral spread as well like rhodes red markings have appeared on his palms and his temper is becoming more labile this is terrible rappaport said wondering about the light in the tunnel salitas had spoken about to make matters even worse the defense secretary said we cant find the vice president henrys vanished hes been missing for a couple of days were still looking but so far nothing do you think he left the capitol we havent dismissed any possibility on top of everything that harpy ursula ellis has convinced the architect of the capitol to resume television broadcasts from inside the house chamber shes done what it appears shes been in touch with genesis dont ask us how shes been an obstruction on every level in fact shes drafted legislation which she claims genesis wants to have passed legislation what are you talking about a bill salitas said like a real legal bill most of congress is here so they can do it shes distributed the bill its been debated for days and now shes pushing for a vote apparently genesis are some sort of ultra leftwing whackjobs an aclu on steroids the legislation they are demanding will repeal the patriot act make wiretapping illegal and dismantle almost every advancement weve made in bolstering our national security we cant let that happen it very well might the president said taking over the line once more ellis is prepared to share what she knows about the virus with the american people i did my best to hold back the truth i wanted to avoid a panic it appears now that decision will be used against me why does she want this bill passed if it passes allaire said genesis is promising theyll deliver her the antiviral treatment shell be a hero and with henry missing if i die she wont have any trouble taking over is that true about genesis having a treatment no of course not whoever the hell they are theyre playing her like a rented fiddle why stalling ill bet stalling until until were all dead the weakness in allaires voice had become even more pronounced isnt there anyone who can reason with her rappaport asked gary here again salitas said ellis wont listen to reason shes crazy for power shes even got bethany townsend the presidents doctor watching his every move for signs that hes not fit to remain in office jim is ready to veto elliss bill but at the moment it looks like shes going to outlast him my god again allaire took over i might not be president long enough to stop its passage paul the situation is truly at its most desperate but there is a ray of hope the light im listening rappaport said the communication we received from rhodes included a summary of his research data he believes his mistake was in the ratio of the adjuvant he used to the amount of serum hes convinced a fifty percent greater amount of this protein is required in order to be effective against the virusthe ratio is something his program sent out that he misinterpreted his only mistake hes calling it cant rhodes just give himself another treatment with that added boost rappaport asked too late allaire said the massive dose of virus he shot into himself is overwhelming the treatment the virus is already mutatingcausing new symptoms hes bleeding from his nose just like many of the people here he admits it was overconfidence to inject such a large amount but rhodes is certain that a fifty percent increase will work for most if not all of us so whats the next step mr president the serum is the key allaire said but it is also unique we cant get another batch how can i help the fbi and the cdc are setting up a lab to prepare a new batch of treatment according to the specifications given to us by rhodes where one of our safe houses here in washington gary will give the address to you we need you and the secret service people guarding you to bring the serum to that lab genesis has been a step ahead of us at every turn so secrecy has got to be your highest priority i understand consider it done mr president paul this is it for us this is the only chance we have i dont trust anybody but you to handle things were sending three choppers in to get you the pilots will know what to do from there i wont let you down jim how do i get the serum out of the lab rhodes decontaminated the cooler containing the serum and is leaving it for you outside the door into the lab you can retrieve it without having to put on a biocontainment suit what about rhodes again there was a long pause rhodes is already quite ill allaire said finally according to his estimates hell be dead in a matter of a few hours chapter day midnight est angie checked her watch and paced about the dimly lit living room like a caged lioness she drew in several calming breaths but could do little to slow her excitement she passed the time by mentally drafting her story featuring griff as the hero and paul rappaport as the mastermind behind genesis the prize at stake the presidency of the most powerful nation on earth the brownstone she was told was one of several safe houses in the metro dc area used by the fbi the atf and the cia the understatedly elegant building situated on a quiet street in the adams morgan neighborhood had been used in the past to bait and trap spies extortionists arms dealers child molesters and con artists every room was bugged and there were hightech hidden cameras throughout a few blocks away a surveillance van would be serving as backup angie would be safe they assured her but she had her doubts especially when she was given a pistola glock they said and a brief course in its use the gun a perfect fit for her was somewhat reassuring she had seen what genesis was capable of and believed that no place was truly safe from them for the thousandth time she wondered about griff no one had told her anything this was his plan but he wasnt there he had requested that allaire call him as soon as he had read the fax what exactly had he told the president in that conversation was the story of the serum needing modification one that he had conjured up or was it the truth at the moment it seemed to be at least a half truth in which case griff might already be dead rappaport believed he was transporting the serum that when modified in the laboratory upstairs was the last hope for the president and all those trapped inside the capitol if he was genesis he would either appear with a story of having been forced at gunpoint to give up the serum or he would fail to show up altogether either way according to the constitution he would be next in line for the presidency another possibility was that he had already made a switch and that what he was delivering was a wellconcocted sham short in one crucial ingredient but a good enough replica to mislead the biochemists upstairs after all nobody but griff knew what he and his computer model had put together the furnishings in the richly appointed rooms were well suited for an upscale stingarmchairs upholstered with plush fabrics a bedazzling chandelier made of brass and crystal and fine oriental rugs that framed a deep fieldstone fireplace this was a home that could have belonged to any highranking diplomat or wellconnected politician angie fingered the compact pistol in the pocket of her skirt she had little experience with guns but she also had a fierce love of life and suspected that she would use this one if hers depended upon it a panel of one wall opened up silently and the three fbi agents whom she had been with since being brought to the house returned to the room theyre here one of them said through the tall bay windows angie watched a black lincoln town car pull to an abrupt stop at the curb outside three secret service agents quickly exited the vehicle one of them opened the town cars rear door and paul rappaport stepped onto the curb the homeland security secretary wearing a stylish overcoat held one handle of a large blue cooler a muscular agent had taken hold of the other angie took a few photos with her new digital slr camera as the two men made their way up the cement outside stairway the other two agents took up positions near the town car angie waited behind the brown leather sofa which faced the rooms only door the door opened without a knock and the secret service agent stepped inside his gun drawn after a check of the room he holstered his weapon and signaled for rappaport to enter the secretary spotted angie immediately whatre you doing here he asked where are the chemists the lab rappaport pulled the cooler tight to his body and took a cautious step backward angie snapped a series of pictures upstairs she said waiting for you what are you doing here rappaport went on i was told you were in a new york city hospital i got better angie said and now im writing this story hopefully it will have a happy ending hopefully rappaport said his eyes narrowed with suspicion pardon the camera but people like pictures angie peered through the cameras viewfinder and let out a terrified gasp two powerfully built men dressed in black wearing black ski masks carrying pistols had appeared behind rappaport hightech gas masks dangled from their belts look out behind you angie cried out but her warning came too late one of the men grabbed rappaport across the throat and before he could move had the muzzle of a heavy pistol pressed up against his temple the agents in the room were a beat too slow to react another intruder moved in quickly and snatched away the cooler from rappaports trembling hand just as three more masked men burst into the room each carrying a submachine gun drop your weapons the man holding rappaport demanded and no one dies two of the agents had their guns out but the numbers were bad angie had her hand in her skirt pocket wrapped around the glock it seemed unlikely she could pull it out fire it and hit anyone before she was blown to bits we have what we want one of the intruders snapped his accent heavily hispanic do as we say or youll all die weapons over there on the floor lock your fingers behind your heads now angie hesitated a burst of machine gun fire erupted from close range the bullets screaming past her head and slamming into the wall for a moment she was certain her heart had stopped she ducked hands covering her head and screamed as she dropped to the floor the other security people and rappaport were already down their weapons thrown aside when she looked back all five intruders had gas masks on they were unimaginably quick and well organized a canister was dropped on the rug in the center of the room angie and the others began to cough as the foulsmelling vapor stung their lungs her eyes were watering profusely and her throat seemed as if it had closed off gloved hands grabbed her from behind before she could scream again a patch of duct tape was pulled across her mouth and her hands were secured behind her the whole operation had taken less than a minute then the room went completely black angie came to almost as rapidly as she had gone out she felt the acidy burn of bile as it worked its way up her throat and shuddered with a new fear that the tape covering her mouth would cause her to choke to death on vomit she rolled to one side breathed slowly and deeply through her nose and focused her thoughts on an image of griff that she had conjured up during their phone conversation from her hospital room she pictured him down in the kalvesta lab bravely and confidently injecting himself with a virus as deadly as any he had hunted down in africa from his courage angie found strength of her own to remain calm all around her agents were gagging and coughing moments later there was a commotion from the doorway her hands were untied and the numbness in them began to abate the room was crowded now with police soldiers and fbi agents so numerous that they struggled to move about freely i cant believe we blew this one of the agents who had been with angie said they moved like frigging delta force how in the hell did they get in so easily the two guards outside are dead both shot in the head probably with silencers we didnt hear a thing until a volley of machine gun fire from up here by the time we left the surveillance truck and made it over they were gone rappaport angie coughed out the words when an fbi agent pulled off the tape covering her mouth where is paul rappaport hes right here the agent said he was tied up like the rest of you the cooler the serum angie struggled to get the words out she was hyperventilating and her eyes still stung from the smoke the cooler she managed again the fbi agent just shook his head whatever was in that cooler he said while helping angie to her feet went out the door with the guys who took it chapter day am est destiny ursula ellis knew she was on the brink of history she stood at the rostrum of the house chamber and gazed out at three hundred frightened and bewildered faces but she was their leader nowtheir shepherd she had lost the battle of the election but now thanks to her destiny and to genesis she was going to win the war she took a deep breath inhaling the feelings of the moment and the events just ahead the committee on rules facing what she had called our lives or this bill had granted privileged status to her legislation she motioned leland gladstone to her side he was carrying the communication device genesis had given her have they responded to us yet she asked nothing gladstone said do they know the vote is now i told them theyll come through im sure of it maybe we should hold off until theyve delivered the treatment weve come way too far the speaker whispered sensing a nugget of concern form in her gut just keep trying to reach them it had been two days since gladstone distributed copies of the bill to each voting member of congress capable of casting a ballot over the time since then ellis had heard disgust from every corner of the chamber one congressman tore the twentypage piece of legislation in half another had tried to set it on fire before the capitol police intervened but from what she could see before her now not a single congressman looked interested in protesting the billnot after she had showed them the videorecording she had made inside the senate chamber not when everyone understood james allaires perfidy and the nightmare that lay ahead for them not when they knew that without herwithout this billthey were going to die and die horribly a heavy silence followed her reshowing the grisly senate chamber video but clamor erupted seconds later the noise level rose hands were raised highpoliticians begging ellis for a chance to be heard they want to vote for my bill they want to live ellis let the commotion continue unhindered for several minutes thanks to lamar the eyes of the world were upon her the television cameras that allaire had ordered shut down were broadcasting once again the american people were strong ellis put more faith in them than allaire ever did they needed to witness history as it unfolded rumor had reached her that the president was failing rapidly by the time the bill was passed and genesis delivered the antiviral treatment it would likely be too late for him ellis adjusted the microphone and turned up the speaker volume then she snapped her gavel down on the rostrum three times and the room fell silent i would like to begin this house vote on my special legislative measure by addressing the citizens of the united states of america and those around the world watching tonights broadcast i have requested that these proceedings be shown worldwide because the government of the united states of america is about the people and for the people and we will not abandon the most sacred and essential tenet upon which our country was founded even if the truths we reveal this day are as horrible as the tragedy we now face ellis paused and reminded herself to stick to the way she had rehearsed the speech she and gladstone had written this will be the unfinished state of the union address she had told her aide only this time it will be me who will be delivering it destiny to my friends and colleagues in congress she went on i realize the bill before you has come as a shock many if not all of you know that some of the points enumerated in it deviate from my welldocumented views but i have been offered an awesome opportunitythe opportunity to save the lives of many of the most important leaders in our nation genesis the vile and traitorous organization responsible for the acts of terrorism that have plagued our country have released a deadly virus upon us claiming that their position must be heard it is not a trade i condone but it is one i reluctantly endorse genesis has offered us a treatment that will deliver us from the horror befalling the unfortunates you have just witnessed again inside the senate chamber the price is highyour passage of this legislation but i for one choose life comment erupted throughout the chamber ellis silently polled the supreme court justices seated before her searching their eyes for judgment that she saw no disparagement bolstered her resolve it helped her that one of their court was prominently featured in the video from the senate chamber i have brokered an agreement with terrorists ellis said that is true but we are a democracy and at that instant the doors leading across the capitol to the senate wing burst open and president james allaire strode in chapter day am est wideeyed ellis fixed on the president as he ascended to the rostrum and moved forward until he was only a few feet from her youre finished madam speaker he said loudly enough to be easily heard through the pa system you have done as much damage and created as much chaos as the terrorists and it ends now the president signaled to sean oneil who was still beside the door that allaire had come through one by one a small procession of sick and hobbled men and women began shuffling into the house chamber their complexions were ashen many of them were smeared with blood some of them were clearly disoriented bewildered and agitated they coughed as they marched some had to stop to breathe those who were too weak to walk unaided were assisted into the chamber by secret service agents and the capitol police at virtually the same moment a second larger procession entered the chamber from statuary hall this group headed by a muscular africanamerican man with a military bearing wearing only surgical scrubs was in less frightening shape than the other but they were still obviously failing the final two people to enter the chamber came from the senate they walked shoulder to shoulder although one of them moved with great difficulty and needed to be supported by the other vice president henry tilden the weaker by far of the two was a phantombattered stoopshouldered and gaunt his face was badly clawed and smeared with dried and drying blood supporting tilden was a tall man in a blue biocontainment suit glare off the faceplate of his helmet made it impossible for ellis to identify him he held a blue plastic cooler in his gloved left hand what is the meaning of this ellis shouted into the microphone those are the sickest of all of us you are bringing death into this room people around the world are witnesses allaires expression was one of disgust no ursula what they are witnesses to is your madness vice president tilden and others are prepared to swear that it was you who locked him in the senate chamber to die or be killed the crowd erupted into a chorus of angry and confused shouts allaire banged elliss gavel to settle them down he then continued still extremely shaky but managing to address the assembly with the mannerisms of a president these people have been brought out from the senate chamber and those from statuary hall because we now have the means to treat themand all the rest of us as well lies ellis screamed hes telling all of us lies the madness is in this man he is badly infected with the virus and is about to be relieved of his duties as president ask dr townsend his physician she knows that the virus has attacked his mind yes the virus is affecting me more each hour allaire said and yes i chose to refrain from broadcasting its terrible effects but i did so to keep all of you from panicking while we worked around the clock to find a cure i did not mislead you because i wanted to deceive but because i felt in my heart that i had a duty to protect you dont believe this insanity ellis bellowed the bill must be passed if you want to live the cure is with genesis and only i have access to it allaire glanced over at his wife and daughter genesis whoever they are doesnt have any cure ursula allaire said patiently they never did they are thieves and terrorists they dont have the technology or capability to deliver treatment for a virus this complex my administration created this nightmare in the misguided hope that we could do away with all forms of torture we developed the wrx virus and we are the only ones capable of stopping it youre lying youre lying ellis kept repeating but there was no longer any force behind her words genesis needed to buy time ursula time for us all to die so they played you they used your pathetic lust for power to turn you into their puppet we have the cure thats why i have brought all these brave people back into the chamberto prove to you that soon the infection will be a thing of your past soon we can begin to repair our lives and we have one person to thank for that allaire gestured to the man in the biosuit who made his way slowly up to the rostrum then the man released the clasps and velcro holding on his helmet and eased it off exposing himself to the contaminated air they were all breathing the man had a worn grizzled face but his eyes were bright it took a few seconds for ellis to place him but when she did it was as if an icy hand had gripped her heart the man was griffin rhodes chapter day am est one by one at intervals of five minutes three rented sedans pulled in through the rear garage doors of the ss trading co five men all in black exited the garage through an inner door and entered the large storehouse on the street side waiting anxiously around a makeshift biochemistry lab complete with immunoelectrophoresis mass spectrometry and a chemist were roger corum colin whitehead and marguerite prideaux the leader of the mercenaries withdrew five large glass jars from the cooler each one carefully labeled and containing a slightly opaque strawcolored liquid the group of them then joined two other men dressed in black one of whom was operating an impressive pair of videoconferencing screens on the screens waiting at their desks in opulent offices were song xi in beijing china and ibn albasarth in riyadh saudi arabia the four men and prideaux each worth tens of millions formed the secret international cartel which called itself genesis the group had been corums brainchild as was taking the names from the old testament their organization had one goal and one goal only profit after this operation was complete and paul rappaport was sworn in as president there would be no need for genesis to continue to exist the american people and their new leader would take care of the rest so any trouble corum asked the head of the squad two casualties on their side is all the man replied matteroffactly unavoidable no problem is rappaport okay fine he was just as clueless and frightened as the rest of them so song xi asked in nearperfect english secretary rappaport still has no idea that genesis is all about getting him and his policies put into the white house not only him and his policies prideaux replied but thanks to the work of genesis an american public ready to cooperate with them and expand the countrys security system to the tune of billions of dollars tens of billions whitehead corrected punctuating the words with a cough and of course albasarth said who better to provide the new identification system and surveillance cameras and antialien barriers and electronic monitoring than our companiesalready leaders in our fields ill bet my own government wont be far behind xi said i think the world is ready for a little isolationism paranoia equals profit who first said that i did corum prideaux and whitehead answered in unison and all of them laughed how are we doing corum asked the chemist a man named falicki falicki had worked for him before in fact it was he who first put corum in touch with the late matt fink there would be no need to silence falicki or any of the men their salaries would see to that almost there the computer printer chimed and soon began to spit out results from the mass spectrometer analysis taken from the serum that paul rappaport had brought with him to washington from kalvesta his brow furrowed as falicki studied the readout well it appears this is the authentic antiviral treatment the chemist announced the serum contains the properties we expected to find as well as the adjuvant we knew the virologist had included i would like to be certain that what is contained here is the precise drug that your dr rhodes injected himself with but this is as close as we are going to get insofar as i can determine i believe this is the real deal roger congratulations corum flinched when he heard a loud pop behind him he turned to see a now beaming prideaux holding an open magnum of champagne with foam gushing out its mouth zees eez cause for celebration non she said purposely adding a dense french accent when in truth she had very little whitehead applauded and everyone in the warehouse joined in there would be no lastsecond miracle cure for james allaire and his administration the doomsday survivor had been aptly chosen the decision to get rappaport himself to request the undesirable position by putting stress on his mentally ill daughter had been brilliant corum reflected absolutely brilliant xi ibn corum said to the men watching the events via video if you have any celebratory drinks nearby i suggest now is the time to pour them along with mr whitehead and mlle prideaux we are soon to appear on lists of the wealthiest menand womenin our countries prideaux handed over the magnum to the head of the mercenary force and passed out flutes she had purchased in the package store then she raised her glass toward the two grinning men half a world away the group assembled in the old warehouse did the same and song and albasarth responded in kind to the trade show in las vegas and the evening when the visionary roger corum first brought us all together prideaux said while hoisting her glass to the trade show everyone sang out speech roger whitehead demanded corum stepped forward glass raised once more i think we owe speaker of the house ellis a few moments of grateful silence for being such a perfect foil and for obviously not being aware of the folk tale of brer rabbit and brer fox what is this folk tale song asked well brer fox was about to eat brer rabbit when the rabbit started crying and carrying on that the fox could do anything he wanted to up to and including having the rabbit for dinner but please the shrewd rabbit begged just dont throw me in that there briar patch well brer rabbit had caused brer fox so much grief over the years that fox decided he could always catch another meal but he could not always cause his nemesis such terrible and feared discomfort but of course albarsarth said the patch was precisely where this brer rabbit wanted to go in fact corum said he had a lovely vacation home there by presenting the foolish offthecharts leftwing bill i crafted speaker ellis was in essence throwing us in the briar patch if genesis was for it when rappaport took office all the world would be against it to brer rabbit song said raising his glass brer rabbit all the others echoed now corum said after the laughter had died down it is time we disposed of the contents of these jars with the help of prideaux he brought the serum to an industrialsized double sink against one of the walls five jars the frenchwoman said one for each of us xi ill do the honors for you and roger will represent ibn so saying she removed a label across the top that read sterilized then she unceremoniously dumped the contents down the drain after a second pouring corum moved to the sink ibn this is yours he said as the last of the golden liquid spilled from the bottle something metallic dropped out of the bottom and fell with a soft clink into the steel sink corum reached down and picked up a dollarsized goldcolored disc an eighth of an inch thick oh holy shit its a homing device one of ours corums words were cut short by a series of loud explosions at the front of the warehouse pulverized concrete debris and large deadly fragments of metal siding instantly penetrated the room as the front wall and part of the ceiling burst apart the prolonged blast of powerful sonic waves that followed the explosions shattered all the glass in the room and knocked everybody within it to the floor a rolling wall of dust engulfed them some were coughing some were dead others were writhing in pain from gashes and broken bones then the soldiers stormed in lights and lasers mounted atop assault weapons penetrated the dense cloud of dust and debris dozens of soldiers followed the winter wind into the warehouse some pushing mobile spotlights hands behind your head general frank egan cried out brandishing his pistol get down arms behind you or well shoot you dead i swear we will get down one mercenary whirled and got off an errant shot the hailstorm of automatic weapon fire that slammed into his body sent him dancing off the floor like a marionette after that resistance vanished wrists and ankles were secured and weapons were collected as the soldiers stepped back angie entered the warehouse and joined egan at the center of the room monitoring the conversations from the surveillance van she had sorted out that corum was the leader of genesis and that paul rappaport was an unwitting dupe chosen because of his wellknown reactionary politics the army information specialists provided her with brief printed dossiers on corum his company and every person whose name was mentioned during the celebration they even managed file photos of him and colin whitehead amazing dazed corum tried to get up he had been gashed in his back and one arm and it looked as if the other arm was broken stay down corum angie barked stay the hell down or ill shoot you you have no idea how much i want to and i promise i will my name is angela fletcher i work for the washington post and guess what youre gonna be in the papers one of the dead men lying near corum angie recognized as colin whitehead the dust had largely settled or been blown away by the wind she nudged the soldier watching corum turn him over please she said the solider used the steel toe of his boot to lift against a spot between corums ribs the ceo let out a pained groan and rolled onto his back angie snapped a photo of him and then several of the room this is my payment for services rendered she said to corum i get to write all about you and your greedy cronies and griffin rhodes is getting the satisfaction of knowing that the antiviral serum the president ordered rappaport to bring east was a fake that griff put together in his lab and topped off with the homing device you made for him to wear it wasnt easy in fact it took him almost as much time to concoct that fake serum as it did to make the real deal fuck you the ceo rasped you killed my friends you killed dozens and dozens of good innocent people you terrorized the country who in the hell did you think you were what gave you the right corums smile was nasty showing bloodstained teeth im just a man he said coughing up a glob of blood a man with a dream a dream of causing death even if i dont benefit directly now corum said my industry will my heirs my employees its commerce commerce at its purest paul rappaport is not going to be the president angie said hell be pleased that we have a recording of you talking about how you were using himsetting him up because of his conservative philosophy setting him and the american people up essentially to work for you and your gang of thugs corum tried to speak but coughed more blood it doesnt matter now he finally managed piles of money will go into the security industry regardless thats something of a legacy for me but it wont go to you or to any of your companies ill see to that does that give you any satisfaction ms fletcher you know what you pathetic creep angie said it kind of does chapter day am est griff stood at the rostrum looking out over the nearly seven hundred survivors all of them infected to one degree or another with the wrx virus the moment in the lab when he saw the concentric red circles on his palm was among the most frightening soulcrushing he had ever experienced not only because his research had failed and people were going to die but because he had seen angie for the last time for nearly an hour he had sat there in his office motionless staring at the wall and planning what he might do to end his life as soon as symptoms of the virus began to become manifest then suddenly the miracle began to unfold over another hour the dreadful markings began to vanish until finally after nearly three hours they were gone altogether by then he had already contacted the president by fax through angie and had asked him to begin laying the trap that was going to confirm or disprove paul rappaports involvement with genesis the mood inside the house chamber was an odd mix of bewilderment and buoyancy some in the vast room were hugging some were crying and some were merely standing motionless staring up at the strange tableaux ellis stood frozen on the stage her eyes looking furiously at griff several of the capitol police force had moved in close to her awaiting orders from their chief or from the president griff had helped the weakened vice president into the speakers chair then he opened the cooler and extracted a large jar of opaque serum and held it aloft for all to see but before he could speak a mans voice hollered out from somewhere near the middle of the crowd get in line there might not be enough suddenly driven by primal survival instincts and in all likelihood by the effects of the virus as well the crowd began to surge forward wait griff cried into the microphone everybody stop theres enough theres enough for each of you but his words had no effect people some violently shoving others already on the floor crawling had reached the stairs to the rostrum the police moved in and the secret service began to form ranks about the president and vice president but before any of the people reached griff three earsplitting bangs stopped the milling crowd and silenced the hall leland gladstone was standing behind him the stillsmoking barrel of the gun he had fired into the air he now held against griffs temple elliss aide quickly ripped the cooler from griffs hand and handed it to her the capitol police surrounding the speaker moved away this is yours madam speaker gladstone said youve worked too hard for it we cant stop now we mustnt stop now ellis took the cooler from her aide and pulled out one of the sterilized jars the chamber remained silent all eyes fixed on the precious serum ellis faced the assembly while gladstone wildeyed continued to shift the gun toward anyone who moved you have all been fooled ellis cried out and you continue to be fooled what is this she shook the bottle for emphasis youre going to let this charlatan inject you with this when i have promised you the real treatment you are going to trust this this hermit and not me havent i shown you the truth the truth about senator mackay the truth about the senate chamber havent i done my part to expose the lies of this president and yet you still rush for this concoction either the content of this jar is useless or it will quicken our deaths but i can assure you of one thingthis is not a cure only genesis has the cure only genesis and the bill ive presented can save your lives not this bottle of lies allaire who had been ushered off the stage by the secret service pushed himself through the cluster of bodies surrounding him you need to stop this ursula he said in a calm voice what you have there cannot be replicated surely you want to save the lives of all these good people you need to give the serum back and allow us to administer it you must i must save these people from you ellis cried out gary salitas who had been on his cell phone leaned over and whispered to the president allaire turned to the crowd i have just been informed that the gang of terrorists calling itself genesis has been captured several of them are dead the rest are on their way to jail he shifted his attention back to ellis they admitted that they were using you ursula they have no serum some cheered others continued to stare at the speaker allaires announcement was the final straw for her lies she shrieked all lies she raised the bottle above her head and hurled it into the crowd where it shattered on the carpet a second jar disintegrated against the head of a tall balding man sending a gruesome mix of blood and serum cascading over him before anyone could move she had thrown a third jar this one smashing on the metal frame of a bed there was a gunshot loud and echoing elliss head snapped back as the bullet tore through her exploding out the back of her skull blood brains and bone splattered over the rostrum as she crumpled to the floor by the seat that had been hers for so long gladstone his eyes widening still with the gun in his hand took a shot in the center of his face the bullet following a path almost identical to the one that had killed ellis he instantly fell lifeless across her body his blood mixing with hers a short distance away sean oneil held his smoking pistol preparing for the followup shot that would not be necessary allaire rushed to griff his expression panicked you said the serum couldnt be replicated he said you said this was a onetime deal can you possibly stretch out whats left can you make it be enough for all of us griff raised his hands to quiet the crowd then as the cries and commotion settled down he turned to the president and grinned president allaire griff said into the microphone the antiviral treatment that i developed cannot be replicated that is true no dont let us die somebody shouted others echoed the fear and again the frightened emotional crowd began to unravel please griff called out to them youve all been through enough please listen an uneasy silence returned the serum cannot be replicated he continued so i could not trust myself to be the one to bring it here genesis had too many eyes and ears for me to believe they could not get to me which is why the mixture i carried into the chamber was a ruse not the antiviral treatment i developed he nodded toward the door to the senate wing and a solidly built man in a biocontainment suit stepped forward let me introduce to all of you sergeant chad stafford of the united states armythe one person i knew we could all trust with our lives the serum in his backpack is enough for every one of you applause and cheers started in the back of the crowd and rolled toward the soldier like thunder in addition to his backpack he held an assault weapon at the ready people moved aside to allow him to pass as the cheering grew even more intense all business as usual stafford climbed the rostrum stairs and stood next to griff who turned to the man and shook his hand glad you found the place okay he said epilogue the inn at coco island american samoa was unlike any vacation destination in the world built on stilts ten feet above the vagaries of the south pacific winds and tides on the eastern end of the island the inn was the only structure on the twosquaremile atoll save for the home of innkeeper jarvis hmalea located on the far west end the inn had only one suitesix rooms it was owned by a consortium of vegas casino heads and serviced by hmalea and his family rental was a week with a minimum stay of two weeks the closely guarded guest list at the inn at coco island read like a whos who in entertainment business and sports and the ability to pay the tariff and sea plane fare did not guarantee an applicant a vacation there the fine white sand was legend and the palms were reputed to produce the largest sweetest coconuts to be found anywhere in the ten years hmalea had been the steward at the inn he had successfully honored demandsdietary and otherwisefrom some of the most eccentric uncompromising men and women in the world but the request from the two guests flying in now was uniquea kingsized mattress placed in a grove of palms on a small bluff facing east toward the sunrise the new e s kluft beyond luxury sublime mattress had been flown to pago pago from the kluft factory in california brought over to the inn by boat and paid for hmaleas vegas contact had told him by some sort of special act of the united states congress at first hmalea was sure the man was pulling his leg but that was before the mattress with a pricetag in the midforties was offloaded the seaplane materialized as a dot in the perfect late morning sky hmalea thumbs in the beltloops of his khakis strode along the pier past indescribably blue water with visibility of over two hundred feet his two guests had requested nothing more than peace and quiet and of course the mattress but they would have access to scuba equipment kayaks small sailboats a hot tub and a luxuriously stocked wine cellar and kitchen with or without hmaleas skill as a chef the drone of the engine could be heard now as the pilot banked smoothly into the light southerly breeze hmalea knew of the events at the us capitol and that the passengers had been central in keeping the death toll down and in saving the lives of the president and vice president as well as close to seven hundred others but he knew few of the details nor would he bother angela fletcher or dr griffin rhodes to fill him in on board the seaplane angie looked down from her seat by the pilot i told you i didnt like large groups of people dr rhodes she said into her mouthpiece what is that mob doing down there on the pier ill speak to him about crowd control griff said three weeks had passed since the last of the victims of wrx had been treated and after a day sent through decontamination out of the capitol and back to their lives although he would have preferred his role remain anonymous griff knew that would never be the case angie had spent most of the time at her keyboard writing a series of articles for the post and a proposal for what her new literary agent said would be the book of the century before angie began her writing though and before griff accepted his newly acquired celebrity and before he submitted to extensive debriefing from the president and his advisors including homeland security secretary paul rappaport the two of them bundled into her silver miata and drove to a small farm near beckley west virginia melvin were never much for keeping in touch kyle forbush told them over a lovingly prepared dinner of pork beans boiled greens and homemade bread but he called from time to time and came home every other christmas or so we knew from early on that he were more i dont know unusual than the other boys his age if he had stayed and worked in the coal mine like we expected him to chances are he would have been beaten to a pulp in the first month he did his last year in high school living with my sister in morgantown and then put hisself through bug schoolthats what i called itworking in a video store he were a real nice boy and a good son were sad to hear of his passing forbush and his wife knew surprisingly little of the events at the capitol but they were pleased and impressed that president allaire and the senators from west virginia had declared an upcoming wednesday melvin forbush day and would all be traveling to beckley to celebrate the pilot swooped in with practiced ease and tied up at the pier thirty minutes later griff and angie were alone on their mattress wearing nothing but sunscreen considering that i made this place up he said its hard to believe it really exists im proud that you allowed congress to do something for you in addition to the medal and the citation im also pleased that because our trip is privately donateda little from each of them and from the cabineti dont have to write an exposé about it im also glad the president paid for the mattress himself its a little out of character for me to say he owes me griff said stroking a wisp of her hair from her forehead but he does in a contrite impassioned speech to the world allaire had come completely clean about the wrx virus and his role in developing it he admitted to making choices under pressure that he might otherwise not have made including the unjust imprisonment of the man who had subsequently saved his life and that of his family and so many others he also promised his quick resignation should public opinion demand it in an affirmation of honesty from politicians his next approval poll was the highest of any during his presidency griff and angie made love that afternoon and again that night beneath an unending sea of stars days passed during which they slept and healed and swam and ate and read and drank coconut milk over that time they spoke almost nothing of kalvesta nor the capitol on the fifth or sixth day they were surprised by the appearance of a thin white and tan dogthirty pounds or so and an indefinable mix of breeds he ambled between the palms and settled down for an hour just off the foot of the kluft beyond luxury sublime mattress he allowed himself to be patted and nuzzled them without being intrusive then in no particular hurry he left the way he had come the next day he returned and departed in the same way and the next on the tenth day after breakfast and well before their visitor made his appearance angie moaned happily and nestled herself tightly against griffs chest i havent asked you because you never brought it up she said but have you given any more thought to allaires offer to have you take over as the director of the cdc its in atlanta he replied i know that you big goof i would move there if you took the job he kissed her on the mouth and i would move to washington for you in fact thats what im going to do if you want me to it would only be for four years but that will be enough time for you to finish your book and for us to decide if its appropriate for us to lend our gene pools to the world this time she kissed himlong and deeply now that would be something to write about she said beaming but what do you mean four years griffs tanned face crinkled in the grin that angie loved the most ive been saving something for you he said and this seems as good a time as any to spring it on you i made a deal with allaire a deal at the moment hes coping with a presidentialsized load of guilt so i decided to take advantage of it if you say yes youre looking at the newest member of the presidents cabinetthe first secretary of the department of animal welfare angie threw her arms around him oh baby thats incredible absolutely wonderful news do you know what the job will entail i was sort of hoping youd help me fill in the blanks on the trip home my brains already exploding you can deal with cruelty and exotic pets and zoo standards and the feeding and housing of premarket hoofed livestock and chickens and a tax credit for neutering and spaying and of course experimentation and hey not until the ride home she held his face close to her own okay she said ill think of something we can do in the meanwhile one thing though yes have you considered that creation of this post will put you squarely at number eighteen on the ladder of presidential succession that evening jarvis hmalea made his scheduled everythirdday visit to the inn he seemed especially pleased that there was nothing either of his guests needed that he hadnt already provided for them tell me something griff asked after the steward had shared some grilled sea bass and a delicious bottle of chardonnay with them on the verandah your dog has been a welcome visitor at this end of the island almost every day whats his name i have no idea hmalea replied and hes not my dog in fact if he stays on coco island much longer hes going to be the death of me explain angie said where could he possibly have come from a few days before you showed up he showed up strolled into our house just like he always lived there no boats are allowed inside the reef and of course no one other than guests are permitted on the island but i cant prevent boats from anchoring outside the reef almost certainly the dog came from one of them i sent several radio messages and my wife has been listening for one ever since but theres been nothing not a word and for the last four days theres been no one anchoring so why is he going to be the death of you jarvis angie asked i cant breathe when im within five feet of him some sort of allergy i guess i cant stop wheezing and coughing say i dont mean to sound forward but as you can tell im desperate i dont suppose you two would like to take him along with you when you leave griff and angle took only seconds to conduct a silent poll as a matter of fact griff said
