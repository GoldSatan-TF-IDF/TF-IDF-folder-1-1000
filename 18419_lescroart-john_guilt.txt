believer finally id like to thank my agent barney karpfinger for helping to make the dream a reality we do not see things as they are we see things as we are talmud part one chapter one mark dooher couldnt take his eyes off the young woman who had just entered the dining room at fior d italia and was being seated facing them at a table ten feet away his companion for lunch was like dooher an attorney his name was wes farrell and he generally practiced in a different strata lower than dooher did the two men had been best friends since they were kids farrell glanced up from his calamari his baleful eyes glinting with humor trying to be subtle as he took in the goddess across the room too young he said my foot wes all parts of you not just your foot besides which farrell went on youre married i am married farrell nodded keep repeating it its good for you i on the other hand am getting divorced i can never get divorced sheila would never divorce me you could divorce her if you wanted to impossible then amending not that id ever want to of course but impossible why dooher went back to his pasta for a moment because my son even in our jaded age when ninety percent of your income derives from your work as counsel to the archdiocese of san francisco when you are in fact a prominent player in the roman catholic community as i am a divorce would play some havoc with your business across the board not just the church itself but all the ancillary farrell broke off a bitesized piece of italian bread and dipped it into the little dish of extravirgin olive oil that rested between them i doubt it people get divorced all the time your best friend for example is getting divorced right now have i mentioned that lydia s divorcing you wes youre not divorcing her its different god he said look at her farrell glanced up again she looks good good dooher feasted for another moment on the vision that woman is so far beyond good that the light from good is going to take a year to get to her at which time youll be a year older and forever out of her reach pass the butter butter will kill you you know farrell nodded either that or something else this calamari milleottocentoottantasei for example or pronouncing it a handsome young man in a business suit every male customer in the restaurant wore a business suit was approaching the womans table he pulled a chair out across from her smiling saying something she was looking up at him her expression cool reserved farrell noted it and something else dont look now he said but isnt the guy sitting down with her doesnt he work for you wes farrell was on his schlumpy way up toward columbus and the north beach walkup out of which he ran his law business dooher lingered in the doorway at fior ditalia then turned and went back inside to the bar where he ordered a pellegrino he sipped the bottled water and considered his reflection in the bars mirror he still looked good he had his hair the light brown streaked with blond camouflaging the hint of gray that was only just beginning to appear around the temples the skin of his face was as unlined as it had been at thirty now at fortysix he knew he looked ten years younger which was enough any more youth would be bad for business his body carried pounds on a sixfoot frame today he wore a tailored italian doublebreasted suit in a refined shade of green that picked up the flecks in his eyes from where he sat at the bar he could watch her in profile she had loosened up somewhat but wes had been right there was a tension in the way she sat in her body language the man with her was joe avery again wes had nailed it a sixthyear associate at mccabe roth the firm dooher managed mccabe and roth both had been forced to retire during the downsizing of the past two years now in spite of the name it was doohers firm beginning to show profit again he drank his italian water looked at himself in the mirror over the bar what was he doing here he couldnt allow himself to leave this was something he thought hed outgrown long ago such an overwhelming physical attraction oh sure when hed been younger in college a couple of times even the first few years of his marriage the occasional dalliance stepping out somebody coming on to him usually on a business trip or one of the firm retreats but that had stopped after the one crisis sheila getting wind of what was going on with one of them she wasnt going to have it infidelity wasnt going to be part of their lives dooher had better decide whether he wanted to sleep around or keep the kids a hundred times since he wished hed have let sheila go taking the kids with her but in truth back then fifteen years ago he was already unable to risk a divorce already working with some of the charities the archdiocese itself there was big money there clean work and sheila would have scotched it if things had gotten ugly he knew she would have as she would today so hed simply put his hormones out of his mind put all of his effort into real life work the wife the kids the house he would be satisfied with the tenfifteentwenty days of vacation the new car everyone else seemed to survive in that secure betweenthelines adult existence it wasnt so bad except mark dooher hated it he never got over hating it he had never had to play by the same rules as everyone else he was simply better at everything smarter more charismatic he deserved more he deserved better that couldnt be all there was do your job live the routine get old die that couldnt be it not for him he couldnt get the woman off his mind well he would just have to do it that was all hed call up his fabled discipline and simply will her out of his consciousness there was nothing to be done with her anyway dooher didnt trust the dynamic of lust that hormonal rush and then the long regret no he wasnt about to get involved with all that it was better just to stop thinking about her or at least not get confused keep it in the realm of fantasy it wasnt as if he knew anything about her as if there could be real attraction in fact if that turned out to be the case it would be far more complicated then what leave sheila no it was better not to pursue it at all he was just in one of his funks believing that the opportunity that would give his life new meaning was passing him by he knew better in reality everything disappointed nothing turned out as you hoped hed just suck it up and put her out of his mind do nothing about the fantasy he didnt even want to take one step because who knew where that could lead hed forget all about her he wasnt going to do anything it was stupid to consider joe avery looked up from the clutter of paper littering his desk a legal brief which was already anything but brief sir dooher the friendliest boss on the planet was in the doorway one hand extended up to the sill the other on his belt coat open sincere smile a mardi gras party feast before fast unless youve got other plans well i youll enjoy it sheila and i do it every year just casual no costumes masks taking to the streets afterwards none of that and pretty good food if you like cajun anyway eight oclock if youre free avery was young and gungho and hadnt spoken to dooher more than a hundred times in his six years with the firm had never spent any time with him socially his mouth hung open in surprise at the invitation but he was nodding already planning to be there wondering what was happening dooher was going on if youve got other plans dont worry about it but youve paid your dues around here youre up for shareholder this year if im not mistaken avery nodded next actually dooher waved that off well well see but come on up bring your girlfriend you got one or not your call just let us know then dooher was gone chapter two a long week later party day and it was going to rain dooher had noticed the clouds piling up on themselves out over the ocean as he drove to his home in st francis wood he considered his neighborhood the best of all worlds it was both the city and a suburb but without the blight of either he had civilized neighbors an elegant gracious canopy of old boughs shaded the streets by day enclosing them with what felt like a protective security by night stands of eucalyptus perfumed the air in the fall magnolias in the summer the street was quiet with large houses widely spaced most cars were in their garages although in the few houses with small children vans squatted in driveways the afternoon sun gave a last glorious golden shout through the clouds and it stopped him for a moment as he turned into the drive in front of his home like the other facades on the block his old california spanish hacienda was impressive with its tiled front courtyard behind a low stucco fence ancient magnolias on the lawn wisteria and bougainvillea at the eaves and lintels upstairs in the turret sheilas office a light had been turned on although it wasnt dark imagining her up there dooher felt a stab of what he used to call the occasion of sin the frisson of excitement one deep breath drove the thought away after all he had done nothing wrong he pulled up his driveway he parked in the garage and closed the automatic door behind him then walked back down the driveway and into the house through the side entrance as he usually did hello cheerfully announcing his arrival he knew she was upstairs in the turret probably talking to one of their offspring which she did when he wasnt around hed seen the light on up there and knew she wouldnt be able to hear him unless he bellowed so there was no answer except the silent echoes of his own voice hello more quietly with an angry edge he went over to the refrigerator stuffed with party supplies and pulled out a beer opening it with the church key he remembered days when shed meet him at the door his drink in her hand mixed theyd sit in the living room and shed join him and theyd have a civilized half hour or so in those early years even after they had the kids hed come first for a long time when had it ended exactly he couldnt remember but it was long gone he took another sip of the beer staring out the french doors into their backyard the wind had freshened in the long shadows a first large raindrop hit the skylight over his head i thought i heard you come in he turned oh i didnt think you had you didnt answer she used to be very pretty short slimwaisted and highbreasted she used to work at maximizing what she had she still could look good when she put her mind to it but at home just for him it never happened anymore it didnt matter to her mark knew what she looked like underneath the clothes slim waists and high breasts were in the past she was fortyseven years old and in decent shape but she didnt look the way she did at twentyfive no one could or should expect her to today she wore green sweats green espadrilles her onceluxuriant black hair was now streaked with gray she loved the natural look and cut to a sensible length held back by a green headband there had been nothing wrong with her face when hed met her widely spaced hazel eyes an unlined wide forehead an expressive beaming smile there was nothing wrong with her face now except that hed seen every expression it could make and none of them had any power to move him anymore she was up next to him and put her cheek against his kissing the air friends i was on the phone mark the caterers theyre going to be a half hour late again we ought to quit using them she patted at his arm oh stop theyre great people and they make great food youre just jittery about the party she turned on the tap at the sink and filled a glass he took a slow sip of his beer controlling himself she was having water youre right he said its nerves i guess you want to have a drink with me she shook her head you go ahead ill sit with you are you going to drink tonight at the party challenging she looked up at him if i want to mark its all right if i dont drink you know i didnt say it wasnt yes you did he tipped his beer bottle up emptying it then placed it carefully on the drain im sorry he said youre right im uptight ill go take a shower sheila was sitting at her dressing table in the makeup room behind the bedroom wearing only her slip her legs crossed putting the finishing touches on her face outside night pressed a gloomy and oppressive hand to the window the lights in the room flickered as wind and driving rain rattled the panes in the bedroom dooher had dropped a cufflink onto his dresser three times more rattling sheila stopped with her blush brush and glanced over are you all right mark do you feel okay he got the cufflink in turned it so it would hold looked up im fine its nothing maybe the weather sheila went back to the mirror itll be all right she said dont worry everyone will fit inside it might even make it more fun dooher made a face fun he said as though the concept were foreign to him she turned again more slowly can you tell me what it is an expression of concern wes not being invited because of wes farrells pending divorce from his wife lydia sheila had suggested with the force of edict that they not take sides so they had invited neither it was the first party theyd ever thrown that didnt include either of their mutual best friends mark dooher could not tell his wife that hed had enough of the man hed been pretending to be for so long something had to change was going to change i dont think thats it ive been known to have fun without wes farrell not as much usually teasing him well thanks for that he said then as she began to apologize the doorbell rang dooher looked at his watch thatll be the band he turned on his heel and left the room his wife looked after him her face wistful saddened she sighed the guests had been arriving through the teeth of the storm and dooher and sheila were greeting the early arrivals in the spacious foyer theyd hired a staff of five to handle the food and drinks and there was of course the band cooking away early on the first of what would probably be twenty or thirty takes of when the saints come marching in doohers palms were sweating he didnt know for sure if the woman in the restaurant had in fact been averys girlfriend she might be anything to him sister cousin financial adviser architect but he did know avery was coming bringing a guest he hadnt planned what hed do after he met her it all synthesized down to the simple need to see her again if she wasnt with avery tonight hed just but she was dooher was moving forward sheila at his side putting his hand out shaking averys as the woman shrugged out of her raincoat passed it to one of the staff shook the wet from a french braid she wore a maroon fauxvelvet dress with spaghetti straps there was a tiny mole on the swell of one breast her body was already subtly catching the rhythm of the music avery was introducing her first to sheila then and this is mr dooher er mark our host mark christina carrera he took her hand and then without consciously intending to briefly raised it to his lips a scent of almond their eyes met and held long enough to force her to look down no one noticed other guests were arriving he realized he was still holding her hand and let it go including avery now in his welcome thank you both so much for braving this new orleans monsoon he lapsed into a drawl sheila and i had ordered a couple dozen degrees of humidity for for verisimilitudes sake but this is takin it a bit farther than id hoped wouldnt you say he had struck the right tone they laughed at home embraced by the host sheila had her arm on his appreciating the return of his good humor he nodded again at avery go on inside get yourselves some drinks warm up have fun now that she was here he could be gracious after his earlier apprehension an almost narcotic calm settled over him there would be time to meet her get to know her if not tonight then she was in his house now he had her name christina carrera she would not get away they had remodeled their kitchen five years before and now it was a vast open space with an island cooking area a deep well inset into the marble provided ice and a continual supply of champagne bottles across the back of the room away from the sinks a twelvefoot table was laden with freshshucked oysters smoked salmon three kinds of caviar crawfish crab cakes shrimps as big as lobster tails the band cornets trumpets trombones banjos and bass was playing new orleans jazz getting into it people were dancing throughout the downstairs but here in the kitchen the swinging doors kept out enough music to allow conversation christina was standing at the well alone pouring champagne into two flutes that shed set on the marble dooher had seen her leave avery with some other young people from the firm take his glass and go through the swinging doors into the kitchen he came up behind her while youre pouring would you mind he put his glass next to the two others on the counter she turned and smiled no of course not her gaze stayed on him a second this is a super party thank you she tipped his glass poured in a small amount of champagne let the bubbles subside poured again a woman who knows how to pour champagne dooher said i thought it was a lost art she was concentrating on the task not in my family is your family from around here no theyre from down south ojai actually really i love ojai ive often thought id like to settle there when i retire well thatll be a long time from now not as long as you think she handed him his glass and he touched hers when i think of the pink moment she laughed you do know ojai the town was nestled in a valley behind ventura and many times the setting sun would break through the fog that hovered near the ocean and seem to paint the red rock walls of the valley a deep pink the locals set great store by it dooher nodded i tell you i love the place i do too and yet youre here and yet her eyes glistened enjoying the moment sipping champagne school usf she hesitated a moment law school actually dooher backed up his hand to his heart not that im afraid so she made a face they tell me its an acquired taste though im done in june and i cant say ive been completely won over she smiled over her glass oops im saying too much champagne talk i should never admit that to a managing partner dooher leaned in closer to her dropping to a whisper ill let you in on a secret there are moments in the profession that are not pure bliss you shock me and yet he said and yet a moment nearly awkward with the connection well joes champagnes getting warm just sitting there that i take it is joes glass the dutiful woman she said softening it with a halfsmile but there was no mistaking it some tension with avery but she picked up his glass are you clerking somewhere this summer have you applied with us most law students spent their summers clerking with established firms for a variety of reasons experience good pay the inside track at a job offer christina shook her head joe would kill me joe would kill you why she shrugged well you know hes on the hiring committee he thinks it would smack of nepotism from the latin nepos meaning nephew are you joes niece by any chance perhaps hes your nephew are you two related to the third degree of consanguinity he raised his eyebrows humorous but holding her there love those lawyer words he said she was enjoying him no no nothing like that he just thinks it wouldnt work well i may have to have a word with mr avery no i mean please it would just he stepped closer again christina may i call you christina she nodded look are you going to be a good lawyer yes i mean i think i am im law review only the best students made law review dooher pounced youre law review and he put his glass down started over more slowly christina listen youre not doing yourself a favor nor would you be doing our firm a favor by not applying if you think there might be a good fit a woman who is on law review and he was about to make some comment about her beauty but stopped himself you couldnt be too careful on the sexual harassment score these days well youll do meaningful work and youll bring in clients which is quite a bit more than half the ballgame although thats a dirty secret i should never divulge to an idealistic young student not so young mr dooher mark youre christina im mark okay she nodded but im really not so young im twentyseven i didnt start law school until two years after college so youve already got practical work experience look christina after what im hearing if you dont come down and apply at mccabe roth i will come out to usf and try to recruit you myself clear he grinned her champagne was halfgone i should really watch what i say when im drinking now joe is really going to be upset i bet he wont be upset he touched her arm dont you be upset either this is a party im sorry i didnt mean to push it if its no he will he also said that theres no sense applying if were going to get married because theres a policy against attorneys being married are you engaged i dont see a ring well not yet not exactly but dooher pushed it christina joes a good attorney but this doesnt have to do with him it has to do with whats best for your career its your decision you come down and apply and itll go through channels from therecapisce all right promise she nodded he clinked his glass against hers and they drank chapter three he awoke without the alarm in the halfdark listening to the water still dripping from the gutters the digital clock on the nightstand read he and sheila hadnt come up to bed until nearly but dooher had always been able to wake up at any time he wanted no matter how long hed slept it was a matter of control of discipline and he had made plans for early sheila slept on her side of the bed the covers pulled high over her and he slipped out and walked over to the window it was cold in the room but the chill braced him he stood shivering enjoying it the storm continued with no sign of letting up his spacious back lawn looked gray and somber mottled with soaking clumps of plant matter the old elms skeleton hung barren the bushes in the rose garden reached out their swollen arthritic fingers the whole place sepulchral within its enclosing hedges it was ash wednesday abe glitskys eyes opened to blackness and he was suddenly all the way awake sprung from fitful sleep by the jackinthebox mechanism that had controlled his metabolism over the past five months ever since flo had been diagnosed unlike a jackinthebox though he didnt move pop went the weasel and the lids of his eyes shot open but that was all that happened on the outside he lay there listening in the dead room his wife was breathing evenly regularly his head rang an anvil for the staccato hammering of his heart glitsky was a homicide inspector with the police department hed been getting through the days by doing what he had to do in fiveminute increments on the theory that if he could just make it through the next five minutes hed be all right when the long vigil began while he felt he still had some analytical powers left hed tried to make it through entire days at a time by force of will he wouldnt think about what was coming what would be but his focus on those days would keep splitting up disintegrating into pointillistic little nothings the stuff of his life unconnected separating now he was down to fiveminute intervals he would function for five minutes keep his focus there were twelve fiveminute intervals in one hour two hundred and forty in twenty hours hed consciously done the math he was doing twentyhour days on average he was also into situps two hundred and forty situps every day a symbol he wondered how he could be so tired and not sleep not be sleepy at all he was never sleepy tired beyond imagining far beyond what hed ever thought were the limits of his physical endurance but his brain never slowed sometime in the course of a night or postmidnight morning the apparatus that was his body would shut down and he would lie unconscious for a few hours but this never felt like sleep last night a blessing the boom had lowered while he lay in bed next to his wife praying for it now pop he was up the digital changed a flicker at the periphery of his vision the only light in the room still deep dark yes but morning really far better than when the pop was when he knew he was up for the day and it was still night he swung his legs off the bed at dooher was in the fifth row of st ignatius on the campus of the university of san francisco because of a hunch that christina carrera would appear as shed implied jokingly when shed said her goodbyes last night dooher realized that the odds might be long against her actually getting up and coming down to church for ashes but long odds had never fazed him after all what had been the odds back when he was fifteen that the baseball team he played for from san carlos california would go all the way to the babe ruth world series and then beyond that that dooher would come up in the bottom of the seventh inning two out one run down with his best friend wes farrell standing on second base and that he would hit a home run to win the whole thing long odds or when hed managed the menlo park mcdonalds in and during his first two years at stanford and decided to take the stock option they were offering to their management employees even though it lowered his pay by ten percent to under three dollars an hour hed taken a lot of grief from friends about the thousand dollars he was throwing down the drain but mark had had a hunch and when he got out of law school eight years later that stock was worth over and he and sheila used it as the down payment on the home he still owned which theyd bought for in and was now worth well over a million long odds kneeling in the pew his knee jammed painfully into the space between the padding so it would hurt some of the other riskier chances hed taken came back at him the time when but halting his reverie christina appeared in his peripheral vision he lowered his head in an attitude of prayer she was wearing jeans boots a goretex overcoat and did not see him she kept walking her own head bowed a couple of pews in front of him she genuflected stepped in and kneeled the glitskys lived in an upper duplex on lake street and abe was in the kitchen bringing handfuls of cold water to his face a steady downpour was tattooing the roof but a thin ribbon of pink hung in the eastern sky off to the right out the window over the sink the thing to do was get the chores started but he couldnt move the order of things didnt flow anymore how could he do this alone he wasnt going to ask that question not in this five minutes it would paralyze him he wouldnt think about it he depended on flo she was one of the worlds competent beings the two of them had split up their domestic duties long ago glitsky had always helped with heavy cleaning hed fixed things lifted and moved washed and dried dishes organized shelves and rooms and closets when the boys had been born hed changed diapers and heated baby food but eventually their care dressing them feeding them comforting them had fallen mostly to flo and now it was falling back on him how was he going to do it stop it it wasnt that he minded doing more work or even thought about the work flo was not someone who worked for him she was his partner in some fundamental way he felt he was half her she half him and their life together his job her competence the boys had taken every bit of both of them together how could that continue with only half of them it wasnt a matter of shaking the thoughts because they werent really thoughts he was resting his weight on his arms and hands which were planted on either side of the sink fighting vertigo the ground felt as though it was going to give way to an echoing abyss he raised his head and the strip of morning hadnt grown appreciably wider after mass after the ashes dooher thought he would let christina come to him rather than approach her waiting on the steps outside he watched the rain come down mr dooher he turned with a practiced look of surprise mingled with curiosity then took an extra moment to place who she was exactly he knew her but christina she said reminding him oh of course christina sorry im not quite awake i know getting up this morning was a little hey were here thats what counts in the eyes of god the eyes of god she repeated penance he said lent some people need thanksgiving or christmas i need the reminder about dust to dust ashes to ashes he shrugged one of the occupational hazards of lawyers is that we tend to think that what we do on a daily basis is important it is important wouldnt you say i mean peoples lives solving their problems he tapped the dot of ash on his forehead eventually it all turns to this an apologetic smile selfdeprecating this happy thought brought to you by mark dooher sorry she kept looking at him youre an interesting man glitsky had ten pieces of bread spread out on the counter five sandwiches two each for the older boys isaac and jacob one for the baby no he reminded himself not the baby anymore the tenyearold oj what are you looking at his youngest son didnt sleep much either night terrors everybody in the duplex handled it differently oj was wearing a spiderman suit hed slept in standing in the doorway to the kitchen glitsky had no idea how long hed been there im making lunches again again but you made lunch yesterday i know its going to happen a lot i make lunch okay and lets talk quiet nobodys up what do you want nothing i dont eat lunch oj you eat lunch every day what do you want nothing outside the window the trees of the presidio behind their duplex had come into relief morning breaking slowly he wasnt going to fight his child over lunch he would just make something and put it in the box and either oj would eat it or he wouldnt glitsky was in his midforties he wore green stringpull pajama bottoms and no shirt crossing the kitchen he went down on one knee pulled his boy onto the other one howd you sleep good oj had to be coaxed to give anything up no bad dreams nope good thats good but the boys arms came up around his fathers neck the small body contouring to glitskys chest a moment holding him there not really an embrace an embrace might drive him off i know you dont want anything for lunch but if you did want something what would it be eye contact a shrug peebeejay i guess it took a minute to process okay you get dressed ill make it oj wasnt ready to do that yet he stayed on the knee but the way mom does okay glitsky took in a breath okay how is that you dont have to yell at me its not that hard im not yelling im whispering in fact and i didnt say it was hard im sure its not hard i just want to know how you like it so i can make it that way all right i said i didnt want one anyway the eyes were clouding up threatening to spill over just forget it glitsky didnt let him pull away i dont want to forget it oj i want to get it right he had to keep from slipping into his cop voice this was his son he loved him tell me how mom makes it he asked gently would you please do that for me buddy its easy im sure it is just tell me okay a pause considering oj stood off the knee and glitsky straightened up bread then butter you never put butter but mom always does you got to put butter first then peanut butter over the butter then on the other bread the jelly butter then peanut butter then jelly i got it on the other piece of bread i got it but dont you close the sandwich when youre done so that the peanut butter and the jelly are stuck together anyway but thats not how you make it i could tell yesterday but yesterday i didnt put on the butter first nope nope what also you put the jelly straight on the peanut butter i probably did youre right glitsky couldnt believe he was having this conversation his world was coming apart as was his sons and here they were discussing a completely undetectable difference in the placement of jelly on a sandwich but he had no strength to tell oj this was stupid maybe it wasnt stupid certainly it wasnt anymore stupid than all this talking about it perhaps it was ojs cry for order as his universe devolved into chaos jelly on the bread not on the peanut butter one thing he could control he motioned his son closer and brought a hand down around his shoulders then gave him a pat sending him back to his room to get dressed on the bread first i got it but he knew he didnt get it the peebeejay was one thing random and irrational the first word in a whole new language that he had no ear for the other eight pieces of bread lay spread out on the counter he couldnt think what he was supposed to do with them the rain continued steady as a metronome the wind had let up and the drops were falling straight down out of black clouds miz carters mudhouse had been serving highoctane java on california street for forty years and dooher and christina were in a booth by one of the windows miz carter served her coffee in oversized mostly cracked mugs the product of some warehouse clearance sale of twenty years before i really did try to become an excatholic for a lot of years dooher was saying stopped going to church entirely even though i was starting to get some work for the archdiocese hell back then a lot of the priests i was working with had stopped going to church but it just wasnt me i guess i need the ritual i dont think thats it she said you dont have to explain it to me i think you just believed thats the problem i do thats not a problem well he sipped at his coffee moved food around on his plate why is that a problem she persisted deciding to answer her he let out a small sigh well as you know we lawyers get used to defending our positions its a bit awkward taking a position that doesnt really have a logical framework i mean its faith its there or its not but theres really not any reason to have it or not have it but you cant prove a negative but she pointed a finger at him theres no reason to prove it its personal well of course i know but it sets me apart a bit from my peers its old fashioned fuddyduddy come on it is not not on you he pointed back at her says you yes she said says me okay i guess that settles it so what about you what about me and what faith belief why youve got ashes on your forehead here at he checked his watch seven oclock of a rather inclement wednesday morning she glanced down at her food cut into her waffle wiped it in syrup she did not bring the fork to her mouth evasive action dooher said still looking down she nodded a little i suppose im sorry i dont mean to push you she took in a breath raised her head her eyes had a shine in them penance too mostly figuring things out dooher waited this isnt turning into the most modern of conversations is it faith and penance sounds like the middle ages or me and wes on one of our retreats she seemed grateful for the reprieve wes wes farrell my best friend best friends another notsomodern concept dooher studied her face something was troubling her hurting her he kept up the patter to give her a chance to let the moment pass if thats what she wanted well thats me and wes a couple of throwbacks we go on retreats we call em replenish the soul talk about the big picture get reconnected youre lucky a friend like that a pause adding still believing in connecting he took a beat making sure she didnt want to avoid it after all didnt want to be protected insulated from whatever it was not today not now she had decided to get it out and this was an invitation to him to ask its really so trite she liked the way the corners of his mouth lifted slightly trite happens he said she leaned forward over the table you know last night when i let you believe id been in the workplace after college for a couple of years that wasnt the truth she watched him for a sign she wasnt sure of what displeasure boredom ready to retreat at any provocation he only nodded patient and tolerant taking a breath she went on he was a professor at santa clara my adviser married a great guy you probably know everything im going to say dont you do you ever talk about this no its too she shook her head im here he said im interested and it wont go any further if it would help through the expanse of window a volley of rain raked the parking area beat briefly against their portion of the glass passed over he was going to leave his wife she began i guess thats what i had the most trouble with when it was first starting to happen that i was going to wreck his happy home except that he told me that margie and he didnt love each other anymore that he was leaving her anyway it had nothing to do with me and i guess i wanted to believe that youre not the first person thats happened to she had turned in her seat one leg extended on the bench her elbow on the table leaning over toward him the waitress came to clear and they both sat silently watching her remove dishes wipe the table down more coffee here after it had been poured dooher prompted her it must have been painful and not so trite after all she was biting her lip again youve only heard the short version girl falls in love with college professor whos going to leave his wife for her after she graduates christina she held up a hand listen it gets worse girl has best friend from childhood lets call her ginny whos kind of the liaison between the two of them covers for them with the wife all that girl gets pregnant professor had been childless with his wife told girl he was sterile low sperm count now accuses girl of sleeping with someone else couldnt have been him dumps her just as she graduates christina reached for her cup took a quick sip swallowed she looked over at dooher met his eye girl has abortion she said end of story see trite and ps professor dumps wife and marries friend ginny just to tie it all up dooher picked up his mug holding it with both hands he blew on it glanced at the rain outside thats what the penance is for she nodded i still dont know what to do with it its been almost five years sighing its so funny because i know better i mean im educated reasonably smart but i dont know it changed me not just brians she looked embarrassed at the slip of the name continued brians betrayal and ginnys mostly the abortion i guess silence so what did you do for the two years before law school i went home down to ojai i moped around let my mom and dad take care of me and then one day my dad and i had a talk about how giving in to grief too much is really wrong well that struck a chord and i decided i had to do something start living again so i applied to law school as if thats living she gave him a weak smile anyway she touched her forehead that explains the ashes the penance the engagement to joe avery that got a rise out of her i didnt say that why do you say that dooher shrugged i dont know the connection just jumped into my head well that doesnt make any sense i like joe very much love him i mean dont look at me like that doohers voice remained measured im not looking at you any way i just made an observation thats all i like joe too hell i hired him i shouldnt have spoken so frankly i thought we were baring our souls here i didnt mean to offend you im sorry she softened im sorry too i didnt mean no its all right he looked at his watch and its time for me to go to work can i drop you back at school christina sat straightbacked pressed against her bench now youre mad at me dooher leaned across the table not at all youre still applying to the firm today tomorrow the next day i said i would but will you now he broke a smile after our first fight gradually the face softened again she nodded yes then im not mad at you glitsky closed the door having just gotten the three boys off to school he stood a minute in the tiny foyer closing his eyes briefly against the constant sting of fatigue he could hear the voices of his sons but he didnt stand still for long he had about a weeks worth of work to do today which was how hed arranged it he would just keep doing things that was the trick today flo was alive and his boys were healthy and doing fine in school thats what he would concentrate on he had five homicides he was investigating and he was also studying for the lieutenants exam which he hadnt even decided to take but it was more busy work he looked at his watch he had to go now into the kitchen pour himself some tea get his day moving abe flo suddenly awake called from the bedroom yo hearty as he could manage he was already across the living room stopping in the bedrooms doorway his wife had propped herself up and she was smiling at him get em off she meant the kids glitsky saluted out of here on time and looking good she patted the bed and moved over so he could sit what time did you get up actually i had a pretty good night got up before the alarm but not much i think about sixthirty she searched his face ran a light finger across the top of his cheek your eyes have bags thats just the way they look flo im working on them as an investigative tool keep me from looking too friendly oh yes she said thats been a real problem youd be surprised he said witnesses thinking im all warm and fuzzy i decided i ought to look a little tougher good idea you wouldnt want your sweet nature to show through people just take advantage you wouldnt believe glitskys mother emma had been black his father nat was jewish so glitsky had a darkskinned face with a hawklike nose in spite of that people tended to see first the uneven white scar that ran between his upper and lower lips even when his eyes didnt have the valises under them as they did now his smile was a terrifying thing to behold he laid a hand on his wifes thigh so hows by you you want some food coffee tantric sex she nodded all of the above ill get up you sure unless you want the tantric sex first but im better after coffee okay ill wait you put on the pot she said ill freshen up he went into the kitchen there on the table were the remains of the boys breakfasts empty bowls cereal boxes milk sugar all over the table and his police reports the five dead people and as much of their recent lives as glitsky had been able to assemble the latest a young woman named tania willows who had been raped and murdered and whose body had been discovered just yesterday the cereal in the cupboard sugar on the counter milk in the fridge got to clean out the fridge if theres that much mold on the cheese who knows what the meat drawer is going to look like sponge that sugar off the table the smell of the sponge the thing had to be three months old he should toss it but they didnt have another one where did sponges come from anyway he couldnt remember ever having bought a sponge in his entire life and then oh yeah the coffee the water boiling now and he still hadnt ground up the beans he really should grind up a bunch all at once so he wouldnt have to do it every morning but flo liked the freshground and he wanted her to have at least he and flo this morning that was a good wakeup hed just keep cheerful another few minutes maybe a half hour and so would she and then that would be another morning and if they just kept that up chapter four christinas sevenyearold toyota hadnt started and when it finally did the windshield wipers refused to function so she walked down the hill from usf past st marys hospital she was planning to cut through the panhandle of golden gate park on this rainy ash wednesday the shortcut would get her to work on time but she didnt count on san franciscos seemingly endless capacity to provide local color this mornings entry was a substantial coven of halfclad druids conducting some sort of treeworshiping ceremony chanting and clapping and having themselves a hell of a good time christina broke right trying to skirt them but a tiny thick woman of uncertain though recent vintage latched on to her a shawl covered the womans shoulders shed woven flowers into her hair and she wore a long leather skirt but her breasts were completely exposed when it became clear that christina wasnt about to join them was in fact going to work she segued smoothly from missionary high priestess to sparechange artist in any event by the time christina got to haight street where the rape crisis counseling center maintained its office she was soaking wet and twenty minutes late for her appointment her boss was a single attractive thirtyfiveyearold smartmouthed pistol named samantha duncan whose industrialstrength convictions on the ongoing battle of the sexes served her well in her role here counseling women who had been raped her genuine compassion for these victims was unfortunately matched by her impatience with the healing process for the women the legal process in identifying and punishing their attackers and the administrative reality of having to depend on parttime volunteers to keep the center functioning when christina had first interviewed for the work sam had impressed her with her humor and passion then she had laid out the ground rules in no uncertain terms i know this job doesnt pay anything shed said but i need my volunteers to believe and to act like its a job ineed you here when you say youre going to be here im not very good with excuses up until today christina had been punctual and dependable sam had a fire a presence and christina admired the hell out of her and wanted to please her she also wanted to prove that she wasnt a dilettante this was her own very real commitment as well many of the barriers had been broken already sam and christina had gone out for coffee together two or three times outside of work talking issues and politics christina thought they were close to real friendship but sam had a hair trigger regarding her volunteers always ready to see signs of their lack of commitment in the work and based on that to bail out of personal involvements with her staff and this morning as christina shook the water off herself it was clear that their tentative relationship had suffered a major setback sam didnt exactly greet christina with a smile oh here she is now christina this is sergeant glitsky hes with the police investigating well sam sighed you know about that ill let him tell you sergeant nice to have met you sam didnt favor christina with so much as a glance before she disappeared back into her office but she couldnt worry about sam not now and she turned her attention to the man in front of her this guy glitsky was in some kind of trouble christina thought he appeared even at a casual first glance to be under incredible pressure in the grip of some strong emotion he was struggling to keep under control she noticed his fingers clenching and unclenching before he reached out and shook her hand a surprise it was a gentle handshake his touch softer than she would have imagined the halfsmile he gave her didnt soften his looks any though im investigating the murder of tania willows and sam was telling me you had talked to her christina nodded tentative embarrassed and unsure tania willows had been their most recent tragedy nineteen years old just out to san francisco from fargo north dakota she had come to the center three times she was being raped she thought she meant she thought it was technically rape she didnt have a relationship with the guy who was older she was confused because she knew her assailant he didnt jump out and attack her from behind some bush so she wasnt sure if it was really rape hed started coming by her apartment gradually getting more aggressive and then hed force himself on her she was sure of that but she also seemed almost certain that it wasnt like he was going to hurt her or anything like that he never even hit her though there was this sense of fear that if she didnt maybe she had somehow been at fault leading him on did christina know what she meant how it could be sending the wrong signals but she definitely felt forced was forced she had kept telling him no and he wouldnt stop but otherwise tania didnt think the person was like a criminal or anything and really all she wanted was for him to leave her alone now she didnt want to get him in trouble maybe she shouldnt even be here and then four days ago tanias murder had been all over the news shed been raped in her apartment tied and taped to her bed gagged and strangled the center had called the police at that time christina found she had to clear her throat glitsky was asking her something which she didnt catch im sorry he showed no sign that he was bothered by having to repeat the question i was just wondering how much she might have told you about the man christina was sitting on the front edge of the ragged couch leaning forward her elbows on her knees her hands folded in front of her her hair still wet from the rain hung in front of her face almost nothing she said she knew him he lived near her maybe in her apartment building she definitely felt that if she moved she could get away from him but she couldnt afford to move glitsky nodded and she didnt want to press charges id hoped we were getting to there but no not by not in time and no names not an initial a nickname she shook her head no nothing i dont think i wish im sorry did you take any notes i might look at maybe there was something i know i took some ill go check it wouldnt have been much but maybe the sergeants face had clouded he was staring blankly out through the fogged glass out into the desultory traffic on haight can i get you anything she asked cup of coffee or something glitsky didnt answer she touched his arm sergeant back with her sure sorry just thinking are you all right suddenly the face wasnt terrifying at all what she saw was sadness tm a little distracted he said my wifes sick then some tea would be nice thanks it still wasnt noon christina was just tired she told herself after all with the party shed been awake until nearly two last night then had her nightly argument with joe this morning then her ashes and the long strangely emotional breakfast with mark dooher her car not starting the neohippie woman in the park sams disapproval then tania willows and abe glitsky with whatever his sorrow was his sick wife suddenly the rain launching a new attack behind her back against her grimy window the lights off as she sat alone in her tiny cubicle something broke in her she wiped the back of her hand roughly against her eyes as a child would trying to will away the tears but they kept coming she was just tired this the sudden collapse hadnt happened in almost two years she wasnt going to let herself think it was anything to do with the baby shed lost with her past not that again that was behind her and she wasnt going to let it get to her anymore it was the events of the morning that was all shed just toughen up that was it that was what shed do swiping again at her face sniffling she got up from her desk pulling her goretex up around her face the rain would hide the tears no one would see chapter five his excellency didnt have to explain it all to dooher but if it made him feel better mark would let him go on he was the client and every hour was they were sitting in the archbishops office above the childrens playground at mission dolores their informal meetings always took place here in the serenity of the laughter of children that floated up into flahertys sanctum sanctorum although the archdiocese employed a fulltime attorney of its own its mandate was far too broad for one man to do it all and so a lot of the work needed to be farmed out to private firms and over the years doohers firm had come to specialize in the churchs secular affairs dozens upon dozens of slip and fall cases liability property management personnel dooher personally had gotten close to flaherty not only for his ability to handle the tougher cases diplomatically and with dispatch but because there was an unstated but perfectly understood ruthlessness in each of the men both got things done sometimes what the archbishop needed to accomplish was better handled outside of his office dooher was unofficial but defacto consigliere also like dooher flaherty was an athletic man who looked a decade younger than he was still at fiftyseven he was running about fifty percent in his squash games nonbillable with dooher here in private the archbishop wore tasseled black loafers black slacks a white dress shirt dooher deeply molded nearly imbedded into the red leather chair had his coat off his tie loosened i dont know why these things always take me by surprise flaherty was saying i keep expecting better of my fellow man and they keep letting me down youd think id learn dooher nodded the alternative of course is to expect nothing of your fellow man i cant live like that i cant help it i believe that deep down were all made in the image of god so our nature cant be bad am i wrong mark i cant be wrong dooher thought it best not to remind his excellency that he had predicted exactly what would happen back in the early stages of the decisionmaking process over the current lawsuit but hed been overridden youre not all wrong jim youve got to take it case by case flaherty was standing by the open window looking down over the schoolyard he turned to his lawyer as neat a turn away from philosophy and to the business at hand as one would expect he pulled a chair up okay where are we today reaching down for his props though he didnt need them dooher pulled his briefcase from the floor opened it and extracted a yellow manila folder labeled felicia diep mrs diep had come to the united states in from saigon a young single mother with a substantial nest egg from her deceased husband in vietnam shed settled in the lower mission district of san francisco where she became a regular parishioner at st michaels parish and not incidentally a longtime paramour of its pastor father peter slocum over the course of the next twenty years mrs diep gave father slocum something in the order of for one thing and another and all might have been well had not the good priest decided to take his promotion to monsignor and move away from her down the peninsula to menlo park he had abandoned her and she wanted her money back so she decided to go to a young lawyer in her community named victor trang trang wasnt in the medical field but if he was he would have qualified as an ambulance chaser barely making a living in his first three years after graduating from one of the night schools that taught law he took the case hoping for no more than his fee of one third of the fifty grand mrs diep wanted he sued the archdiocese for fraud father slocum wasnt celibate as promised and hed taken mrs dieps money under false pretenses promising her over the years that he would eventually leave the priesthood and marry her this was where dooher got involved and it hadnt been a big item on his plate one of his associates took care of the preliminary motions in response to the lawsuit then passed them up to him he and flaherty had determined that they would offer ten grand as a settlement and if mrs diep didnt accept it they would go to court and take their chances so in the middle of the previous week dooher had called victor trang conveying the settlement offer it was then he discovered that things had changed and hed arranged this meeting with flaherty the archbishops face did not exactly go pale but he was rocked he lifted his eyes from the folder three million dollars the lawyer nodded trangs got nothing else to do jim the church has deep pockets so he went looking flaherty was trying to read and listen at the same time not very far it seems no slocum was sleeping with the daughter too veronica now nineteen thats trangs story to say nothing of several other immigrants whose names he didnt provide he may be bluffing flaherty closed the folder abruptly i know slocum its possible trangs not bluffing this is nowhere near the first allegation this was not welcome news dooher leaned forward if you knew some of this whyd you make him a monsignor a crooked smile i didnt know it they were allegations wed heard we thought wed remove him from the temptation put him where he didnt have the same freedom of movement give him more responsibility a shake of the head and thereby change his nature i know mark i know my natures the problem i believe people i trust them well dooher slapped his palms on his knees thats why youve hired a top gun like myself i trust no one he pointed down at the folder still on flahertys lap you get to the end of that no i stopped at the three million dooher took it okay i can give you the short version it gets worse he went on to explain what trang had told him last week on the phone the young upstart would be initiating to conduct a series of investigations with other immigrants in san francisco to determine with what kind of frequency these clerical abuses were occurring he expected to discover that the archdiocese systematically condoned this kind of behavior from their priests hes calling it a policy of tolerance jim hes going to amend the complaint to name you personally the archbishop was back at his window looking down at the children can we have slocum killed quickly he turned hand out im joking of course of course but all kidding aside mark what are we going to do flaherty wasnt having his best year six months earlier after an extensive twoyear study by the archdiocesan pastoral planning commission had confirmed their predicted results hed finally bitten the bullet and announced the closure of the ten least financially viable parishes in the city he knew that the archdiocese would not survive into the twentyfirst century if it didnt take steps now the city had taken a hard line after the world series earthquake and passed an ordinance that assessed the archdiocese million for retrofitting their unreinforced masonry churches dooher had worked his magic to lower the bill down to million but it might as well have been zillion for all the church could afford to pay even that the plain fact and it broke flahertys good heart was that the archdiocese couldnt afford to keep the smaller parishes operating with attendance down at masses throughout the city holy family church out in north beach for example averaged only seventyfive people total for four masses on sundays and there were really no significant private donations to offset the appallingly low sunday offerings but after the closures were announced a firestorm of protest had developed flaherty had even heard from rome the problem that flaherty had not foreseen and dooher had was that perennial san francisco twoheaded serpent ethnicity and money most of the parishes that had been closed were those in the poorest areas hunters point the lower mission district the western addition the outer sunset balboa park so flaherty was widely vilified for abandoning the poor and what had been a purely financial move had been totally misinterpreted flaherty had also believed that the catholics in the closed parishes would simply move to other buildings for their worship and would be accepted in those new locales by the other catholics who already worshiped there that is truly an ecumenical theory jim and in a perfect world that would surely happen dooher had said but my prediction is that my fellow parishioners st emydius in st francis wood are simply not going to offer the kiss of peace to the vietnamese community from st michaels thats going to descend upon them its not going to happen flaherty responded as he always did that people were better than dooher gave them credit for the commission had made its recommendations it had not been flahertys decision alone the people would get used to it it could actually be a force for growth for advancement of the whole catholic community well yes jim i guess youre right it could go that way dooher had finally said thinking and im the king of ethiopia and now trang was threatening to name flaherty in a lawsuit contending that he tolerated fraud and licentiousness among his priests before all of these problems had begun there was a rumor that flaherty had been on the short list to be named a cardinal he had confided to dooher that he had dreams of being the first american pope now all of that perhaps even his immediate survival as archbishop was at stake he was at his desk now moving items randomly nerves showing but trang hasnt yet amended the complaint pacing dooher stopped thats why were talking here jim i need to head this off the guys obviously looking for press make his name in the community bring in some clients ive got to talk sense to him what are you going to say ill just tell him wed be grateful for his cooperation he knows you know there wasnt any policy here weve got to get him off this jim or at the very least you can forget about your red hat flaherty pulled himself up in his chair how grateful dooher clasped his hands in front of him settle for six hundred thousand if it goes that high lord and a gag order no press conferences no conscience of the community nonsense trang pockets two hundred thousand dollars mrs diep gets a nice return on her fifty grand and her broken heart everybodys happy the archbishop shook his head tm not we start at six hundred dooher tried to keep his tone light jim this is mark dooher youre talking to we start by offering to break trangs legs hopefully we stop a long way before six flaherty nodded a long way if you can dooher bowed slightly from the waist i understand he said ill take care of it youre not actually seeing her wes i ran into her at church thats all at church thats very good wes farrell lowered his voice a notch the night after your party which she happened to attend because her boyfriend got himself invited markus were running into a critical coincidence factor here wes farrell had his feet up on the desk in his small office behind him through wooden slats rain beat against the window dooher was continuing with the fairytale version of his story about christina and farrell finally stopped him this is all good stuff mark i mean it and because i am your longstanding friend i believe every word of it however i will offer one word of advice lawyer to lawyer what dont try it on anybody else it sounds suspiciously like a rationalizing crock although i know in my heart of hearts because you would never lie to me that it couldnt possibly be how did she look dooher crossed his hands behind his head considering who in your opinion is the allaround bestlooking woman in the world face body an expansive gesture the whole schmeer everything farrell thought a moment demi moore dooher nodded well demi moore is a dog next to christina carrera even with wet hair and ashes on her forehead ive never seen demi like that farrell said usually when we go out after she ditches bruce she dresses up puts on some makeup stuff like that come to think of it i wonder if shes why lydias divorcing me if she found out about demi and me that could be it dooher said those damn paparazzi dooher cracked a grin your fantasy life is much too rich for you to be a good lawyer farrell pointed across the room says the man who meets his associates fiancee at church what do you plan to do with her if i might ask a shrug as though hed never considered the question i dont know im thinking of hiring her at farrells expression he added just as a clerk shes law review pretty sharp kid actually farrell pointed again i must tell you this is fire its all innocent wes i swear nothings going on so do yourself a favor and get another clerk were going to have ten other clerks christinas just going to be one of them farrell scratched his chin oh boy he said oh boy oh boy oh boy im so worried about mark hes just not been himself lydia farrell wess wife threw an oh please expression at sheila dooher over the rim of her china cup the two women were in the glassenclosed breakfast nook with the french countryside motif above which the driving rain of the earlier morning had turned to a romantic normandy drizzle at the look sheila said come on lyd theyre not all bad men i mean lydia put her cup down i didnt say they were you know i dont think wes has anything bad going against him hes just got nothing going period either direction against for sideways mark i dont know marks a good man lyd that counts once in the very early days mark had subtly but very definitely come on to lydia his best friends wife when shed called him on it hed backed off saying in his charming way that she must have misunderstood something he was sorry but she knew she hadnt misunderstood a thing shed never mentioned it to wes or to sheila on some level she was flattered even amused by it to have something on the great mark dooher who obviously thought she was attractive enough to run that risk imagine but she had decided opinions about his inherent goodness still sheila was her friend theyd been through moves and children and schools and their husbands careers together and she deserved a listen im sorry youre right good counts im just a little snippy today im seeing sarah her divorce lawyer tomorrow and i want to be in shape im always tempted to be so nice let wes have something ive got a legal right to so sarah told me start thinking hate thoughts the day before think of all the shitty things hes done the times he hasnt shown up when he said he would the dinners that got cold the shirts youve ironed to say nothing about more personal things youll never regret it sarahs a jewel i never want to go through that well i didnt either dear but divorce is like war if youre in one youd better win still you and mark arent going to get divorced no i dont think that but i didnt say but lydia smiled at her friend yes you did so why why what why do you think your marriage is suffering sheila put down her cup picked up the tiny spoon and stirred after a long moment she answered because mark is from what sheila took a moment phrasing it she wasnt sure herself i think hes clinically depressed with the kids gone now and all i think hes lost a pause im worried he might kill himself has he said that no you know mark but hes made a few comments lydia picked up her cup sipped at it eyes on sheila why would he kill himself hes got everything maybe what he has doesnt mean anything or enough sheilas eyes were dry and she spoke calmly but lydia had known her since college and had learned that just because sheila wasnt given over to histrionics didnt mean she didnt go deep hows he acting she asked silent and hes not sleeping his doctor gave him some pills but he wont take them he was up and out by seven this morning when i got up and we didnt get to bed until very late twoish up and out gone to work no i called he didnt get in till after ten i dont want to say sheila held up her hand no its not an affair he doesnt have time you dont go meet your lover at six in the morning someplace actually he went to church ash wednesday for ashes i asked and he told me the good catholic still thats him but the point is hes getting no sleep this has been going on almost a year now its like hes afraid hes going to miss something some excitement i dont know and then hes constantly disappointed when nothing happens are you two doing okay i mean personally sheila wore a rueful look you mean our sexlife speaking of nothing happening then as though shed said more than she intended added its great when we get around to it which is about every four times the moon gets full if that lydia looked out at the drizzle at her manicured lawn she sighed that happened to wes the whole thing you describe i tried as long as i could but i just couldnt stand it he wasnt depressed i dont think hed just stopped loving me i dont mean thats you and mark but that was me and wes sheila thought a moment i just dont believe that she said i think its deeper and if i could just figure out what it was everything would get better lydia took her hand over the table patted it you know him better than me sheila im sure youre right i hope so sheila really blamed herself that was her training as well as her inclination she always blamed herself for everything that went wrong their kids marks dissatisfaction it had to be her she knew it couldnt be mark who didnt make mistakes not the way other people did factual errors even in casual conversation forget it the man knew everything and forgot nothing sheila made lists to remember all of the many jobs she had to do every day or week mark just did them all and perfectly he never needed a reminder he never lost his temper well once in a very great while and invariably when she had provoked him beyond the limits of a saint mark dooher performed his duties flawlessly so if something was wrong and something was it had to be sheilas fault she thought it was probably the doublewhammy of the onset of menopause and jason their baby finally going off to school way off to boulder where he could snowboard all winter long and mark jr working now on that rig in alaska trying to make enough to pay the bills for a summer of his sculpting since his father wouldnt help him if he was so set on doing that kind of stupid art and susan in new york well at least susan called every week or so tried to keep them up on her life though sheila and especially mark would never understand why she had no interest in men sheilas hormones too had caught up with her swirled her into depression she couldnt deny it and she couldnt blame mark shed become miserable to live with a hard truth to accept for sheila graham dooher who until she turned fortyfive was one of the citys legendary partyers but as the gloom had begun to settle and she couldnt shake herself out of it she felt less and less motivated to try for over a year everything mark did shed pick pick pick losing her temper poking viciously even at his perfection his charming smile his trim body his own patience with her she couldnt blame him for retreating into himself his work for not approaching her on sex whenever he did she turned him down then came the end of their nights out or even the laughfilled gourmet dinners at home with wes and lydia in their places thrummed the somber pervasiveness of the big empty house no wonder it had gotten to him finally worn him down which is what had finally woken her up she hadnt intended to hurt mark shed just been in her own funk thinking somehow it would end it was her problem and a good dooher all the way she would suffer it in silence what she hadnt counted on was the longterm effect that her depression had on mark he had withdrawn and she didnt know if she could get him back shed decided she had to get over it had finally gone to her doctor and hed prescribed the antidepressant nardil and it had worked the only drawback was that she couldnt drink while taking the drug which meant no more cocktails with mark when he came home after a hard day no more sharing his passion hers too for wine with dinner no more getting a little silly and loose and rubbing up against him she might have told him about the prescription but she was afraid of his reaction that his opinion of her would sink even lower doohers didnt need to take antidepressants they willed their weaknesses away so she told him instead that shed reached the decision that her depression was a result of her drinking too much and she was going to stop cold turkey that was the kind of decision a dooher would make an act of will to better yourself mark had to respect that even if he didnt like it it was far better she reasoned to give up drinking and treat her husband civilly than it was to have him consider her weak hooked perhaps forever on an antidepressant but it wasnt working mark was gone and she wasnt sure he was going to come back and it was all her fault chapter six joe avery wasnt malicious or abusive christina didnt want to be overcritical he had a lot of fine qualities but he was driving her nuts joe would go into little routines with mindnumbing regularity to illustrate how in spite of being a lawyer he was actually a nice guy not really a typea kind of uptight dweeb fly fishing for example how he was catchandrelease all the way used only barbless hooks that way those little fishies didnt feel a thing probably enjoyed the exercise there on the end of his twopound test keep their hdls up or the volunteer work with the sierra club see even though he made money and he wasnt ashamed of that nosiree he was sensitive to the environment christina did volunteer work herself so she could back him up here it was important to have a broad spectrum of interests and involvements you didnt want to lose sight of the big picture which was a quality life another of his big phrases quality life also he had the habit of saying look at the facts followed by thats very interesting both of which set christinas teeth on edge when shed first started seeing joe shed been attracted by the sense of sweetness he projected it had been nearly three years since her professor and joe had just happened hed been the ta in her contracts course after a few classes some of the students started hanging around together afterward going out for pizza talking the everfascinating law talk and then one night everyone else went home early she and joe had closed the place in the course of the night leaving contracts behind them discovering a mutual interest in backpacking skiing the great outdoors christina also liked joes looks his full head of black hair over a chiseled face a cleft chin like her fathers joe and some friends were going out in the tahoe wilderness for five days over thanksgiving would christina like to come no push no come on shed liked that after a while she came to recognize that she liked his manner and his personality in a lukewarm way that occasionally got up to a fair impersonation of heat that was all right maybe it would change she would wait she didnt trust too much passion she also desperately wanted to believe that the like could over time transmogrify into love it was why she had after all this time picked a nice person someone whose company was if not thrilling then pleasant livable with joe was now at his desk at four in the afternoon twirling a pen between his fingers glaring at christina struggling to control his anger i dont know why youre so mad she was saying im not mad i just thought wed already talked about this i mean you didnt even mention it last night and now here you are dressed to impress she spread her hands in front of her joe this is a simple business suit yes but every other applicant for summer clerk or anything else sends in a letter and a resume then we review it and decide whether i know all that mark dooher asked me to come down so i thought it would be appropriate to dress nicely which on you doesnt he stopped himself not wanting to say it to admit that whether she liked it or not her beauty was an issue over and over again im maybe im a little disappointed is all the pencil snapped between his hands and he looked down at it in surprise i dont know why youd be disappointed i really dont mark said mark you mean mr dooher her lips tightened in frustration he said to call him mark hes a nice guy joe hes a nice guy avery reeled himself in i lied he said calmly i am really mad he looked over christinas shoulder making triple sure his door was closed all the way mr dooher is not a nice guy lets get that straight look at the facts he is a hatchet man he cut both mccabe and roth out of here like so much driftwood after thirty years and she was shaking her head okay hes tough in business hes the boss right that comes with the territory but he asked me to come down what was i supposed to do i asked you not to come down how about that how about how comfortable i am with you going around feeling out the job situation here behind my back i didnt do that the volume went up i told you i ran into him at church jesus give me a break joe dont be so so so what jumping on her notching it up so goddamn controlling is what avery sat back lowering his voice almost to a whisper trn controlling if i am im not very good at it am i you shouldnt be thats my point this is my life and my career and if the managing partner invites me down for an interview what do you expect me to do say oh im sorry im a modern woman and all but my boyfriend would be so upset im not upset and youre not mad either i suppose though she knew he was furious damn it joe you dont have any right to be mad at me she grabbed up her briefcase where are you going im going to talk to mr dooher she hesitated to mark this got him up hand outstretched nearly knocking his chair over behind him whoa whoa wait a minute christina wait a minute she paused her hand on the doorknob all right one minute what for he crossed around his desk stopping an arms length from her look a long breath getting his own control back look im sorry dont go to mr dooher not like this like what like all mad at you like ill get you in trouble i promise i wont mention you at all christina i dont understand why you dont want me to work here joe i thought youd be happy we could be together see each other during the day go out to lunch i thought it would be fun he moved toward her held her arms gently i know he said i know it would so whats the problem it just surprised me thats all i thought wed decided something else and then just having this sprung on me this wasnt sprung joe i didnt feel like i needed to ask your permission i came down and here i am now telling you im not hiding anything all right he said all right im sorry i dont want to fight about this i dont either okay then he stepped back did you bring your resume with you a cover letter she nodded crossed to his desk put her briefcase on it and snapped it open handing him the envelope she asked him where it went now there was a look in his eyes that she didnt like very much then a halfsmile to back it up he motioned with his head follow me on the floor next to one of the bookcases across the room was a cardboard box that had originally held a case of wine as the associate in charge of the summer clerk program avery received all the hopefuls resumes which a fourperson committee reviewed once every two weeks in the meanwhile avery filed the resumes in the cardboard box which currently was two or three inches deep in them he dropped christinas in on top okay he said youre in the hopper next it goes to the committee he reached out a hand and touched her sleeve after this it gets pretty objective chris well just have to see what happens all that to drop her envelope in a box she had been finessed christina was so angry that she didnt even feel her reaction until shed kissed joe goodbye by the elevator banks and ridden the twentyone floors back down to the lobby that opened on to market street there she stopped still her heart suddenly pounding though it was short notice victor trang had been only too happy to come down for an afternoon meeting with mr dooher who was representing the archdiocese as usual trang wasnt exactly loaded down with litigation and he was heartened by the almost immediate response represented by doohers call also late in the day he welcomed the excuse to leave his oneroom office in the darkened back corner of a turnofthecentury building near the geneva avenue offramp of the junipero serra freeway as bleak a setting as san francisco offered as soon as possible would he like to come downtown to the nodoubt elegantly appointed twentyfirst floor of the one california building and discuss this matter why yes he allowed as to how he could find the time hed only brought the matter up with dooher on the previous thursday and thought that this quick a reply boded well for an equally quick settlement which was why he was in the game mark dooher wasnt drinking anything but his secretary came in and served excellent french roast coffee in an almosttranslucent white china cup with a thin band of gold at the rim trang was sitting before a mahogany coffee table on an empirestyle couch looking across doohers spacious office and out through the floortoceiling windows the office hanging here exposed above the city was intimidating the message it conveyed was clear dooher hadnt gotten here by losing very often the weather had been dismal all day and now wisps of dark clouds blew by in the strong wind alternately obscuring then revealing the view the bay bridge and treasure island freighters and tugs on the water the hills across the bay in the distance were hulking shapes of gunmetal gray trang took a sip of his coffee nodded and smiled at his host he was thirtythree years old hed been a us citizen for fifteen years and was used to caucasian faces but this one was unreadable open honest apparently friendly civilized and well groomed it was the kind of face that scared him the most and the man who owned it sat kittycorner to him hands crossed elbows on his knees leaning slightly forward getting right to the point first the archbishop wanted me to convey to you that there is no intentional policy of toleration toward this kind of behavior in the archdiocese if father slocum had this relationship with mrs diep he did and with her daughter too if as i say if this went on with father slocum it was wrong and we deplore his actions but dooher continued the larger issue the whole question of officially looking the other way thats a very sensitive area trang nodded thats true he said but its equally true that many people have been substantially damaged dooher winced at the legal phrase without damages there is no recovery trang was putting him on notice that he was here to talk turkey some people may have actually suffered damages mr trang for the moment i thought we might stick with mrs diep shes your primary client isnt she trang put his coffee cup down and smiled for the first time he had a sense that this was going to work and if it did he would be on his way only until i file the amended complaint another smile which i believe youve seen yes of course thats what i wanted to see you about needless to say wed prefer you dont make that filing trang barely concealed his excitement the archdiocese was going to offer a settlement he lifted his shoulders an inch naturally if we could reach some understanding here dooher smiled nodded and stood good he said i think we can he walked over to his desk where he picked up a leather folder and opened it i have here a check in the amount of fifteen thousand dollars as a settlement for mrs dieps claims trangs stomach went hollow ten seconds before hed been thinking in the millions and now fifteen thousand its a generous offer considering dooher was saying i know mrs diep feels that shes been wronged but lets not pretend that she wasnt a willing participant in this whole unfortunate scenario this is as far as were going to go i know the archbishop if i were you id take it thats honest advice trang forced himself to remain seated to keep his voice calm we were asking i know i know but look victor do you mind if i call you victor lets not pussyfoot around you and i know what youve been doing youve been out beating the bushes trying to find witnesses or victims or whatever you want to call them to accuse priests of things that didnt happen or are very difficult to prove its going to get ugly and its going to take forever and ps youre going to lose youre going to waste five years of your young life dooher was standing by the windows come here a minute come here obediently trang rose and crossed the room the height was dizzying the floor upon which they stood seemed to end unsupported in space dooher stepped to the window his shoes nearly touching the glass he motioned trang up next to him stood too close to him threateningly close dooher picked up the thread of the discussion you know not a day goes by that i dont stand here looking down over the city reflecting on the frivolity of our fellow men all these buildings all this scrambling activity he leaned right into the window all that humanity down on the street tiny and busy as ants doing so much that is frivolous you know what im saying you are warning me about the dangers of bringing a frivolous lawsuit a beam lit doohers face thats exactly right victor thats what im doing because i must tell you this may be old news to you that the courts are overworked as it is and extremely sensitive to frivolous lawsuits extremely sensitive they smell frivolous and you got fines and even suspensions like you wouldnt believe bad stuff very bad especially for sole practitioners such as yourself courts have been known to put em right out of business trang straightened himself moved away from the windows this lawsuit isnt frivolous mrs dieps may have some merit we agree hence the fifteen thousand look dooher laid a hand on his shoulder seeming to push him out over the city i was going to play hardball with you victor and not make any offer but when i told jim flaherty the archbishop that you would be fined and have to pay our fees and possibly be suspended from the bar and so on well he insisted i convey to you this warning and offer the really generous settlement myself i hate to give away strategy but his excellency doesnt want you to suffer and if you go ahead with this lawsuit youre going to thats a bald enough threat mr dooher not at all its friendly advice here lets sit back down dooher was shepherding him back toward the couch over the years weve had hundreds of cases with litigants who viewed the church as deep pockets some kids skateboarding on the steps of one of our buildings and breaks his leg dad hits us for liability okay we settle sometimes but some greedy people have attorneys who dont stop there they want negligence due to faulty maintenance punitive damages that kind of thing these cases always lose dooher picked up the check from the coffee table and dropped it in trangs lap you know why they lose and you know why your amended complaint will lose because if you ask for three million dollars you enter the realm of bullshit and bullshit walks in this town victor ive seen it happen a hundred times whereas there on your lap is fifteen thousand real dollars you take a third right five grand for your trouble ten for mrs diep and you get to spend your next five years a lot more profitably trang felt as though he would be sick what dooher was saying just couldn t be true this case had to be a winner it was the best idea trang had ever had if this one couldnt make him some money he wasnt going to survive in the law his mouth was sandpaper looking down he saw his coffee cup and grabbed for it cold he swallowed nearly gagging trying to think of some response i cant take the check without consulting with my client the buzz at the telephone gave him a moments reprieve dooher picked it up nodded said okay let her come on in he shrugged an apology to trang as the door opened and one of those impossible women appeared in the doorway at least trangs height her skin flawless her teeth even one step in she stopped oh im sorry janey said i didnt mean to interrupt dooher was coming forward its all right christina mr trang and i were just about finished he introduced them trang shook her cool and firm hand with his own hot and damp one there was from trangs perspective a long and awkward moment eye contact between the woman and dooher she seemed overly selfconscious that she was interrupting that there was another person in the room it was clear she had expected a personal moment and was somehow disappointed at the same time doohers bravado faltered she was obviously one of his young associates and yet it was clear that he was tonguetied with her no trang thought it was mutual both of them somehow at risk i could step outside he said christina recovered no really its just a short message she was back at dooher i just wanted to tell you that i left my resume with joe as promised good she shrugged joe says from here on its out of his hands she deepened the pitch of her voice put on a stern face after this christina it all gets pretty objective a flash of that connection again between them objective works in your favor christina im glad you let me know well talk later trang thought he caught a note of panic in the question it was nowhere near as casual as it sounded dooher desperately wanted to see her again needed to see her again he could put on any act he wanted in their negotiations but here in this moment trang was certain he glimpsed an underlying vulnerability but she kept it light said sure and apologized to trang again before turning and leaving them when shed gone dooher was lost another instant staring after her then as though surprised to find trang still with him he put on his smile again the animation so mr trang victor you want to use my phone call mrs diep now feel free but the womans entrance had ruined doohers rhythm he wasnt the same power broker hed been suddenly the pushing to settle right now seemed overdone it gave trang some hope dooher wasnt as tough as the game he was playing he could be beaten and certainly trang would never know if he didnt play it out at least a little further i think mrs diep and i should confer in person dooher shrugged no show of disappointment he was back in his persona well thats your decision the check will be here until noon tomorrow after that the offer is rescinded you understand that trang was standing yes i do and thank you for the warning ill consider it very strongly a dim shadow fell across sergeant glitskys desk and he lifted his eyes from the report he was pretending to read a woman stood backlit from the fluorescents overhead wearily he pushed his chair back glanced up at the clock on the wall five to five and heres a random witness come to the hall his lucky day help you he asked i might have remembered something glitsky had no idea who she was he stood up im sorry you are she put her hand out christina cairera tania willows we met this morning at the rape crisis center glitsky narrowed his eyes it was possible he supposed he really wasnt noticing women these days the woman this morning wore jeans and a wet jacket and had soaking hair hanging down in front of her face but he still didnt think he could have picked this woman out of a lineup as the person hed interviewed in the morning he ran a hand across his forehead assayed a broken smile keen eye for detail its what makes a good cop he sat back down motioned she do the same on the wooden chair by his desk so what did you remember im not sure its anything i was downtown applying for a job i thought it would be okay if i stopped in without an appointment its fine glitsky said then repeated what did you remember he has a tattoo in the distant future glitsky thought these days would be remembered as the age of bodily mutilation everybody had a tattoo or a nipple ring or at least something metal pushed through some erectile tissue somewhere but unless tania willowss rapistkiller had a tattoo of his full name with middle initial it probably wasnt going to be distinctive enough to help glitsky identify him but the woman christina was going on i dont know why i didnt think of it this morning when we were talking she touched her head it just wasnt here there were a lot of other things going on and then i was thinking about tania what had happened waiting for the bus and i saw this guy in an ad with a tattoo okay she paused a minute swallowed it was on his penis glitsky pulled himself back up to the desk sat up straighten okay this might be something on his penis she nodded he asked her if she wanted to see his tattoo and she said sure thinking it was i mean you know not there she never thought that glitsky broke a rare smile the old come up and see my etchings trick updated for the romantic nineties did tania happen to notice what it said christina shook her head no im sure she didnt she would have she trailed off but the pretty head kept shaking looking down embarrassed glitsky surmised by the topic her eyes came up to his and he saw that in fact she was trying to control herself her laughter he knew exactly what she was thinking not wendy then its not funny she said i dont mean to laugh no it wasnt wendy i dont think the wendy joke when the man got an erection the tattoo read welcome to jamaica have a nice day suddenly glitsky whose professional life was a litany of violent deaths who hadnt slept more than four hours any night in the past month who had little money three young children and whose thirtynineyearold wife was dying of cancer suddenly something broke in him as it had done in christina that morning and he couldnt stop himself from laughing out loud the chief of homicide lieutenant frank batiste had come out of his cubicle to see if anything was wrong glitsky hadnt laughed here in the homicide detail in his memory maybe nowhere else either you okay abe glitsky had it back under control he raised a hand to batiste looked over at christina that never happens to me im very sorry his eyes glistened with tears the fit had gone on for nearly half a minute its okay christina had lost it for a second or two herself its supposed to be good for you glitsky wiped his eyes took in a breath sighed whew batiste went back inside his office sorry anyway he repeated then unexpected i dont know what im doing here what do you mean i dont recognize you four hours after our interview i crack up over some rapists tattoo i ought to take a leave come back when im worth something she didnt know how to respond to such a personal exposure but felt she should say something you said your wife was sick maybe your brain is concentrating on her truly sobered now glitsky reached for the willows file that could be it he said maybe you should call her see if shes feeling better he waited deciding whether he should say it denial didnt seem to help so maybe admission once in a while wouldnt hurt shes not going to get better he said she has cancer christina sat back oh im so sorry he waved it off opened the file stared at it for a few seconds was there anything else you remembered chapter seven outside doohers windows the city lights glowed up through the clouds he sat in his darkened office elbows on the arms of his chair his fingers templed at his lips in the hallways he could hear the occasional voice all of the associates at mccabe roth worked late dooher ran a tight ship his crew the young men and women who hoped after seven years to make partner and thus in theory secure their financial future were expected to bill forty hours a week fiftytwo weeks a year this left them no time during the regular to workday to do administrative work answer their mail talk to husbands wives significant others eat take breaks or vacations for that matter go to the bathroom small details like that to bill eight hours the associates had to work at least ten and more likely twelve hours every day if they wanted their twoweek vacation on top of that they could count on working at least ten weekends a year so at this time every day the firm hummed along mark dooher who had overseen the downsizing and belttightening that had made the place profitable again felt a profound satisfaction in what hed wrought people werent necessarily happy but they put out some serious work for which he reminded himself they were handsomely rewarded and nobody had ever said a law firm was in business to make its members happy he rose and walked around his desk stopping at the edge of the windows again to look out now with the clouds there was no view merely a sensation of floating shed left her resume telling him it was his move joe avery was at his desk plugging away dooher knocked quietly at his office door and avery looked up in surprise two visits from the managing partner in two weeks unheard of still at it dooher asked i thought after last night youd call it early avery struggled for the proper tone that was a good party sir i meant to come up and thank you earlier but this baker matter dooher waved him down shut the kid up im sure its in good hands joe i came down to pick up the summer apps file a worried look crossed averys face its not i mean is there some problem not at all not at all stepping into the office he closed the door behind him were handing off your summer clerk duties to another associate joe i think youre going to find yourself with more meaningful work sir dooher cut off the expected barrage of questions raising his hand again ive said more than i should joe maybe i shouldnt have mentioned anything but you might as well know the summer clerks are going to have to get by without your involvement there are bigger items on your agenda and more than that i really cant say in another minute he had the wine box full of resumes under his arm on his cellphone in the car driving home he left a message christina this is mark dooher just wanted to thank you for keeping me in the loop on your application im proud of you you made the right decision if you need to talk to me anytime the number here in my car is he left his home number as well christina didnt hear doohers message shed talked to her parents in ojai when shed finally gotten home from her meeting with glitsky and then decided that her day which had begun with ashes at was over she was plain done in if the phone rang at this time of night it would just be joe anyway and she really didnt feel like talking to him so with the sound turned down on her machine she was snuggled under her comforter in bed and beginning to doze the doorbell rang and she heard joes voice christina then a soft knock christina you there she knew she could just lie there and pretend she was asleep but she wasnt able to do it exhausted and angry she grabbed her bathrobe wrapping it around her one second unhooking the chain she opened the door youre in bed already no actually im standing here in the doorway you got a problem with that no i just thought we might whats the matter oh nothing not a thing she whirled around crossed the front room snapped on the floorlamp and plopped herself down on the sofa you coming in or not he closed the door after him why are you so mad she pulled her robe close around her glaring up at him see if maybe you can guess he spread his arms all innocence chris we had a misunderstanding thats all your resumes on file now file thats good it really is thats a fact its on mark doohers desk at this instant as we speak in fact in fact she repeated he went on oblivious he picked them all up tonight theyre giving the summer hires to somebody else why because im moving up he ventured a step closer come on chris dont be mad at me not tonight tonight we should celebrate i dont want to celebrate i dont even know what wed be celebrating i dont even know if there should be a we anymore i really dont chris he sat on the far end of the couch i mean it joe okay youre moving up maybe and im glad for you but where are we going are we getting engaged are we getting married i mean what is all this i dont get to apply to your firm because we might be an item someday we are no were not she held out her left hand you see a ring there i dont were still trying to decide joe arent we were still looking at the facts he went silent how am i supposed to respond to that chris you know its no youre just getting to where you think that after all the time youve put in on our relationship it would be nice if it worked out after all she swiped at the angry tears that had broken but the truth is that you dont like how i act how i am you certainly dont want me working around you thats obvious but i do which is why you didnt want me to apply thats not true you know theres a rule about stop lying to me thats not it and you know it we are in fact not actually engaged you realize that so theres no reason but we were going to be she laughed heres how that happens joe listen up careful now one person asks and the other says yes not too difficult so how about it do you want to marry me chris you know goddamn it joe its a yes or no question but it isnt you keep saying you dont want kids ever and i dont think suddenly she bolted upright on the sofa kicking out at him get out of here i mean it get the hell out of here the lifebuoy in santa barbara bay had a deeptoned bell and it didnt seem to be far off although the fog was so heavy she couldnt see it she was trying to save her baby from drowning and she couldnt see it either didnt even remember if it was a boy or girl though of course she knew it just wasnt in her consciousness at that exact moment the tolling of the lifebuoy wouldnt stop though it was pulling her forward toward it through the water which seemed to be thickening as she moved there was the baby so close just out of her reach disappearing into the brine wait wait dont sitting up now in a sweat her eyes opened on the clock next to her bed the tolling continued her doorbell she tossed off the covers and pulled her robe around herself again who is it its me joe still groggy too tired for any more anger she sighed flicked on the overhead and opened the door leaving the chain in place hangdog he stood there his hair damp as the coat of the suit he wore hands at his sides hed been out walking around for a while perhaps since hed left earlier im a total jerk he said thats a good start im sorry she stood looking at him through the crack in the door finally she closed it undid the chain and pulled it open he came forward into her wet and smelling of wool she leaned into him gradually bringing her arms up to encircle him they remained that way a long moment before joe let go of her backed up a step and theatrically went down on one knee joe no this isnt a joke i want to know if you want to marry me hypothetically or what she didnt mean it to come out so harshly but this hadnt exactly been the way shed dreamed it if in fact she ever had dreamed it about joe avery he wasnt going to be sidetracked by semantics no not hypothetically if i asked it wrong im sorry im talking real life here will you marry me christina his hand grasped at the fall of her robe as his desperate eyes came up to her will you please say youll marry me i dont think i could live without you it surprised her that it was not at all pathetic as it might have been hed finally woken up realizing he was going to lose her she saw it in his face he thought at this moment that he loved her maybe she could work on that make it last it struck her that this was the best she was going to do and it wasnt that bad not really at last she nodded yes she whispered okay she reached down and pulled his head close up against her his arms came around her clutched her to him chapter eight on the morning of st patricks day mark dooher stood at the door to wess apartment and shook his head in disbelief how do you live like this farrell surveyed his living room which he persisted in calling his salon it looked about how it always had since hed moved in half a year ago with the books and old newspapers piled on the floor the television astride the folding chair the forlorn futon in its unfinished oak frame well all right this morning there were a few additions to which the fastidious such as dooher here might object his boxer bart had spent a few delirious moments savoring the aromas of one of the used bath towels and had strewn its remains across the rug and last night wes had ordered chinese food and hadnt quite gotten around to putting away all the little cartons and come to think of it there was the pizza delivery container from two three nights ago on the brick and board bookcase the paper plate on which wes had served himself the reheated spaghetti hed had for breakfast decorated the floor next to the futon near his coffee mug and of course there was bart himself sixtyfive pounds of salivating dog lending a certain aroma to the digs sprawling over half of the futon chewing a nylon bone hey do i make fun of your house when i come over im not making fun i am truly appalled farrell gave the place another onceover i think its homey its got that livedin feel realtors actually pay people to fix their houses up like this dooher was crossing the darkened yellow rug negotiating some ambiguous stains im getting some coffee so mr dooher tell me again how you found all this out about divorce one of which you are not getting they were in the kitchen drinking their coffee by the window that looked out over the earlymorning traffic on junipero serra boulevard the old metallegged table was pocked with cigarette burns at the edges of the formica bart had come in to join them settled on the floor under wess feet gabe stockman who is who is the official attorney for the archdiocese and this just came up in conversation more or less actually we were on the golf course last week and he started talking about annulment in the church maybe i could get an annulment wes said is there alimony with annulment but why do you care about annulment when last we spoke you and sheila were in a state of bliss we are thats not what lydia says dooher had his mug nearly to his mouth when his hand stopped with it turning it around slowly lydia we still do speak you know mostly shes digging to find out the secret location where ive squirreled away my last two coins so that she can take them to rub together but occasionally she does mention something human and she told me that sheila thinks the two of you are in trouble that you in fact might be nearly suicidal which if that were the case would make me sad farrell put aside the wiseguy pose rested his own mug on the table his hands encircling it this was his best friend and lydias information had worried him it was why hed asked dooher over this morning to pick him up so they could drive downtown together for a game of squash and get a chance to talk he wanted to find out if lydias information were true and if so if there was anything he could do to help are you all right i cant say im in a state of bliss but im fine which is why youre getting all the facts on annulment i dont want an annulment i dont want a divorce and im not suicidal he pointed a finger annulment came up and i thought since you and lydia i thought youd be fascinated i thought maybe it could help you somehow how well the short answer is it cant great that is fascinating dooher was smiling nevertheless i thought there might be something in it for you so since stockman brought it up i asked but the bad news is that theres no annulment without a civil divorce which of course puts you back where you are thats okay bart and i are happy here starving and all but farrell the lawyer couldnt let it go even if it didnt affect him directly i thought the only way you could get an annulment was if you never consummated the marriage and somehow the existence of my children would cost me credibility there the other way to get an annulment is if one of the spouses isnt psychologically capable of making a real commitment farrell sat back in his chair his hands outstretched well there you are you have just described my soontobeexwife psychologically possibly pathologically incapable of commitment thats her all over wes you were married for twentyseven years twentynine actually but however many thats going to count as a commitment a mere twentynine years where i come from thats barely going steady my parents were together fiftysix years now thats a commitment its beautiful dooher said but twentynine years is going to count damn they had their three games of squash dooher won two letting wes take the second before creaming him in the third when theyd been younger both had been roughly equal as athletes they had in fact remained a doubleplay threat through high school but in the past few years and especially in the six months since farrell had been living alone wes had put on about ten pounds and no surprise it slowed him down they walked together down to the hall of justice where wes was having a meeting with art drysdale the chief assistant district attorney about a client of his levon copes whod been charged in a rapemurder farrell had originally thought the case had a chance to go to trial and since the defendant was a middleaged white guy who owned an apartment building he had money to pay his lawyer the initial retainer had been the check had cleared and wes had hoped if he played it right that the trial could carry him financially for a couple of years even with lydia chipping away at whatever she could since his clients arrest though hed read the discovery the prosecutions evidence and concluded that there must have been some mistake there wasnt nearly enough in his opinion to go to trial at all much less get a conviction so wes was going to try to talk drysdale into dropping the charges altogether it would be extremely unusual in a case like this but he thought possible his success would be the best possible news for his client if not financially for wes but he had no choice he was a lawyer if he could get his client off he had to do it dooher had listened sympathetically to all of this then left farrell at the hall of justice now he was walking alone uptown the ten or so blocks to his office the weather continued damnably irish the banshee was howling off the bay only a few blocks to the east the cloud cover occasionally dipped low enough to become fog and the soft drizzle ate into his bones dooher was wearing a light business suit and no overcoat but he didnt feel the cold for the first time since shed left her resume he was seeing christina again in fifteen minutes the engagement ring infuriated him the fucking chintzy little fifteenhundreddollar quartercarat trinket he wanted to rip it off her finger stomp it under his foot slap her silly for accepting the stupid thing but he wasnt going to do that he was going to smile and say its really nice christina im happy for both of you congratulations they were in a cafeteria down market street from mccabe roth shed left a message asking to meet him and for her own reasons didnt want it to be in the office she thought it might be awkward she seemed embarrassed at the explanation her head tilted to one side not meeting his gaze i just thought that after our talk after everything you did for me i didnt do anything well i certainly wouldnt have applied without you and now with me and joe she twisted at the ring gave dooher a hopeful look anyway now that we are engaged there wouldnt be much point in going on with the application process and i thought it would only be fair to come and tell you in person dooher fiddled with his own coffee cup you know christina not to get too technical but the rule regarding personal relationships isnt exactly written in stone its devised more to discourage the associates weve had two or three couples in the past hed fired them but he left that unsaid forcing his easy smile though his stomach churned he risked reaching over and touching her hand lightly but again im giving away the house secrets her remarkable green eyes sparkled briefly theyre safe with me ill take them to my grave its the only reason i tell you and i appreciate it their eyes met and held for an instant then christina shrugged and the smile faded the point is he persisted that if its not a problem for you and joe personally i dont think it would stand in the way of you coming aboard if thats still what youd like to do not only didnt he think it he was the managing partner and it was a certainty hed see to it but he was tiptoeing here afraid to push too hard and scare her away i dont know she said what dont you know just twisting the ring round and round just if id want to start with the rules being bent id want to be like everybody else doohers chuckle was real believe me once the work starts getting given out youll feel just like one of the gang do you have any other offers yet no well im just saying i wouldnt withdraw yet on the theory that its always a good idea to keep your options open until they get closed for you i know that in general but a silence then her eyes lit again a feeble flame damn you mark the face lighting now this was supposed to be easy he sat back in his chair im trying to make it easy shaking her head no i mean just letting this whole thing go but then here you are mr reasonable im not trying to stop you from letting it go if thats what you want i just want you to be dealing from the facts she seemed to jump in her chair ahh dont say that word what word facts god spare me from the facts a little came out about joe and dooher told her lightly shed better get used to it if she was going to marry him whens the happy day by the way she shook her head not exactly the picture of hopeful expectation its not final yet we thought we ought to wait about a year dooher let out the breath he realized hed been suppressing since hed first seen the ring a year plenty of time the world could change in a year on the third floor of the hall of justice a grayblue block of concrete and glass at th and bryant chief assistant district attorney art drysdale was having a discussion with an assistant district attorney named amanda jenkins and sergeant abe glitsky regarding a murder case people v levon copes copes had a tattoo which did not as it turned out read wendy but more prosaically levon unfortunately for the cause of justice levons arrest had come about after glitsky had interviewed several residents of the building he owned and lived in and where tania willows his victim had resided as well he learned that levons tattoo was no secret copes talked about it all the time so glitsky had a pretty good idea of the identity of tanias killer from the beginning of his investigation finding other damning evidence hadnt been too hard fibers in tanias bed that matched with clothes in copess closet the same type of rope that had strangled tania was in the buildings basement to which copes had the only key his hairs were in her bed so glitsky had gone to the das office with his evidence normally art drysdale would have reviewed this and assigned a prosecutor but drysdale had been on vacation which left les mccann to handle administrative matters mccann a retiredonduty drunk with seniority had assigned the case to amanda jenkins who was on record as saying that sex criminals were worse than murderers in the hall it was common currency that she was perhaps not the soul of objectivity when it came to analyzing evidence in cases like copes she had reviewed the file shed had a talk with abe glitsky he told her about the tattoo which had clinched the fact of copess guilt for her armed with that knowledge she had gotten les mccanns approval to go to the grand jury and seek an indictment and copes had been arrested this morning though art drysdale home from vacation got a call from wes farrell who inquired if drysdale had taken vast quantities of mindaltering drugs while hed been away because based on the discovery farrell had seen there wasnt enough in the way of evidence to support a murder charge on levon copes what farrell wondered was going on this was the question drysdale now put to jenkins her short darkgreen skirt rode high over legs that while heavy possessed some indefinable quality that tended to stop male conversation when she sat and crossed them they were uncrossed now her feet flat on the floor hands clasped tightly on her lap as she was explaining to her boss all about the tattoo and her witnesses and so on okay but so what drysdale asked feet up on his desk effortlessly juggling three baseballs as he often did he appeared calm though glitsky knew him better and wasnt fooled i cant believe the grand jury indicted on this nonsense and im doubly disappointed in you amanda he stopped juggling long enough to point a finger for getting conned into this glitsky in a flight jacket and dark blue pants leaned forward in his chair his eyes flicked to jenkins came back to drysdale i didnt con anybody sir drysdale palmed the balls in one hand and leaned over his desk he knew all about glitskys home situation was inclined to be sensitive on a personal level but this was business and glitsky was usually one of the cops that the das office could count on so he had a gentle tone figure of speech abe how bout this art i didnt get conned either jenkins demeanor was severe as a sandstorm abe didnt get around to the duct tape silver duct tape had been used to bind tania willowss hands to the beds brass railings and on the inside sticky part of one of the strips of tape glitsky had found a fingerprint that belonged to levon copes drysdale sat back i know about the duct tape but again so what so that proves levon copes did it and how exactly does it do that jenkins held her lips in a tight line furious at this inquisition she held her voice in a monotone copes pulls the tape she was pantomiming his actions and his fingerprint stays on the inside this means not only was he in the womans room but he was in it when the tape got unwound which was when she was tied up drysdale nodded i was afraid that was the answer glitsky spoke again again wearily its a good answer art in fact its the right answer but drysdale wasnt hearing it no sorry guys but how about if our landlord copes came in to fix some pipes started undoing this magical tape and left his fingerprint on it then he simply forgot to take the tape with him when he left the next day our perp comes in to do what he did and there is the convenient tape why couldnt it have happened that way god it got tiring glitsky was thinking there was always some other way it could have happened he knew drysdale was playing the devils advocate none of them doubted that copes had left an incriminating fingerprint on the inside of the duct tape but the point that wasnt good enough drysdale sat back pondering his options the tattoo is what screwed this all up glitsky from a deep well the tattoo means he did it too which is where you guys went wrong you dont start out knowing that he held up a hand hey i believe with all my heart that levon copes is our man i dont see how in the hell were going to prove it though suddenly glitsky let out a heavy sigh and stood up i thought the duct tape was pretty good you titans let me know how it all comes out you need me at the trial if it gets to trial im there the door closed silently behind him as he left the office his coworkers sat stunned in the ensuing vacuum finally drysdale blew a little gust of air through puffed cheeks abes having a hard time the duct tape is pretty good you know jenkins responded drysdale started juggling again youre dreaming he said glitsky had to get out of the hall out on to the street he checked in at homicide no messages then walked the windblown back stairway out to the city lot behind the building he always had half a dozen witnesses on other cases he could interview it was the constant in the job so he was driving west through the fog toward his home vaguely and the bush street projects where he didnt know what bothered him the most that hed almost lost his temper in the office or that drysdale had been right you really didnt want to start with a certainty about whod committed what crime if you did as abe had done in this case there was a temptation to lose sight of the evidentiary chain that sense of linkbylink accretion which eventually became the working blueprint that a prosecutor would use to build a case that would convince a jury it was by necessity a slow and tedious process where you questioned yourself your own motives your preconceptions your work habits every little thing you did every step of the way and it was best if the things you discovered led you to the only possible correct answer he slammed his hand hard against the steering wheel glitsky couldnt say exactly why he stopped by the rape crisis center there really was no official reason maybe it was a human one maybe he needed to talk to somebody he told himself he was fostering good community relations something the men in blue were always encouraged to pursue ms carerra said she would like to be kept up on the progress of things shes not here right now sam duncan replied but if its not a secret i wouldnt mind hearing about it the progress i mean would you like to sit down he took the folding chair in front of her desk turned it around and straddled it backward it doesnt look very good sams shoulders sagged an inch why doesnt this come as a shock whats the problem this time youve been through this before it was not quite a laugh ive been around rape and the law for about ten years does that answer your question she sighed so another creeps gonna walk glitsky temporized maybe not they might still go ahead the prosecutor wants to put mr copes away the grand jury did indict im going to keep looking he paused i think the problem was that i did my job backwards she cocked an eye at him thats funny i thought i just heard a cop admit he might have made a mistake what do you mean you went backwards he explained it all to her christina and the tattoo the evidence that really wasnt admissible finally he wound down so this copes theres no doubt he did it not to me but thats never the point as you probably know the tattoo cant be mentioned its hearsay this sucks and of course hes got a milliondollar lawyer whos going to make a million more hes got wes farrell hes good enough but she interrupted him i dont understand these defense lawyers im serious i dont understand how any human being can take a case like this i mean this man farrell hes got to know his client did it raped and killed this poor woman doesnt he he knows about the tattoo all of that sure and he still best defense the law allows its what makes our country great glitsky shrugged maybe he needs the money maybe its just a job murder cases pay but if he knows i mean if you really truly know for sure how can you its amazing isnt it it blows my mind sergeant it truly does whistling wes farrell took off his white shirt and tie in the cramped unisex bathroom down the hall from his law office farrell often thought he was too easily amused by stupid things such as the tshirt he had been wearing under his suit all day green with gold lettering that read take me drunk im home okay so he was getting divorced his kids didnt see him much his career generally sucked but his life wasnt all bad he had his health and that was number one right give or take a few pounds he still had his body lots of acquaintances and at least one true and great friend mark dooher how many people could say that much plus attitude he had attitude in spades and thats what pulled him through in the hereandnow that positive attitude the vision that daytoday life itself was okay even fun and now thank god he had levon copes he loved levoncopes levon was a lankhaired slackjawed sallowfleshed hollowchested lowlife weakwilled inbred and braindead sociopath for sure but all together now he said aloud into the mirror doesnt mean he isnt a nice person except that levon really wasnt a nice person but wes farrell was going to forgive him for that he wasnt going to forget about the heinous crime hed undoubtedly committed but he had to admire one thing about mr copes the man had a serious bank account art drysdale had not given up on the case at least not yet hed told farrell this morning that the district attorneys office was planning a vigorous prosecution as it did with all indictments unless of course farrell wanted to cop a plea no farrell had responded he would go to trial on this one thanks because this one was a winner farrell knew juries and he knew san francisco and you needed a lot more than they had on levon copes to convict anybody of murder here so he might be going to trial to a trial that he could win and a drawnout murder trial meant that he was going to wind up billing his client a minimum of before it was all over and his client would pay it gladly it was the price of freedom god he loved levon so now tonight wes was going to celebrate maybe even get himself some horizontal female companionship for the first time since his separation there was no denying it he felt some spark tonight some sense of life he wasnt sure where it had come from but he wasnt going to jinx it by worrying it to death the rides here boys get on it or get out of the way he was going to start at ghirardelli square for the view to remind himself of where he lived of why san francisco was the greatest city in the western world heading downtown hed hit lefty odouls put himself on the outside of some corned beef then perhaps a stop by lou the greeks the eclectic subterranean barrestaurant that served the hall of justice community the watering hole for the criminal legal community of which he was thanks to levon copes a member in good standing what a city on this night the possibilities were endless flush as he was out of levons retainer he had kept in cash out of his checking account before lydia could even see it to grab he was going to cab it everywhere he went barhopping the abbey tavern the little shamrock by hed had himself half a yard of ale some outstanding megacholesterol food three extended discussions with interesting people about subjects which had been totally engrossing even if now somewhat vague in his memory his cabbie ahmal was turning into his best friend ahmal had already cleared he had parked the cab just around the corner from the little shamrock and would wait all night for farrells return getting inside the door through the crush of people was a bit of a trial but wes persevered he knew the place well it was on his way home small well kept without discernible ferns of any kind it was the oldest bar in the city established in there was often a crowd up front or at the bar but he knew that in the back there was a mellower area furnished with rugs and couches and easy chairs just like a living room though not just likeus living room so he moved steadily in no hurry toward the back they had waitresses working which was unusual on a weekday normally you ordered at the bar and he had a pint of bass in his hand before hed gone twenty steps the jukebox didnt drown out the people here and especially tonight it didnt the place was bedlam only now could he make out what a fool believes over the crowd noise he thought it was fitting and there she was through the jockeying mass of humanity he saw her sitting on the arm of one of the couches leaning forward on her arms sensual curves everywhere and one leg curled under her she was a grownup which was about as close as he could guess for her age beyond that it didnt matter something about her was knocking him out he looked away took another sip of beer checked for signs of how drunk he was and decided not very then looked back at her yep she still looked good mediumlength dark hair with red highlights great skin her face was alive that was what it was her smile lit up all around her he got himself a little closer she was in conversation with a couple on the couch next to her and suddenly the woman who was half of the couple got up it was magic and went into the adjacent bathroom wes moseyed on over she slid off the arm of the couch into the empty place next to the other half of the couple a goodlooking man put an arm around him uh oh maybe not then she looked right at wes i love your shirt she said then this is my oldest brother larry he was fun when he was younger she patted the arm of the couch and wes moved up a step and sat where shed been wes he said sticking out his hand which she took and shook over her head he asked how you doin larry larrys loaded sallys taking him home sallys his wife she just went to the bathroom im sam im staying as it turned out she didnt stay all that long sam had apparently been waiting at the shamrock for someone who looked just like wes to walk through the door and save her from a night of aimless drinking so another beer later for each of them they were arminarm outside and there was ahmal parked on th where wes had left him this made an impression on sam he paid ahmal fifty more at her place a downstairs flat on upper ashbury and while sam was getting out told his good buddy the cab driver to wait an hour more and if wes didnt come back out he could take off and thanks for the memories the door closed behind them on a cosy space a large open room with a low ceiling oldfashioned brick walls builtin and seemingly organized bookshelves a woodburning stove you have a dog he said a cocker spaniel was waking up stretching in a padded basket next to the stove youre not allergic or anything are you as a matter of fact i myself own a dog i knew there was something about you his names bart hes a boxer she leaned over to pet her little darling this is quayle sam said with a y just like dan you know the brains of a cocker spaniel so i thought why not do you want another drink not really would you like to come over here he held out his arms and she gave quayle one last pet hesitated a moment smiled then walked to him she came naked through the door of the bedroom a glass of irish whiskey in each hand the funny thing she said is i dont normally do this there was a blue liquid lava lamp from the s or s next to the bed the windows were horizontal high in the brick wall at groundlevel outdoors wes was under a thick down comforter hands behind his head he reached out for one of the glasses i dont either she handed him his glass and sat on his side of the bed he thought she was as comfortable with her nakedness as it was possible to be and also thought that was as it should be her body was toned and lush nice breasts with tiny pink nipples he rested his hand on her thigh you can tell me the truth she said it wont hurt my feelings i can take it that is the truth i was married for almost thirty years now this you mean this is the first time since you were married that was it am i blowing my cover here as man of the world no im just surprised why it seemed natural enough to me pretty great actually she gave him her smile againthat too me too i mean its supposed to be such a hassle to get it right especially the first time maybe not she put her whiskey glass on the side table and slid in next to him snuggling into his chest after a minute he could feel her begin to laugh whats funny well the name thing he thought a moment your name isnt sam this made her laugh no my names sam im talking last names you are at least wes arent you full disclosure coming up he patted her back reassuringly wes farrell attorney at law at your service she groaned oh youre not a lawyer not really realler than a heart attack were everywhere wes farrell she said quietly i feel like i she stiffened and sat up abruptly what he asked wes farrell au personne which means something in french i think but the good humor seemed to have left her youre wes farrell oh my god i cant believe this this what what are you what am i what are you what am i what come on sam dont dont you dont me she was up now grabbing a robe from a hook behind her on the wall pulling it around her covering up she turned and faced him youre the wes farrell whos defending that scumbag levon copes arent you how do you know dont worry i know him she was fully engaged now slamming her fists against her thighs the bed whatever was handy i knew it i just fucking knew it god my luck i should have known sam dont sam me either walking around in little circles now im sorry but this just isnt going to work i want you to go now would you please just leave just leave but he was already sitting up grabbing his pants from the floor yes just leave please okay okay but i dont know why because i cant believe youd do what youre doing with levon copes thats why trying to get him off i cant believe this is you oh shit its my job he said im a lawyer its what i do that reply stopped her dead suddenly the energy left her she let out a frustrated sigh and whirled around one last time just go all right he had his shoes in his hands his shirt untucked dont worry im gone it had been more than an hour and ahmal had gone too mark and sheila dooher had said no more than a hundred words to each other all night she had made the traditional new england boiled dinner which he normally loved but hed only picked at the food at dinner hed been polite and distracted and then hed excused himself saying he felt like hitting a few balls at the driving range hed been playing more golf lately an excuse to stay away from home longer go out more often hed even asked her if she wanted to accompany him but he really didnt want her to she could tell so she said no now near midnight he was still up reading in the downstairs library a circular room in the turret under her own office when he got home from the driving range hed come in to say good night kissed her like a sister saying he had work to do would she mind if he went to the library and got some reading in some research she couldnt take it anymore she stood in the doorway in her bathrobe hed lit a fire and it crackled faintly he wasnt reading he was sitting in his green leather chair staring at the flames mark yo he looked over at her you all right whats up youre still up the old brain just doesnt seem to want to slow down tonight so i thought id just let it purr awhile she took a tentative step or two into the room whats it thinking about oh just things another step two more then she sat sideways on the ottoman near his feet you can tell me you know whatever it is he took a moment i played squash with wes this morning went over and picked him up at the hovel he calls home you know what he told me that youd told lydia you thought i was suicidal that our marriage was on the rocks he leveled his gaze at her imagine my surprise to get it from wes he was being a good listener leaning forward now holding both her hands he couldnt help but notice the hands they really did age quicker than everything else you couldnt fake hands the hands gave her away he really wished she wouldnt cry but she was not sobbing but quiet tears no looking ahead no laughs i know he said its my fault too i suppose i let your depression get to me i shouldnt have done that i should have said something but you tried and i pushed you away i still should have it wasnt you mark it was wait wait lets stop who it was it doesnt matter who it was were talking about it now well fix it starting now starting today he leaned over and kissed her weve just gotten into some bad habits you feel like a nightcap she hesitated then decided sure id like one one light drink isnt going to hurt me youre right she held on to him i love you mark lets make this work okay he kissed her again it will i promise chapter nine wes farrell exited the crowded elevator into the familiar hallway madness cops das reporters witnesses prospective jurors hangers on it was just after am and the various courtrooms wouldnt be called to order for at least another halfhour farrell knew that a lot of legal business got done here in these last thirty minutes pleas were agreed to witnesses prepped lawyers hired and fired this was also the moment when negotiations about plea bargaining got down to tacks if you were a defense attorney as wes was and you had a losing case you didnt really want to go to trial but your client generally didnt like the prosecutions offer of jailtime only ten years didnt tend to sound like a deal except when you compared it to the twentyfive youd do if you got convicted maybe somebodys mind would change and your client would get off with a fine maybe world peace was just around the corner so you played the game and hung tough for your client bluffing that you really would put the prosecutors office through the time and expense of a jury trial but at some point such as now when you were in the hallway waiting for trial this was when you folded your cards and took the plea but that wasnt farrells intention this morning he wasnt here to run a bluff he was here with the outrageous intention of talking the da into dropping murder charges against levon copes right now or failing that deliver the message that levon was prepared to go to trial of course levon had already pled not guilty at pretrial but that had been more or less pro forma this was different wearing a black silk blouse and one of her trademark miniskirts dark green today amanda jenkins was leaning against the wall enjoying this mornings special entertainment decked out in fezzes and robes a dozen or so representatives of the moslem mosque were protesting the arrest of one of their members for bank robbery and were performing a hucca a ritual dance derived from the old whirling dervishes they were jumping up and down and chanting justus justus several uniformed cops were available to maintain a semblance of order but it probably wasnt going to get out of hand these things happened every week in the hall to farrell it was almost more amazing that no one seemed to think it was that odd he came up to jenkins with a couple of instruments they could take it on the road itd really go better with music dont you think she considered it seriously accordion and tuba alternating bass notes oompa oompa its a good idea they discussed variations on the theme until they located an empty bench far enough away to hear themselves talk and farrell went into his pitch you cant be serious she said when he wrapped it up youre saying you expect us to simply drop this like the hot potato it is i dont really expect it but you dont have a case and your boss seems to know it im sorry he gave you that impression and im sure he would be too i just talked to art this morning before coming down here and he is totally committed to this prosecution this was a lie but amanda delivered it straight murder one she nodded with specials meaning special circumstances in this case murder in the course of a rape the state was going to ask for lwop life in prison without the possibility of parole so why are we having this discussion amanda straightened her skirt pulling it down to within four inches of her knees a move she was unaware of it didnt escape farrells notice however neither did the clearing of her throat the woman was a nervous wreck you called art true but then he called me back said maybe we had something to talk about after all if your best offer is life i think all in all i owe it to my client to try to get a better deal he paused especially since you cant convict him not on the discovery ive seen hes gonna walk amanda and you know it drysdale knows it you guys fucked up we drop the specials you plead murder one straight up twentyfive to life farrell cast his gaze down the hallway up to the ceiling how can i phrase this no chance amanda was trying to get some satisfaction out of this drysdale had told her she was going to have to drop the charges an extraordinary onceinalifetime decision in a rapemurder case this just didnt happen ever except now it was happening and amanda was in the middle of it the only chip the da wanted to play was to use its slight remaining leverage if any to avoid embarrassment in the press jenkins who took this stuff personally was hoping to salvage a little more wes your client killed this woman my client is innocent until you prove hes guilty oh please spare me what do you think really i just said what i think jenkins took in a breath and held it for a long moment murder two she said at last fifteen to life hell be out in twelve farrell crossed his arms gave her a worldly look amanda please what whensthe last time you went to a parole board hearing out walk five people whove read the police report hate your client and figure hes done it before at least one is there from some victims rights group your client comes in says hes sorry hell hes really sorry and they say thanks for your time see you in another five years amanda repeated it still hell be out in twelve on murder two hell be out in twelve weeks if we go to trial i guess well let the jury decide then were not going to simply drop these charges wes and if we go to trial its one with specials thats putting your client at tremendous risk farrell nodded stood up grabbed his briefcase ill discuss it with him see you in ten seconds he held out his hand ill be in touch hed gone about ten steps when the prosecutor called after him wes he stopped and turned he was almost tempted to go back and put an arm around her shoulder tell her everything was going to be all right this was just a job a negotiation nothing to take so seriously a vision of sam from st patricks day when it had been personal to her too what was with all these women amanda jenkinss eyes showed her concern even panic the woman was deeply conflicted but she forced a weak smile nothing she said forget it i had to try art no you didnt amanda farrells going to talk to levon right now this morning levon knows hedid it hes looking at lwop if he doesnt plead weve got some leverage here we dont have the evidence farrell appears to have a pretty good understanding of that hes got to convey our offer to levon if he takes it we win it was worth a try drysdale picked up the telephone on his desk all right you had your try you got farrells number she argued for another five minutes but it did no good so she made the call and told farrell the people were moving to dismiss the charges on levon copes to permit the time for further investigation victor trang made dooher drive half an hour out to balboa street to meet in some dive named minhs decorated mostly in yellowing strips of flypaper which hung from the ceiling dooher hated the smell of the place his vietnam hitch had been the low point of his life and since hed returned he hadnt put much effort into developing any taste for the culture he didnt see trang right away dooher had to walk along a counter and endure the suspicious eyes of the proprietor and of the four other customers who sat hunched over their bowls trang sat in a booth at the back papers scattered around him his calculator on the table so hed look busy there was a cup of tea in front of him and some dirty dishes still on the table pushed to the side he wore the same suit the same skinny tie as the last time theyd met dooher slid in across from him and trang punching the damn little machine held up a finger hed be with mark in just a minute finally a whirr of numbercrunching he looked up there was a smile but it lacked sincerity he began briskly enough ill be filing the amended complaint next monday which gives us a week to reach a settlement agreement if youre still interested if not ill go ahead sooner dooher tried to run his bluff i did tell you that our offer expired the day after we met when i didnt hear from you and yet youre here the archbishop thought it was worth another try trang stared at the ceiling behind dooher at last he put down his pencil brought himself back to the table heres the situation mr dooher first id appreciate it if youd stop insulting me with this talk about the archbishops concern for my wellbeing ive got a lawsuit thats going to do his diocese a lot of harm and incidentally might smear him with the runoff he knows it i know it you know it all right dooher wore his poker face i didnt know you i mean no insult some people hear the bluff and cave early trang seemed to accept that he shuffled some of his papers around appearing to look for something specific finding it he pulled the page toward him and read a moment ive got lets see twelve names here twelve people youre telling me slocum was involved with twelve people trangs selfsatisfied smile remained in place it was getting to dooher ive got twelve people so far who are willing to allege a relationship with a priest in the archdiocese three different parishes its a widespread problem as my amended complaint contends clearly theres a policy of toleration beginning at the very top dooher took the paper and glanced at the list all of these names seem to be asian thats correct most are vietnamese an interesting coincidence trang shrugged these refugees came to this country as displaced people they turned to their spiritual advisers to help them through the many adjustments they had to make and many of these advisers these priests betrayed them took advantage of their weakness and vulnerability he shook his head at the tragic reality dooher had a different interpretation wed depose every one of these women you understand that telling trang what he suspected that the charges were bogus trang had recruited a dozen liars to trade their accusations for a fee some tiny fraction of the settlement he hoped to get but trang had another card theyre not all women another meaningless smile this is san francisco after all so now trang had priests seducing young men as well with flaherty consistently looking the other way and of course thered be depositions my clients would want to reveal the whole truth if only to warn others who might be in their positions he made a little clucking noise this is the kind of story that will be all over the newspapers though of course wed try to contain that this dooher knew was the real issue trang was running a scam pure and simple he was threatening to foment a scandal and what made it viable was that it wasnt all made up undoubtedly mrs diep and perhaps her daughter had been wronged by father slocum perhaps there was another victim maybe two but twelve magically appearing out of the woodwork within the last few weeks dooher didnt think so but what he thought didnt matter much anymore he had to contain this lunatic its what flaherty expected him to do its what he got paid for lets talk about mrs diep for a moment the suit thats already been filed shes asking for but trang was shaking his head interrupting no no mr dooher that is in the past ive uncovered a widespread problem that would frankly benefit from a public forum your archbishop may have meant well but many people have been damaged and i think as we proceed that many other victims will come forward dont you think thats likely its the way these things often go again the smile dooher knew he was right trangs plan was wonderful hed prime the pump with bogus victims then once the issue made the daily news everyone who had ever been kissed by a priest was going to stand up and ask to join the party which is why we would prefer you not to proceed a nod that perhaps trang believed was dignified magnanimous he was going to be a good winner dooher wasnt prepared to be a loser however not to this little upstart gook that wasnt going to happen not now not ever the archdiocese wants to redress the wrongs it may have inadvertently condoned mr trang thats why were talking these people he indicated the list on the table now they may feel betrayed but i dont think theres much of a case that theyve been substantially damaged mrs diep yes her daughter okay were prepared to give mrs diep her fifty thousand with another fifty to be distributed among he paused a look of distaste among your other clients trang sucked on his front teeth if you deduct my fees that really satisfies no one completely thirty thousand among twelve people is an insult for what theyve endured you must know that and mrs diep will still be out nearly twenty thousand in cash plus the interest dooher held up a hand well pay your fees on top this upped his offer to or so this situation was making his stomach churn with rage and impotence nearly three times what trang had been asking only last week and and he was still shaking his head no i dont think that figure addresses the seriousness of these charges mr dooher the sense my clients feel that there should be some punishment so that the archbishop will think twice before allowing these betrayals to occur on his watch a hundred thousand is a mere slap on the wrist hed never feel it swallowing his bile dooher folded his hands in front of him what do you want trang it was a simple question palms up trang came clean the amended complaint asks for three million dooher kept his face impassive this had become personal trang playing him like some fish but he wasnt going to flop for him he waited perhaps i could convince my clients that half of that figure would be a reasonable compensation for their suffering a million five dooher knew that this wasnt close to what hed been authorized to offer and yet if he didnt get to some agreement theyd all have to go to court and the whole thing would become public even if most of trangs clients were invented the fallout would poison flaherty and dooher would have failed in every respect he could not let that happen thats too much he snapped he grabbed the paper again ran his eyes down the list ill tell you what we will do mr trang final offer and subject to a confidentiality agreement no press conferences he was showing his temper and paused a fraction of a second for control this was his last card and he knew hed better play it six hundred thousand dollars trang showed nothing it was as though dooher hadnt said a word he was in the middle of lifting his cup to his lips and there wasnt even a pause he drank put the cup down that is really excellent tea he said then as though it were an afterthought six hundred thousand dollars dooher let him live a minute with the number then he said a lot of money he didnt say and two hundred grand for you you slanteyed little prick which was what he was thinking it is a lot of money trang agreed but it is also a long way from three million or even one five if i may id like to take the offer under advisement speak to my clients of course dooher said except he knew that trang had nobody to discuss anything with he decided he had to raise the stakes but this offer expires at close of business today five oclock trang digested that then began gathering his papers packing them into his briefcase in that case id better be on my way its going to be a busy day the sun had come out for what seemed the first time this year and that springtime sense of hope in the air prompted christina to walk into sams office her boss was sitting in the hard chair tilted back her eyes closed her arms crossed over her chest and her ankles crossed on her desk sensing a presence in the doorway she opened her eyes i hate all men she said well i dont hate my brothers or my father but all the other ones christina leaned against the door smiling how do you feel about volunteer rape counsellors i dont think they should be men sam shook her head im sorry about the other day sergeant glitsky came by here and told me you d come down to his office outside of office hours doing your job she paused im a jerk as a person and a lousy boss arent i which one a nod i deserve that but sam was trying to apologize and christina didnt think it was a moment for sarcasm neither really she said neither a jerk nor a lousy boss you care a lot sam thats all thats a positive thing too much christina shrugged beats the opposite doesnt it im going out to get some coffee you think the office will survive fifteen minutes without us here or should i bring you back something sam considered a moment then brought her feet down off the desk and stood up ill leave a note on the door they waited in line at an espresso place down the street from the center sams general theme on men had narrowed to the specific wes farrell christina was saying where do i know that name hes levon copess attorney no thats not it i didnt know that before you just told me i know that name from somewhere else sam had omitted the details of her interaction with wes farrell leaving it only that theyd met and shed given him a piece of her mind maybe you saw it on one of glitskys reports or something maybe christina ordered a latte her brow still furrowed trying to remember when theyd gotten served they sat at a tiny twoseat table up by the window in the sun they shared the sill with two cats and one of them purred up against christinas arm anyway christina said i didnt think last week was the greatest time to tell you just when you were finally starting to believe that i was a real person who genuinely cares about the people i try to help which i am i know that now i see that well but so now this is a little awkward but i wanted to give you notice that pretty soon im going to have to stop coming into the center doing this a long dead moment because of this tania willows thing no really because in about a month im taking finals then graduating then studying for the bar and working fulltime for a firm downtown which i hear is about a hundred hours a week then taking the bar im not going to have any time sam stirred her coffee stopped her eyes restlessly scanned the street in front of them damn she said finally this always happens i know im sorry its all right i just get so tired of it when it seems you finally get to where you might connect with somebody then they leave i know christina was holding her coffee mug in both hands trying to keep them warm so you didnt convert wes farrell away from defense work sam made a face i was dumb i just got mad at him and it wouldnt have mattered anyway whatever i did copes would just go out and hire another one fucking lawyers oops sorry christina waved it off thats okay im not a lawyer yet and im not going to be that kind of one anyway its funny because he seemed like a nice guy otherwise a great guy really who who are we talking about wes farrell christina looked over her coffee you liked himdidnt you i dont know i might have maybe i would have i dont know call him up say hi hes got to be in the book tell him hes making a mistake with levon copes but that you were too hard on him youd like to buy him a drink sam shook her head i dont think so i dont know if i want to buy him a drink sighing its not that simple but wouldnt it be nice the conference room at mccabe roth was meant to intimidate the dark cherry table was twentyfour feet long and the shine on its surface encouraged neither relaxation nor work it was a table at which to sit and listen and be impressed the subliminal message from such perfection was that to leave so much as a fingerprint upon it was to vandalize a work of art so briefcases stayed on the floor notes were taken on laps coffee cups paperclips drinks food forget it at one end of the room the floortoceiling windows worked their powerview magic while the walls were covered with heavily textured light green cloth wallpaper original oils in heavy frames glowered sconced lighting kicked in when the blackout drapes were drawn after his debacle with trang earlier in the day dooher was primed to win one hed had a bad day all around in fact with the archbishop giving vent to his frustration that even his top offer of had not been immediately accepted dooher still found himself smarting from the carefully phrased reproof its really not like you mark to let a beginner get the upper hand like that in your negotiations there had been nothing he could say and now close of business had come and gone and he hadnt heard back from trang so the archbishops offer was no longer on the table and dooher knew it was all going to get much worse but for now this moment he was going to enjoy himself he sat at the head of the conference table and checked his watch the other eight partners should begin arriving any minute he found himself smiling thinking of david and bathsheba and of bathshebas poor first husband whom david sent off to war promoting him so that he would be at the front of the troops leading the charge against the philistines a hero alas never to return joe you may have heard rumors to the effect that the firm has been considering expanding into new market areas well were all gathered here now to put an end to those rumors theyre absolutely true a polite ripple of masculine chuckle joe avery smiled nervously from his end of the conference table several of the other men looked his way nodding and smiling dooher continued weve reached the decision that the first satellite office should be in los angeles as you know we do a lot of business down there many of the cases youve been working on as a matter of fact weve all been impressed with the hours and effort youve put in over the years here and wed like to reward you now by asking you to put in some more another round of club laughter but seriously and before we get down to the nittygritty of what were expecting down in la all of us wanted to take a minute and say congratulations and i should add im afraid ive hinted at this to you before here dooher included most of the partners around the table in a conspiratorial wink we kind of rushed your partnership through committee a little earlier than you might have expected wed like you to take the helm down in los angeles joe open the office get us up and running and put us on the map down there again an inclusive gesture around the room gentlemen ive seen the future of mccabe roth and its name is joe avery congratulations joe heartfelt applause joe avery stood beaming and basking in his colleagues approval and dooher knew that even if it meant losing christina the fool wouldnt let this job get away chapter ten on the next thursday night dooher suddenly stopped his reading in the library on the lower floor of the turret his eyes raked the shelves quickly all of his senses alert with an overwhelming prescience something was going to happen he could feel it the telephone rang he knew who it was and he trusted these things implicitly besides the timing was about right four days since avery had been promoted he picked it up on the first ring resisting the urge to answer with her name instead he was as he always was mark dooher here he said the library doubled as his private office with a personal phone that he answered in business tones a longish pause then mark hi another breath its christina carrera im sorry to bother you at home christina heartfelt surprise and enthusiasm its no bother i wouldnt have given you my home number if i was going to get mad at you for using it dooher carried the portable phone across the room and quietly pushed the door closed it was a little after pm and sheila was watching television in the kitchen doing the dinner dishes the closed door was a signal that he was working she wouldnt disturb him to what do i owe this pleasure what can i do for you i dont know maybe nothing i feel very awkward about calling you but then again ive been awkward about everything lately as he listened dooher recrossed the room went to his bar and poured a couple of fingers of bourbon neat into a brandy snifter he was nodding fully engaged but i didnt know who else i could talk to i think i need some advice advice is my business and my rates are reasonable well not completely reasonable no one would respect me if they were he could almost see the relief in her face her smile their banter marks light touch put her at ease he was her friend and she was glad he was here for her he heard it in her voice okay she said ill pay good lunch on you then more seriously whats the problem christina the job again this time the silence continued for several seconds he waited really its not so much the job its more personal youre not in legal trouble are you no nothing like that but personal joe shejsaid simply i just dont know what to do he sipped his drink still standing by the wet bar we can talk christina but if its joe maybe this would be better discussed with him thats what im trying to avoid i dont want to always be so negative with him not when hes so happy with everything its the transfer i presume a bitter laugh i almost want to blame you for promoting joe i know its stupid no not that but this move has been in the works a long time certainly before i ever met you this was not strictly true the decision to open an la office had been considered months before but doohers decisions to go ahead with it and then to appoint avery was finalized over the last six weeks or so in administrative matters dooher rode roughshod over his nominal partners he ran his firm his way it was making money and if the partners didnt like his decisions one of them could try to do what he did but without him he and his business would go elsewhere i know i know that she sighed god im such a bitch i havent really noticed that are you being hard on joe not yet i think thats why i needed to call you for my permission for you to be hard on your boyfriend i dont think so he couldnt bring himself to call avery her fiance also he wanted to deliver the subliminal message boyfriends were temporary and insubstantial i dont want to be a nag all the time thats just it im not an unhappy person dont laugh im really not im not laughing but now i cant seem to accept if i talk to joe everything i say lately comes out like im not being supportive of his career i probably shouldnt even be talking to you you can stop saying that christina im glad you called im just not sure what i can do the decisions already been made the drink was kicking in he eased himself down onto a barstool relaxing i guess im not asking you as the managing partner mark and i dont know if im presuming but youve been i feel like you ve been a friend is that all right and i need to have a friend who can talk about this who can understand both sides all right then ill take off my managing partners hat he lowered his voice im touched that you thought of me and i really dont know if i can be of any help but im listening the good husband dooher was finishing a second drink at the table in the kitchen nook confiding to his wife about the call so the poor kids in a bind whats she going to do sheila was drinking her decaf this is the really stunning girl from the party isnt it christina that was her and she called you he pointed a finger broke a sardonic grin actually the truth is she wanted me to leave you for her said she couldnt live another moment without me and i cant say i blame her but i had to tell her i was taken he reached across the table and took his wifes hand happily are you a reassuring squeeze eye contact completely sheila what kind of question is that you know that i know but lately lately we havent exactly been flying okay weve pulled out of dives before were going to do it again he shrugged of course she was devastated but shes young shell get over it probably sheila was shaking her headto think that someone who looks like she does could have problems people have problems she you did we did especially when we were young trying to figure everything out but i never looked like her not like but every bit as good his wife beamed and covered his hand with both of hers youve got a halfhour to cut this flattery out i mean it she let go of his hand picked up her cup and sipped arent you glad were not starting out now you and i i dont know how these kids do it i mean in our day if youd been transferred id have gone with you no questions asked in fact i did go berkeley then waited through vietnam then la then back here i remember and you never complained she couldnt stop smiling at him he was getting back to his old self the little compliments the kindnesses well complained sometimes but never thinking i wouldnt go with you now these girls nowadays i mean women of course theyre women i mean she must be in her midtwenties if shes getting out of law school we had all our kids by that age do you realize that we were unusually wise and mature still are but now look at what this girl is dealing with and all because she wants her precious career and whats a career who wants to have to work your whole life she wants to be able towork sheila theres a difference maybe shell need to its hard to say nowadays its a different world i think its a damn shame id tell her to just go with her man and the rest will take care of itself doohers face broke into a conspiratorial smile i dont think i could put it exactly like that shed think i was the last of the reactionary pigs well maybe not the last but you wouldnt be wrong maybe not but im afraid in todays social environment its one of lifes little truths that shes going to have to discover for herself so whats she going to do what did you advise her i was punctiliously pc told her if it were me id stay here and do a great job this summer study for the bar and pass it be supportive of what joe was doing if theyre in love itll work out eventually maybe sooner lots of people get separated by jobs by life the ones that are meant to make it make it it doesnt have to be a crisis she took his hand again you know mark sometimes i forget what a romantic you are he shrugged it off im just trying to be a good boss theyre both valuable assets to the firm if theyre not happy they wont be productive oh and thats it all this paternal advice is simply an ingenious management technique essentially he tipped up his glass mostly she shook her head smiling yes she said im sure motioning to his empty glass she asked if she could get him another one he hesitated im not trying to be an enabler here but would you consider joining me she still wasnt anywhere near telling him about the nardil her antidepressant drug she didnt think shed ever get to there but mark was relaxed in a sensitive mood open to her shed gone back to her wine over the past few weeks and thered been no illeffects now mark wanted her to join him for a nightcap if she said no the mood would be gone and she wasnt going to risk that midnight sam duncan sat up abruptly terrifying quayle whod been asleep in bed with her the dog yipped twice then whimpered and she reached out a hand to calm him bringing him over the blankets on to her lap petting the dog absently she swung her legs over the side of the bed she hated it when she couldnt sleep and she d made a resolution that she wasnt going to drink even a drop of anything to make her nod off the last time shed had a drink was st patricks day and look where that had gotten her to right here the couple who lived in the unit above her janet and wayne were silent now though from the sound of it theyd had a hell of a good night actually it had been like one of those scenes in the movies where the couple next door let out all the stops and just completely went for it perhaps janet and wayne didnt realize that sam had come home maybe they didnt think sound carried that well through the old building regardless they put on some show pretty much the complete range of the audio spectrum vocals screams thuds creaking springs sighs and moans you name it in the movies it was often pretty funny for sam tonight it wasnt it was damn near tragic she thought but she wasnt going to panic she was a mature woman and if fate had not supplied her with a mate after all this time she had dealt with it made a successful life for herself the men had come and gone a few steadies a fiance once for a couple of weeks but for the past four or five years shed simply decided to stop pursuing it stop worrying about it concentrate on her career and let whatever was going to happen in her lovelife simply happen the problem was that nothing significant had happened not until wes farrell she hadnt been with him more than two hours but in that time stupidly without any reason or explanation shed felt more alive simply better than she could remember there was just a whole different quality to the way theyd related complete ease immediate rapport sexual attraction attitude humor of course shed been half in the bag but the half that hadnt been thought it remembered pretty well and then hed turned out to be well what really a guy who did a job she didnt approve of didnt it come down to just that what was so bad about him it wasnt like he was a mass murderer a professional wrestler a car salesman and the violence of her reaction to what he did though she hated with all her heart to admit it might have had just a tad of a tiny bit to do with alcohol so she did the wise thing first went completely on the wagon thought about the whole issue soberly and while sober she was thirtyfive she hadnt been lonely before but now damn it she was well no not exactly that what she wanted was another fix of him christina had said to look him up in the book and after two days of struggling with herself she had there was a work number on columbus no home number listed and the number was there right now on the notepad on her bedtable under the lamp shit she said flicking on the light what the hell she was thinking its midnight hes at home and i can just talk to the machine at his office apologize for being such no not apologize dont start on that note id just like to talk with him and shed leave her number but wait he knew where she lived and if it had been important to him he could have come by rung the bell except that no shed thrown him out hed probably think with some justification that she was a nutcase even if he was tempted to come back hed think twice maybe ten times and decide hed better not she couldnt blame him also if she was really as hed said the first woman since his marriage hed be skittish and again she couldnt blame him it was going to have to be her ive got to find out if his marriage is over she thought thats got to come first im not getting involved with a married man i dont know him at all this is dumb but she was punching the numbers and the phone had started ringing hello oh im sorry i must have the wrong number she was about to hang up she wasnt prepared to really talk with anybody certainly not with him she was only going to leave a message sam sam is that you it stunned her he recognized her voice she clenched the phone she should just slam it down wrong number wrong time wrong sam he repeated is that you she sighed with frustration i wanted to apologize no not apologize explain i thought id get your machine you want ill turn it on promise not to listen till tomorrow morning thatd help are you still working i mean at work if you ask questions my machine wont be able to answer itll get all confusing youre right also i think you should know that i got my client levon copes i got him off today if thats what you were calling about you got him off they dropped the charges the da decided the evidence wasnt going to stick hes out of jail she took a breath well thats not exactly what i called about maybe a little but not mostly another pause listen if i promise not to get psycho on you would you like to meet me sometime for some coffee or something sure i mean okay i guess why dont you tell me when would like about now be all right part two chapter eleven sergeant paul thieu an investigator in missing persons who doubled from time to time as a translator rode in the passenger seat of glitskys unmarked green plymouth chattering away as though he was on his way to a wedding or a party instead of a murder scene next to him glitsky kept his eyes on the road it was dusk and the fog clung around the car like wool actually glitsky was thinking that it wasnt so bad hearing a voice with some animation in it there wasnt much cheeriness in the rest of his life especially around his house where now they had a nurse coming in every day flo wasnt going to spend her last days in any hospital theyd discussed it and the family was going to be around her not that she was there yet to her last days but they were coming also nat glitskys father was spending a lot of nights on the couch in the front room taking up the slack with the boys trying to keep things in some perspective as if there could be any but glitsky had hjs job going to it was a kind of a relief and thieu chatter or not represented the beginning of what might turn out to be a more than normally interesting case by far the majority of homicides in the city were what lawenforcement personnel referred to as nhi no humans involved cases one person from the lowest stratum of intelligent life would kill another or several others for no apparent reason or one so lame that it beggared belief last week glitsky had arrested a twentythree yearold woman whose iq soared into the double digits and whod killed her boyfriend in a dispute over what television show they were going to watch after shed shot him she sat herself down and watched all of roseanne before thinking well hey maybe id better see if i can wake old billy up now which with a bullet in his heart proved an elusive undertaking but occasionally someone with a more or less normal life got killed for a real reason the deadly sins did continue to reap their grim rewards these were the cases homicide cops lived for glitsky and thieu were driving to what looked like one of them now an attorney named victor trang whod been stabbed in the chest so the way i figure it theres no way im going to get to homicide by moving up the list thieu was referring to the seniority list by which promotions in the sfpd were controlled the other guys up there isnt that true they put in their fifteentwenty and by the time they get assigned to homicide they are completely burned out then they discover they actually have to work weekends and nights if they want results but they dont want to put in that kind of time hell homicides a reward isnt it but they cant be touched because of their seniority and they still want the prestige of the homicide detail so they take the job and then dont do it glitsky shot him a glance i do my job paul other guys do their jobs thieu didnt seem affected by glitskys lack of agreement certainly it didnt shut him up im not saying that abe im not talking about you you know who i mean a noncommittal nod glitsky did know who he meant and paul had perfectly analyzed the deadwood problem within the unit it was not glitskys inclination however to badmouth anyone else in his detail these things had a way of getting around but the point is im being the squeaky wheel i want to do this this is the action and i crave it something in thieus enthusiasm for the work forced glitsky to consider smiling the idea of the thrill of the chase had slid away from his vision of his job over the years and imagine this the gush went on i get this call in missing persons and we wait our three days and i just know i know this is a homicide its a rare gift paul thieu caught the intonation and realized he was pushing too hard but who could blame him for being excited when he got the call from the vietnamesespeaking mother about her missing son hed had a hunch in san francisco a missing person had to be gone for at least three days before it became an official police matter and thieu had gone by the book waiting the full three days but sticking with the story as it developed so how many calls did you get in total thieu didnt have to consult his notes a graduate of ucla in police science crewcut and cleanshaven he represented the increasingly new brand of san francisco cop he wore a light green business suit and a flamboyant red and green silk tie that somehow worked his mother his girlfriend one of his clients and how long was he missing this was in the first day before it even got to us three people in the first day this was a popular guy well evidently thats a question glitsky driving slowly flicked him a glance i looked into it a little did some background before he got filed officially as an mp a missing person something the mother said about a lawsuit this guy was working on which was well evidently he was well known but not particularly liked except by his mom and girlfriend why not why not what why wasnt he liked oh well appears the guy was a politician in the vietnamese community here glad hand big smile full of shit thieu looked over at glitsky checking for his reaction which was not forthcoming he was watching the road thats not me speaking ill of the dead its what ive heard glitsky was paying attention to mission street they were now at the light on geneva which wasnt working traffic was a mess the fog made it worse darkness was closing in fast so thieu kept chattering anyway seems this guy trang was always showing up at parties gatherings weddings funerals giving his card to everybody a real nuisance i think i met him glitsky said straightfaced really you met trang another sideways glance joke paul not really momentarily taken aback thieu slumped a little in his seat glitsky perhaps oblivious to his passengers distress said the heck with this and pulled his flasher out putting it on the roof turning on the siren in five seconds they were through the intersection rolling so what did his mother say glitskys rhythms put thieu off his own hed lost the thread of what hed been saying about what about some case he was working on that made you think there might be trouble which as it turns out there is if you define trouble as getting yourself killed which i do well apparently trang was suing the archdiocese of san francisco for a couple of million dollars or something what for i dont know not yet the mom said he was over his head and knew it but it was a big case he was scared she said of what i dont know just playing at that level i think the mom seemed confused about the church and the mafia and thought getting mixed up with one was like the other glitsky nodded ive heard worse theories so he was scared did he get any threats anybody knew of the mother knew of anything like that no well theres a help as was often the case glitsky was the first of the homicide team to arrive the body had evidently been discovered at around pm by someone from trangs weekly cleaning service who undoubtedly not wanting to call attention to his immigration status had gone back to the main office and reported it to management after suitable discussion the company had called the police squad cars from ingleside station had confirmed the stiff since they had a tentative identity for the victim glitsky had made a courtesy call to missing persons and asked if they had an outstanding mp named victor trang which had alerted paul thieu whod asked if he could tag along a couple of squad cars were parked in front of a squat faceless depressing building on a side street off geneva two uniformed officers stood shivering four steps up in a little semienclosed portico smelling of urine and littered with newspaper and broken glass identifying himself and thieu glitsky asked them to wait until the coroner and the crime scene investigators arrived then he and thieu opened the door and entered the building inside two bare bulbs illuminated a long hallway in which three doors were staggered on opposite sides at the far end the other two officers and either another plainclothes cop or a civilian stood in a tight knot whispering glitsky was aware of his and thieus echoing hollow footfalls on the wooden floors though the other doors in the hallway were woodfaced pitted and stained with the lacquer peeling off this ones top half was of frosted glass upon which had been etched the name victor trang and under it in script attorney at law he had that door made special the civilian said his name was harry something and he lived upstairs and said he managed the place poorly glitsky thought harry did have master keys for the building the uniforms had located him as soon as theyd set up it was a minor miracle and glitsky was grateful for it must of cost him a thousand bucks the door harry was trying to be helpful talking to be saying something glitsky ignored him and turned to thieu to whom the likely presence of a dead person was having the opposite effect than it was having on harry thieu had stopped chattering you ever do this before no you might want to wait then steeling himself it was never routine glitsky opened the door flicked on the light fortunately he thought it had been cold in the office even now the room was chilly but he could detect before he saw anything the distinctive smell something was rotting in here in glitskys experience reallife crime scenes tended to be prosaically ordinary rarely capturing the vividness the sense of evil and foreboding so favored by cop shows and b movies this one though victor trangs office came close trang had evidently blown all of his appearances money on his door once inside the office reverted to the form of the rest of the building and neighborhood the long desk was an eightfoot slab of whitewashed plywood in fact glitsky realized it was another door perhaps the original at an l to the desk a table held a computer and printer the phone and answering machine the walls were a flyspecked shiny beige which might once have been white and they were absolutely bare not a calendar not a picture not even a postit behind the desk a dark window without blinds or curtains was a black hole there was an offgreen couch along the side wall a wooden library chair with a pillow seat a folding chair set up facing the desk slowly taking it in as he moved glitsky walked around the folding chair had it been set up for an appointment was it always where it was now he stopped the chair behind the desk had been knocked over he could see it now up against the back wall the body rested along the length of the desk in an attitude of repose almost as though no glitsky realized exactly as though it had been placed there carefully laid down trang had been wearing an offwhite linen suit and now it was striped with red in neat rows there was a large bloodstain in the center of the chest but it was roughly circular it hadnt run down the front of his shirt therefore strangely it hadnt bled much until trang was already on the floor glitsky stood looking for a moment letting it all sink in he would wait until the coroner arrived until hed read the forensic reports but his impressions were coalescing into a certainty he knew what the red stripes were it chilled him the killer had used a knife then had held trang up in some death embrace holding him up maybe for as long as a minute leaving the knife in perhaps twisting it toward the heart then with his victim good and completely dead hed laid him down carefully on the floor finally pulled out the knife then calmly wiped the blade off on trangs suit two or three swipes at first glance glitsky had been a cop for twentytwo years in homicide for the last seven of them from the evidence of what he was seeing here he thought he might be looking at the most coldblooded upclose and personal murder of his career chapter twelve mark are you all right christina stood in the doorway one arm propped against the frame her hair was down she wore a navy blazer over a white silk blouse two buttons open just this side of demure she wouldnt start her summer job until late june but shed been coming in regularly for the past couple of weeks ever since dooher had counselled her to be supportive yet independent to help joe get his workload organized for the move south shed also gotten into the habit of stopping by doohers office after business hours just before she went home daylight savings time had begun two weeks ago and the office was above the fog layer bathed in an amber light from the sunset is something wrong no nothings wrong something i think moving into the room she stopped behind the brocaded easy chair hands resting on it he took in a deep breath held it a moment exhaled heavily the trang thing i guess cant get it out of my mind he raised a hand to his eye and rubbed weary and distressed an apologetic halfsmile at christina a shake of his head whats the sense in it huh heres a guy whos just getting started prime of his life perfect health i dont know you wonder it rocks you the big plan yeah i guess the big plan maybe there isnt one its all random you mean if it isnt whats free will he paused a minute nodding as though in agreement thats a good lawyer question ill have to get back to you on it her lips curved up slightly and she came around the chair sat on the edge of it pulling at her skirt meeting his eyes then looking down you do hide behind that you know that lawyer pose the glib answer i am a lawyer christina if im glib its a line of defense first we argue then we deflect the direction words might be going and on those rare occasions when it doesnt look like were going to win we obfuscate but im not hiding from you i hope you believe that i do i know that he shook his head again i feel bad about trang but whats the point of belaboring it nothings going to bring him back its the simple fact of it of life being so fragile i dont feel so glib about that not at my age your age again how old are you anyway sixty sixtyfive you couldnt be seventy she was teasing him trying to cheer him up eightythree next month he said but i work out he pushed around some items on his desk actually since youre as young as you feel i couldnt be a day over eightyone he shook his head sometimes the world gets to me christina i shouldnt burden you with it shifting around behind the desk he flashed his selfdeprecating grin youre just lucky i suppose getting to listen to my moaning i do feel lucky well im glad i do too you do he nodded why do you think the managing partner takes fifteen minutes at the end of the day just to visit risking not only the office gossip but the wrath of people who think they need my time i dont know part of me thought you were just watching out for me after talking me into coming here that i wasnt screwing up i dont believe that well a small part but some none not the smallest bit i dont take care of people professionally you either do it here or youre out no you wouldnt i dont recommend you try me but i have no worries about you not one she sat back in the chair then i dont know why yes you do christina he leveled his eyes at her across his desk the moment called for a matteroffact intimate tone and he got it you know life goes along and people get so they dont talk to people i mean you talk but its mostly surface but with you and me maybe we got lucky that first morning ash wednesday you remember of course what i mean to say is this its not common in fact its rare and valuable i value it immensely you ought to know that id hate to die suddenly like trang did and you not know this isnt business you and me isnt business okay okay and another thing while were on it im happily married my wife is a great partner and a wonderful person and not a halfbad cook im not going to accept any gossip about you and me that this office is likely to put out and i hope you dont either she was smiling now with him i wont i dont good now how are things with your boyfriend abe glitsky in a pair of khaki slacks and a flight jacket was walking down one of the muted hallways toward doohers office accompanied by the night receptionist an exceptionally attractive black woman of about twentyfive she was explaining that doohers secretary had gone home was glitsky sure he had an appointment for this time normally the receptionist was explaining if shed known that she would have stayed i made it with mr dooher personally he said noncommittal maybe he didnt mention it to her glitsky was struck by the color of the light the doors to several westfacing offices were open and the sun was going down over the cloud banks spraying the hallway with crimson in almost every office he saw a young person hunched over a desk oblivious to the sunset to everything but what they were reading or writing fun job dooher was standing in his doorway talking to yet another beautiful woman glitsky figured they grew on trees at this altitude sergeant glitsky she was smiling at him holding out her hand and he realized he knew her from the rape clinic and then that visit to his office what was she doing here christina carrera helping him out right levon copes he said and im still looking this seemed to register positively im glad the man with her glitsky presumed it was dooher stepped forward protectively you two know each other christina quickly explained while glitsky checked out the man in his thousanddollar pale gray italian suit the only wrong note was the hair no gray which meant the guy was vain and had a bottle of grecian formula hidden in the back of his sock drawer glitsky figured if he looked like mr dooher hed be vain too but hed have to go some before he decided to dye his hair the receptionist had disappeared christina was asking if glitsky was the only homicide sergeant in town sometimes it feels like it i dont know how you do it christina said up until a couple of months ago i never knew anybody whod been murdered and now ive met two tania willows and victor trang its unsettling you knew trang i met him here in mr doohers office once still it is easier if you dont know them first glitsky tried to mitigate the cop humor of what hed just said by smiling but his scar got in the way i know what you mean though its terrible dooher said christina here and i were just talking about victor trang the waste of it you were in vietnam christina had gone away glitsky had no questions for her he and dooher went into the big corner office and they had more or less finished with the routine questions glitsky was still seated on the sofa his tape recorder spinning silently on the coffee table the receptionist had brought him a cup of tea and it was excellent with a slice of lemon yet he would take the moment of peace until the cup was drained they were hard enough to come by dooher was volunteering information it probably had no connection with victor trang but glitskys experience was that a murder investigation led where it took you and the most innocuous comment or detail could be the hinge upon which it all eventually turned he sipped his tea and leaned back in the soft leather waiting for whatever was coming next the strange red sky had gone motherofpearl and dooher had loosened his tie he was drinking something amber without ice pacing around leaning on the edge of his desk crossing to the easy chair to the floating windows nervous glitsky thought which wasnt unusual he knew that people even attorneys got jittery when they talked to homicide cops it would be more suspicious if he wasnt thats why i was surprised i found myself liking him trang i mean dooher sighed i dont like to admit it but its one of the prejudices ive carried around all these years maybe its genetic my dad had the same thing with the japs the japanese he always called them japs me now some of my best friends glitsky kept him on it so howd you like it nam you go he shook his head bad knees football yeah well maybe youve heard it sucked glitsky had come upon that rumor you see action oh yeah we got ambushed and most of my squad got killed he swigged his drink i still dont know why i survived and the other guys and then the warm welcome at home that was special he looked over at glitsky i was bitter for a while blamed it on the vietnamese ruined my life all that did they dooher took in his plush surroundings no that was all youth i suppose excuses look around my life isnt ruined ive been lucky suddenly he snapped his fingers went around his desk and opened a drawer he pulled something out and handed it to glitsky these were the guys it was a framed color photograph of a bunch of soldiers armed and dangerous goofing and scowling dooher was in the front row on the far right with his captains bars his weapon propped next to him i had this up in that space in the bookshelves here till just before trang came up here the first time then i realized it would be offensive to him i guess i can put it back up now glitsky handed it back theyre all dead i dont know all three of us came home i know that but i havent seen either of the other two in maybe fifteen years the tea had cooled dooher went back around the desk and placed the frame in its former space in full view now anyway they trained me pretty well he was saying to hate em charlie i mean so what happened with trang like anything else you finally meet one personally get to know em a little and you realize theyre people first i just put off meeting any of them for a long time i wanted to keep hating them you see so the war would make some kind of sense dumb its so long ago now so who still hated him trang i dont know i understand he was suing you dooher had settled in the easy chair he leaned forward elbows on knees well thats technically accurate hed filed a lawsuit where some priest took money from a woman he was amending the suit that was all trying to get more hey its his job anyway i represent the archdiocese the whole thing hadnt gone very far thats just our business litigation personally we were on good terms glitsky didnt have any reason to doubt dooher he did believe that the killer was probably a tall strong male and though that described dooher he didnt have a patent on the build im wondering if he mentioned anything to you about anybody else clients colleagues the attorney gave it a long moment honestly i cant think of anybody ill put my mind to it if youd like id appreciate that standing glitsky turned off his recorder and slipped it into his pocket he handed dooher his card if something comes to mind thats me day or night dooher accompanied him to the door opened it for him the cotton clouds out the window had begun to glow with the lights coming on in the streets below do you have any leads at all sergeant on who might have done this no not yet its still early though something may come up well good luck they shook hands and glitsky turned to leave as the door closed quietly behind him chapter thirteen wes farrell and sam had been going out for a couple of weeks now and hadnt yet moved into the serious phase as they called it of what they were also calling their quote relationship unquote there was no plan as yet to escalate things were nicely physical they were getting along moving back and forth between their places taking care of their respective dogs although quayle and bart had yet to meet wes was flirting with what felt like his first happy and carefree moment in about half a decade it was the saturday evening after a noon wakeup followed by lovemaking and the planetarium in golden gate park theyd sat in the plush reclining seats holding hands as the night sky came up indoors farrell learned more than he ever thought hed need to know about the planet neptune although you never knew facts had a way of coming in handy they ended up sharing a short drink at the little shamrock the bar where they had met it didnt hurt that the winter cold had lifted not that it was balmy but anything above fortyfive degrees seemed a gentle gift the wind and fog were both gone and here at dusk wes was comfortable half reclining in the chaise outside wearing blue jeans and a sweater on sams tiny fencedin deck surrounded by potted greenery in the cupola created by three large redwood trees shed handed him a perfect martini gin had always been to wes the harbinger of summer and told him shed be out in a minute to join him as soon as shed put the game hens on to roast sam was making him dinner a first step into the heretofore dreaded return of the domesticity that had failed him so miserably the first time around they had talked about the implications of the dinner and decided they could risk it besides sam had pointed out it wasnt going to be just the two of them and quayle nothing that intimate other guests would be there to buffer the raging magnetic attraction that was nearly ripping the skin off their bodies there was going to be some lawyer woman from her office christina and her fiance another lawyer joe and sams brother remember larry and sally would serve to balance out the lawyer ratio wes sipped his drink sam thought he might be nervous meeting all these people in her circle at the same time he supposed one day long ago this kind of situation might have had that effect but today there was nothing but a sense of the exhilaration of new beginnings hope it was great the door creaked a hand on his shoulder the scent of her as she leaned over from behind the chaise laid a soft hand against the side of his face you know what i cant believe she said she came around the lounge chair holding her own martini farrell loved a woman who drank like he did he also loved the look of sam the way she had filled her glass right to the rim slurping at it delicately to get that first taste puckering her lips around it umum she was wearing jeans too and a white sweater and hiking boots she looked seventeen he smiled up at her what cant you believe i can t believe that pluto s going to be inside the orbit of neptune for the next eleven years so its not jupiter saturn uranus neptune and pluto anymore its jupiter saturn uranus pluto and neptune that wacky old solar system wes said just when you think you got it all figured out he moved his legs off the recliner patted it with his palm and sam sat the haunch of her leg tight up against him he grinned at her the good news is that this is the kind of fact on which i believe we can make some money larry and sally arrived first the sun was down and wes was back inside with sam another round of gin poured and good smells emanating from the kitchen everybody already getting along laughing about st patricks day hey the parts i remember were great larry defending himself from his sisters mock attack and how many parts do you remember larry paused considering at least two including meeting wes he gave farrell an appraising glance shook his head im afraid that particular moment didnt make the cut where were we exactly no offense wes you had the tshirt sally said to wes she was as tall as her husband with long dark hair that had gone about a third gray her friendly attractive face showed more age than sams she also wore nicer clothes some makeup dangling earrings thats what did it sam saidthe shirt i saw that shirt and read the message and said heres a guy ive got to meet i thought it was how it fit me that too she said thats what i meant you guys sally was smiling no foreplay until after dinner its one of the rules what shirt larry asked farrell recognized them both immediately shaking joes hand taking in the woman christina carrera yep it was her no doubt about it not looking any uglier either he noticed and it looked as though shed found the right guy joe avery was tall and thin with an angular cleanshaven face shoulders a yard wide and no gut at all it wasnt fair youre at mccabe and roth arent you joe included christina we both are not quite yet close enough then placing wes youve been to the office no more than two three hundred times mark doohers my best friend christina snapped her fingers thats it explaining i knew i knew the name wes farrell when sam told me its been driving me crazy you go on camping trips or something with mark right occasionally retreats we call them joe avery was looking a question at christina but sam was coming up kissing her on both cheeks getting introduced to joe okay you lawyers break it up no professional talk until weve all said hello at least the moment passed sam and sally were in getting dessert and larry had gone to the bathroom joe turned to christina so how do you know about these retreats mark told me about them one of the first times we talked i dont remember exactly it just came up she turned to wes hoping to deflect the line of questioning from joe he said you guys go out and get recharged on life farrell shrugged mostly we drink he said then continuing to make light of it get away from the daytoday talk about what we believe in in theory try to beat the burnout which you know joe is a constant wes drank some more wine and smiled at christina youll find out after youve been at this business a year or so joe shook his head i cant see it with mr dooher mark he doesnt seem like hes on the burnout track hes always geared up joe hes got to act that way christina rushing to doohers defense nearly blurted it out you dont want your managing partner moping around making you feel like its all so hard well he doesnt do that thats for sure yeah but i think christinas right he acts tough but if you know him christina laughed dont tell me hes a pussycat a gentle heart maybe but no way joe couldnt envision it maybe with you guys but ive worked for him a lot of years and mark dooher does not invite closeness joe looked around the table perhaps realizing he was being too negative he caught himself nearly knocking himself over backtracking although lately i must admit i dont know exactly what happened hes been fantastic you got over the hump thats all farrell said you proved yourself is that it farrell nodded thats mark he used to be too soft one of the guys you know didnt want to give orders set himself above anybody avery laughed well he sure got over that one joe thats a fact christina say what you want about mark being afraid to give orders isnt what hes about anymore farrell stopped them youre responsible for ten people dying joe it hardens you right up in the silence christina finally spoke up what do you mean dying farrell made a face he hadnt intended to bring this up it was too personal one of doohers true ghosts but to drop it now would only arouse more curiosity better to downplay it god knew it did relate to their discussion mark was in vietnam he said platoon captain about a dozen guys under his command this being vietnam as you may have heard the guys smoked some dope did they inhale joe asked mr dooher smoked dope farrell shook his head no i dont think so but his men did so what happened christina asked so mark knew how bad things were over there and he knew the dope made it bearable for his troops regular guys pretty much his age so he made an unspoken policy that they had to be straight when they were going out on maneuvers but otherwise he wasnt busting anybody for a little dope he thought it was a reasonable rule and so everybody would follow it what was a reasonable rule larry returning from the bathroom didnt want to be left out wes shortened it up my best friend happens to be the managing partner of joes law firm he said we were talking about how he got to be such a hardass to work for and the answer is vietnam he didnt exert his authority didnt take charge so when his troops went out on patrol it turned out they were stoned to the eyeballs and got themselves ambushed and most of em died i dont think hes ever forgiven himself for that jesus joe clearly wasnt used to stories like this one you get used to thinking in business terms how maybe somebody beat him in a deal or something but this no this wasnt like that this was real so now hes more careful hes got to be problem is and ive known him my whole life underneath he really does want to give people a break but people you cut em some slack once and next time they expect it again so they dont perform as well as they might and that doesnt help anybody so hes a bastard at the firm he is not christina didnt like the language at all he is nothing like a bastard wes held up his hands hes my best friend christina were a little free with what we call each other hes been known to be less than flattering to me who has sam was coming back in with a large plate of cut fruit and cheeses wes rolled his eyes they werent going over this whole thing again enough mark dooher already nothing wes said then ive got five dollars that says neptune is the last planet in our solar system he winked at sam no its pluto joe said it is pluto christina was sure too larry and sally were nodding in agreement wes extended his hand out over the table five bucks he said just slap my palm that was cruel sam said the guests had all gone home she and wes were having some port sitting on the loveseat theyd pulled in front of the woodburning stove quayle was curled over her feet cruel but cool wes said and we did make fifteen dollars it could have been twenty if sally had ponied up her own five theyre married sam said married people never do that i remember a piece of wood popped in the grate wes raised his glass to his mouth and realized hed had enough tonight gin wine port maybe for tomorrow too the silence lengthened you all right wes he brought her in closer against him im fine fine isnt the strongest word in the dictionary okay im ecstatic this wasnt too much tonight the family stuff dinner at home he had to chuckle i assure you this wasnt anything like any dinner ive ever had with lydia at home or anywhere else in the first place you can cook im not pushing anything she said i know not that i couldnt handle a little of that even but it was fun i had a great time i enjoyed your brother and sister and thought your friend christina was charming and lovely and i think you are fantastic although im not absolutely sure im going to respect you in the morning she put her own glass down took his hand from where it rested on her shoulder and placed it on her breast i hope not she said lets go find out at about the same moment that wes farrell was enjoying his first martini that evening mark and sheila entered st emydius church to attend saturdaynight mass they walked together down the center aisle and chose a pew about ten rows from the front there were more than fifty people in the church a good showing the congregation had come early to take part in the reconciliation service which had for most catholics replaced the old oftenhumiliating sacrament of confession now sinners were offered an opportunity to reflect on their weakness privately resolve to do good and then be communally absolved of any guilt without having to confront another human being or suffer the minor indignity of a formal penance today though before the priest had come on to the altar to begin the reconciliation service mark leaned over and whispered to sheila that he was going to use the real confessional which was still an option im old fashioned he said it does me more good he didnt know what priest would be sitting in the confessional but there was a good chance hed know dooher and vice versa all the priests at st emydius knew him maybe not though often a visiting priest would get the chore of saturday confession dooher would let fate dictate it he nodded his head made the sign of the cross stood up and opened the confessional door the familiar smell of it dust and beeswax filled his soul as did the comforting darkness then the window that separated him and the priest was sliding open the man recognized him immediately hello mark how are you doing today it was gene gorman the pastor whod been to the house fifty times for poker for dinner for fundraisers who got a bottle of canadian club every christmas whod baptized jason their youngest dooher paused not so good im afraid he whispered he let the silence gather then i dont want to burden you gene thats what the sacraments for mark dooher hesitated another moment hesitation heightened the gravity of things would you mind not using my name is there someone in the other stall the confessionals at st emydius as in most catholic churches had three compartments one in the middle for the priest and one on either side of him for the repentants this time the hesitation came from father gorman dooher heard him slide open the window on the other side then close it no were alone you can begin the old words the ritual he so loved again he made the sign of the cross bless me father for i have sinned chapter fourteen john strout san franciscos coroner was a gangly southern gentleman of the old school he had a prominent adams apple a perennially bad case of dandruff in his wispy gray hair poor taste in clothes and a pronounced dixie accent he was also rube or not one the countrys most respected forensics experts and now he was taking a morning walk with glitsky through the debris and detritus of southofmarket san francisco it was monday morning sunny breezy and cold strout was of course a medical doctor and after a lifetime of bad morning coffee and stale donuts had recently been a convert to the theory that a healthy breakfast was the key to a long life and perhaps even more luxuriant hair growth like all good converts he had found the truth and was going to spread the word around goddamn it like it or not so whenever feasible hed taken to briefing cops and das about his forensics reports over breakfast in one of the citys eateries it never occurred to him that discussing the finer points of oftengory violent death complete with color photographs might not be particularly conducive to stimulating the earlymorning appetite it did occur to glitsky strout had finished the pm on victor trang on the previous friday afternoon and glitsky had atypically in strouts experience probably because of his troubles at home said hed be free to discuss the results first thing monday morning let the weekend intervene why not ill just look at the pictures while were walking here if you dont mind john with a show of reluctance strout handed over the folder and put his nowempty hands into the pockets of his greatcoat against the chill what do we have abe went on any surprises well as a matter of fact glitsky closed the newly opened folder what ill listen first surprises may be too strong a word but the deceased here got himself gutted by a pig sticker of the first order pig sticker knife a pig sticker is a certain kind of knife strouts expression betrayed a certain intolerance damn you yankees pig sticker means knife genetically victor trang got stabbed by a big knife is that clearer and not just any big knife something like a bowie or my own favorite guess a bayonet yall familiar with the term bayonet glitsky played along ive heard of it made by the swiss army people right whittling tool yeah thats it cept the large version strout put a hand on glitskys arm and stopped him as they walked open the file he said the breeze gusted and they moved into the entrance of an office building out of it the photos glitsky followed instructions flipping over glossies of the murder scene the body as hed found it then as it looked from various angles stripped on the morgue table finally strout put his finger on one there you go that one it was a color closeup that glitsky recognized all too soon the wound itself after the area had been washed long and wider than most knifewounds hed been witness to you see there strout was saying right at the top glitsky squinted not clear what he was supposed to be seeing strout moved in closer put his finger on the area over the top of the gash right here you see that halfmoon the little circle under it know what that is glitsky took a second then guessed its an imprint from the haft of the knife the coroner was pleased i must say it is a pure pleasure to work with a professional thats exactly what it is the perp stabbed him so hard and so far up the haft left this little fingerprint which is pretty damn distinctive you ask me actually cut into the skin above the blade area i wouldnt put my name on it as a definite this was because he could never prove it for certain and some attorney might discredit his entire testimony if he wasnt one hundred percent positive and correct on every detail but between us this could be nothing but a bayonet strout reached inside his greatcoat and extracted a folded brown paper shopping bag as a matter of fact you just happen to have one handy this wasnt as unusual as it might have appeared strouts office contained an impressive collection of murder weapons from throughout the ages maces crossbows garrotting scarves sabers handguns and uzis and apparently bayonets he withdrew it from the bag hefted it affectionately and handed it to glitsky i thought id cut my steak with this at breakfast make an impression on our waiter but look abe was already looking it was as strout had noted a pig sticker of the first order where the blade met the handle of the knife was an oversized steel haft with a halfinch circular hole through the metal strout was pointing again thats where it connects to the mount of the rifle then back to the picture its also why theres that kind of double circle the top of the haft then the punchout area couldnt really be any thing else how common are these things you think strout shrugged well they aint exactly carters pills but anybody wants could get ahold of one armynavy stores gun clubs mail order good old paramilitarytype boys saving our country from the government your guess is as good as mine round here they probably wouldnt be as common as say in idaho or oregon but youd find em also exarmy glitsky said suddenly he experienced a small jolt of connection mark dooher vietnam and his dead troops he closed his eyes trying to revisualize the photograph hed seen in the attorneys office whether there might have been a bayonet mounted on any of the many weapons displayed he couldnt see it couldnt bring it back but strout was going on actually abe that might be a tougher nut if memory serves they take your weapons away when they muster you out course you could smuggle em people probably been known to rubbing his thumb over the bayonets blade glitsky nodded i dont think so he said that would be illegal after his mondaymorning breakfast meeting with john strout glitsky had planned to get right on the trang investigation murders that didnt get solved in the first couple of days very often never did but when hed come back to the office there had been another homicide he had been on call last week so normally this would have been someone elses problem but this weeks inspector had called in sick and gone salmon fishing and glitsky appeared just as his lieutenant frank batiste had despaired of finding an inspector to assign apparently a fry cooker whod been fired from a tastee burger in the lower mission had returned to the scene of his humiliation and gone postal a new expression glitsky loved the exemployee naturally killed none of the people with whom he had a gripe he did though by mistake before he killed himself end the life of a seventeenyearold highschool student whod stopped in for a hot chocolate this new homicide brought glitskys workload to seven active cases and put him inside and around the tastee burger for the rest of the day now it was just before noon on tuesday and finally he was at mrs trangs clean but cluttered apartment with paul thieu his enthusiastic interpreter victors mother had been glitskys first choice of where to begin asking questions but like so many other of his plans lately this one hadnt panned out he had respected the fact that she had been too distraught to talk in the immediate aftermath of her sons death then there had been the wake and funeral this morning was the earliest they could get together the apartment was a study in lace every smooth surface was covered with some type of crocheted thing a doily or hankie or tablecloth there was lace over the back of the overstuffed couch that glitsky and thieu were directed to lace over the coffee table on the end tables under the lamps and photographs on the television set under the phone on the little hall table a feeble sunlight struggled to pierce a veil of weblike lace drapery covering the front windows trangs mother was petite and weathered with flat gray hair and a shapeless tiny body made more so by its enclosure in an oversized mans black business suit over the shoulders of which she had thrown a crocheted white shawl she offered them small flavorless cookies of some kind and coffee near boiling chicorylaced and appalling to glitskys taste but thieu sucked the first cup right up black and accepted a second she sat still as a rock at the coffee table responding to his opening expressions of regret in a patient and compliant way without any interest her life along with her sons was apparently over but now finally he was getting to it and the last time you saw your son was he waited for thieu to interpret listened to the womans inflection as she answered trying to piece something in advance from sounds alone but the tonality was too flat thieu nodded to mrs trang then turned to him she saw him the day before he was killed but talked to him that night that evening after dinner sometime shes not sure exactly what time glitsky pretended to scribble on his pad and kept his face impassive his voice low and conversational paul would you please just say the words she says exactly dont tell me what she says say what she says the younger man nodded then swallowed suitably chided sorry its okay he sat forward on the couch spoke directly to the mother mrs trang how did victor seem to you the last time you saw him thieu translated the wait he was hopeful we had a nice dinner he tries to come over at least once a week on sunday sometimes more he she paused and thieu waited it saves him money to come here and eat i think he has taken a little while to start making money as a lawyer and he felt that he was about to make a lot and how was he going to do that he had a client who was suing the archdiocese and he said they the archdiocese had offered to thieu listened turned to glitsky shes apologizing to me he said she doesnt know the jargon glitsky pointedly ignored thieu thats all right mrs trang just do your best she came back to him began talking again thieu picked it up to settle it before going to court they were not going to go to court and he thought he would make a lot of money he was pretty certain of that yes he seemed very sure very hopeful but also worried what about that it wouldnt happen that something would go wrong a pause as it has did he say what might go wrong what he was worried about that this was a lot of money and the church might use connections in the court perhaps so that even though victor was right even if the law was on his side they could stop him did you think he meant violently no now i dont know maybe so how much money was he talking about he didnt say exactly enough to pay off his loans he thought he would move his office get a secretary he wanted to get me a new place she motioned around their cramped quarters buy me some new clothes okay then how about the next night when he called did he call or did you call him he called me the attorney for the archdiocese markdooher yes i think that was his name he had called victor and asked him to stay in the office to wait for a phone call and they were going to offer more money that night did he say when hed gotten that first call from dooher i thought it was just then just before he called me glitsky made a note on his yellow pad there would be a phone record of the precise time mrs trang said a few more words which thieu related its why he stayed late would he have called anyone else about this to tell them perhaps about the possible settlement no i wanted to call my sister and tell her and he told me to wait that he was going to wait too not to talk to anyone until it was done he didnt want to thieu frowned trying to find the right word to bring it bad luck to jinx it he told me this but that doesnt mean the girlfriend or somebody else didnt just happen to drop by thieu wanted to talk about it still and always glitsky was driving the unmarked plymouth back to trangs office trying to keep from jumping to conclusions glad he didnt usually work with a partner he was coming to believe that entirely too much credence was given to the roundtable discussion sometimes a radical idea in this bumptious age he knew but sometimes solitary contemplation did produce results it had to be somebody he knew right thieu persisted it wasnt a robbery nothing was missing we dont know that we dont know what was there to be missing i mean his wallet personal effects it might have just been botched if thieu wanted to play these games glitsky could at least make them instructive guys in there and trang comes back from dinner he didnt leave for dinner paul had done his homework the autopsy didnt find anything in his stomach so he came back for his keys or something or went to mail a letter if he left though and came back discovered the perp burglarizing the place who killed him then decided hed better split that didnt happen thieu said no i dont think so either but it could have which is my point what i think is what you think a strong male who knew him killed him dooher maybe or maybe one of his clients maybe one of the people he was hassling for business abe gave the other man a sidelong glance thats what they pay us for to find out trangs office didnt look much better in the daytime and to thieu it felt worse the crimescene tape was still across the door inside the way it had been left by the forensics and homicide teams on friday night created a sense of abandonment that to thieu was overwhelming he noticed that none of whatever weak sunlight there had been outside made it into this cavern ever glitsky had zipped up his flight jacket his breath showed in the chill he crossed to the one window the black hole of the other night and opened it into the brick of the building next door about four inches away he stuck his head out and looked up down sideways if the perp came through here he said he is one skinny dude it was the first even remote touch of levity thieu had heard from the sergeant emboldened by it he dared ask another question what are we looking for glitsky had moved back to the desk was sitting in the library chair he motioned to four cardboard boxes lurking in the corner with manila file folders visible in them anything why dont you start by looking through those boxes thieu shrugged the well of glitskys humor was proving to be relatively shallow and went to work the files werent alphabetically arranged and hed gone through the first three of them notes from law school when he heard a click and a hum behind him and turned to see glitsky at the computer legs stretched out arms crossed scowling at the monitor after a minute the sergeant sat forward and began clicking the mouse thieu left his boxes straightened up and came around behind him resolving to ask no questions though it wasnt his style not to ask he liked people and believed that the truth emerged from a full and free discussion of ideas and theories also it had been his experience at ucla that asking professors what they wanted was how you found out what to give them it wasnt any mystery just simple communication and then at the academy it got drilled into them that you should justask questions and senior officers would always be happy to help you he didnt think anybody had briefed the inspector here on that part the monitor was scrolling the pages of a document that was evidently some kind of an organizer glitsky got to the day of trangs death a week ago yesterday now and leaned forward look at this he said thieu already was there were four entries called md told him need answer by cob today or filing tomorrow million md message i called back he was at lunch wcb md callback f out till extension till midnight tonight okay md from fs settlement possible offer still unresolved midnight firm thieu couldnt stop himself that last one thats when he called his mother whos f glitsky was scrolling backward now eyes on the screen the archbishop he said flaherty as expected it didnt appear that victor trang had had a lot of business the screens reflected few clients appointments or telephone numbers at the screen for a couple of weeks earlier glitsky stopped on another screen md kh declined thats something thieu said glitsky nodded youbetcha he turned it down looks like i guess he thought he could get more there was an answering machine with calls from trangs girlfriend lily martin and mrs trang and mark dooher and felicia diep all wondering if victor were there why hed not called back would he please call when he got the message they also found the folder on the lawsuit including the amended complaint predated for tuesday the day after trangs murder there was a yellow legal pad with pages of notes that were mostly unintelligible to glitsky but on the first page thieu had been able to read enough to learn that trang had felt threatened in his first visit to mccabe roth dooher thieu asked they were heading back downtown where glitsky was to talk to lily martin whod volunteered to come to the hall of justice for an interview id just bring him in and grill him about what about what about all this is what this isnt anything paul this is squat we are nowhere yet on this he didnt really want to bite off thieus head after all what the man was saying could be correct but there was as yet no evidence that it had been dooher not even enough to insult him by asking him pointed questions and glitsky was still smarting from his fiasco with the undoubtedly guilty levon copes where he had just known what had happened he wasnt going to make the same mistake here but he was really being an unnecessary hardass he didnt want to burn the kid out before he even got lit although he knew he wouldnt require any translator with lily martin glitsky decided on the spur of the moment to invite thieu to remain for the interview with her besides glitsky knew there was a chance he might need him again lets talk to the girlfriend first paul see what shes got to say one million six hundred thousand dollars was the settlement figure which was would have been five hundred and thirtythree thousand for victor lily martin was absolutely certain she was conservatively and glitsky thought inexpensively well dressed and she spoke english perfectly having been in this country since she was four her father ed martin had fought in vietnam married her mother over there and brought them all back here now she was twentyfive working as she did as a junior accountant doing her internship with a big firm the money angle was no mystery to her victors mother said he told her he wasnt going to call anybody to tell them abe said gently he didnt want to jinx the deal he didnt call me i called him like a minute after he got the call she broke a brittle smile which cracked almost immediately this was going to be the start of our life of everything of course i called him that night last monday yes and what did he say he said that mr dooher had just called from the archbishops office and he wanted before he presented a final number to the archbishop he wanted to run it by victor to see if they were going to be in the ballpark and that number was what i just told you sergeant a million six i just want to get this straight maam dooher told him they were going to be talking in that range thats right and if they dooher and flaherty if they didnt come through then victor was going to file but he didnt think no she folded her arms too quickly over her chest glitsky recognized the classic body language shed decided to clam up about something no what nothing im sorry go ahead the interrogation room was small and windowless there was no art on the walls the furnishings consisted of three folding chairs around a pitted wooden table this setting could play on the nerves of even the most cooperative witness the air got stale people froze imagined things got weirded out in any number of ways suddenly glitsky leaned back straightened shook his shoulders getting loose he lifted the corners of his mouth scratched his face finally there was the trick he did with the eyes letting them go out of focus he fancied this made people think there was something soft in there he turned his head to include paul thieu how about if we all take a break get a cup of tea or something so then after you talked this night he was going to come to my place he asked me not to call again dooher might be there hed call when he knew or when it was over and when he didnt i just thought it must have gone real late he just went home i waited all the next day at work but no call i tried his office his home even mr doohers office and what did he say he didnt talk to me glitsky and thieu exchanged glances lou the greeks seemed unusually cavernous nearly empty here in the midafternoon it provided a better environment for talking than the tiny interrogation room at the hall so eventually i went by the office and knocked but there wasnt any answer of course by now she was sniffling occasionally into a napkin and then i called the police glitsky kept it casual why wouldnt dooher talk to you she shook her head i dont think its so much he wouldn t he just didnt his secretary took my message which was that i was a friend of victor trangs and did he have any idea where victor was had he seen him then she called back and said he was concerned too maybe we should both call the police so thats where i left it glitsky was tearing his own napkin into tiny bits and piling them neatly on the table ms martin upstairs a while ago there was something you didnt want to talk about about the settlement with dooher she cast her eyes to the ceiling and sighed deeply okay she said that night at the glitsky home it was almost the way it used to be his sons were watching television perhaps even doing some homework to the mindless background in the bedroom shared by the two younger boys flo was feeling better today it went up and down but tonight it was way up she was dressed in tight bluejeans gold sandals and no socks a maroon blouse diamond stud earrings and a brush of makeup a light touch of lipstick a maroon scarf artfully curled around her head to hide the hair loss the nurse was off at night and flo had sent glitskys dad back to his home she told him he needed some time for himself he should take in a movie go solve one of the mysteries of the talmud nat must be sick of taking care of things here and flo was able to cope today who knew how long it was going to last but for now maybe a couple of days maybe more she craved some semblance of normalcy for them all and somehow she was a genius shed done it created that feel made dinner of stuffed flank steak everybodys favorite home fries with onions and peppers broccoli and cheese sauce vanilla ice cream over cherry pie you know i just never seem to worry about cholesterol anymore jokes yet now she was rinsing dishes about a freightcar full piling them carefully in the dishwasher glitsky sat on the counter next to her telling her about his day just like old times about what lily martin had suddenly gone quiet about which was that her boyfriend never really thought he would win the lawsuit if he filed it you mean he was basically trying to extort money from the church lily didnt want to put it so bluntly but essentially yeah that is scuzzy glitsky shrugged hes a lawyer was a lawyer you think thats why he got killed just because he was a lawyer i dont know flo thats a tough theory theres lot of lawyers out there and many of them are alive she gave him the eye because of the deal abraham he temporized i dont know yet i think it might be possible another look sergeant goes out on limb film at eleven he smiled at her his real smile my problem is this so what this guy dooher may have had all this against victor trang but you dont go out and kill somebody whos suing your client and this killing was personal how about if you thought you might lose your client if you lost but they werent even playing yet nobody was going to lose that big they were settling maybe the client wasnt happy about the settlement terms theyd go with this one because they had to it had gone too far whatever but afterwards they fire the lawyer or he thinks they might so he kills the guy abe shook his head i just dont see it it doesnt make any sense besides this lawyer were talking about dooher hes managing partner of a big firm downtown hes been at this all of his life hes not going to kill a professional adversary over a case besides they lose a case they lose a client its not the end of the world his firms probably got a hundred clients only probably you didnt check glitsky had to smile yeah flo in my free time i ran a d b on them firms dont usually run on one client flo shrugged okay so who then if its not money i know i just hate to see a money motive go nowhere she put the last dish into the dishwasher closed it up and came to stand in front of her husband between his legs she put her arms around him they kissed i remember that glitsky said flo nodded toward their bedroom race you for a halfhour hed forgotten all about real life then she was breathing regularly and he was back in it the clock said it was a school night he had to get the boys down to bed he had to move but if he didnt maybe it would all just stop right here where he was where they all were she shifted slightly abe not sleeping after all find somebody else promise me that there was a tremor a tic above his eye the muscle of his jaw tightened the scar through his lips went white with a surge of anger so sharp it grabbed his next breath i dont want to talk about it he stood its time i got those kids to bed chapter fifteen christina knew it had happened at the dinner on saturday at sams its aftermath on the drive back to her apartment joe going on and on how could christina think she knew mark dooher so well what was with the two of them where did she get off saying he was nothing like a bastard and while they were at it what was the real story behind her knowing about these retreats with dooher and farrell and shed closed her eyes too tired to fight him anymore to explain to care the certainty had come in a flash that joe wasnt right for her and all the rationalizing and wishing in the world wasnt going to change that he would never be right she didnt love him there had been early admiration then a desire born of curiosity followed by a leap of faith but the fact was that she didnt feel much about him one way or the other except when he started talking about acts and even then she didnt hate him she just found him irritating and boring pleading a headache shed gone into her apartment alone said shed call him when she felt better which wasnt sunday then on monday hed flown to la and stayed overnight shed been out both nights studying shed come home and listened to his petulant messages and it all got clearer now wednesday morning she stood at his office door he was as always hipdeep in work ear stuck to his telephone he was signing something and reading something else passing paper to his secretary who hovered beside him with a notepad and an expression of exasperated fear yep christina thought joe is going to make it fate sealed the decision at that moment joe reasonably spoke into the telephone i dont think youve got all your ducks lined up bill and thats the plain fact of it she came forward into the room seeing her joe held up one finger pointed at the phone and smiled as though she were a client hed been expecting he mouthed be right there she sadly shook her head and put the envelope containing the ring and her letter on his desk patting it once she turned and walked out i feel like a coward just running out like that i should have faced him and said what i dont know told him would he have listened maybe to the fact that i was leaving him maybe that she looked out at the whitecaps pocking the blue bay sailboats halfkeeled in the breeze san francisco in the distance the golden gate beyond the sausalito curve to her right at sams expression she laughed no youre right not even to that and that look isnt fair what look and i didnt say anything you know what look and you didnt have to they were at scomas having taken the ferry to sausalito sam had two experienced volunteers working at the center and decided she could afford a few hours off for her part christina after leaving her envelope had been tempted to go to doohers office and tell him about it but thought it would smack of leading him on which she flatly wasnt going to do to what end hed made it clear he was married not interested in her in that way and what a relief really though she did think he was terrific she sometimes thought every other man on the planet was incapable of seeing who she was inside but not mark he simply liked her who she was it was a joy she was aware however that her decision to break off with joe had come about because shed been unable to avoid contrasting the younger man to dooher with his heady mix of physical good looks substance experience power and humor she decided that her growing friendship with him would be the litmus test for the kind of relationship she would eventually not settle for as she had with joe but settle on someone of doohers quality if he could be found at all it might take a while but that was the other thing the other wonderful result of this friendship with mark dooher if some other man didnt come along to validate who she was it didnt have to be the end of the world she was trying to explain this to sam i dont know why it took me so long to realize sometimes i think about the only man whos ever liked me for me besides my dad is mark sam mopping up the perfect dore sauce with the perfect piece of fresh sourdough bread was matteroffact its the curse of fabulous beauty she raised her eyes im serious christina knew better than to flutter her lids with false modesty well but now at least im getting a glimpse that maybe im worth something by myself as opposed to i dont know the lesser half of some guy i happen to be with the trophy christina nodded on some level its flattering or something so i let it happen i become the person they want me to be its tempting thats why it is flattering its also what everybodys always taught you you want to please youre hardwired for it so it gets internalized sam mopped more sauce i cannot make a sauce this good at home how do they do this she took the bite chewed a moment sighed its one of the hard truths the sauce sam laughed shook her head what sauce another laugh im all over the place arent i no the hard truth about who we are i went through the same thing about ten years ago i think youve lost me what same thing this decision that i wasnt what some man thought i was and you did it just like that no smiling again she held up a finger but i tried i acted that way for all the world to see got my heart broke four or five times got bitter and cynical about men but i did get better about me i think eventually christina nodded well im not going back not the same way not to another joe good hold on to that feeling youre going to need it when its been six months you get a little lonesome trust me on this i think i can handle lonesome ive done lonesome before the difference was that lonely was always clearly the time between one guy and the next guy now i think ill cultivate some friendships friendships are good sam said as long as you dont get confused you mean mark dooher christina shook her head no hes not like that sam raised an eyebrow hes not a sexual creature no she laughed he exudes confidence that way i suppose but hes married hes happy hes got it in balance hes never come on to me in any way in fact more the opposite hands off be a person first its great actually ive got to meet this guy wes thinks hes god too speaking of god or wes christina nodded mrfarrell im afraid i let lonesome get the better of me and pursued him a little more uh recklessly than i would have liked now i like to think were moving cautiously toward friendship but weve got a ways to go before we get beyond superficial which isnt so bad is it sam shrugged i dont really know thats the funny thing it makes me a little nervous what weve been talking about all day here theres no way im investing any of this she tapped her heart until i know him better until you know its real sams face was a kaleidoscope of emotions she nodded sheepishly thats always the question isnt it glitsky really hated it when he talked himself out of a plausible murder suspect and thats exactly what his two talks the one with his wife and the other with paul thieu had accomplished not only did he lack any physical evidence pointing to mark dooher as victor trangs killer but as he had told flo there was no reasonable way that a successful corporate lawyer was going to stab another lawyer to death over the terms of a possible settlement that solution much as he would love it if it did just didnt scan so he was going to have to get another approach and to that end he had dropped in on paul thieu in missing persons and asked him to call felicia diep and set up an appointment for some time if possible before afternoon tea in the meanwhile glitsky went upstairs to homicide the room looked as it always did a large open area with twelve desks no more than three of them occupied at any one time the doorless corner cubicle office of the chief of homicide lieutenant frank batiste two massive dry wall columns papered stuck and tagged with every poster fax ammo sale notice car repo slip random prostitutes phone number and so on that had crossed some inspectors desk in the past four years or so and which at the time had seemed too important funny or unusual to simply discard in a waste basket glitskys desk was next to one of these columns he pulled his chair in crossed his arms behind his head and put his feet up his eyes came to rest on the xeroxed note at his eye level dont let your mouth write a check your ass cant cash he let his chair back down trying to will away the nagging sense that he shouldnt stop concentrating on mark dooher who was in some ways the least likely probable candidate for the murder but for just that reason instinct counted that was the problem glitskys instincts were screaming something that he couldnt prove trangs murder had tohave been personal someone had hated him passionately and that element just didnt seem to be there with his business adversary mark dooher so glitsky should stop wasting energy on him except if trang represented something dooher hated passionately like vietnamese people no forget that he had a lot of other work six other pressing homicides it might after all be the girlfriend lily girlfriends always had a motive or two and lily stood to benefit if trang accepted doohers settlement maybe shed gotten mad at him when he hadnt yesterday hed told himself that no she was too small she could never have held trang up but sudden thought what if she had another boyfriend shed known victor was alone in the office hed overlooked that if she sent boyfriend number two over abe got a minute frank batiste stood in the doorway to his cubicle the lieutenant and glitsky had come up together through the ranks both were nominal minorities glitsky halfblack batiste a spanish surname and both had elected to disregard any advantages and they were legion accruing to that status in san francisco it had created a bond of sorts and although batiste currently outranked glitsky theyd been in the department the same number of years and felt like equals so glitsky got up and by the time he reached the doorway the lieutenant was sitting behind his desk whats up frank come on in sit down get the door a joke since there was no door glitsky took the folding chair across from the desk batiste pulled a pencil from his drawer and began tapping the table so you know how to tell the prostitute in the miss america contest im afraid i dont frank shes the one with the banner reading idaho the one saving constant in the office glitsky thought somebodys always got a dumb joke and batiste was on a roll okay another chance for you you know the difference between mick jagger and a scotsman glitsky broke a small smile i give up mick jagger says hey you get offa my cloud and the scotsman says hey mccloud get off my ewe you gotta get an agent frank the right agent could make you a star thats true the downside being that it would leave a vacancy here batiste said he pulled himself up straighter getting to business which is what this is about i notice you arent taking this years lieutenants exam you dont want to make more money more money would be good then what maybe i dont want to be a lieutenant maybe i dont want to leave homicide typically a promotion to lieutenant meant a transfer out of the detail to which an officer had been assigned there were exceptions to this rule batiste himself had been a homicide inspector before his promotion that wasnt something to count on but batiste was hinting that it could happen again with abe but of course first he had to take the exam batiste opened the side drawer of his desk and took out a giant handful of peanuts in the shell he dumped them on the desk between them then grabbed one and cracked it the peanuts were a constant in the homicide detail no one remembered when or how theyd first arrived but they were always there thats fine if thats what you want i just didnt want it to be an oversight i know youve had a lot on your mind lately batiste chewed and cracked another peanut busy with it this was awkward ground you want my opinion you want to take the test keep your options open glitsky gave it a minute then nodded okay ill do that thanks for mentioning it good the sound of peanuts being cracked neither of the men moved hey frank yeah another long moment batiste took another handful of nuts out of his drawer and glitsky got up dropped his shells into the waste basket looked out through the open entrance of batistes office then sat back down are you sure there isnt anything else i could handle it there was like what like ive got so much on my mind that im not doing my job glitskys voice remained matteroffact but his eyes became distant that id be better off pushing paper as a lieutenant in the traffic division than as a lowly inspector with a real jobin homicide the eyes rested on his lieutenant id like to know frank i really would if im an embarrassment whos saying that his shoulders sagged i am i guess im asking i couldnt close on levon copes then i get assigned this clown who shoots up the tastee burger when there is no investigation to conduct but it keeps me off the streets this kind of stuff it makes me wonder batiste had stopped with the peanuts he shook his head nobodys saying anything like that abe i dont even think it glitsky took a breath a beat another one three batiste you all right im reading everything wrong frank sorry i didnt mean to lay it on you im just getting everything wrong batiste told abe he didnt have to worry so much about what he might be doing wrong so what if he wasted a few minutes they worked in the citys last bastion where results not hours were what counted if glitsky felt he wasnt on all cylinders enough were still firing to get the job done so he should put aside the doubts about why he thought it was dooher sometimes professionals had hunches you asked yourself every question you could think of even if you didnt exactly know why you needed to ask it answering them all probably wouldnt take fifteen minutes then he could go talk to lily martin again or felicia diep or the pope which gave glitsky an idea by the way i met your girlfriend again the other night i think she likes you wes farrell leaning against the padded back wall was sitting on the hardwood floor on the squash court breathing hard dooher wasnt even winded he was absently whacking the ball into the wall hitting it back on the short hop a machine ive got so many wes which one are we talking about the pretty one dooher inclined his racket slightly the ball bounced shot straight up off his racket and arced into his waiting palm theyre all pretty he said smiling theyre not all as pretty as she is the girl from fior dltalia christina your summer clerk ring a bell dooher corrected him one of my summer clerks wes i think were bringing on about ten and i hate to ruin your fantasies but weve remained platonic i thought i was talking about your fantasies i have no fantasies i live an ordered and disciplined life which is why i will beat you in this next game besides sheila and i are enjoying a little renaissance right at the moment dooher gave his practiced shrug minimizing personal complicity in all the good things such as his wifes sexual favors that constantly came his way and bounced the ball off the floor double or nothing im ready whered you see her farrell slowly pulled himself to his feet actually im having a little renaissance myself with lydia lydia who her names sam he was all the way on his feet now half limping holding his back how did i get so decrepit anyway i eat right i drink right am i not at this very moment exercising dooher was tossing the ball up and down catching it without looking whose name is sam my girlfriend you fool and christina carrera is a friend of hers we were at a dinner party and my name came up wes shrugged when we realized half the people there knew you i said you werent as bad as you appeared im afraid i told them your vietnam story doohers face clouded for a moment that story i dont think its come up once in the past ten years and just the other day dooher explained about glitsky so i showed him the picture what was christinas reaction to all this talk of me she didnt need your tragic background to think you were a hero shes one of your fans obviously someone has deluded her into thinking you are a sweet and gentle soul under that craggy exterior shes got a keen insight into human nature dooher said maybe ill give her a raise chapter sixteen it wasnt exactly the pope but glitskys polish was pretty ragged anyway he figured the archbishop was close enough flahertys appointments secretary was initially inclined to be coldly officious but after glitsky had explained that he needed a personal appointment with his excellency to talk about the murder of one of his flock the man had first gotten interested then had thawed he checked flaherty had a two oclock but his lunch had broken up early he was in the office right now would glitsky wait a moment okay the secretary had told him if he could get down to the chancery office the archbishop would give him between when he arrived and his appointment say twenty minutes if he flew he flew the windows were open and the sound of children playing down below drifted up to them they sat kittycorner in wingchairs the spartan office was chilly glitsky kept his jacket zipped the rest of the room reinforced the theme of minimal creature comfort berber rug flattop desk computer the chairs some photos of flaherty with unknowns and kids and sports figures a crucifix a wall of books with no pretension or sign of earthly power it was nothing that glitsky had expected neither was the man himself in his black pants scuffed loafers white socks green and white striped dress shirt the archbishop might have been a highschool teacher the gray eyes though were singular intelligence there glitsky thought lots of it the ability to calculate to see through things but in spite of that he didnt seem to be following glitskys line of questioning are you saying that mark dooher told you we had a meeting here on monday a week ago he didnt say that no good because that didnt happen there was no meeting to talk about an increase in the settlement you were willing to give mr trang yes we had that meeting but it was it must have been three weeks ago maybe more and we decided no we were sticking with the six hundred thousand clearly the settlement issue still rankled but flaherty wanted to go back im curious you said you talked to mark mr dooher is that right so if he didnt mention this meeting who did victor trangs girlfriend and his mother independently glitsky felt he ought to explain a little further ive been talking to people as theyve been available sir dooher was first where did you even get that connection dooher to trang flaherty might try to present a low profile but he was used to command glitsky sat back kept his voice low dooher called missing persons him the girlfriend the mother thats where i started and dooher didnt volunteer anything about the meeting but since that time ive heard about it from two sources im trying to find out if it happened why didnt you go back to dooher now glitsky leaned forward made some eye contact excuse me sir but do you mind if i ask a couple of the questions thats how we usually do this the archbishop let go with a deepthroated laugh recovered told glitsky he was sorry to go ahead hed shut up so there was no meeting no not that monday night not any night as i said we discussed the settlement terms at one of our regular daytime business meetings glitsky consulted the notes hed taken with lily martin you never discussed the figure of a million six hundred thousand no chance mark wouldnt even have brought me a figure like that he knows that would have been insane hell what we did offer the six hundred that wasinsane but trang turned it down the archbishop shrugged people are greedy sergeant its one of the cardinal sins and i bet you wouldnt be surprised how often it comes up so where was it going from there the lawsuit id guess mr trang was going to amend the complaint and then file it and lose thats what everybody seems to think which makes me wonder why he was going to do it another shrug it was a power play sergeant pure and simple thats all it was mr trang evidently thinks thought that we have infinitely deep pockets he was i gather inexperienced in these matters and evidently thought he could get more simply by holding out putting the squeeze on a little tighter but the suit itself had little merit and yet you were going to settle for six hundred thousand dollars flaherty broke a cold smile he hesitated uncrossed his legs and leaned in toward glitsky in real life sergeant an untrue accusation can be as damning as a conviction we were willing to pay something to keep a lid on the accusation but not a million six no not even half that as ive told you did dooher ever mention to you how he felt about trang personally no didnt like him or dislike him he was an adversary i dont think they saw each other socially if thats what you mean flaherty sat back you cant honestly think mark dooher could have had a hand in any of this do you glitsky pointed a finger toygun style risking a faint smile youre asking questions again but the answer is i dont have a clue trangs death seems to have been good for the archdiocese finally a degree of frustration peeked through sergeant were in constant litigation about one thing or the other one lawsuit one scandal more or less just isnt going to make too much difference and thats gods truth not that glitsky necessarily bought it but that direction wasnt taking him anywhere all right one last question do you have an appointments calendar i might glance at see what you were doing that monday night this marked the obvious crossing of the archbishops threshold into active annoyance flaherty nodded curtly stood up and went to the door and out in a moment he returned with a large black book he carefully placed it open onto glitskys lap that the day yes sir he looked down catholic youth organization convention do you remember that did it go on late flaherty was no longer glitskys friend that was certain but he answered civilly it was at asilomar sergeant down in pacific grove you know it its a hundred miles south of here he picked the book up and closed it firmly and see the line here to noon the next day that means i spent the night in one of those amazing coincidences glitsky thought just then there was a knock on the door and the appointments secretary opened it stuck his head in and told flaherty that his two oclock had arrived glitsky looked at his watch closed his notebook and stood up the interview was over he put out his hand and the archbishop took it thank you sir youve been a big help flahertys grip was a vice and his eyes had gone the color of cold steel you know sergeant i try not to stand upon it but most people address me at least as father some even say your excellency glitsky squeezed back thank you ill remember next time but what did it mean hed better begin to consider the possibility that there had been no meeting on monday night at least not with flaherty and dooher so why did the two women lily martin and mrs trang both think there had been but wait who said the meeting had been in person in flahertys office maybe flaherty hadnt been able to talk to dooher until later because but no that meant flaherty was at the least just plain lying and at most implicated in the actual murder and though glitsky ran into liars every day murderers too he did not really believe the archbishop was involved here hed just not been able to resist the urge to jack him up a little hed always had a problem with people who thought they spoke directly to god hed picked up a piroshki and a celery soda and sat having a late lunch in his car just off market street his windows down it was warmer outside than it had been in flahertys office and the air smelled sharply of coffee one of the nearby restaurants must be roasting its own he kept coming back to the meeting or nonmeeting for now he was going to believe that the meeting never took place further he didn t believe flaherty had even talked to dooher on that monday night which did not mean that dooher hadnt talked to trang did it glitsky was wrestling with it trying to piece together some rationale for trang to have written up messages on his personal computer purporting to have come from dooher if there had been none it could have been that he was going to extraordinarily great lengths to run a false story past his mother and girlfriend see im just on the cusp of greatness just about to be rich and successful its going to happen any day now the other side is about to cave in look here are the messages from their attorney to prove it im not a nothing as youve all believed im going to make it big was that too much of a stretch glitsky wasnt sure hed known a lot of people perennial losers whod tried to fool themselves and others in similar ways maybe that had been trang trying to convince himself as well as the women in his life and then when the settlement didnt come through after all hed fall back into victim mode it hadnt been his fault the breaks were against him the power of the church the bigger players had ganged up but glitsky brought himself up short the truth was that there had been a substantial offer six hundred thousand dollars had been on the table and trang had turned it down would he have done that if he wasnt fairly sure he was going to get more no he would have taken it which meant what that the pennyante psychological profile glitsky had been drawing of trangasloser was not valid and if that were true then at the very least trang believed something was happening with dooher and the settlement he hadnt made it all up or possibly any of it so dooher had called him twice on that monday maybe three times he wondered if hed admit it it didnt exactly reek of probable cause but glitsky knew he could find a judge to give him a warrant for doohers phone records based on the inconsistencies but if dooher hadnt called trang from his home or office any other call would be nearly impossible to verify the phone company kept track of the calls you made but didnt keep records of nontoll calls received he chewed the last of his piroshki tipped back the soda well at least now he had a plausible excuse to go back and talk to dooher take another look at the vietnam photograph while he was at it maybe casually bring up some other topics say i was doing the crossword this morning and came across a sevenletter word starts with b means infantry knife what do you think that could be subtlety was the key dooher was going to be in meetings out of the office for most of the rest of the afternoon but if he checked in for messages his secretary would tell him the sergeant had called so the rest of glitskys wednesday afternoon was lost in paperwork he labored over his initial report on the tastee burger killing he checked the transcription of his interviews with three of the witnesses there moving along he filled out the warrant for doohers business and personal phone records then there was the application for the lieutenants exam a final homicide issue involved rebooking a burglar whod killed a seventyyearold man last week the elderly resident had had the bad luck to wake up and grab his in the middle of the night when hed heard the noise at completely fried with the paperwork as he was putting on his jacket to go home his telephone rang this is mark dooher he said to himself and it was dooher was free now but maybe if the sergeant just had a quick question or two he could answer it on the phone save him a trip glitsky wondered if he really needed to actually see the vietnam photograph again it was quitting time he wanted to go home and be with his family hed worked a long day as it was he wasnt the same cop he had been he said some questions should do it sure i talked to him that day more than once i may have i believe so why when you and i talked last time you didnt mention it did you ask about it im sorry i dont i thought it might have occurred to you as relevant talking to a murdered man just before he was killed no answer do you recall what you talked about sure he was asking for my strategic advice on another case he was handling as i told you we kind of hit it off i think he was hoping id offer him a job at the firm here you didnt discuss the settlement of your suit another pause no not that i recall although he was threatening to file it the next day ratcheting up the figures and then wed duke it out in court thats how we do it sergeant those lines had been drawn there wasnt anything to talk about and he didnt seem concerned worried anxious not to me he seemed normal do you remember what the other case was about the one he wanted your advice on sure it was another settlement on a personal injury sergeant am i under some kind of suspicion here the case is still open glitsky said ambiguously ive been trying to get a sense of what mr trang did in those last hours but may as well just come out with it did you have a bayonet as part of your gear in vietnam so much for the subtle approach it sounds like i should contact my lawyer or just answer the question yes i did did a bayonet kill victor we believe so do you still have yours no the army takes it from you when they send you home do you mind telling me where you were last monday night a sigh perhaps an angry one i believe i went to the driving range then came back to the office here and worked late sergeant glitsky why on earth do you think id consider killing a man any man much less victor whom ive told you i liked i didnt say i did im collecting all the information i can hoping some of it leads somewhere the implications are pretty damn infuriating im sorry about that archbishop flaherty thought so too you talked to the archbishop about this hes your biggest client isnt he by far so and trangs death means the suit gets dropped trangs death means mrs diep gets another lawyer sergeant and thats all it means chapter seventeen the earthquake that rocked the city at the next morning wasnt as destructive as the world series quake of it didnt collapse any part of the bay bridge for example or any freeways however with a magnitude of and an epicenter just a mile into the ocean northwest of the cliff house it was by no means a minor temblor the eventual damage total exceeded million seventyseven people were injured seriously enough to seek medical help and four people died bart was going insane he jumped up on farrells bed howling like a coyote rather than the intelligent and sensitive boxer that farrell knew him to be so something must be wrong but wes had no idea what it could be he cast a quick glance at the clock next to his bed what the hell bart bart come on boy its all right its all right but apparently bart knew more than his owner on this score wes was grabbing for the dogs collar to pull him nearer it sounded like he was dying wes was thinking i knew i shouldnt have given him that lamb bone thats what it is its cut his stomach to shreds he flicked on the light holding the dog close now murmuring to him petting to try and calm him down please dont die come on hang in there ill call wham it was a sharp upanddown similar to the northridge quake that had done so much damage to southern california the experts later estimated that the shock was equal to a vertical drop of five and half feet it was probably fortunate that farrell had no art on his walls and very little furniture so there wasnt much to fall or fly around after one terrified bark coupled with a desperate escape maneuver involving claws and fangs that scratched farrells face badly bart got himself to a corner of the room and set up another howl the lights went out there was a second smaller jolt and farrell rolled from his bed and started crawling eventually arriving at the bedroom doorway his hands gripping both sides of it for support should the foundations shake again his hands were sticky and wet glitsky hadnt been able to sleep and didnt want to keep flo up so at around midnight hed gone out to read on the couch in the living room taking a cue from his father nat a talmud scholar he had been immersed for weeks in wilton earnhardts epic tome gospel a story about the missing new testament book of matthias this was about as far from san francisco crime and politics and his home life as he could get which was the point eventually hed nodded off what got him up wasnt the shock but flo screaming his name the lamp next to him crashed to the floor sparks and broken pottery one of the kids he thought it was jake his middle one was also calling him god why were the other ones quiet abe yo coming another shake knocking him sideways bare feet on broken shards in the short hallway he turned on the light another step the bedroom the light flo looked at him eyes wide and tearful as though he were a ghost as well he might have been the six or sevenhundred pound oak armoire in which they kept their hanging clothes had jumped four feet across the room and fallen landing on glitskys side of the bed where he normally would have been lying flo was up and in his arms and jake cried out again sheila dooher nudged her husband earthquake she said swinging her feet around finding the floor louder another push mark now people said you never got used to earthquakes but sheila had lived in the bay area most of her life and had experienced over twenty of them the great majority of the time they shook the ground or the building you were in and then stopped and the other quakes well by the time you worked yourself up to really scared they were over and then you dealt with what theyd done mark opened his eyes immediately awake in the darkness he knew that sheila had moved to her prearranged location in the doorway to the stairs it was a drill and he did the same to his four steps over to the bathroom door you all right he heard her say there was another smaller shake they rode it out three seconds max fine for sam duncan living in a seventyyearold underground apartment with brick walls there was no time for any thought either quayle was a sounder sleeper than bart was or he wasnt as finely attuned to the tiny movements of the earth by which animals can supposedly predict earthquakes in any case quayle didnt whine or bark or howl preceding the event sam was sleeping one moment and the next feeling something moving falling around her in the split second she had to react covering her head as the wall behind her bed gave collapsing over her chapter eighteen before christina was awake her father bill had gone downtown to the bakery and come back with hot hamandswissfilled croissants her favorite irene her mother left the steaming cup of french roast on the nightstand in her room and brushed a strand of hair back over her daughters ear she stirred your coffees here her mother said having driven down to ojai in six hours shed arrived unannounced at tenthirty last night and theyd kept the visiting short she was tired and planning to stay through the weekend get rested before finals next week theyd get time to catch up in person theyd all turned in early around midnight late april before noon and she was sitting out by the pool in her bathing suit in perfect comfort she wondered again why she was living in san francisco in the wind and fog and bustle here it was already warm as midsummer the pace was slow life itself seemed to have an element of fluid grace her parents house was on the side of one of the encircling hills at an elevation of about feet and the pool hung out cantilevered over a deck that seemed to drop off into space far below the town sparkled in the pristine air a little terracotta jewel nestled in its verdant setting in the distance the topa topa mountains and the los padres national forest lent some drama to the view closer in were the avocado and orange orchards the golf course the orangeroofed landmarks of her own childhood over to the right she could just spy the edge of her high school villanova for good catholic girls as she had been there was the tower at the post office and in the peace of the morning she could hear some enchanted evening coming up on the thermals the tower played show tunes on the hour her eyes continued to roam there were the trees over libbey park downtown where shed gone to dozens of incredible concerts blues classical jazz rock n roll all the great la players loved coming up here this is where hollywood came to drop out ojai was the chumash indian word for nest and she thought it captured the place perfectly it was her nest her home she wondered again if shed ever really have another one her mother was walking down from the house with some iced tea she normally worked in her husbands brokerage house as his assistant but decided shed take the day off to catch up with her daughter irene carrera had a buffed leather complexion from too much sun and her body toned with regular exercise was still twenty pounds overweight nevertheless in a casual way she believed herself a beautiful woman and so nearly everyone else thought she was too she frosted her hair and wore gold slippers padding about out by the pool and she appeared to be as shallow as a petri dish but shed never fooled christina now she sat in the wicker chair next to her daughters chaise longue put down the tray that held the pitcher and glasses and placed coasters on either side of the table you picked the right day to come down san franciscos had another earthquake christina sat up straight a bad one her mother handed her a glass theyre saying moderately serious although if you ask me theyre all bad you can ask me too do you want to call anybody no no they dont want you to use the phones after emergencies anyway mom besides she took a sip theres nobody to call her mother sat back gestured to her daughters left hand your father and i noticed theres no ring we didnt want to press last night i guess were not going to be meeting joe i guess not a sigh it was my decision it wasnt going to work out irene took a minute stalling with her iced tea lemon sugar mint you gave it enough of a chance youre sure christina shrugged come on mom you know over a year it just wasnt she trailed off im not sad about it so i dont think you should be im not sad about you and joe hon i worry about you thats all these relationships that get to she took a deep breath and plunged ahead to intimacy that go on a year or more then end they must be taking their toll i know christina was nodding they are i just look at you now and i know this is foolish dont laugh at me and i dont see my happy little girl it just breaks my poor silly heart christina started to stop her but her mother touched her shoulder and continued no i know what youve been through i do or a little with brian and the pregnancy and now this i do know hon how it must hurt how youre trying but it just seems to me that every time you give up when you let it end then part of you dies the part that hopes and you dont want to lose that a tear coursed down christinas cheek she wiped it with a finger the good news is i didnt put much hope in joe then why did you say youd marry him i dont know i was stupid i wanted to convince myself that i could do just what you said commit to somebody and make it stick to get there mom you know what i mean you get so tired of waiting of things being empty her mother sat back in her chair and looked for a moment out to the horizon it has to be right thats all the right person to begin with yeah well where is he thats what i want to know mom where the hell is he christina its mark dooher mark are you all right a refined chuckle im fine i was worried about you weve had a pretty good earthquake up here you might have heard several people didnt make work and you were one of them so we tried to reach you at home and you never called back was i scheduled to come in ive got finals next week i wasnt starting until after that i thought i told joe no no its all right i was concerned thats all i remember youd told me about ojai so i thought id see if your parents had heard from you if you were okay i am in fact i thought of you five minutes ago were drinking champagne remember the lost art of pouring i do how is it down there by the way she looked out through the french doors a balmy evening was settling its the pink moment she said the classic pink moment she could almost see his grin im on my car phone just at the army street curve on my way home and its the classic gray moment here a moment went by i heard about you and joe im sorry yes well the pause seemed a little awkward to christina she was thinking that mark didnt want to push but then he spoke up well good luck on your finals then and well see you in a couple of weeks ill be there i know you will if its any help to you joe should be down in la by then there shouldnt be any awkwardness i know i guess no guesses this is a promise if you have any problems i want you to come see me hear i hear i will okay then there was a crackle on the line sorry the calls breaking up you hang in there christina thingsll turn around you watch im glad youre okay i am and mark yes thanks for checking it matters it might be the pink moment but it was also the yellow jacket moment at dusk the vicious bees seemed to come up like locusts scouring the foothills for food and making outdoor hors doeuvres a challenge at best but it was one to which bill and irene rose whenever they could christina remembered sitting inside a hundred times as a child afraid to go out until one day her father had sat her down look we can either go outside where the weathers great and weve got the view and the air and things taste better except we ve got the chance of being molested by yellow j ackets or we can sit cooped inside wishing there werent such a thing as yellow jackets but definitely inside and definitely not having half the fun ill take the risk every time so tonight they had broken out some paté three kinds of cheeses cornichons french bread the works after shed hung up with dooher she stood a moment at the french doors looking out at her parents who were sitting in their matching wicker chairs holding hands laughing at something okay she thought there was her father and there was mark dooher two good ones it wasnt impossible she would simply have to bide her time do her work live her life the pink shifted almost imperceptibly to motherofpearl and she stood in the door struck by her third revelation this week the first had been that she didnt love joe then recognizing something deeper something fundamentally different and better in the way she and mark dooher related something that would be part of her from now on of any future she had then watching her parents the last illumination that she was still afraid of the yellow jackets so wary of being bitten that she was afraid to go outside that was why she had always settled for her lesser men it was so clear now suddenly and so wrongheaded there had always been yellow jackets on otherwise perfect evenings and shed never gotten stung and taking that risk of getting stung put you out where you really wanted to be it was the only way with luck to get you to where her parents had gotten to where she wanted to be chapter nineteen of course nothing happened to you wes said why did i even feel like i had to ask in fact now that i think about it im surprised some fissure didnt open in your backyard revealing a vein of gold i didnt tell you about that dooher put a hand on his friends shoulder just kidding he said hows the face farrell had needed seven stitches and a tetanus shot he had one bandage under his blackened left eye another on the side of his mouth lets go with unpleasant no hows it feel farrell gave him a look funny it was friday morning a little before noon the day after the quake and they were in wess office dooher took a seat in the ragged armchair his friend was putting books back on the shelves bart giving no sign that hed ever been jumpy in his life slept under the table so howd your office make out wes asked dont tell me it wasnt touched a little its a relatively new building with all the codes up to date they dont shake much farrell turned around you mean nothing dont you nothing structural couple of bookshelves fell over like here not like here mark not like here here we got cracks in all the walls maybe you didnt notice the place has got to get completely repainted we got plaster in the ducts the waters out in the bathroom every single one of my books hit the floor running he whirled further around pointing picking up some steam that window check it out is now plywood he blew out a long breath no no decidedly not just like here bart came awake barked once went back to sleep dooher sympathetic as a hangman held up a hand du calme wesley du calme ducalme my ass easy for you to say his body sagging farrell crossed to his desk and edged himself onto the corner of it i know theres no justice in the world and nothing happens for any reason its all random i know all of that but what i dont understand is why all this perverse random shit happens to me its like grace dooher said and dont give me any of that catholic stuff either not that grace dooher crossed a leg enjoying himself this lady grace shes born ugly as sin halfblind one leg missing her hair never grows she gets cancer at thirteen a mess dies horribly and goes up to the pearly gates god looks at her says grace youre going to hell but why she asks why god ive tried to be a good person tried to please you suffered my whole life i dont know grace god says theres just something about you that pisses me off farrell was shaking his head i can understand why that joke would appeal to you you are lucky i on the other hand am cursed oh bullshit wes people stop stop i know what youre going to say that people make their own luck that is what every lucky person in the world says and that is bullshit he pushed himself off the desk stepping on barts tail ruff you dog shut up i dont want to hear anymore out of you back to dooher look at me here mark look at me my apartment is trashed my office is ruined my fucking dog mans best mauling machine nearly tears my head off he sank back to his corner of the desk staring at his shoes wes tm sorry im just a whining sack arent i but i have to tell you sometimes the weight of what appears to be random bad luck just gets a little hard to take its not like i want something terrible to happen to you but dont you sometimes wonder when it never does does this mean something about me jesus hey come on dooher got out of his chair walked over to his bud put his arms around him come on i love you wes you know that you need help here ill send over some of my associates you need it at home some money whatever you got it you want ill put a couple of gashes into my own face bleed a little farrell looked up shook his head in disgust im a waste arent i dooher pinched his good cheek but cute come on let me buy you some lunch it wasnt fancy but the chinese food was spicy hot and excellent there were only six tables in the place and farrell took the opportunity to point out that he came here twice a week and never got an empty table but mark dooher walked in the door and there was one with his name on it and no they didnt mind if the dog came in too the owner had a dog looked just like bart this led farrell to wonder aloud if there was any part of doohers experience untouched by good fortune for the record ive got some pretty estranged screwedup kids and you dont i never see my kids farrell said but when you do they dont hate you do they no at least i dont think so mine hate me my failed artist namesake son hates me my lesbian daughter hates me my skiboard bum son hates me they dont trust me they do you know it too now i dont know whether thats luck or not but its not good i must have had something to do with it okay thats serious your life isnt perfect i apologize a macho shrug doohers minilesson in handling the pain the way a man should its life he said it hits us all which is actually since were on the subject why i wanted to see you this morning more bad luck for me but this is business what business i want to put you on retainer for a while as my personal attorney farrell stopped with his chopsticks halfway to his mouth im listening victor trang okay what about him i think the police think i might have killed him get out you are you kidding me i dont think so why do they think that i dont know im not even a hundred percent sure they do but this cop glitsky called me the other glitsky yeah thats his name you know him he was the cop handling my last case levon copes screwed it up completely well thats a relief he might be screwing up this one too he thinks you killed victor trang why take it easy wes im not sure but hes called me back a couple of times zeroing in asking questions where was i did i talk to trang that kind of thing and you answered him dooher shrugged sure ive got nothing to hide why wouldnt i talk to him that doesnt matter the first rule is never talkto a cop about a crime in your timezone without your lawyer sitting there but i didnt doesnt matter what did he ask what did you tell him does this mean youre on retainer farrell nodded yeah of course what do you think it was quarter past noon on friday afternoon glitsky was walking the hallway on the th floor heading back to homicide hed spent the morning interviewing witnesses who lived in apartments on either side of his seventyyearold victim whod owned a handgun for protection the man whose last thought had been that his gun was going to help him if a burglar ever broke in nope the last couple of days had been well over the line into surreal at home the earthquake damage had been serious but miraculously all cosmetic theyd straightened up the armoire and rehung the clothes in the boys room jake had been crying out because it was dark and hed been tipped out of his bed isaac and oj had remained so quiet because theyd slept through it all as he had he reminded himself if flo hadnt yelled out for him then all day yesterday his wife wouldnt stay still she had been up and around throwing away the broken dishes shards of pottery and glass straightening vacuuming rearranging even washing the windows nesting nesting the day of the quake hed stayed home a good day for it as it turned out there was not one homicide reported in san francisco today day two he couldnt stand seeing flo working so hard singing to herself reborn so much energy and sense of purpose it was going to come crashing down he couldnt let himself get his hopes up this was pure adrenaline hers he wanted no part of it and she didnt want him moping around bring her down theyd almost had a fight about it would have if he hadnt left so hed gone to his morning interviews now back at the hall his plan was to call around line up some more witnesses on his other cases call the phone company and check on the progress of mark doohers records there was a package on his desk and he ripped it open the phone records on dooher werent supposed to be delivered for at least another day maybe two or three but now here he was holding them in his hands wonders did never cease doohers home was easy hed made no phone calls at all on the monday that trang had been killed his office was a little more interesting hed called trang twice and precisely the times noted in the dead mans computer which meant that if trang had been making up a story to impress his mother and girlfriend major elements of it were close to the truth his pulse quickening the thrill of the chase indeed glitsky turned to the last little packet of sheets there as promised by trang was the third call from doohers cellphone at and even though glitsky thought the official policy on miscreants in san francisco was three strikes and youre misunderstood this time he was getting willing to call dooher out he sat back in his chair feet up on his desk wondering what if anything it meant trangs computer notes might have been cryptic but they also told a consistent story mark dooher was working on the settlement not acting as an adviser on a personal injury case as hed claimed glitsky could imagine no reason why trang would lie to himself in his electronic notebook and here was another tantalizing entry md from f s the call that glitsky had interpreted to mean that dooher had called from flahertys office but in fact hed made it from his car what did that mean was it possible that f wasnt flaherty another thought did trang even have any personal injury cases in his files this glitsky thought was a job for the evereager paul thieu and the note md message there might be something the lab could salvage from the tape that had been in trangs answering machine even if it had been recorded over he leaned forward pulled his yellow pad toward him and started writing he longed to catch dooher in his lie in any lie there had to be one in a kind of trance he was lost in his notes then staring into the space in front of him he picked up the telephone and punched some numbers law offices hello this is sergeant glitsky san francisco homicide id like to talk to mr doohers secretary please and im sorry i dont remember her name janey thats it thanks mr doohers office janey yes another introduction a little riff of bureaucratese then he was saying janey i need to confirm a couple of things your boss told me this is just routine it turned out janey did remember the call from trang on the day he had died hed called while dooher was at lunch left an urgent message that dooher get back to him this was about the settlement deadline isnt that right janey paused perhaps wondering if she was saying too much glitsky didnt want to lose her im sorry he said that was the impression i had let her think hed gotten it from dooher it worked janey continued mr trang reminded me to tell mr dooher that he needed to hear from him before five no later or that hed have to go ahead and file the amended complaint the next day so trangs call to dooher had been about the settlement janey had said as much and that made dooher a liar and if that were true it dramatically increased the odds that at the very least dooher knew more than he was letting on and at the most that he was a killer glitsky was bouncing it off frank batiste the lieutenant was sitting forward in his chair in his office arms on his desk pencil in hand shaking his head i believe you although id be a little happier if you had any idea why wasnt it you whos told us a zillion times that were not in the motive business were in the evidence business yep that was me and i was right so so what wheres your evidence then batiste continued drumming his pencil because we agree you dont have a motive but glitsky didnt want to let the motive go in his experience people didnt often get killed not by someone they knew for no reason whatever look the archdiocese is doohers biggest client if the case gets filed he gets fired why would that happen because he hasnt done his job which is keep the lawsuit hush hush and why would that be glitsky rolled his eyes because frank its politically embarrassing to the archbishop so to keep it from getting filed dooher kills trang thats a reach abe i know but its all i can think of batiste straightened up bopped his pencil a couple more times stretched out the crick in his neck are you sure youre not just on dooher because you havent got any other suspects maybe there arent any other suspects because he did it frank maybe thats it batiste didnt want to fight about it he took a beat well that was instructive and a hell of a lot of fun we should do it again sometime this was where we started isnt it no motive so lets leave motive you came in here wanting to talk evidence evidence is good what do you got but there wasnt much glitsky had gotten his search warrant for doohers phone records by trotting out the old probable cause argument to judge arenson who knew him fairly well and was aware that he didnt abuse the privilege now the question was whether the information in the phone records the three calls that coincided with trangs notes moved things along the probablecause trail glitsky knew that the judge wasnt about to give him carte blanche on the more invasive search warrants he was going to want to request doohers house office car and so on unless there was something real whether or not it was physical evidence to back up glitskys suspicions he was hoping the phone calls would be enough but batiste wasnt buying that either and didnt think arenson would so is this just your day to be difficult frank or what the pencil was taptapping again what do they prove abe the calls dooher said they were talking about a personal injury case trangs notes say it was the settlement even as he said it glitsky knew the objection and it was valid so its he said this but he said that but doohers secretary janey agrees with trang she didnt overhear the last two calls why would trang have written fictitious notes to himself on the calls that just doesnt make any sense batiste held up the pencil abe even if they talked about the settlement even if dooher is lying about it we got nothing maybe dooher was sleeping with trangs girlfriend or his mother glitsky said maybe his girlfriend and his mother batiste liked it now were on to something glitskys lips were pressed tightly together in frustration and the scar stood out in relief i need a warrant ive got to look through the guys laundry batiste didnt think so arenson wont do it not with what youve got so far youre going to need more what about the bayonet he never brought it home from viet stopping short batiste broke a smile says he lord im stupid the wife if she invited him in he would not need a warrant he kept a white shirt and regimental tie in the drawer of his desk for the occasional forgotten court date he changed in the mens room and traded his flight jacket until tomorrow for frank batistes gray sports coat a little short in the sleeves but the chest fit it would do he was on the semienclosed front porch his badge out introducing himself to sheila dooher there had been sun and a cool breeze at the hall but out here a mile from the ocean the fog clung and a savage wind dug itself into his bones he didnt mind though at this moment it was to his advantage the victor trang case youre familiar with that yes it was really such a tragedy mark was very upset about it yes he was id been planning on coming by a little later when your husband was home but i was in the neighborhood and thought i could save some time i wanted to ask you a few questions too me yes maam what about i didnt even know victor trang glitsky shrugged but you know where your husband was on the night of the murder yes well i dont know you dont think i dont think anything at the moment mrs dooher but the fact is that your husband was one of the last people we know who talked to victor trang so farfetched as it might seem to you hes a suspect and you could eliminate that possibility right now was he here that night monday a week ago he noticed that she was gripping the door handle her face set eyes shifting i think i should call mark she said you could do that but you understand that anything you say to me now before talking with him will have a lot more weight you could verify his alibi right now and that would be the end of any suspicion he added conspiratorially really maam it would be a good thing she wrestled with it a moment then dredged it up monday night he went to the driving range i think i could check thats what your husband said glitsky broke his smile see that wasnt so bad behind him the wind gusted and sheila dooher seemed to notice it for the first time im sorry sergeant would you like to come in out of this weather i wouldnt mind now that you mention it she fixed him a cup of tea they were sitting on either side of a marble bar in a skylit kitchen that was about the size of glitskys duplex through the french doors he had a partial view of an expanse of manicured lawn a patch of early daffodils stubbly bare roots and trunks marking an ancient rose garden he took a slow sip of the tea swallowed then plunged in mrs dooher your husband was very upset by victor trangs death he asked me if there was anything he could do to help with our investigation her expression pleasant concern teased at the edges of his conscience but more importantly it meant that dooher hadnt told her that he was under suspicion thats mark she said waiting for glitsky to continue i really didnt think much about it until we discovered that trang had been stabbed with a bayonet oh god how horrible he nodded yes maam it was bad but the point is we werent able to go much farther than that the weapon hasnt been found undoubtedly the murderers thrown it away anyway i mentioned all this to your husband he wanted to be kept in the loop telling me that if we could just identify exactly what kind ofbayonet it was from the size of the blade and so on he assayed a smile speaking more quickly now hoping to keep her riding on the flow of verbiage the forensics guys can tell these things that we might be able to determine where it had been bought or what war it might have been used in that kind of thing and from there maybe get a lead as to where the murderer might have got it he hoped she was paying attention still with him i was hoping to compare it with the one your husband brought back from vietnam trang being vietnamese it might narrow it down to someone in that community its a long shot but might be worth checking she was nodding im not sure i completely understand but it sounds like it might be a good idea she stood up i think its out in the garage up pretty high you might have to help me get it do you mind chapter twenty by dusk farrell still hadnt reached sam it worried him enough that he decided to drive by her house find out what was going on yesterday the day of the quake okay lots of lives had been disrupted his own more than many others while he was trying to get his own mess cleaned up hed tried to call sam a few times but had no luck hed been sure hed get her today but hed started calling as soon as he woke up had placed maybe two dozen calls and nothing her machine hadnt even picked up neither had the phone at the clinic no one had heard from her her brother larry had an unlisted number farrell eventually even thought to call dooher back after their surprising lunch to see if by any chance he had christina carreras number if she might have heard from sam but no dooher said christina was in ojai visiting her parents why and how did mark know that the first indication that something might really be wrong was the construction equipment all the way up ashbury street stopping traffic trying to get up over twin peaks farrell was in his datsun painted by his son six years previously in what lydia called a fetching puke yellow lydia was driving the metallic green bmw he really hated her bart wasnt enjoying the wait in the fog and fumes anymore than he was finally when divine intervention produced a parking space he pulled in and decided he and bart would hoof it it was time bart met quayle anyway he thought he attached the dogs leash and they got out but drawing up close getting to sams block he was struck by the air of disaster and hurried his steps there were more than a few police cars plus other emergency vehicles a revolving knot of gawkers milled around in the street quietly taking in the destruction four brick structures in a row on the west side of the street with sams third on the way uphill had taken the big hit all of them had lost their chimneys a majority of their streetfacing windows though crews were still there and had obviously been at the cleaning a while piles of brick rubble and roof slate still littered the area supporting scaffolding had already been erected around the two downhill buildings but sams from the look of it might be beyond salvage the front corner appeared to have caved in completely and the entire house listed forward as though waiting for one more tiny aftershock to send it toppling my god he thought that was sams room she was in there farrell walked up to one of the blueuniformed policemen who were keeping the crowd from getting too close to the unstable structure excuse me i know somebody who lives in that building do you have any news about the tenants the cop turned around his eyes sympathetic have you tried the hospitals maybe id start there wes nodded mutely then stood another minute struck again by the power of moving earth excuse me he repeated do you know if anybody died in these buildings the cop shook his head commiserating conveying the worst id check the hospitals he said again once sheila dooher admitted that her husband had owned a bayonet although it was no longer in the garage glitsky thought that getting his search warrant would be easy he filled out his new one and brought it down to this weeks duty judge martin arenson but arenson like everyone else was cleaning up from the earthquake hed handed off his magistrate assignments to another municipal court judge ann connor and she hadnt been particularly receptive to abes version of probable cause shed refused to sign the warrant which put him in a bind since once one judge in the muni court declined to sign a warrant no one else there would touch it glitsky did have another option one hed used in emergencies in the past he could go to superior court and get a sealed warrant from one of the judges on the senior bench he was fairly well known in superior court since most trials he attended were for homicides and he was anxious to move quickly before dooher had a chance to hide or ditch anything else but the wife cant testify against him judge oscar thomasino had the search warrant in front of him on his clean desk awaiting his signature hed listened to glitskys tale and wasnt close to sold on more probable cause and am i wrong i dont see anything pointing to this man except your questionably legal search she let me in judge thomasino waved a hand sixtyish he wore his gray hair brush cut he had thick slab of a face a swarthy liverspotted complexion and a reputation as a judicial hardass it was friday night and he had been going home after a grueling week of earthquakerelated delays but glitsky had caught him at the back door and tried to guilt him back inside hed come but out of duty not guilt and now he wasnt disposed to be cooperative and he treated glitsky to his bushy eyebrow trick up and down over the glare no words i dont need her testimony your honor glitsky repeated i just need what might be in the house the judge smoothed his hands over the grain of his desk abe this is a prominent man not some lowlife from the projects not that as a matter of law that makes any difference of course and youre telling me you didnt find out anything incriminating from the phone records glitsky more or less agreed but tried to sweeten it by riffing around it for a couple of bars thomasino stopped him i dont see this one abe the judge straightened up in his chair considering something then decided to come out with it you know abe this business of coming to superior court when muni turns you down is tricky i know youve got good instincts you might even be right but what i see here i dont have enough connor didnt either judge thomasino held up his hand again i understand you cant go back to muni not now but youve got to get me a little more if you find it come by the house im around all weekend ill sign off but i need something i can point to do you even know where he was on the night in question he was killing victor trang a face the eyebrows okay but what does he say he says he went to the driving range then came back to his office and worked late well if he did that maybe somebody saw him or didnt that may be well good luck the judge said have a nice weekend glitsky was damned if he was going to find himself a picture of mark dooher and go trotting with it out to the citys driving ranges showing it to employees and asking if they specifically remembered seeing him a week and a half before if he thought that course of events would produce any results he might have considered it but he believed what hed told thomasino dooher had been killing trang that night not hitting golf balls but the bottom line was that he didnt have the signed warrant and couldnt go looking where he stood a chance of finding so what the hell else was he going to do pondering he was standing in the downstairs lobby of the hall by the elevators hands in his pockets oblivious to the passing throngs checking out for the weekend too much lemon in your tea abe amanda jenkins the assistant da whod shared levon copes with him had moved out of the flow of humanity and amused was looking up at him that expression i just sucked on a lemon its so you it so happens i did justsuck on a lemon he held up the unsigned warrant but whats really made my day is thomasinos call on this jenkins snatched it away and scanned it quickly this looks good to me house car office personal effects whats the problem youll notice the good judge didnt sign it my first choice for perp appears to be a pillar of the community so hes got a higher probable cause threshold than lesser mortals ah democracy aint it grand i dont have any evidence so i cant get permission to look for evidence its a beautiful system jenkins agreed so what do you have you got anything you must have something glitsky started to tell amanda what he did have his hunches the settlement background the discrepancy between trangs womens story and mark doohers the hazy alibi the bayonet that had mysteriously and apparently recently disappeared and finally the one search warrant thomasino had signed off on for doohers phone records they dont by any chance include a earphone do they yeah but so what jenkinss normally stern visage cracked her eyes lit up with excitement with the thrill of the chase you got time to take five get some coffee all may not be lost the downstairs cafeteria was nearly deserted cavernous and echoing with the cleanup workers efforts glitsky and jenkins brought their paper cups over from the long stainless steel counter and were sitting down across from one another at one of the foldup tables amanda was already rolling with it explaining the new technological investigatingtool breakthrough that had been discovered as a byproduct of the cellular phone network you never heard of it she enthused because i dont think anybodys ever used it to find out where someone was normally they use it to track where somebody is right now she could see glitsky still wasnt clear on the concept abe you remember that big kidnapransom thing in oakland last year okay the kidnapper hes calling the victims family every five minutes making ransom demands changing the drop point making sure theres no trail the usual so guess what hes using his earphone and one of our guys remembers an article in one of those magazines we all throw away he gets a brainstorm he calls the phone company asks if theres any way they can tell even roughly where a cell call originates you know how it works im listening big metropolitan area like oakland theres maybe ten towers around the city cells hence the name clever huh and they work like a combination amplifierreceiver if youre in your car you move from one cell to the next and theres a record of it okay but and this is the cool part within each cell there are also pieshaped cones that pick up the signals so this guy the kidnapper hes talking on the phone calling again yack yack yack they figure out exactly which block hes driving around and they nail him glitsky was nodding amanda was right this if true was cool but i dont see how it helps me here he said i dont either abe but thomasino said he only needed a little more to get to probable cause right so maybe your perp was ten miles away when he said he was at the driving range that kind of thing prove he lied hell youve got the warrant for the phone records already might as well use it all up sheila told him what shed done are you kidding me that son of a bitch he came in here lied to you invaded our privacy im calling farrell calling somebody this is pure harassment ill have the bastards badge he threw his leaded crystal bourbon glass with all his might and it smashed into the bottom pane of one of the french doors shattering glass all over the kitchen that son of a bitch sheila was in a deep couch in her living room crying she was of a class and station that had grown up believing in authority sergeant glitsky had represented that to her and he had betrayed her tricked her and used her to insult her husband she had put her husband in jeopardy she couldnt stop sobbing mark came over and handed her a large glass of white wine and she held it with both hands he sat down next to her its all right sheila how could you know she shook her head mumbling through her tears over and over i should have known i should have just called you he put the palm of his hand under her glass and helped her raise it to her lips she had to admit that it helped she took another mouthful the good cool wine shed been getting back to a glass or two regularly lately and it hadnt caused her any illeffects the doctors nowadays were always so paranoid about alcohol she should have started out taking their dire warnings with a grain of salt this wasnt hurting her at all in fact it was helping she got her breathing back under control the whole story didnt make much sense to me mark but i just thought its all right he repeated theres no harm done i didnt even have any damn bayonet i know but i didnt remember i lost the damn thing on a camping trip five ten years ago maybe longer you dont remember but why would he think the sergeant her husband shook his head i have no idea i knew trang maybe im the most convenient warm body i think thats how these guys work he reached out laid a hand on her shoulder so what happens now she asked timidly mark sat back into the couch now i think hell probably come back with a warrant and tear the house apart and maybe my car and the office ive got the m after all and hes seen it and some judge will probably believe that means something and give him the search warrant after all i did steal it from the army demonstrating my longstanding history of criminal moral character you were twentythree years old she cried you havent broken a law in almost twentyfive years well i did cut the tag off a mattress once dont be funny please not now she was shaking her head god this is unbelievable this cant be happening to us farrell kicked himself for being so stupid but at the moment he hadnt seen any alternative he had to drive all the way home in the lower sunset district to leave bart anyway and he decided to make his calls to hospitals from there ten minutes later he found himself in his car again driving the three miles back nearly an hour at this time on a friday night to within yards of where hes started st marys hospital wes hated almost everything about hospitals the smells the light the sound which somehow always seemed to be simultaneously muted and amplified as the elevator opened on the fourth floor he let out a sigh of relief this wasnt the intensive care unit he realized hed been afraid to ask he stopped at the door to the room the bed wasnt visible the room separators had been pulled halfway around it but larry and sally sams brother and his wife were sitting next to one another talking quietly hey comrades he said she never calls she never writes is this the party then seeing sam her head wrapped in gauze one arm above the blanket and one strapped to her body he came forward up beside her bed hi he found his hand clutched by her free one there were sickly black and yellow wells under both of her eyes a bandage over the bridge of her nose he saw her make the effort to try to smile to greet him but it cost her her eyes moistened and he leaned over to her gently brought his cheek next to hers left it there god he said thank god shes going to be okay he heard larry behind him couple more days and shes out of here he straightened up still holding her hand looking at her ill ask these guys he said larry and sally told him sam had actually been very lucky suffering only a concussion a broken nose a broken collarbone multiple bruises and abrasions shed been buried by brick and mortar but the beams in the ceiling had prevented the house from collapsing on her theyd pulled her out within three hours and hows quayle is he okay her grip tightened she shook her head and a tear broke and rolled across her cheek glitsky thought the day might never end but the trail was getting hot and this was where you didnt quit after he left amanda he ran up the outside stairs to homicide where he called the cellphone company because of the earthquake a supervisor hal frisque was actually on duty working late pulling a ton of overtime he would love to help so five minutes after faxing a copy of his warrant to frisque glitsky was again on the phone at his desk a map of san francisco open in front of him were talking the sevenforty call is that right frisque asked thats what ive got here glitsky said okay a pause thats zone sf you got a map there looks like he was on the freeway had to be because a minute later he got picked up in sf so he was going west glitsky was lost in possibilities but none of them helped him very much true trang had been killed near the freeway south of it on geneva avenue but to get to the san francisco golf club and driving range or to doohers home for that matter his car could have taken the same route but frisque was continuing okay now he moves to dc further west a short moment then no mostly south dc daly city picked him up check your map id say it looks like he left the freeway at geneva and went south no way to tell how far because the call ends sergeant glitsky im here dooher left the freeway and turned south on geneva at knowing at that time that trang was sitting in his office alone got him chapter twenty one archbishop flaherty had canceled his other appointments for this monday morning this was more important the entire situation was getting out of hand as a matter of fact over the weekend the police had torn apart mark dooher s world finding nothing that tied him to victor trang in the process it was unconscionable irresponsible and appalling so his spartan office was crowded with a gaggle of lawyers his fulltime staff corporate counsel gabe stockman was punching something into his laptop dooher and he had been in touch over much of the weekend and now he and his attorney a man unknown to flaherty named wes farrell had arrived they were pouring themselves some coffee from the small table near the window that overlooked the schoolyard what id like to know flaherty said is why they seem to have settled on you mark wes farrell the new guy stopped stirring his coffee mark owned a bayonet once he talked to trang they dont have anybody else thats what they have beyond that ive got a theory if youd like to hear it at this point id like to hear anything that makes sense glitsky sergeant glitsky i understand youve met him too that he attacked you as well that might be a little strong flaherty said he wasnt very sociable lets just say that well regardless your excellency i did a little checking a couple of people i know at the hall of justice he is having some serious personal problems his wife is dying he screwed up his last major investigation which happened to be another one of my clients at the same time hes bucking for promotion and he needs a highprofile success in a bad way and guess who oversees police promotions the chief dan rigby whos a pawn of the mayor who is in turn just a little bit leftwing flaherty interrupted youre telling me this is political now stockman looked up putting in his own two cents everythings political emboldened by the support farrell was warming up so heres how it breaks the mayors support is ninety percent blacks womens groups and gays am i right hell hes got two gay supervisors in his pocket the catholic church represented by my client here mark dooher is antiabortion antiwomen priests antigay thats not entirely accurate flaherty said he really didnt like the antithis and antithat rhetoric if farrell was going to be representing dooher hed have to try to get him to retool his vocabulary the church was prolife profamily promarriage it was not a negative institution but farrell waved off his objection and kept rolling so glitsky is willing to go the extra mile to bring mark to grief even if the evidence is lame and its less than that he puts himself on the side of the people who can promote him who can watch out for his ass pardon the language the room went silent could that really be it flaherty asked thats very hard to believe i mean this is the police department of a major city farrell sipped his coffee its one man dooher held up a hand his voice was cool water glitskys not the issue here wes there is absolutely no evidence tying me to victor i was out driving golf balls i forgot to tell glitsky that i had stopped on geneva to get gas on the way out to the range i foolishly paid with cash the attendant who took my money had his nose buried in some asian newspaper and consequently didnt remember me or my car or anyone else id wager so glitsky thinks i lied covered up thats not it even if glitskys out to get me somebody out there has got to believe im innocent maybe the da himself chris locke this flaherty realized was why he valued dooher so highly he saw things clearly even here at the center of this maelstrom he was formulating a firm effective strategy it was ridiculous to think that mark dooher would ever have to resort to violence of any kind he was too smart he could destroy without a touch let me try that flaherty said ill call locke explain the situation see if he can help clear things up chris locke was the citys first black district attorney and a consummate political animal and he was sitting alone in his office thinking about archbishop james flaherty with whom he had just spoken locke knew that flaherty influenced a lot of votes in san francisco through parish homilies position papers public appearances pastoral letters he also knew that conservatives comprising perhaps thirty percent of the citys voters played at best only a peripheral role in any election but that it would be foolish to ignore them completely locke though a prosecutor was on the mayors liberal team as any elected official in san francisco had to be but his private support of the archbishop might in some future election tip the scales in his favor locke thought that cooperating with a powerful conservative like flaherty behind the scenes was worth the risk but something in locke knew it wasnt just the votes it was more visceral more immediate and he was addicted to it having something on people who held authority and power and flaherty had taken the unusual step of asking locke for a favor that was worth looking into though he directed all prosecutions in the city locke was rarely current on the progress of investigations being conducted at any given time they were police business the da came later but of course he had his sources he could find out art drysdale sat behind his desk juggling baseballs now in his late fifties hed played about two weeks of major league ball for the giants before hed gone to law school and the wall behind him still sported some framed and yellowing highlights from college ball and the minors for the past dozen years drysdale had run the daytoday work of the das office and locke depended on him for nearly all administrative decisions the da had come down to drysdales smaller office knocked on the door and let himself in closing the door behind him drysdale never stopped juggling how do you do that what oh juggling no i wasnt talking about juggling what makes you think i was talking about juggling the balls came down plop plop plop in one of drysdales hands and he placed them on his desk blotter its a gift he said whats up what do you know about mark dooher the chief assistant da knew just about everything there was to date about mark dooher drysdale believed in a smooth pipeline from the police department through the das office and on to the courts he stayed in touch with chief rigby with the calendar judge with his assistant das such as amanda jenkins he generally knew about things before they officially happened if not sooner if asked he would undoubtedly say that his prescience too was a gift so he ran the dooher story down for his boss it was a tasty mixture flahertys fears doohers mysterious turnoff onto geneva near the time of the murder the bayonet question the interviews with trangs women glitskys recent overaggressive stand on levon copes the stress he was under because of his wifes illness but not much evidence yet drysdale shook his head not that ive heard they searched all weekend flaherty says this dooher is a pillar of the community community pillars have been known to kill people we know this art but his excellency thinks that maybe glitskys harassing dooher for some reason the famous some reason the point is flaherty is really unhappy really unhappy hes also worried that glitsky will arrest dooher for murdering trang anyway even if hes light on evidence drysdale was shaking his head no glitskys a stone pro chris hes not going to arrest him without a warrant if theres no evidence theres no evidence and there is none nowhere near enough so far so i can tell the archbishop he neednt worry if things dont change but drysdale held up a warning finger they often do ill keep that in mind art but in the meanwhile he stood up if were hassling this guy whatever reason i want the word out its to stop we get righteous evidence or we let it go we in accord here thats the way we always do it chris locke was at the door i know that i dont want to criticize a good cop whos having problems art but flaherty seems to know that weve got no matching hairs or fibers or fingerprints no blood no bayonet and no motive am i right yep all right drysdale stared at the door for a moment after it closed behind the da then he picked up his baseballs again locke he thought had his own gift the man knew how to deliver a message glitskys fears about his wife were well founded after three days of whirlwind housecleaning following the earthquake she had faked feeling better on sunday morning when glitsky had left to continue serving his search warrant she had gone back to bed she sent all three boys out to the movies with instructions not to return until dinnertime flo knew that her nurse and abes father nat would be back on monday she thought shed be fine until then she didnt want to burden anybody which is all she did anymore but this morning she hadnt been able to get out of bed the nurse was in with her abe had put off going to work and now he and nat sat in the livingroom armchairs in the same attitude hunched over elbows on their knees shes got to do what shes got to do abraham maybe all the cleaning it did her some good for her soul glitsky didnt have it in him to argue anymore it had been a thoroughly dispiriting weekend hours of work and nothing to show for it there had been no sign of mark doohers bayonet the lab would be coming in with microscopic results over the next few days but glitsky held out little hope of finding anything dooher had lots of suits in his closet at home ten pairs of shoes and all of them were pristine it had been basically the same story at his office fewer clothes but everything spotless his files gave no indication of any meeting with trang he kept his golf clubs in the trunk and in pursuit of those meager pickings abe hadnt been there for flo and now his father was talking about her soul well he no longer cared about her soul he cared about her body that it wasnt causing her pain if it could somehow stop betraying her even god forgive him that it let her rest for good maybe youre right dad maybe it helped her soul but you dont think so he shrugged it doesnt matter she did it it wore her out now shes worse but for those couple of days she was better there was nothing glitsky wanted to say he might feel like howling at the moon but he didnt want to yell at his dad who was cursed with the need to find meaning in life an explanation for the randomness of experience the telephone rang and he made some hopeless gesture to nat got up and went to the kitchen to answer it it was frank batiste lockes message had made its way through the system and he heard it said thanks and hung up who was that his father was standing in the hallway between the kitchen and his bedroom glitsky stared ahead work if its important you can go in ill be here flo no glitsky said just a case closing thats all part three chapter twenty two on tuesday june about six weeks after abe glitsky was told to forget about mark dooher and victor trang he got a call at his home it was by the clock next to his new bed he had gotten home an hour before turned on and off the television made a cup of tea opened a book finally he had gone in to his bedroom to lie down the house was empty now except for him the boys were staying at a friends until glitsky could finish the interview process for the nanny housekeeper he was going to hire in the first five days after flos death hed talked to two pleasantenough young women and both interviews had been disasters glitsky knew he had been to blame he probably wouldnt have hired himself under these conditions he should give himself a week or two to come to grips with his desolation his anger his despair he was fighting to keep desperation out of the picture too reminding himself that there really was no hurry it had only been a few days hed find someone the new bed was a double he and flo had had a queen but the first night after she was gone he found he couldnt make himself get into it he knew he would keep turning as he tried to sleep and be newly surprised to find her side empty time after time so that first night hed slept or tried to on the couch in the living room the next day hed called the salvation army and theyd come and then the bed was gone but even the smaller one felt enormous he was still in his clothes one hand over his eyes squinting at the digital clock he reached for the telephone glitsky abe this is frank batiste i know youre on leave and you can say no but they got me at home and asked and i thought youd want to decide for yourself we just got a nine one one from a frantic husband in st francis wood his wifes been stabbed shes dead okay the caller was mark dooher the womans his wife his feet were over the edge of the bed on to the floor send a squad car by ill hitch a ride with it glitsky didnt hear batiste start to ask if he was sure he didnt have to hed already hung up he remembered the house more vividly than he would have thought he saw a lot of homes in his job and they tended to blur together but this one was distinctive with its tiled front courtyard behind the low stucco fence the turret in the front the semienclosed entrance the broad sweeping lawn with its fiftyyearold magnolia tree which was in bloom scenting the clear stillwarm air glitsky stood a minute surveying the front of the house now all lit up someone was moving in the turret but he couldnt see through the blinds the coroners van hadnt yet arrived but there was an ambulance in the driveway three other black and white squad cars from the early responding officers were parked on the street the yellow crimescene tape had been hung over a wide perimeter around the driveway and across the lawn within it a couple of uniforms were standing guard talking glitsky had to remind himself that this was st francis wood and that police response time here was measured in minutes not hours as was often the case in less tony neighborhoods he was directed to the driveway and saw three other men standing in front of the ambulance the two in uniform would be the lieutenant and the sergeant from the district station which was taraval the third saw glitsky and started walking down toward him it was paul thieu on glitskys recommendation thieu had recently been detailed fulltime to the death department and hed been in the office at the hall pulling long hours when the eightohtwo a coroners case had been patched through from emergency services thieu had called batiste which was why abe was here glitsky met him halfway further up the drive he noticed the pool of light under an open side door wheres dooher library downstairs over in that turret area couple of guys are with him thieu had quickly improved in the chatter department hed also learned how to answer questions okay i guess hell wait they approached the taraval station people lieutenant armanino and sergeant dorney and thieu introduced glitsky around armanino was taking pains to explain to the downtown homicide inspectors that the guys from his station had secured the place well the woman upstairs was in fact dead shed been obviously and thoroughly dead when they got here so the paramedics hadnt moved the body or touched anything thieu needed to talk stabbed in her bed abe it looks like a burglary gone bad maybe attempted rape sheets and blankets tossed pretty good lots of blood she must have cut the guy hands in his pockets glitsky nodded okay lets go on up before you do armanino interrupted there are a couple of other things sergeant the paramedics and responding officers were here when we arrived but we got here right after nobody else had been on the driveway there was no obvious blood on it though there might be a drop or two some spatter ill keep it clean till the crimescene guys get here armanino was a stickler for details glitsky thought it was undoubtedly how hed made lieutenant but in the meanwhile one of my guys he indicated the policeman standing on the driveway found this he showed glitsky a ziploc bag containing something white dotted with red glitsky took it what is it its a surgical glove it was there in the dirt by the back door which was evidently the point of exit maybe entry too the light bulb by the way again he indicated with gesture was dark unscrewed unscrewed armanino nodded dorney here put on his own gloves and turned it and it came right back on and this another larger bag contained what at a glance appeared to be the murder weapon a highquality kitchen knife the blades pretty clean isnt it it got wiped but a lot upstairs armanino shrugged youll see what it meant if anything wasnt for him to determine neither was glitskys definition of a lot he was simply reporting what he and his men had found that it armanino looked at dorney and the sergeant nodded a welloiled machine these two good cops for now i think so okay paul glitsky said lets go at the side door he turned and added quietly thanks for having batiste call me the side door opened on to a laundry room with black and white checkered tile floors a washing machine and dryer they walked through into the beautiful marblecountered kitchen where glitsky had once sat with sheila dooher and had tea there were voices coming out of the turret room but glitsky followed thieu as he turned into the foyer and they ascended the stairs to a balustraded landing it seemed that every light in the house must be on a large circular rug with a navajo design covered the floor up here two panelled doors on the left were now closed the bedroom was huge and well lit double french doors led to a balcony there were two darkwood dressers and a door through which he could see a makeup area and beyond that the bathroom the woman lay diagonally across the kingsized bed in an awkward position half turned with one arm under her the other splayed glitsky stood a minute registering it something though he couldnt say precisely what struck him as odd she looked almost as though shed been dropped he remembered the face and looked at it now in death there was no sign of fury in sheila doohers last moments in fact glitsky thought her expression was remarkably peaceful the hair mussed from sleeping still bore the traces of its last brushing and perhaps tellingly no visible blood which is not to say there was no blood elsewhere a bloodspattered white cotton nightie was bunched around her neck covering her left breast leaving the right exposed only one wound was visible a inchlong slit out of which seeped a brownishred ribbon her underpants were still on though theyd been pulled down forcefully and were ripped glitsky straightened up backing away a step for a wider angle thieus statement about the blood was a relative one but glitsky knew that blood was one of those things if you werent familiar with it a little could go a real long way glitskys first take on the blood in this case was that there wasnt nearly enough of it even victor trang had bled substantially more than this and his killer had used the bayonet to plug the flow if the knifewound here had gone to the heart with the victim on her side which was what it looked like there should have been massive quantities of blood pints not a cupful what thieu asked but glitsky didnt answer instead from his new vantage point back a little from the bed he noticed something he should have seen immediately he wasnt going to touch or move the body to make sure but there were four or five other apparent blood marks on the nightie he leaned in to see more clearly now that he thought he knew what he was looking at they were like brush strokes straightsided and tapering the concentration of blood heavy at one end and lighter at the other it could only be one thing something hed seen only once before with victor trang in his career the killed had wiped the blade off on his victims clothes farrell didnt look like a lawyer at the moment he was in the pair of white painters overalls that had been next to his bed hed finally finished all the repairs the caulking and the cracks in the walls of his apartment for the past few weeks after work when he wasnt visiting sam he had been haphazardly painting a baseboard here a door there tonight after the midnight call from mark he threw on the paintstained pants stepped barefoot into his trashed topsiders threw on a ragged and grubby university of california sweatshirt and grabbed his giants hat from the peg by the door so he didnt look like a lawyer but he wasnt here as a lawyer at least he didnt think so he was here as a best friend marks voice had been calm though there was no mistaking the anguish theyd had a burglar he said sheila was dead he pulled his datsun up behind the police cars the driveway and the street in front of marks house were clogged with the ambulance the coroners van the knot of curious neighbors two local news trucks he went up to the nearest uniform excuse me im a friend of the resident here he asked me to come over id like to go up to the house the cop had his orders though his arms remained crossed and he shook his head afraid not this is a crime scene its closed to the public im not the public im an attorney the officer looked him overthen be an attorney outside this is still a crime scene look why dont you go ask mr dooher if he wants wes farrell up there with him youre wes farrell yeah well wes we dont run things the way mr dooher wants them run especially at a murder scene you know what i mean were investigating a crime here we dont want people tramping all over the evidence thats how we do it now when were done you can go up meanwhile somebody comes out ill send word up if ican see some id wes patted his empty pockets he could visualize his wallet on the top of the dresser next to his bed at home he considered breaking and running up the pavers but figured hed get shot or arrested or something for his troubles no the only hope was to drive the two miles back home and get his goddamned id have a nice night he told the cop a polite smile you too the csi crimescene investigation unit knew the drill and glitsky knew them he didnt want to step on toes but he wasnt working backward from any theory now this time he was looking at what he knew was evidence not wanting it to go away through inadvertence or simple bad luck he walked up to sergeant jimmy ash from the photo lab a gangly fortyyearold freckled albino who tonight with the late hour even had pink eyes and whod already painted the room in videotape ash was standing by the bed taking stills of the body that had been sheila dooher hey jimmy you got any special technique for splatter stains the blood he swallowed a prominent adams apple bobbing no nothing special clear photos my particular area of expertise you know and something to provide perspective in the picture you see something i think so then you got it thieu was standing next to them both glitsky could figuratively almost hear him panting there dying to ask what hed seen and having no clue he started to take pity on him turned to answer when alice carter the coroners tech from the other side of the bed spoke up abe she pointed a finger at him and curled it toward her come here anybody move this body i dont think so not since ive been here thieu spoke up she was this way when i came in too i think you want to be sure on this the responding officers still below thieu was already moving out the rooms door going to get them if they were still there why abe asked ms carter pointed at sheila doohers bare right shoulder the exposed back beneath it a slight darkening red under the skin because weve got what looks a whole lot like fixed lividity here in the upper right quadrant which means she was moved right and after shed been dead a while it was well after midnight thieu trailing behind him glitsky stopped in the doorway to the library and caught dooher in an unguarded moment sitting back in his wingchair legs crossed talking with another man he couldnt hear what they were saying but doohers expression was bland his body language relaxed it had been a week now since abe had lost his wife and he had yet to draw an easy breath his tired muscles seemed as though their ache would never end and his jangled nerves strung with fatigue twitched like a thoroughbreds and here was dooher his wife gone less than three hours all but holding court the comparison invited conclusions glitsky was going to have to concentrate to keep his personal feelings from intruding this had to be by the book todays date is wednesday june th the time is approximately hours this is sergeant inspector abraham glitsky star number am currently at ravenwood drive san francisco present and being interviewed is mark dooher caucasian male with me is sergeant inspector paul thieu star and mr doohers attorney wes farrell q mr dooher ill be taperecording your statement as you can see do you have any objection to this a no none q but for the record your attorney did raise some objections to your coming downtown to give your statement a farrell sergeant weve been through that its after midnight and the mans wife has just been killed since mr dooher wasn t home all night he couldnt possibly be a suspect in this crime he voluntarily has agreed to give a statement here and now theres no reason to go downtown a dooher its all right wes what do you need for the statement sergeant q how about starting by telling what you found here tonight a all right at about nine fortyfive i got home from hitting a couple of buckets of golf balls at the san francisco driving range pause as you know ive had some bad luck with driving ranges lately q you got home at quarter to ten a right i came inside q what car were you driving and where did you park a i was driving my lexus its light brown with personalized plates reading eskw i drove up the driveway and parked in the garage behind the house i closed the garage door behind me its automatic and walked out the side door of the garage on the path next to my back lawn to the driveway and in the side door q was the door locked a i dont remember to tell you the truth i wouldn t have noticed anyway i always just put my key in first give it a turn it opens i dont remember specifically q do you remember if the overhead light was on a no i dont believe it was it must have burned out q okay what did you do then a i went to turn off the alarm system we have a box next to the doors and i noticed it hadn t been set q was that unusual a unfortunately no sheila that was one of the things she wasnt a farrell give him a minute here would you you all right mark a dooher yeah okay sorry sheila often forgot to set the alarm system she would go in and out a lot and thought it was silly unnecessary while we were home she thought it was more for when we went on vacation times like that she thought i was paranoid q all right then what a then i went into the kitchen did the dinner dishes which were still there then i had a beer and read the mail q you thought your wife had gone up to bed a i knew she had gone up to bed sergeant wed split a bottle of wine for dinner she hit the wall around seventhirty and said she wanted to turn in so i thought id go to the range anyway i finished my beer and went upstairs q did you touch your wife a no i turned on the lights and it was obvious she was dead i suppose i froze a minute or two i dont remember then i guess i called nine one one q and then what a then i sat on the stairs and waited no i checked the other upstairs rooms too q you didnt try to resuscitate her anything like that a farrell sergeant hes answered that she was obviously dead q did you touch the body at all a dooher there was blood all over the place there wasnt any doubt you can tell when somebodys dead i didn t know what to do to tell you the truth i dont even know exactly what i did i was afraid i suddenly thought the guy might still be in the house i dont know i just dont know q im sorry mr dooher but i need a specific answer to the question did you at any time up to right now touch mrs doohers body a no q all right lets go back earlier in the day before a farrell whats that got to do with anything sergeant a dooher its okay wes my attorney here wants to make sure i dont say anything to incriminate myself but i cant incriminate myself since i didnt do anything how far back do you want to go sergeant last week q lets start when you got off work chapter twenty three christina stood by the french doors and watched dooher move about his backyard greeting the other mourners she was fighting the feeling that she really didnt belong here guilt that in her heart she didnt mourn sheila doohers passing it freed mark there was no sense denying it she sighed heavily im glad youre here i dont know anybody she turned to see sam duncan her arm still in a cast you know me now but why are you here sam gestured behind her wes hes taking over details for mark for a while even without the police stuff this whole thing is just so horrible christina laid a hand on sams arm what police stuff damn sams face clouded im not supposed to talk about it wes doesnt want any rumors going around she lowered her voice hes worried that theyre going to say mark did it killed his wife christina mouth dropped the idea was absurd what he wasnt even here was he how could he have i know but wes is afraid they might i mean so soon after the trang thing and all but they didnt find anything there either no but apparently our friend sergeant glitsky didnt like being proven wrong and hes the inspector on this case but mark wasnt even here evidently the police can make a case that he was sam held up a hand wes says if they really want to get you they can make your life pretty miserable i guess they didnt really want to get levon copes sam made a face still a sore subject but that was glitsky too but what does glitsky have against mark no one knows wes isnt sure if theres any reason and nothings happened yet hes just worried he thinks glitsky might be overworked and guessing wrong he did screw up on levon copes and you know about his search warrant on mark theres two strikes you dont think hed plant evidence do you the police dont really do that do they sam shrugged i dont know what theyd do farrell was sitting in a corner of the kitchen with a beer listening to marks two youngest children jason and susan talking to their friends hed known the two kids their whole lives and they looked very much alike both very thin with slack blondish hair waiflike features and piercing green eyes marks eyes susan wore black silk tunic and pants and jason had the baggy pants an outsized brandnew dress shirt buttoned to the collar a camouflage jacket none of farrells own kids had made it home for the funeral which very much disappointed him especially since sheila and mark had been godparents to michelle his youngest but he consoled himself with the fact that neither had marks eldest mark jr the wildcatter sculptor wes had tried to help dooher out with breaking the brutal news making the call to mark jr and had been unprepared for the venom hed heard his dad never needed him for anything before he didnt need to see him now besides it was too much of a hassle to come down from alaska he said his mom was already dead anyway what good was it going to do and he didnt have the money to spare oh dad was offering to pay to fly him down no thanks one way or another hed wind up owing him hed have to pay even for something like this all the young people were drinking beer he was comfortable here in the kitchen with them especially since lydia was out in the great room mingling as she did so he was avoiding her and he didnt particularly want to introduce her to sam either that kept him in here too not that it had been uninteresting up to now he was learning a lot listening just edit out the dudes and profanity and most of it was english jason sitting on the counter now had sat next to his sister in the pew with mark but both of them down five feet or more from their father an eloquentenough statement the boy cried at the mass but was over that now he was enthusing over the snow in colorado the winter hed spent back there how he was going down to rosarito from here surf the summer away like starting tomorrow he had to get out of here this scene here with his dad was just too weird his sister leaned up against the sink holding hands with another young woman how mom took it i dont know she said more dadtrashing coming up wes thought even a child could do it suddenly stoked by the beers he stood deciding to butt in hey guys how about you give the old man a break would you hes having a tough enough time susan nearly snorted dad doesnt have tough times ive just been through one with him dear im sure she dropped her girlfriends hand and walked the four steps over to him a bit unsteadily you think you know my dad dont you you think hes devastated by all this she shook her head hopelessly youre a good guy wes i really think you are but dream fuckin on she repeated dream on what susan what are you talking about jason hey come on look around im looking around what am i supposed to see i see your dad trying to maintain here i see hes lost his partner susan snorted derisively nodded over at jason six months tops he said what are you guys talking about they were both shaking their heads but it was susan who said it youll find out finally summoning the nerve christina walked out into the backyard he was standing now in the dappled sunlight under the budding elm and she thought she had never seen a more magnificent face not the face per se but that it so clearly reflected the man beneath that was what was so magnificent it was all there the agony he was in the strength to bear it the grace eventually to rise above it he was deep in conversation with a priest who wore a black cassock with a purple lining but when he saw her it was as though he bestowed some benediction on her pulling her forward to him almost physically she felt her steps grow light welcome even now taking both her hands he leaned forward and kissed her on the cheek thanks for coming i couldnt not have they were still holding hands suddenly realizing it he gave a brief squeeze and let go well remembering turning back to the priest i dont know if youve met the archbishop of san francisco james flaherty christina carrera christinas one of the firms future stars jim she shook flahertys hand heard him uttering the usual commonplaces kept her smile in place but her eyes and mind stayed on dooher he was holding up his own eyes elsewhere within crushed by the weight of his loss he caught her watching him then and tried to smile an apologetic turn of the lips for having caused her even briefly to glimpse the pain he was feeling within he did not mean to show it to wear it on his sleeve he was a man he would be all right it wasnt anyone elses problem he was alone and he would survive she thought her heart would break seeing her ex with another woman of course younger thats what they all did wasnt it had gotten under lydias skin not that she was romantically interested in wes anymore heaven forbid but it skewed her vision of her own importance how dare he so after wes and sam had gone lydia decided she deserved a couple of drinks then in the kitchen shed gotten to talking with the kids she was godmother to susan aunt lyd to jason and they traded sheila stories laughing crying laughing again rituals the two children left when their father had finally come in from the backyard after nearly all the other guests had said their goodbyes the kids departure wasnt exactly abrupt but it wasnt leisurely either after the exodus lydia had exchanged one of those whatcanyoudo glances with mark then picked up the bottle of gin on the counter how about one his shoulders sagged from lydias perspective mark had held up like a trooper all day making the required rounds having to listen again and again to how sorry everybody was to the advice and the sympathy and the anecdotes he had been endlessly patient as he always appeared under tight control that was mark dooher after all although just for a moment the final abandonment by his children did seem to take the resiliency out of him then he bounced back smiled nodded hit me a good one he said she was sitting on one of the barstools and when he came over she rubbed a hand across his back he straightened up leaned into it that beats the drink he said but then he took the drink too shed stayed to clean up she knew the house was good with the caterers it was a help having her there everybody else had gone by and she went back into the kitchen and though they certainly didnt need it poured two gins on the rocks and brought them out to where he sat in the living room in his black suit his hands shading his eyes at one end of the chamoissoft white leather couch they clinked glasses long day she said why dont you take off your coat and stay awhile i guess i should as though she were his valet she helped him out of it on the way over to the closet to hang it up she caught sight of herself in the large gilt hall mirror stopping there she had to think again that wes was an idiot she was slightly out of focus but she looked terrific in her own black tailored suit her high heels and black hose she could have been ten years younger trim toned her hair lightened to ash cut a la princess di well screw wes and his girlfriend she hung the coat in the closet the day was still warm and suddenly the top of her own suit felt binding she unbuttoned it shrugged out of it and hung it next to marks her black blouse too was tight at her neck and when she came back to him it was undone to the second button he handed her her glass and she stood in front of where he sat as they chinked them again she felt him looking up at her as she drank god bless gin she said i dont think ive had anything but wine for six months but sometimes you need a real drink dont you think heres to that he tipped his own glass back to quote the great dean martin that sometime is now get you another one he drained his drink and handed her up his glass back in the kitchen she grabbed the silver ice bucket and the bottle of bombay and brought it out with her setting them on the coffee table building two fresh ones she was standing in front of him again here we are he said who would have thought it she stepped out of her heels how are you mark really he took a thoughtful sip rotated his head brought his hand up behind his neck tell you the truth im tight as a drum putting her glass down she walked around behind the couch and put her hands on his shoulders close your eyes she said take a deep breath as her thumbs dug into the muscles around his neck he let out a small groan of relief youve got a halfhour to cut that out lydia his head fell back against the couch and he slumped down she stopped now your angles all wrong thats what she said down on the floor she said on your stomach he was stretched out as shed directed arms folded now under his head she knelt at his waist reaching up and began to knead his shoulders his neck down his backbone reaching across then over the broad back another bad angle she straightened up hitched her skirt up and straddled him her hands moving pushing rubbing pulling the shirt out then going under it up his backbone with her thumbs another sigh of pleasure she reached to her side and undid the button then unzipped stood and stepped out of her skirt her nylons dooher still lay on his stomach unmovingturn over his eyes were closed his hands crossed behind his head the belt then the button zipping slowly over the bulge he still didnt move sam and wes were on the roof of his apartment building sitting barefoot in beach chairs holding hands watching the sunset bart lounged between them a small pot barbecue smoked and sam had turned farrells boombox radio to a country music section which he barely knew existed until six weeks before now he was worried that he was getting hooked on the stuff something in him rebelled at the idea of a middleaged urban professional like himself relating to this corn but dumb as they were about every fourth song seemed to bring a tear to his eye a couple of tunes over the past weeks tim mcgraws dont take the girl and brooks dunns neon moon had made him outright weep when hed been alone painting but all of em were about those country things oldfashioned values mommy daddy sometimes grandpa true undyin love god beer dogs and trucks but dang he couldnt deny they hit something in him wynonna was just finishing up she is his only need and wes was blinking pretty hard sam squeezed his hand youre just doing that to impress me doing what she laughed that mistyeye thing to every mushball lyric you hear its nothing to do with the lyrics i happened to look too long at the sun and it made my eyes water or else it was the smoke she ignored him so maybe ill think that way deep down youve got a tender and gentle soul no that is not me im not trying to impress you im a cynical bigcity attorney and nothing touches me i am a rock i am in fact an island my understanding is that no man is an island i tell you i am a fucking island okay youre an island anyway i am impressed she lifted his hand and kissed it then nudged bart with her bare toe i think he actually feels things dont you bart bart raised his head put it back down on his paws see she said the mute beasts concur wes got up and took the top off the kettle cooker a couple of tbone steaks filled the whole grill he gave them a turn and came back to sit down you know why people cry at happy endings in movies or at weddings or even some incredibly weak slobs at countrymusic lyrics theyre crybabies im going to hit your broken arm crybabies isnt the answer he shook his head they want it that way again something in them remembers that they used to think it was that way that things in life could turn out good and seeing that hope being reminded of it its too much to take so they cry but you still think things turn out good dont you no i still wish they did just as bad but i dont think so anymore she reached and took his hand seeing your wife today lydia he let out a long breath no lydias over it was more i think the kids marks kids what about them again he sighed i dont know all the effort the hopes the lessons the tears the fights the sicknesses and at the end what do you get you get some kids who are total strangers who dont want anything to do with you your kids well some of that maybe but mostly marks they really hate him maybe he wasnt a good father thats just it he was a great father i was around i saw him baseball tennis soccer boy scouts girl scouts private schools great summer camps you name it those kids had it but did they have him he seemed to deflate i guess i dont know that did my kids have me i mean both of us mark and i we worked like dogs so lydia and sheila didnt have to this was of course the middle ages back then wasnt considered the height of oppression the silence as well as the difference in their ages hung between them i better get the steaks wes said but he didnt get up he didnt want to let go of sams hand he turned to her his kids really hate him sam and i know them theyre not bad theyre fine with me they call me uncle wes even sometimes but their dad i just dont get it maybe hes not the person you think he is not with everybody else he seemed pretty cold to me now he did let go of her hand lets not take my best friend apart four days after his wife was killed okay im not taking him apart im saying he seemed cold maybe he was cold to his kids thats all and maybe hes trying to keep from breaking down so hes guarded right about now hows that he had raised his voice and bart sat up growling sam took a beat a breath youre right i dont know him at all im sorry the steaks arent going to be rare downstairs in his kitchen they sat at the table sam stared down at her food wes couldnt stop the smile that crept up she wasnt going to be able to cut her steak your cast standing up he came around the table and kissed her im sorry he said i dont want to fight sam lay her head against him dont be mad at me im not attacking your friend i know with your permission he pulled another chair out from the table sat down picked up a knife and began cutting and the fact is mark might have been a terrible father i dont know maybe husband too we didnt pride ourselves on that so much in those days hes just my friend some of us white males even if were not angry occasionally feel unfairly attacked here in this modern world its tempting to band together so i suppose ive got a gut reaction to protect him especially now i can see that but im not attacking you either okay i know but i wonder if its just that i didnt see what he might have really been like with his kids couldnt let myself see because i was doing the same thing and what about now that stopped him again for a moment what about now she only dared meet his eyes no he said flatly emphatically no okay but since we were talking i dont understand how you can even say that i didnt actually i looked it but i was talking to christina today her reaction to mark being under suspicion kind of reminded me of you you told her about it a little its okay wes she wont alert the media so how was her reaction like mine just very kneejerk not really looking at it shes in love with him you know she told you that no he rolled his eyes but a girl can tell so christinas in love with mark and hes my best friend now let me get this straight because of those reasons we both dont believe he killed his wife while he was out driving golf balls how strange do you think he killed her she shook her head no your steaks getting cold its perfect by the way standing up he kissed her and went back to his seat all im saying she continued is that i have a hard time believing sergeant glitsky goes around planting evidence to convict people for no reason well i hope youre right he cut a piece of meat christinas in love with him tis the season she said sweetly she may not even know it yet but you wait six months wes stopped chewing the words were almost exactly those used by marks kids when he hadnt known what they were talking about he did now and it made him nervous most nights sam stayed with her brother larry she was apartment hunting in a haphazard fashion but it was never easy finding the right place and tonight she was staying at wess now she slept peacefully next to him unable to do the same he carefully lifted the blanket from his side of the bed and got out threw on his old terrycloth robe and padded into the living salon sitting on the futon the streetlights outside painted their designs on his hardwood hed left the kitchen window open over the table where he and sam had eaten and the breeze coming through it still felt almost balmy bart climbed up next to him and he petted him absently his mind wouldnt stop racing maybe he ought to write a country song he thought bout settin up all night while your girls asleep your love is deep but youre feelin blue whats a poor country boy to do it had possibilities but that thought didnt hold he kept returning to christina carrera which brought him to mark of course as hed told sam mark had an airtight alibi hell it wasnt even that he reminded himself it was the truth the past twentyfive years of wess professional life had been spent in the mud and trenches of criminal law taking on the causes and cases of a seemingly endless procession of people whod been careless negligent and who found themselves called to answer for their mistakes and misdeeds he didnt often torture himself with whether any of his clients had done what theyd been accused of he generally preferred to ask them about the evidence against them and how they might explain it sometimes if he liked his clients hed provide two or three explanations and ask if any of them had a particularly nice ring he never askeddirectly if a client were guilty that was a conclusion for the jury similarly he tried not to ask any openended questions about what someone had or hadnt done because he might get an answer he didnt like and then be stuck with it and there was always the very real possibility that his client would lie to him anyway this was in the very nature of people he believed and hence understandable human acceptable but his adult pragmatism was a far cry from the idealism that had drawn him to the law in the first place it was a rationalization as so much of his life had become you did what you had to and that was okay most of the time hed been trying to convince himself of all this now for the last decade or so it was the recurring topic in his retreats with mark dooher who would always argue the opposite you didnt do what you had to do you did what you believed in before these troubles farrell thought that had been easy for dooher to say hed never had to struggle in his career in his life he could afford the luxury of idealism of believing he was always on the side of the angels he was job before the curses but dooher was right about one thing the accommodation ate at you it made you cynical sometimes it seemed to wes that the endless litany of good enough good enough good enough was a prescription for failure that there really wasnt any such thing as good enough there was your best and then there was everything else and in his darkest moments wes sometimes believed that his marriage had failed his business had never really prospered hed never achieved all hed set out to do in law school hed dreamed of being appointed to the supreme court because hed burned himself his best self out on the altar of good enough lord knew it had been hard enough raising the kids getting and keeping clients making time for lydia hed put in all the energy he thought he could spare instead of all he had on just about everything he put his mind to what had he been saving the rest for was this the source of his mediocrity the secret of the nonentity hed become he knew the reason for his nervousness after dinner because for once now hed committed he had a potential client and best friend that he totally believed in and now there was christina carrera his own albatross why couldnt she just go away farrell too had caught a glimpse of them together for a moment on marks lawn this afternoon witnessing firsthand the almost embarrassing connection between them he kept coming back to the one salient fact that he wished he could forget or better never have known which was that mark had wanted her from the first moment he laid his eyes upon her but what did that mean nothing he told himself it was merely one of those latenight chimeras that tantalize or frighten and then in the morning turn out to have been a shadow falling on an uneven surface a wisp of white fabric blowing lonely in a faraway tree wes sams quiet whisper from the bedroom worried obviously caring was he all right did he need her petting bart a last time he pushed himself up the doubt the ghost the mirage whatever it was would be gone in the morning he was sure of it chapter twenty four the next day glitsky was at marine world with nat and the three boys he still hadnt found a nanny and had decided that what they all needed was some time together a change of scene a nice day outside away from the city so hed picked them up at the friends house where they were staying and theyd made the drive across the bay and north to vallejo at the amusement park the sun was out and although there was a steady breeze it didnt have that arctic intensity you got off the ocean out in the avenues where they lived now he was sitting high in the grandstands watching the killer whale show isaac and jacob had gone down to the seats by the water with their grandfather all of them including nat deciding that they really needed to get soaked but oj ten years old didnt want to do that and didnt want to leave his dad either in fact after the older boys had gone down oj asked abe if he minded if he sat in his lap which was where he was now the huge mammals entered the pool but oj couldnt have cared less dad he said can i ask you something ever since flo had first gotten sick oj had preceded nearly every remark with this question glitsky thought it was because he was such a sensitive little kid so aware of the pressure everybody was under he didnt want to add to it by asking any question that someone would have to answer he didnt want to be a bother this sometimes translated to glitsky as though his youngest son didnt want to exist and that drove him crazy but he kept his voice modulated and answered the way he always did you can always ask me about anything oj you dont have to ask permission to ask oj as always then said but can i ask you something patience glitsky told himself patience yes you can ask me something okay what if all the sudden you know merlin merlin yeah merlin king arthurs musician magician but yeah okay i know merlin right so what if merlin came back to life and he decided all the unicorns were going to be down on earth from now on oj had also been playing with variations on the comingbacktolife idea for the past few months what if robin hood came back to life and got disguised as one of the power rangers what if george washington really didnt die but was just waiting to see if he could live to be and then he could be president again what if bambis mother things dont come back to life abe said gently but as firmly as he could dead means youre gone forever thats what dead is i know that dad but merlin was a musician and he could come back if he wanted to and then he could decide the unicorns could live on the earth he wanted to tell him there were no unicorns either the boy was ten years old closing in on puberty and he really ought to stop seeking comfort in these fantasies but somehow his energy failed him he let out a long breath instead of where where do they live now oj couldnt believe his fathers ignorance well now they live in the clouds in unicorn land okay and then they could come down and be here on the earth and we could ride them and maybe even have one as a pet what if that happened glitsky tightened his arms around his gangly son came up with the answer he always wound up with if that happened oj thatd be really neat isaac was still very wet he exceeded by several years the twelveyearold limit for the playground but dripping as he was he didnt look it and even though he was a cop pledged to enforcing the laws abe wasnt going to call him on it he and nat had left their food french fries and corn dogs on one of the picnic tables behind them where the ravenous seagulls had spirited it away and scarfed it all down now the two men stood at the fence that kept the adults in their place all three of the boys were clustered together up high in a corner of a climbing structure made of rigging rope hanging together the killer whales had dumped a couple of swimming pools worth of water into the lower galley by now nats hair was recombed but his clothes stuck to him he was marching in place his tennis shoes making squishing noises this is a good place abraham but i wish someone had told me about this getting splashed they dont mean a little damp let me tell you i didnt know but i noticed you didnt go down yourself am i right oj didnt want to get so close to the water thats why i didnt go down i wish i believed this completely i dont want to think you sandbagged your old man i would never do that you didnt raise that kind of boy a sideways glance thats a good answer he pulled his shirt away from his body did a little dance with his pants and oj i happened to see he was on your lap glitsky nodded hes having a hard time hes trying to figure it out and you are back to work ive got to work dad its what i do but he realized that his father needed more of an explanation look the hardys are great people frannies taking better care of them than i can right now and the boys are in school anyway most of the day im there for them i see them i go over some nights we go out on weekends like now dad like right now ive got a lot to get set up i understand this so so nothing but what nat shrugged just to think about thats all he knew what his father was getting at but there wasnt anything he could do about it he should have taken some more days off he supposed gone over every single night to be with the kids but when hed gotten the call about sheila dooher his priorities found themselves rearranged or maybe it was just an opportunity to dwell on something other than the emptiness his father had implied that to some degree he was running away denying what he needed to confront shunting off his responsibility to his children and maybe there was an element of that he had something to do something that needed to be done and it was consuming the simple doing of it regardless of the outcome could save him could pull him through this time he didnt know but he had to try this was why on sunday night the boys were back at his friends house and he was at his desk downtown on the th floor reading the autopsy report on sheila dooher that had finally come in he had done legwork all week long interviewing neighbors and drivingrange employees and doohers coworkers and anybody else he could think of going over the initial lab reports studying the roompainting videotape combing the dooher house again with another warrant while dooher was downtown working for fibers and hairs and fluids but without the autopsy he was whistling in the wind and he knew it and there had been some bottleneck on paper coming out of the coroners autopsies normally took almost six weeks to get typed but hed asked for a rush on this one he had the report in front of him now and he scanned it once trying to make sense of it wondering if it might be the wrong one for a different body because the autopsy report he was looking at listed the cause of death as poisoning and what the hell was that about chapter twenty five the woman was waiting at the door to the rape crisis counselling center when sam arrived at on monday morning slightly matronly though not unattractive she wore jeans hiking boots a brightly colored sweater jacket and a purple beret she held a designer purse out of the top of which peeked an amy tan paperback sam stopped in front of her hi hello a cultured voice are you waiting to get in here behind the selfconscious expression not all that unusual in this setting she projected a strong attitude of resolve even as she nodded her eyes surveyed the street in both direction i thought this would be a good place to start it often is sam said let me get the door diane price had removed her sweater and beret and sat easily in one of the wingbacks in the tiny room behind the reception desk thick gray hair fell over her shoulders the natural woman sam thought she wore no makeup and with a gorgeous mouth and graygreen eyes really didnt need any her nails looked professionally manicured but they were clear shed waited while sam put on the pots of water and coffee told herself that shed waited long enough a few more minutes wasnt going to hurt the bell over the front door tinkled again as terri the first of the days volunteers came into work sam brought the mugs black coffee for them both back into the room where diane was waiting and sat across from her i feel a little awkward about this but i didnt know where else i should go sam waited it would come out diane sipped her coffee and took another moment exhaling then as though satisfied with something she began i imagine you know why ive come here sam inclined her head youve been raped yes diane took another sip of her coffee repeating it yes she said ive been raped sam leaned forward its difficult to say the words isnt it yes the monosyllable hung between them its been a long time now i didnt know if id ever say it how long again dianes eyes raked the small room sam had the feeling she was trying to decide whether or not she should continue with this whether it was too late to back out all the staring around putting off bringing the rape into focus she put her mug down and crossed her hands on her lap a long time ago twentyseven years ago and youve been silent about it diane folded her arms selfprotective now its called a date rape i knew him he seemed so nice ive been living with it all this time i dont think ive denied that it happened i suppose mostly just feeling that it happened so long ago what difference can it possibly make you know but it has of course a nod i dont really know how i feel about it all anymore not clearly all the parts of it thats all right why dont as you said why dont you just start somewhere what do you feel the most right now it changes thats whats funny i guess now today its all resentment because ive been thinking about it so much first though when it came up again it was just this overwhelming anger this rage but for such a long time before that you know living my life with my husband and being the school mom and doing soccer leagues and just living i didnt see what good it would do to bring it all up again does your husband know about it don he does now but a lapse into silence hes a great guy but im not sure he understands not completely the cultured voice was flattening by degrees losing what had appeared to be a natural animation what im trying to deal with now is i guess my anger over this sense of loss of having lost so much of my life over this one this one episode a wistful smile its funny you know you dont really believe that one day can change everything i mean if youd just done one little thing differently everybody feels that diane if thats any consolation its one of the mechanisms we use to blame ourselves somehow at least a little bit its our fault this didnt seem to help but i really wonder if it was my fault i dont mean just the rape where okay no doubt i led him on but i really believed i didnt know anything then i mean i was a virgin you said no and it stopped right that was the theory sam said diane sat back in the chair put her head all the way back and closed her eyes briefly opening them she abruptly reached for her mug of coffee something to do that wasnt this recitation of history she forgot to drink from it even now she said even now i wonder how much of it was my fault diane if he forced you he said hed kill me well then you but she was shaking her head no not just that not just the rape itself everything after that my whole life another silence another shake of the head no not my whole life thats an exaggeration only most of a decade only suddenly she slapped the arm of the chair god i hate this victim thing im not a victim i dont want to be a victim sam waited before i was going to be a doctor the brittle laugh shook her it wasnt ridiculous you dont get into stanford if youre dumb and id never gotten a b in my life i was fun smart pretty and now i tell myself have for years ive had to tell myself that it was this this thing that made it all change that it wasnt my fault that wouldnt be so unusual diane in fact it would be more normal if it was i know that im still not stupid but dont you see it makes me sick that victim excuse i should have just risen above it put it behind me instead it just ate me up and i let it i just let it her fists were clenched on the chairs arms and one of her eyes overflowed im sorry she reached into her purse pulled out a handkerchief dabbed theres no reason to cry about it this is stupid no it isnt she managed a condescending smile well of course youre trained to say that sam wasnt going to fight her about it yes she was trained to say that and that was because it was the truth it wasnt stupid to cry about it almost everyone did so what happened diane what do you blame yourself for everything dont you understand im mad that it happened im mad that i do blame myself i dont care what the proper modern response is supposed to be i could have been i dont know more somehow who i was really meant to be and instead she visibly deflated instead im who i am and is that so bad i dont know thats what im trying to figure out i suppose thats why im here i cant believe it seems so small a thing somehow the rape a small thing she nodded i know that sounds crazy but its what i tell myself when im just so full of loathing it was one small thing and i let it change the whole direction of my life i mean one day im in premed pulling as i go to football games im kind of rara and carefree and the next day the next time i turn around im a mess im taking every drug in america and this was the sixties remember there were a lot to choose from i survive another year or so before dropping out of school and sleeping with anybody not caring losing touch with my mom and dad and family and not caring at all so what happened finally she brought the handkerchief back to her eyes left it there a minute pressing finally i woke up i dont know how else to put it i just woke up i guess i didnt want to die and i never thought about that until my mother did thats the thing i regret the most i think i mean if she could see me now itd be all right but i was still that other way that other person when she died so she never knew sam nodded there was nothing to say sometimes she knew closing that circle could be the toughest pull of a persons life and it seemed to her that diane price was well on her way to doing it diane was going on and by now it seems behind me i married don went back to school and at least got my degree ive got two great teenagers and im actually working in a lab where my brains count and i got there i got all of that by finally not being a victim anymore just pulling myself up by the bootstraps and deciding that was it deciding i wasnt going to have this cancer in my life i wasnt going to talk about it think about it refer to it it was the past over done but youre here im here sam hesitated did something else happen diane shook her head not to me thank god but then suddenly last week i was reading the paper and i started shaking at the breakfast table i couldn t stop shaking what was it the story about this woman whod been murdered sheila dooher her name was sam felt the hair begin to stand up on her arms so the name caught my attention and i looked down the article and then opened to the inside page and there was the picture of her and her husband at some charity thing last year her husband mark sam knew what was coming the man who raped me father gorman knew why hed been summoned to the archbishops office not only had he been absent at the rosary when sheilas body had been laid out hed not attended the wake afterward then begged off officiating even peripherally at the funeral mass he hadnt gone to the gathering at doohers home afterwards now theyd kept him waiting nearly twentyfive minutes at the end of the day not a good sign he was more exhausted than hed ever been in his life for weeks hed slept no more than four hours a night plagued by nightmares about his own longgone parents of all things and then finally he was inside the austere office james flaherty stood up behind his desk but didnt come around it didnt offer the kiss of peace as he sometimes did instead his lips moved into a perfunctory smile but his eyes did not change in any way at all and he sat back down immediately gene ill get right to it he said mark dooher is one of my most trusted advisers he is also not incidentally a substantial contributor to the church and to your parish hes been president of your holy name society president of your parish council president gorman didnt need the glowing litany yes your excellency i know who he is not used to being interrupted the archbishops eyes flared briefly after a long silence flaherty continued he has also lost his wife to murder as you well know the police have been hounding him on another matter because of some kind of political vendetta this is not a time to abandon those people who need us most the man is going through some kind of hell right now and i found it incredibly unchristian not to say callous as a human response that you didnt see fit to assist at his wifes funeral or visit with us afterward he changed the tone of his voice making it more personal mark was incredibly hurt by it gene incredibly im sorry gorman said i he didnt know what else he could say and left the sentence unfinished hanging in the room flaherty waited for more but it didnt come youre sorry yes sorry doesnt seem like quite enough gene im sorry about that too your excellency flaherty cocked his head whats going on here you two have a disagreement a fight no do you want to talk to me about anything else i checked your most recent reports and things at the parish seem to be going along smoothly am i wrong about that no your excellency flaherty tapped the table lets drop the excellency im jim flaherty weve known each other a long time is there something going on in your parish gorman knew what he was asking was he having an affair was there a scandal brewing he shifted his burning eyes to the ceiling to the sides of the room i do feel like im under a lot of stress lately im not getting much sleep i again the rogue syllable and again it hung there what would you like me to do gene would you like some time off a short retreat maybe so jim maybe that would help the archbishop sat still a minute lips pursed eyes unwavering all right he said at last lets give that a try farrell knew he was fouling the air the upmann special tasted delicious and normally he made it a point not to smoke cigars in small offices but he didnt much like craig ising and it gave him some pleasure to realize that ising was going to have to get his suit cleaned to get the smell out farrell thought it was a fair trade he felt dirty near him but he was a client and your clients were not always people you admired but i didnt do anything wrong this isnt even a crime in nevada farrell coughed then blew a vapor trail into the air above them weve been through that craig you shouldve been in nevada when you committed it thirtysix years old physically fit nicely tanned ising had told farrell all about the suit that he would soon have to clean it had set him back in hong kong a silk blend that supposedly felt even better than it looked if you could get it in america it would go for more than a grand farrell had spent most of the day in this tiny conference room in isings plush embardacero office the two men discussing a plea so ising wouldnt have to go to jail that was the hope anyway and farrell was ready to go home isings position early on in the day was that he was a businessman and all hed done was take advantage of an investment opportunity hed been making some pretty serious money at this particular endeavor for the past couple of years the investment was straightforward enough ising had been buying the insurance policies of people infected with aids in effect becoming their beneficiary when they died in isings views everyone benefited by this arrangement the aids patients sold their discounted policies for cash which they needed for their medical bills normally sixty percent of the value of the policy and their policies were then sold by middlemen to investors like ising who paid between and for the policies based on the patients life expectancy ising had gotten lucky with the first couple the patients had died almost immediately and hed cleared nearly half a million dollars in less than a year unfortunately for him the state of california regulated this particular investment by outlawing it and ising was looking at two to five years in state prison and a sixfigure fine this doesnt bother you at all does it craig what bothers me is theyre trying to take me down for it thats what bothers me other guys have done a lot worse this was inarguable so farrell didnt push it instead he got down to tacks youre lucky you know the das taking heat for the courts dragging along on violent crimes so he gets the idea he wants to clear some massive backlog on these whitecollar cases get em processed out without taking up court time you fall in the crack otherwise youd be looking at hard time this is actually a sweet offer ising rolled his eyes its so sweet why dont you put up the money the deal was a fine of half a million dollars earmarked for aids research and two hundred hours of community service for ising and the time where am i supposed to get two hundred hours farrell shook his head two hundred hours is five weeks fulltime craig you get the minimum prison time and its two years five weeks two years think about it he sucked on his cigar keeping it lit the air in the room was getting as opaque as fog but hey its your decision its robbery is what it is we ought to sue them sue who whoever passed this law its criminal no wonder this states down the tubes a man cant make any kind of living farrell didnt know exactly what ising had made last year but the rent here in the embarcadero highrise was not close to cheap and ising had personally ponied up nearly for farrells legal fees in the past year so it was a little hard for farrell to work up much sympathy for how difficult it was for an entrepreneur without morals to make a living in california whats the matter craig you afraid this community service is going to put you in contact with the riffraff yeah among other things you got a problem with that you get your commoners out there rubbing shoulders with me and they find out who i am and next you know im getting hit up for money you wait youll see itll happen does that mean youre going with the plea ising pulled at his upper lip drummed his fingers on the table in front of him damn he said i didnt know if i should call i was worried about you youve always been able to call christina i appreciate it but there isnt anything to worry about im a big boy ill be all right im not trying to argue with you but you dont sound all right and saturday i thought saturday i was pretty good but it was an act i could see that well yes but what was i going to do with everybody there i couldnt very well sit in a corner and cry could i no im sorry i didnt mean i know what you meant christina and i thank you youre right youre saying its okay if i show it a little people arent judging me so hard right now is that it of course you see it you see things still its good to remember and im very glad you called a time like this you dont want to you dont want to push yourself on your friends the house has seemed to get pretty big mark im still here im thinking maybe i should just sell the damn thing i dont think id make any decisions like that for a while give yourself a little time for what though for things to become clearer oh they seem clear enough now thats almost the problem everythings crystal clear this is just the way things will be from now on time will make it better mark eventually it will it does okay im sorry im not saying its not horrible now no i know thats all right well listen im not much for conversation right now and i do thank you for calling me really ill be back in the office in a couple more days ill see you there sure okay then take care she put the phone down gently stood looking out at the traffic passing by her front window then picked it up and hit the redial button its me again a surprised chuckle wonderful to hear howve you been ive been insensitive not at all more than i want to be i dont know what youre feeling other than the pain mark its stupid to say time will make it better maybe it wont i just wanted you to know that if you need to talk sometimes it wouldnt be a burden thats all i wanted to say he didnt respond right away and when he did the voice was husky with suppressed emotion youre great he said thank you when he realized that the aidsinsurance matter involving craig ising was going to take up most of the day farrell had called and left a message with sams brother that hed pick her up on his way home and they could go out to dinner someplace larry and sally lived over twin peaks from sams old place in a gingerbread victorian and farrell wasnt halfway up the dozen stairs leading to the front porch when the door opened sam was coming out to him slamming the door behind her moving fast weve got to talk she said where have you been so let me get this straight he said some lady some woman wes okay some woman comes in to where you work and tells you this story it wasnt a story it was the truth he stopped she walked a couple more steps here we go now he said im going to try to finish one sentence then you can have one how about that you dont need to get snippy im not being snippy im trying to respond in whole sentences to the topic we are trying to discuss now this woman tells you that twentysomeodd years ago she went on a date with mark dooher and she took him back to her apartment and got him drunk and then he raped her and threatened to kill her sure why not that too and because of that if it is true it is true if itis true i should abandon my lifelong best friend whom you now seem to believe is a murderer thats where we are thats right he killed his wife because he allegedly raped this woman wes dont go all lawyer on me he didnt allegedly rape this woman he raped her no wait a minute she invited him up to her apartment plied him with drink started making out with him and then told him to stop thats right and he didnt she was giving him that look eyes hard and challenging thats rape ex post facto what does that mean it means now its considered rape then it wasnt considered rape its like people who say lincoln was a racist when they didnt have the same concept back then by todays standards everybody was a racist a hundred years ago same with date rape its all semantics its not semantics at all he raped her im not saying date rape isnt rape im saying thirty years ago a lot of girls said no and didnt really mean no im not going to get into how neanderthal that sounds wes but this particular woman didnt just say no she tried to fight him off and he told her hed kill her no he didnt what how can you possibly because i know mark dooher hes not going to kill somebody in college over a piece of ass come on sam youre a rape counsellor for christ sake you know how this goes she invites him up she asked for it right dont give me that one please i dont know if she asked for it i wasnt there but it sure wasnt the same thing as lurking in the bushes and assaulting her as she walked by yes it was wes thats the point they were still standing where theyd stopped in the middle of a fogbound street in the gauzy glow of one of church streets lights wes had his hands in his pockets he hadnt thought they were going hiking and in his business suit he wasnt dressed for the chill he forced himself to slow down take a breath not let this escalate theyd work it out it was just that right now they were both charging at one another he thought hed pull back a little lower the voltage look sam how about we go someplace sit down maybe have some food calm down a little she crossed her arms i am calm and i dont need that condescending take the little lady someplace she cant make a scene bullshit either i am not doing that i thought we might be able to have a reasonable adult discussion in a more comfortable environment this environment seemed to be comfortable enough until we got on this on rape or what youre calling rape you mean what im callingrape goddamn it wes i expected a lot more from you well yelling is a big help there now she was yelling put me down again dont discuss the real subject whatever you do jesus christ id like to discuss the real subject sam but first i cant get out a whole sentence and then im getting screamed at while im freezing my ass off getting all kinds of motive laid on me for the truly ominous condescending idea of finding someplace warm to sit down give me a break would you i didnt rape anybody im not the enemy here my enemys friend is my enemy he brought a hand up to his forehead thats good whats that kahlil gibran or the plo handbook its common sense is what it is its survival i didnt think we were in survival mode all women live every day in survival mode jeez thats good too what are you doing writing a book of feminist slogans fuck you she turned and was walking off he followed after her his own volume way up youve been working at that center too long you know that she whirled on him yeah thats right ive been working of course thats the problem women shouldnt work should they wes they shouldnt have their own lives sure thats what im saying sam thats what i think i wonder if you could twist it anymore im sure i could im a woman after all i dont get things right ill tell you something you didnt get at least this one thing right my friend mark dooher didnt kill his wife and id be goddamned surprised if he raped this lady either she saw his name in the paper she wants her twenty minutes of fame you ever think of that oh no wes that never crossed my mind you asshole she started walking away again stopped turned back i heard her i saw her face this happened goddamn it whether or not you believe it what happened she maybe said no thirty years ago and just forgot about it until now im sure sam said nothing did she seek counselling did she tell anybody did she report it to the police back then did she do a fucking thing no it ruined her life it changed everything in her life how sad for her and now damn look at this what a surprise mark doohers in the news and it all comes back and this is the great part this means my best friend who ive known only a hundred times longer than ive known you this means he killed his wife he loved and raised a family with please i mean it sam you got to get a life here this is ridiculous this time she started walking away and didnt turn back hey bart daddys home it was ten oclock the dog got up yawned and walked slowly over to where his master stood wes petted him distractedly then schlumped into the kitchen turning on the light checking for dog shit he paid a young woman who ran a small graphics business out of her apartment in the building to take bart out two or three times a day but sometimes that wasnt quite enough today it had been the refrigerator held a couple of six packs of rolling rock and he took out two bottles and opened them both drank one half down pulled out the kitchen chair and sat heavily at the table he felt a hundred years old he ached to simply pick up the phone there on the wall and apologize until dawn but he didnt move the phone didnt either eventually he lifted the bottle of beer again staring out at the night this was not supposed to happen everything had been going better than it ever had in his life even better he thought than it ever had with lydia when theyd been young and believed they must be in love in the first heady rush of physical pleasure and then in the next weeks of growing intimacy hed put sams occasional penchant for volatility out of his mind that first night when shed thrown him out after learning that he was defending levon copes hed chosen to believe that that had been an aberration born of insecurity and alcohol but evidently it wasnt it was better to find out now rather than later he supposed but he wasnt in the mood to put much of an optimistic spin on anything just now hed wracked his brain all the way home playing devils advocate with himself conjuring all the negative images of mark that he could remember but there were so few of them and that was the truth once in college when they were engaged mark had cheated on sheila but hed been riddled with guilt because of it told wes all about it on one of their retreats wondered if he should call off their impending marriage because he was such a bad person hed backhanded his son mark jr across the face for throwing his bat in a babe ruth league game that wes thought was marks worst moment but at the time mark had been working eighty hours a week trying singlehandedly to save his ailing firm and hed tried to turn even that incident bad as it was into something positive treating it as a type of wakeup call he was working too hard ignoring what was really important his family his spiritual values in some way these peccadilloes reassured wes about his friends character mark would be the last to say he was perfect of course he had sinned he was human hed done things he was ashamed of but these were why to wess mind he was balanced he wasnt wound so tightly holding in every tiny impulse to evil that he would one day need to explode so he tried to figure out what it was why the sudden rush from so many quarters to slander and vilify mark dooher jealousy was one thing mark was wealthy powerful and up until a couple of months ago lucky he was exactly the kind of person that lesser people loved to see destroyed then the trang business politically motivated and unfounded as it was had put a hole in marks bubble of invincibility and wes knew that an enduring truism of life was that accusations bred more accusations and now finally the dominant bull was injured limping this was the time to take him down when it could be done everybody was abandoning mark people were lining up to take shots at him when he was least able to defend himself well wes wasnt anybodys hero and he couldnt stop anybody from taking aim and firing but he could stand in front of his friend and try to defend him until he was strong again trangs murder this womans rape story the enemies were assembling and he didnt have to think too hard to figure out what was coming next they were going to charge him with sheilas murder and wes knew he would be the last line of defense and for once whatever they might dig up and however it spun he knew it wouldnt be true wes was going to defend him chapter twenty six a week later paul thieu got his first real break in the case it was not without some trepidation that he guided his cityissue plymouth off the freeway at the menlo park exit forty miles down the peninsula south of the city and negotiated the narrow entrance to the parking lot by the veterans administration building the short drive between the freeway and the va reminded him of th street between mission and bryant in san francisco the most dangerous walking blocks on the map though the climate down here was infinitely more benign the small town thoroughfare itself was a no mans land of reagans enduring legacy the mentally impaired homeless the cops called these people eight hundreds and their social workers called them fiftyone fifties after the welfare institutions code sections that defined them but by any name they were tragic derelicts drug addicts bag people thieu saw them every day in the city but here within a long spit of silicon valley where the sun always shone and the real estate glittered he found all this evidence of poverty and despair especially dispiriting he was also keenly aware of his vietnamese nationality men in old army uniforms singly or in small groups loitered here and there on the main street and under the trees that provided the shade for the parking lot thieu didnt have to guess which war they were veterans of and time might have passed he knew but in the brains of some of these guys it still might be he opened the car door into what was by san francisco standards blazing heat it was not yet noon and already in the mideighties thieu was wearing an ivory linen suit and decided he could leave his raincoat on the passenger seat where hed thrown it it was misting heavily in san francisco forty miles away the temperature was in the fifties a couple of guys in old fatigues nudged each other as he passed them on the way to the imposing doors but he smiled and said hello and was past them and through the doors before they had moved two steps the place had that old institutionalbuilding feel and smell a wide entryway with linoleum floors made every sound inside echo to his left a waisthigh counter separated the government workers from the veterans who were for the most part queued up waiting for their numbers to be called across from the counter a shiny lightgreen wall sported woodframed photographs of all the presidents since eisenhower as well as a decent assortment of admirals and generals including another one of eisenhower in uniform at the end of the entryway a large paned window let in a lot of light thieu stood a minute getting his bearings reading from the building directory in its glass bulletin board gradually he became aware that the noise had ceased behind him deciding to ignore it he found the room number for his appointment and moved out directly hey somebody was calling after him but he came to the big window hung a left and took the stairs two at a time they had been lucky locating chas brown here at the south peninsula va detox neither thieu nor glitsky had really known where brown might lead them but glitsky was directing this investigation and hed sent thieu down to conduct the interview last thursday and friday hed run around trying to get a handle on either a chas brown or a michael lindley the two other survivors of mark doohers platoon in vietnam their names had been provided during the trang investigation by dooher himself now glitsky smelled blood he told thieu that they simply had to find out everything they could about dooher from whatever source glitsky was working st francis wood talking to the neighbors working the pawnshops in the adjoining neighborhoods still looking against hope for the bayonet the clothes dooher was wearing something and thieu with his background started out to find yet another missing person chas brown wasnt a total burnout case true in his faded jeans and flannel shirt with his long unwashed graying hair and beard he didnt look like anyone who worked for a living blue or white collar but his eyes were clear his handshake firm he showed up at his counsellors office on time promptly at noon exhibiting no signs of prejudice toward thieu after a couple of minutes thieu offered to take him to lunch there was a terrific pizza place not far away named frankie johnny luigi too brown looked like he wouldnt turn food down he weighed about a hundred fifty pounds he was nearly six feet tall thieu also thought hed get franker answers if he was away from his counsellor so now they were sitting at a table outside under the green and white umbrellas sharing a large pizza of which thieu wouldnt be able to eat more than one enormous piece fully loaded with pepperoni sausage olives mushrooms peppers double cheese and anchovies one slice weighed in at nearly a pound judging from how he started it thieu guessed chas would finish the entire large pitcher of budweiser hed ordered he was already on his third glass thieu was having iced tea the two men werent yet friends but the beer wasnt exactly making chas taciturn the pocket tape recorder was rolling and theyd already covered thieus background verifying that he was too young to have fought in vietnam his father hadnt been in uniform either though hed been anticommunist all the way a capitalist in the silk trade in saigon the elder mr thieu had to leave when the city was abandoned by the us so thieu and chas were on the same side thats when my name changed brown had a lot of nervous energy tics and scratches eyes moving all the time but he was talking clearly if a little rushed maybe the beer would eventually mellow him out before i got in country i was charles charlie brown when i was a kid i would have done anything not to be named charlie brown so of course it stuck like glue then i get to nam and dooher says theres no charlie in his platoon im chas so im chas i thought it was a good omen at the time i thought dooher was a good guy shows you what i knew thieu didnt want to stop him and remained silent as brown downed another deep slug of beer the eyes going blank a moment another drink more emptiness blink the lights went back on led to the abrupt segue tried to be my friend yknow after after what the eyes came back then darted away you know i dont know about the dope all that i thought that was what you came down here for in fact thieus main avenue of inquiry was going to be about the ease of smuggling bayonets and rifles out of the country when your hitch was up instead a bonus chas brown was heading in a different direction what dope suddenly browns expression closed up was thieu trying to sandbag him in some way the open camaraderie the ruse of drinking together having lunch faded the change in brown was palpable suddenly thieu was the heat and that wouldnt help his investigation so he moved into damage control mode im not interested in dope chas im interested in a murder well yeah meaningless unforthcoming thieu pressed it look chas its none of my business what drugs youre taking or took i want you to understand that here he pointed at the tape recorder on the table between them im saying it on this tape its on the record this has nothing to do with you except insofar as you know something about mark dooher did he take drugs was that it brown moved out of the blazing sun into the shadow of the tables umbrella he wiped his high forehead and took a long pull of beer everybody took drugs he said everybody he scratched at his neck dooher bought our drugs he was the connection mark dooher was selling marijuana brown laughed marijuana look at me you think im strung out on marijuana you think thirty years down the line my brains fried on some doob he shook his head amazed at thieus world view were talking shit here china white skag thieu digested this horse man heroin youre saying mark dooher sold you heroin a continual nod thats what im saying thats what im saying not just me the whole platoon got his own stash free and sold to his guys did us a favor lowest price in nam thieu sat back rocked by this information but brown was going on unbidden and you know if you look at it the way it really was doohers the one who let it all happen it was his job to keep us straight instead he kept us wired thieu leaned forward let what happen brown wasnt good with direct questions they seemed to spook him he leaned back found himself out of the umbrellas shadow his face in the sun and that moved him forward again you dont know about this why did you want to see me i wanted to see if the guys in your platoon dooher specifically smuggled out their weapons if you knew if dooher had why though it had nothing to do with sheila dooher which was his case thieu ran with what he had we think dooher used a bayonet to kill somebody thats why browns face cracked a broken smile thieu had just verified something for him yeah he said yeah what thats how he did nguyen too thieu was learning about the art of interrogation with this man dont ask directly just keep him talking nguyen his source andre nguyen had a little shop just outside saigon pretended to sell groceries thieu must have looked confused brown put his beer mug down brought his face in close eye to eye come on man the guy he killed the story came out there had been no ambush with a platoon of stoned soldiers nguyen had sold dooher a load of bad heroin or maybe it was extragood heroin in any event dooher sold it to his troops and it overdosed all but two of them and this never got reported again an expression that told thieu that his world and browns operated on different planes dooher covered it he wasnt part of it we me and lindley we werent part of it we all alibied each other we were out on patrol the guys left back at camp had this bad load of shit and it killed them and the authorities believed you brown nodded enough but that wasnt really the end of it a slug of beer problem is dooher knows its his fault and we know its his fault so now he like wants to be friends afterwards make sure lindley and me we got no hard feelings howd he try to be your friend you know pulled us me and lindley some cherry r and r in hawaii he had a knack of getting what he wanted he thought hed show us a good time make up for the other some bullshit like that lindley wouldnt do it why not it was a direct question and brown hesitated again but thieu couldnt stop himself chas why didnt lindley want to go out with dooher he thought he was going to kill us why why cause we knew hed fucked up thats why we could ruin him if we told we were the only witnesses left and we were pretty bitter at dooher brown shrugged at the whole thing man you get tight over there with your guys youre like twenty years old and then wham theyre all dead but you it makes you bitter thieu believed it but you went out with dooher in hawaii chas nodded i just didnt see it he wasnt going to kill nobody lindley was just paranoid i thought now you dont think he was well he didnt try to kill me theres the proof of that the eyes seemed to go empty again but thieu saw something in them that chas brown was trying to keep hidden chas grabbed for the crutch of his beer glass but thieu surprised himself reaching out grabbing his wrist stopping him what he asked i always thought later that if lindley had come along he might have killed us both i mean when i showed up at his hotel alone it was like he freaked out goes all quiet on me like what the fuck i ask my guys out for a good time on me and they stand me up what kind of bullshit is that so what did happen that night nothing we got drunk well tell the truth first time in my life somebody got drunker than me i was i guess still a little scared what he might do browns ravaged face creased into a littleboy smile i poured out a lot of good rum that night still breaks my heart to think about it i bet it does thieu found the thread again and so after that you became friends not hardly why not cause he was an officer this time he got the beer to his mouth no not that i thought he was pathetic i guess thats why pathetic a nod you ever have somebody push on you too hard they want to be friends so bad and dooher wanted to be your friend it was all coming back now and browns head swung from side to side no no no he wanted to be forgiven thats all he wanted i mean as long as we were alive and he wasnt going to kill us then he wanted us to understand howbad he felt how he had proved it how hed made fucking amends how did he do that shit i shouldnt be telling you this youre a cop i am a cop so what thieus hand was still locked around his wrist and suddenly brown became aware of it he moved it raised the beer to his mouth drained it took a deep breath so he killed nguyen the guy who sold us the shag went to his store and gutted him with his bayonet wiped the fucking blade clean on his pajamas told me all about it man to man how hed taken this great risk and all to get the guy whod been responsible for everybodys od so id forgive him see what a hero he was can you believe that my lord glitsky sitting on the table in one of the interrogation rooms on the th floor the door closed behind him flicked off the tape recorder thats what i thought thieu said except i didnt use exactly those words he wiped his bayonet on the guys pajamas that was my favorite part too do you think this is enough to play for drysdale i think were getting there you know you came barging in with this you didnt hear the other news whats that we got the blood lab report in today you know what edta is glitsky consulted his notes sure ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid glitskys mouth hung open my sisters a nurse thieu explained i used to test her on stuff but what about it the edta glitsky was still shaking his head you think well most people think when you give blood they take it out put it in a vial spin it down or whatever do their tests right right right but often they need to add an anticoagulant to the blood to keep it from clotting and that my son is edta actually thats not precisely right they dont add it to the blood it comes in the vials theyve got purple stoppers on the top so so the blood all over sheila doohers bed supposedly left there by the perp when he was cut in the struggle was loaded with edta which means which means that dooher got his hands on some blood maybe at his doctors maybe the same place he got the surgical glove i dont know he thought hed leave a bunch on the bed send our slowwitted selves off in search of a man with apositive blood which couldnt be him but sadly for him the vial he picked up wasnt pure thieu tsked and how could he have known glitsky stood up of such questions are tragedies made chapter twenty seven at on tuesday morning glitsky thieu amanda jenkins and frank batiste were all jammed in front of art drysdales desk the door was closed behind them art was sitting back in his chair getting an angle on them its awful swell having you all stop by at once if id a known you was comin id have baked a cake any of you know that song no glitsky was thinking that he bet thieu knew it but didnt want to draw attention to himself the other guests looked around at each other and it was amanda jenkins who spoke up we want to talk about mark dooher art okay what about him he killed his wife glitsky said all right whats the problem i dont need a committee to tell me that since glitsky had the ball he decided to keep rolling it the problem he said is that he also killed victor trang and frank here tells me that mr locke may have had a hand in shutting down that investigation and if hes got some kind of political tie with dooher drysdale held up a palm whoa stop right there chris locke didnt stop any investigation period chris locke does not obstruct justice and were not going to talk about that here everybody understand that everyone nodded drysdale pointed at the head of homicide frank did i tell you to drop the trang investigation batiste swallowed you did say that unless we got some real evidence pretty soon we ought to move along and did we get some real evidence physical evidence that would withstand the rigors of a jury trial no okay so much for the old news now whats this about his wife sheila right glitsky took over again id like to just run the whole thing down its a little complicated and you tell me how you think it looks excuse me abe drysdales gaze went to jenkins amanda youve heard this already yes sir but you remember i heard levon copes too and you and i came to different conclusions this is like copes glitsky butted in its one of those times like copes where we know the perp yeah we know that first drysdale was shaking his head his lips tight and you know how uncomfortable that makes me which is why were here seeking your counsel and advice drysdale laughed out in the small room beautiful he said let the record reflect that i am truly snowed by this display of sincerity and trust he leaned forward elbows on his desk all right tell me all about it if i like it well ask my wife if she likes it well go to the grand jury i promise later around drysdale poked his head into homicide on the th floor saw glitsky at his desk and walked over i just called lous he said referring to lou the greeks and todays special is kung pao chicken greek pizza lous wife was chinese and the menu at the place often featured interesting culinary marriages such as this i ordered a medium enough for two and its going to be ready in drysdale checked his watch precisely seven minutes sounds delicious glitsky said getting up but im really only going because i want to see how they do it i make that stuff at home it almost never turns out they were in a booth along a wall in the back of the darkened restaurant the table was below street level the woodslatted windows began at their eyes and outside the view of the alley included two garbage dumpsters the barred back door of a bail bondsmans office rainbows of graffiti on every surface at the big meeting in his small office drysdale had listened attentively and said he wanted to review the reports but tentatively wasnt going to object to proceeding with the grand jury indictment on mark dooher but he and glitsky had a bit of a longer personal history which was why they were having lunch now lou the greek himself was hovering at the table wondering how todays masterpiece was being received its good drysdale was saying but you want my honest opinion lou id leave off the goat cheese lou was in his fifties and hed lived underground in a cop bar for twentyfive years so he looked closer to a hundred but his eyes still sparkled in a long lugubrious face but the goat cheese is what makes it greek why does it have to be greek glitsky asked how about just plain old kung pao chicken pizza like everybody else makes youve had this before lou asked it bothered him this was san francisco a major restaurant town and lou featured his wifes cuisine as cutting edge which in fact it was not particularly good but nobody else made anything like it lou they got this at the round table just without the goat cheese the greek turned to drysdale hes putting me on its possible art agreed but heres an idea the chicken why dont you just serve it over rice forget the pizza altogether call it kung pao chicken but then its chinese food the idea clearly distressed lou everybody makes kung pao chicken people come here to eat they expect lou the greeks something greek am i right i let my wife take over completely and pretty soon im lous dragon moon a chinese place im fighting for my ethnic identity here glitsky took a bite of the pizza on second thought leave the goat cheese maybe sprinkle on some grape leaves lou straightened up struck by some merit in glitskys suggestion kung pao dolmas he said you think drysdale nodded worth a try abe glitskys attention had suddenly wavered he was staring blankly out the window at the alley abe drysdale repeated you with us yeah sure i was telling lou king pao dolmas good idea coming back from far away glitsky nodded yeah good idea definitely but the real purpose of the lunch im just going to pretend to be a meddling picky defense attorney here now for a couple of minutes drysdale was saying i can see you and amanda want to run with this and my instinct tells me its going to go high profile in about ten seconds so id like to have answers for some questions that i predict will be asked by our evervigilant media to say nothing of my boss the pizza was done the tray cleared away glitsky had his hands folded around a fresh steaming mug of green tea on the table in front of him okay shoot all right dooher comes home from work brings some champagne into which he intends to put some chloralhydrate thereby to knock his wife out so that he can come back later and kill her but when he gets home she is already dead this is the theory right this was of course the nub of the problem but he doesnt know she is dead hes got his plan all worked out and hes moving fast all nerves he comes in says thank god shes not awake not moving and he sticks her rearranges the body to make it look like a struggle gets back to the driving range before anybody notices hes gone but he was gone abe hes been gone at least a halfhour and nobody noticed you talked to people there at the driving range right anyway forget that lets go back youre saying he poisoned her with chloralhydrate is that it how do we know she just didnt take the stuff what if she was committing suicide glitsky spun his tea slowly so your argument is that dooher waits until his wife commits suicide and then comes in and stabs the body with a knife and makes it look like a burglary he shook his head no art the knifewound is why its not suicide the drugs is why its not a burglary besides there wasnt enough chloralhydrate to kill her drysdale spread his palms i thought she was poisoned didnt you just say the chloralhydrate the chloralhydrate is the drug dooher gave her to knock her out make her go to sleep but what he didnt know was that she was evidently having a tough time with menopause and was already taking a drug called nardil for depression also just that day she had evidently dosed herself up with benadryl she had an allergy shot that morning so she was already drugged to the gills then she drank the champagne add alcohol mix and pour the chloralhydrate pushed her over it did her in okay drysdale sighed so what exactly does that leave us with the stabbing is a crime okay but its not murder one hell its not murder anything to stab a dead body it is murder one to poison somebody to death drysdale sat back in the booth contemplating it a quiet edge crept into glitskys voice he leaned in over the table this works art listen amandas argument isnt going to be that he meant to kill her with chloralhydrate even though that was the result he didnt intend to kill her until he stabbed her later but he did intend to give her poison and she died from that and the beauty is that stabbing her is what proves it and of course we can prove that we know he stabbed her not exactly my question okay this is what weve got you tell me glitsky outlined it all it was doohers knife and contained only his fingerprints he had left his house alarm system off and his nextdoor neighbor had seen him unscrewing his sidedoor light on the way out to the driving range another neighbor saw his car parked on the street around the corner from his house during the time he was supposedly hitting golf balls then there was wiping the blade on the victims clothes which glitsky had never encountered before in all his years in homicide and now it had happened twice in cases implicating mark dooher three times if you included chas browns vietnam story finally there was the blood that had been contaminated with edta and who else would have stabbed a dead woman and then faked a burglary when glitsky finished drysdale sat still for a moment youve got an eyewitness for the car glitsky nodded emil balian swears it was doohers car swears it was that night that time rock solid drysdale appeared satisfied theres your case he said dont let that guy die a beat but now just for me abe one more thing you want to tell me why he did it franks always telling me we dont need motives we just need evidence and franks right abe hes right but chris locke is going to be curious as to why a model citizen suddenly decides to kill his wife dont forget victor trang okay him too maybe two of them for no apparent reason why did he do this maybe sheila and trang were having an affair glitsky held up a hand just kidding the real answer is we dont know not yet well chris locke is going to ask abe and id be a whole lot more comfortable if i had something to tell him amandas got two possible theories which are this thing with sheilas drinking weve heard some talk both from neighbors and from some of doohers partners that she got silly when she was out in public she might have pushed it too far become an embarrassment i dont think so drysdale said flatly the other one is money money is always good what kind of money a million six insurance the wife had a million six now were talking well they both had it the same amount on each other why i gather when dooher reorganized his firm a couple of years ago things got pretty lean they were living on their savings deferring his salary the whole thing dooher thought hed turn it around eventually and he did but if he died halfway through sheila was pretty exposed so they started to buy some term on him just in case and then she evidently wanted to protect him if she died in the middle of it so bottom line doohers getting it yep drysdale stretched his neck looked around the now nearempty bar all right he said slipping out of the booth it could be tighter but i think weve got enough ill tell amanda that if we need it were going to go with the insurance drysdale waited until the end of the day he was going to be reporting to chris locke anyway on a host of other matters and while he didnt for a moment dream that hed simply slip this one through he thought he would package it to appear within the realm of normal business hah as you might imagine art ive already gotten a call on this warning me to expect just such a moment the archbishop is not going to be pleased he is convinced there is some kind of vendetta going on against dooher i dont think so chris i think he killed his wife for a million six in insurance money and why did he kill trang jesus christ art people dont just become homicidal maniacs one morning out of the blue for no reason at all drysdale was suddenly happy in the midst of this reaming that hed earlier decided not to mention as part of his argument the chas brown story instead he stuck to the question at hand he killed trang because trang pissed him off hey im not saying its the best reason ive ever heard but it worked he got away with that so he got cocky decided he could do the same with his wife and collect big time why does he want to collect big time does he need the money is his business failing since drysdale knew that if anything the contrary was true he thought it would be wiser to shift gears get on to the evidence the point is this time weve got witnesses we got fingerprints on the murder weapon we have one good citizen who saw doohers car near his house when he said he was at the driving range chris weve got a case weve got a righteous murder one but locke was still frowning his head swinging slowly back and forth side to side and glitskys the investigator again howd he get on this i dont know chris but hes hes got a damn conflict of interest if you ask my opinion even if hes not out to get this guy for whatever reason it looks likehe is which is just as bad locke didnt want to add although they both understood that glitsky who for statistical purposes within the bureaucracy was considered black was someone locke couldnt afford politically to alienate or even to a great degree to criticize as a show of solidarity locke had even attended flos funeral a few weeks before well im afraid thats water under the bridge now chris glitskys the inspector of record locke stood still for a moment then swore and slammed his hand down on his desk he walked over to the windows and stood staring out his hands clasped behind his back without turning he spoke conversationally i really really dontwant to charge anybody much less an influential lawyer with a murder he didnt commit no sir neither do i now locke did turn what do you think art commitment time drysdale spoke right up i think glitskys right though it may be a bitch to prove you dont think theres anything to him being out to get dooher planting evidence anything like that or his wifes death has but drysdale was emphatic not a chance back out to the window all right im going to give you my decision and youre not going to like it but here it is we go for the indictment on killing his wife but not on victor trang from what you say were not going to prove trang well sir there is the consistent mo with wiping the blade forget it its not going to happen so we go with one count murder one no specials this meant special circumstances murderkilling a police officer multiple murders murder for profit and other especially heinous crimes but weve got specials at least two ways no locke was emphatic i am supporting my staff on the one charge that it has any chance of proving but personally i must tell you art i am not convinced it smells funny to me but i cant not charge it can i i dont think so no all right then go get the indictment but i want you to ride this case like white on rice it starts to go sideways i want to know about it yesterday all right yes sir and one other thing i want you to ask for a quarter million dollars bail what drysdale was stunned this was unheard of murder suspects did not get out on bail or if they did it was for millions a quarter million dollars bail meant that mark dooher could put up his ten percent bond on one of his credit cards and be out of jail before he was in in effect he would never be arrested you heard me art this particular man is innocent until hes proven guilty and i want him treated innocentdo you understand but this bail sir the precedent alone this is an unprecedented case if amanda jenkins wants it and you think its a winner ill go along because i respect you art but well do it my way and thats the end of it but he held up a warning hand no buts thats the end of it chapter twenty eight glitsky liked this woman the appointment was scheduled for his home at and that was the exact moment she rang the doorbell glitsky generally believed that cleanliness was next to godliness but punctuality was next rita was starting off on the right foot hed been surprised at first by her nationality since hed expected rita schultz to be somehow vaguely germanic but she was a hefty and healthylooking hispanic woman her greatgrandfather she explained had come over to mexico with the emperor maximilians troops then stayed she was thirtythree years old and her english was accented but at least as grammatical as most of what glitsky heard on television she had been working for six years for the same couple the references were glowing the couple were having their third child and the woman had decided that she was going to take an extended leave from her job in advertising and stay home with her new baby and the other two so they wouldnt need a nanny anymore but it did mean that rita could not start for glitsky until after the baby was born it was due any day he thought that for rita schultz it would be worth the wait the light had faded long ago and christina was sitting alone in her office at mccabe roth the room was small stark and utilitarian with a desk a computer terminal a bookshelf a gunmetal legal file with her door open she could look out across the open reception area and catch a glimpse of the oakland bay bridge but she had no windows of her own the walls in her office had been bare when shed moved in but shed tacked up a couple of posters to lessen the claustrophobic feel on her desk she had a picture of her parents smiling at her from the pool deck in ojai she heard a noise somewhere on the floor and glanced up from the brief she was writing seeing her parents in the picture smiling and carefree in the bright sunlight she felt a pang and looked at her watch what the hell was she doing with her life she stretched and stood thinking shed go see what other lunatic was burning the oil the way she was at her door she paused it was marks office the light on now he hadnt been back into work yet she crossed the reception area the sense of disappointment when it wasnt mark brought her up short she hadnt really been consciously aware that she was waiting to see him wanting to see him again shed been biding her time until he could face coming back into work and then thinking it must be him in his office this late at night her heart had quickened but it wasnt him another man was standing by the wraparound windows looking out at the mezmerizing view she knocked on the open door wes farrell turned smiled weakly she couldnt help but notice how drawn and tired he seemed c est moi i thought everybody would have gone home by now she took a step into the room can i help you i dont think so he held up a key by way of explanation mark asked if id stop by on my way home and pick up his inbox he must be thinking about coming back to work wes moved over to doohers desk picked up his briefcase and opened it what are you still doing here christina shrugged brownie points i guess i wanted to finish my brief by the morning how is mark doing farrell raised his eyes hes lying pretty low i havent seen him since the funeral weve done some phone he finished stowing doohers papers in his briefcase snapped shut the lid hell be all right christina hes pretty tough i dont know if tough helps at a time like this well he smiled ruefully it doesnt hurt lifting the briefcase he came around the desk over next to christina he gestured her out turned off the lights in doohers office closed the door and locked it wes are you worried about what mark the police sam said he turned to her and his shoulders sagged i dont want to talk about sam and i dont know whats going on with the police to tell you the truth i dont think mark does either so far theyve left him alone maybe thats a good sign you dont sound very confident i dont think i am but if he wasnt there i know but if youre predisposed to see something youd be amazed how often youll see it i think the police got stuck on the trang murder and suddenly mark went from being an upstanding businessman to potential suspect and once youre a potential suspect well you know this its a lot easier to accuse somebody a second time but not if he wasnt even there maybe but all theyve got to do is have somebody at the driving range say they couldnt swear he stayed there all night and then they walk around the neighborhood asking everybody if they saw mark dooher or somebody who looked like him or his car or a car that looked like his car and somebody will have seen something or thought they did and thats all theyll need even sam no ive got to get going he started toward the elevator what about sam wes he made it another couple of steps before the spring gave out and he stopped what happened with sam he turned around actually sam is a perfect example of what im talking about after he hired rita and she left glitsky was back in his kitchen rattling around when his beeper went off he called the number and learned that paul thieu was still working had beeped him from a pay phone not ten blocks away glitsky had sent him out on what appeared to be another wildgoose chase and for the second time in two days thieu had discovered something glitsky gave him his home address and told him to come on up no sooner had he opened the door when thieu enthused dr peter harris i realized going over to his place that i couldnt ask he wouldnt know about any missing surgical gloves theyre not any kind of a controlled item but the blood hes sure of he even thinks he knows precisely whose blood it was though well never be able to prove it and why is that paul because the man is dead and cremated hes gone it had been glitskys idea to question doohers physician to see whether any vials of blood had gone missing in the past month or so he reasoned that dooher had to have gotten it somewhere and his own doctors office seemed the most likely spot so hed told thieu that the place to start would be sheilas female doctor whom they already knew it might not be much of a stretch to suppose that the family physician marks doctor would be somewhere on sheilas documentation or records did you have to mention dooher the police were keeping the edta angle out of the news for the time being so it would be better if no names were used thieus face already animated lit up ever further no he didnt even ask i showed him my id and told him we were talking to a lot of doctors doing a kind of informal survey on how often blood got lost from their offices or labs you made this up yeah i told him that with our new dna tracking and all we were seeing more and more criminals contaminating crime scenes with we thought stolen blood to throw us off so we were trying to track the sources of it and he bought this thieu broke a grin i have an honest face anyway he said it almost never happens especially since aids blood is a highsecurity item but it turns out his lab did lose this one vial last month the doc was really upset because the patient was an old guy with bad veins who pitched a fit over having his blood taken at all and then they had to do it again and he is marks doctor harris i couldnt help but notice doohers name in the rolodex on his receptionists desk so unless its a coincidence glitsky still hadnt closed the door or invited thieu in but neither of them seemed to notice okay lets get a subpoena tomorrow for harriss records and find out the last time dooher saw him do we need to do that if were letting the cat out of the bag about the edta why dont i just call him back and ask him if you want to invite me in in ten minutes they knew dooher had gone for his yearly physical a couple of weeks ago dr harris would doublecheck on the exact date in the morning and also when the blood was reported missing but he thought the two dates were in the same general time span wes farrell delivered doohers inbox and his friend asked if hed like to come in and talk about things now in the turreted library wes crossed one leg over the other sinking back into the soft leather ive got to ask you mark ive been wrestling with it all day sam and i broke up over it and id kind of like that to have not been for nothing you two broke up over whether or not i slept with somebody in college not slept with mark raped i dont believe this he began pacing fingers to his temples whats next where are they digging this up what did sam say the womans name was price i think he stopped pacing and took a breath i have never heard of anybody named price i never dated anybody named price i swear on sheilas grave and ps old buddy ive never raped anybody either its not my style jesus christ sam believes i did this where did this price woman come from i dont know she walked into the center and said youd raped her when exactly did i rape her in college sometime you were out drinking and she brought you back to her room i dont know suddenly dooher snapped his fingers diane lord diane taylor of course of course you do know her no im not sure an ottoman was handy and dooher sat heavily on it i dont know any diane price wes but i did go out a couple of times with a diane taylor if its diane taylor lets hope its not diane taylor why not because diane taylor is an unbalanced person wes shes done every drug in america twenty times over she slept with every single other guy i knew at stanford including you including me before i even met sheila and with her full consent i assure you he moved the ottoman forward lowered his voice wes you know more than anybody the couple of times i screwed up on sheila didnt i come crying to you but this wasnt a screw up this if it was diane taylor was getting laid a couple of times before i developed any taste in women jesus shes now saying i raped her evidently and ruined her life in the bargain dooher hung his head and shook it raising his eyes he met his friends gaze its just a black lie wes i dont know what i can tell you i didnt do anything like that i wouldnt i know farrell said i didnt think so but i had to ask all right a long frustrated sigh okay but this gets old especially at this particular juncture in my life you know what im saying im not having my best week no id imagine not me neither actually doohers voice softened im sorry about your girlfriend i feel if it hadnt been for me no its not you mark it was her it was me so go back and tell her youre sorry leave me out of it i can get another lawyer whose life i wont ruin youre not ruining my life and i am your lawyer just so youre sure im sure im sure you didnt do any of this thats good to hear because i didnt well then heres to the oldfashioned idea of friends standing by each other and to hell with the rest of em amen to that dooher said and thank you chapter twenty nine the conference room at mccabe roth had seen more somber moments but not since the downsizing layoffs and this may have been worse than any of those it was five oclock on this monday evening one day shy of two weeks from the day of sheilas death mark dooher waited until the room was full before having janey page him and tell him it was time dooher lingered one last moment outside the room aware of the muted tones within these people were worried he had returned to work the previous wednesday enduring the sympathy of his partners and staff taking individual meetings with key people for the rest of the week reassuring one and all that life would go on he was fine the firms client base was solid and then sundays chronicle broke the story with the frontpage headline local lawyer suspected in wifes murder sources at the hall of justice have confirmed that the grand jury is considering an indictment on a prominent san francisco attorney mark dooher for the murder of his wife sheila the long article went on to include all the other details that the unnamed sources provided the other allegations from the rape of diane price to the murders of victor trang ten weeks earlier and andre nguyen in vietnam dooher and farrell had spent all of the morning denying everything they had held a press conference in wess office yes they were planning on suing the chronicle and the police department no he had never raped anybody hed never killed anyone in vietnam or anywhere else this was a carefully orchestrated character assassination political overtones despondent desperate police inspector blah blah blah theyd hit all the high notes and the media had gone into its fandango all the local stations were carrying it by the noon broadcasts radio talkshows picked it up the office had gotten calls from newsweek and time and usa today clearly it was going to turn into a circus he opened the conferenceroom door and all noise ceased he went to the chair at the head of the table and stood a moment meeting the eyes of his people one by one he came to christina and gave her an almost imperceptible extra nod finally he cleared his throat at his earlier request janey had placed a copy of the sunday chronicle in a folder at his place dooher picked up the folder opened it and withdrew the paper holding it up so that the headline fairly screamed he by contrast spoke with great control quietly i did not do any of this he said i will fight these charges until the day i die no one said a word he scanned the room again the sea of faces staring back at him rapt the current of tension was palpable underscored by the barely audible sibilance of heavy breathing janey and three of the other women in the room were crying he continued i wanted to meet with all of you face to face and tell you this i want to sit here and answer any questions you might have were a room full of lawyers and youll notice i dont have my lawyer present in here hes sitting in my office waiting until were finished i dont have anything to hide he glanced a last time at the newspaper then put it back in its folder sitting down he clasped his hands in front of him on the table i am at your complete disposal glitsky and thieu armed with their warrant stood in the empty reception area for a couple of seconds wondering where everyone was that odd red evening light seemed to shimmer in the moted air and the place appeared absolutely deserted this is spooky thieu whispered doohers office glitsky said i know where it is they walked the long hallway through the center of the building offices to either side all of them empty the light blessedly shaded in the interstices between them the area opened up again in front of doohers office janeys area the view again the light glitsky knocked on doohers door and sensed the movement inside he put his hand on his gun and the door opened on wes farrell weve been expecting you he said still with his staff in the conference room dooher looked over and stood when the door opened excuse me he said to the silent table in front of him he came outside to meet them closing the door behind him youre making a terrible mistake sergeant he said you have the right to remain silent glitsky began while thieu more or less gently took doohers arm and placed a handcuff over one wrist turning it behind his back is that necessary the door opened again and thieu put out a hand against it just a minute please police but the door got pushed open anyway roughly sergeant glitsky glitsky stopped his recital he remembered her now no problem stunning in the sepia light her color high eyes flashing ms carerra he said im sorry can i ask you to please wait back inside no you cant this is outrageous farrell stepped forward christina she jerked her arm away faced off on them all whats the matter with you sergeant cant you see what youre putting this good man through look at him he didnt do anything goddamnit look at him would you but glitsky was looking at her christina its all right dooher said thieu had snicked the other cuff on dooher and now he was advancing on christina im afraid im going to have to ask you to get back in there ma am right now glitsky said paul its okay its not okay christinas hands were clenched tears of anger were beginning to gleam in her eyesthis isnt right why are you doing this christina dooher repeated softly almost like a lover they cant prove it its all right then to wes gently take care of her would you christina looked pleadingly at dooher he met her eyes she started to reach a hand up but wes farrell took it some profound energy unmistakable flowed between them glitsky saw it and suddenly knew that the very slim chance that he might in fact be wrong had disappeared they had inadvertently given him the last piece the elusive key to the whole puzzle a motive part four chapter thirty the dooher case had enthralled much of the public and captivated the media not only because of the bizarre set of facts in the case itself but because it had so deeply polarized the already balkanlike factions that made up san francisco wes farrell had carefully manipulated the coverage accusing glitsky of using dooher as a pawn in his own campaign for advancement within the police department there was simply no case against dooher it was all political glitsky abetted by activist feminist prosecutor amanda jenkins was simply trying to make his bones by pushing a highprofile case in front of police chief dan rigby who was a rubber stamp for the liberal mayor conrad aiken at the same time glitsky was counting on the support of district attorney chris locke a black liberal supported by two gay supervisors on doohers side he had the archbishop of san francisco most of the citys legal community a host of independent angry white males including some very vocal radio personalities dooher was white and male stories appeared in which people who had known him and whom hed fired recounted his insensitive remarks about his own lesbian daughter there were no gay attorneys in the firm he ran he must be homophobic no women had made partner in his firm either he was on record as being antiabortion in short mark doohers public defense was that he was a modernday dreyfuss exactly the kind of scapegoat an ambitious liberal zealot like glitsky would need to bolster his reputation and advance his career the sergeant had taken the lieutenants exam and in what was widely viewed and roundly criticized in certain circles as another liberal end run to enhance his prestige as a prosecution witness he had been promoted to head of homicide outside judge oscar thomasinos courtroom on the rd floor of the hall of justice things were heating up building security had erected a makeshift sawhorse chute through which spectators at the trial would have to pass before they entered the courtroom at the double doors a metal detector further slowed ingress the metal detector at the front entrance to the hall had been known to miss the occasional weapon and thomasino didnt want to take chances in his courtroom so on this cold and clear monday morning the ninth day of december the hallway outside department was a microcosm of the city and it was all but unbridled bedlam there had already been a miniriot between the veterans of foreign wars who supported dooher and the vietnam veterans of america who believed chas brown seven people had to be restrained by the building cops and two were removed from the hallway and arrested but that hadnt ended it their blood up a couple of hippies from the vva group waded into a contingent of vietnamese activists who were there protesting the fact that dooher wasnt being charged with the trang or nguyen murders both of which had received enormous media attention it didnt help that the chute was funneling everyone into the same place inside the courtroom it wasnt much calmer the hard wooden theatrestyle foldup seats and all the standingroom area in and around them were crammed with print and network reporters jockeying for space womens rights activists wanted diane prices story to be heard prochoice and prolife advocates sniped at each other across the central aisle the veterans whod made it inside werent getting along much better than they had in the hallway and this was merely for the pretrial motion phase before jury selection had even begun attorneys for both sides went before the judge and talked about the evidence they would be presenting about what would be allowed what barred normally this was not a public sexy part of a trial it was often a lot of legalese and mumbojumbo but if any of the political and social issues that surrounded this trial were going to be part of it today was when everyone was going to find out the judge hadnt yet entered the courtroom but the court reporter was at her machine in front of the bench the clerk sat with his computer printouts off to the side and the three bailiffs stood at ease in their uniforms at the defense table mark dooher was a study in careful control he and his attorneys had come into the hall of justice and then into the courtroom through the back door to avoid having to confront either the reporters or the crowds demonstrating in the hallways outside now dooher sat somber and subdued his hands folded in front of him on the table on his right was wes farrell whod lost his ten extra pounds and abandoned his former air of slovenliness with his maroon tie and charcoalgray brooks brothers suit he was every inch the successful lawyer on the other side of the defendant sat christina carrera by some accounts the other woman for whom dooher had killed his wife this theory seemed to suffer under the burden of inspection the two had been hounded by reporters nearly constantly for months now and they had spent little or no personal time together theyd never been caught out at any private tryst they denied any personal involvement with each other beyond a mutual friendship respect and commitment to proving dooher not guilty christina had only passed her bar exam two weeks before but at doohers request had been on his defense team from the beginning over farrells strenuous objections dooher had sprung the idea on him as they were leaving the hall of justice after posting bail farrell had laid a hand on his friends sleeve let me get this straight you want christina carrera who hasnt even passed the bar to be my second chair in your murder trial shell have passed the bar by the time we go to trial okay so even then thats your plan thats it farrell nodded appearing to give it serious thought how can i phrase my response so that its both powerful and unambiguous and yet subtle and sensitive ahh the words are coming to me are you out of your fucking mind not at all wes its a terrific idea its the worst idea ive ever heard the very worst dooher started walking forcing wes to tag along down off the steps of the hall along bryant no listen i cant listen mark it doesnt bear discussion but dooher was going on we both agree weve got political issues on our hands here right here we are two old white guys the very image of what san francisco hates what any representative jury is going to hate it doesnt hate no hear me out and at the prosecution table weve got a woman da and a black cop representing the forces of justice we need to steal their own thunder diversity okay so well get a second who doesnt look like us but not her ive already heard talk about the two of you dooher stopped walking there is nothing to that nothing i didnt say there was mark im telling you what ive heard other people saying well then all the better get the rumors out of the closet put her on the team and well all be under a microscope for months and they wont find a damn thing cause there isnt anything she is very bright you know law review top of her class bright schmight mark shes not even a lawyer weve covered that she will be shes got passion and brains and shell work her ass off for you at a fraction of what youd have to pay somebody else you mean what youd have to pay someone else youre telling me moneys the issue no thats incidental ill save a few bucks but i want her with us shes pretty as hell men on the jury are going to want to be on her side farrell was shaking his head men on the jury will be jealous of you and women will be intimidated by her not true you want to risk your life on that dooher seemed to consider that notion im a risktaker wes my gut tells me im right in this case ive lived my life believing what my gut tells me so yeah i guess id risk my life on this thats who i am and ive done pretty well with it dont you think wes caught the unspoken message better than you have old buddy old pal but this was a terrible idea wes couldnt make himself just roll over and accept it though he could see where this discussion was going to lead what if i cant work with her what if we dont get along why wouldnt you get along two professionals one cause you both believe in whats not to get along then a sop to farrells ego youll be the man wes she takes orders from you and shell jump at the opportunity then through hoops if you ask her to they were walking again it was a blustery midafternoon and cars packed all of bryants four lanes traffic lined up for the five oclock commute across the bay bridge had halted horns and swearing why do you want her mark really i just told you farrell shook his head no i mean personally im asking this as your friend not your attorney okay you ve got to see how badly this could play dont you yeah he finally admitted weve said theres a risk i think its worth taking but why dooher walked on for a few more steps then put an arm around farrells shoulder i guess the same reason i want you i just dont feel comfortable with a hired gun he pulled farrell closer to him shes got faith wes she believes in me on the prosecution side of the courtroom amanda jenkins had abandoned her trademark miniskirt for a conservative dark blue suit shed let the frost grow out of her hair and now wore it shoulderlength curled under next to her helping her arrange her papers at this moment was lieutenant abe glitsky glitsky had tried to put the madness of all of this out of his life over the past months hed had enough on his mind with his children and his new job batistes prediction had come true and glitsky had been promoted within his unit and now he was running homicide the paper could say whatever it wanted about the politics of his promotion but he knew hed been batistes first choice as his successor and hed scored secondhighest among applicants for lieutenant hed earned it the way he saw it mark dooher was unfinished business from his days as a sergeant he had investigated the case assembled the evidence and delivered it to the district attorney it was his case until dooher got sentenced so as the da had requested as the investigating officer glitsky sat inside the rail at the prosecution table next to amanda jenkins wearing the dark suit hed bought for flos funeral and hadnt worn since almost seven months ago he was going to be there every day for the duration of the dooher trial california evidence code section c provided that the da could appoint an officer or employee to be present at the trial and prosecutors liked the investigating officer to be there for any number of reasons to prepare other witnesses for what they might expect to bounce theories and strategies off another professional to have someone to talk to during recesses to watch the judge and the jury if a juror fell asleep during testimony for example hed tell jenkins that perhaps she should go over it a second time but mostly he was there as a second set of ears to hear what a witness actually said as opposed to what everyone except the jury expected and therefore heard there was a huge difference and thats what abe was listening for all rise department of the superior court of the city and county of san francisco is now in session judge oscar thomasino presiding farrell stood pulled at his tie and cleared his throat his nerves were frayed nearly to breaking he had been in courtrooms hundreds of times but nothing came close to the electricity surrounding this case and now finally after all the preparation it was beginning thomasino in his black robe ascended to the bench sitting he adjusted his robe arranged some papers took a sip of water whispered something to his court reporter who smiled knowing that it was undoubtedly a ritual pleasantry farrell still wondered what the judge had said if it was about any of them thomasino raised his bushy eyebrows to include the courtroom everyone was getting seated again shuffling around and the good morning thomasino perfunctorily uttered went largely unheeded it didnt seem to bother the judge he turned to the court clerk tapped his gavel once as though checking to see that it still worked and nodded to the clerk call the case the clerk stood superior court number the people of the state of california versus mark francis dooher counsel state their appearances for the record farrell looked at his client to his left then further down the table to christina his second chair a thumbs up a practiced smile for her confidence for his clients he felt little of that confidence himself concerned his weakness in accepting christina as second chair would fatally harm the defense christina looked good hell she always looked good and she certainly was game to fight this battle for as long as it took farrell even had to admit she was a substantial and resourceful person with a damn good legal mind but so what in spite of that in spite of her gungho attitude and good humor he wished she could simply disappear because she was in love with their client goddamn it wes believed that there was nothing yet between them but he never doubted that there would be and privately that shook him this was the unspoken motive farrell had no indication that amanda jenkins was planning to bring it up during the trial but it was the only argument for doohers guilt that farrell couldnt refute this one question lay buried under the rational arguments in the very pit of his being there had been nights when it rose ghoulish and woke him in a sweat but the time for reflection had passed thomasino all business ostentatiously opened his folder read for a nanosecond and was now skewering both attorneys tables ms jenkins he began mr farrell before we call the first jury panel weve got a fourohtwo to rule on jenkins stood up at her table yes your honor the judge was reading again youve got two motions here and both of them have to do with character evidence which you know can only be used in rebuttal by the prosecution thomasino was clarifying this technical point but that was what motions were about as a matter of law evidence of bad character could not serve as proof that a defendant had committed any particular crime one couldnt say for example that because joe smith beat his dog it followed hed killed his wife the law further recognized the perhaps natural human inclination for the prosecution to want to tarnish a defendants reputation by bringing up every bad thing that person had ever done so that it would seem more likely that that person had done the particular thing they were accused of so it created a check to keep this from happening unless the defense brought up evidence of a defendants good character first the evidence code forbade the prosecution from introducing evidence of bad character farrell had filed his motion because amanda jenkinss witness list had included some of doohers past coworkers not all of whom had the fondest memories of him but most of all the accusations of both chas brown and diane price had become joined at the hip to the actual murder charges against dooher jenkins clearly thought that these were critical to an understanding of who mark dooher was the thrust of her prosecution strategy obviously was that dooher was not the man he appeared to be and without character evidence that was going to be a tough nut she may have thought she had enough physical evidence and a proveable theory that stood a chance of convicting him but she wanted more if she could get it on the other hand if farrell stuck only to refuting the physical evidence that jenkins presented the issue of doohers character would never come up the defense had to be first to bring up character or it would remain inadmissible so it was tempting to simply forget it farrell wasnt sure he was going to need it anyway on the other hand farrell knew that sometimes you could refute all the evidence and still the jury would not see it your way innocent until proven guilty was a wonderful concept the prosecution had the burden of proof all right but the daytoday reality of human beings was to assume that people didnt get arrested and brought to trial unless they were probably guilty so farrell like jenkins in this regard knew it never hurt to have more and he had the best possible character witness he could have dreamed of james flaherty the archbishop of san francisco whether or not any of the jury members turned out to be catholic farrell believed that the moral authority flaherty would bring to the witness stand would be unassailable he was torn to be safe hed put the archbishop on his witness list his motion asked for a ruling once hed called the archbishop and thus put character at issue would jenkins be allowed to call price and brown farrell obviously did not want the jury to hear from either of them jenkins was responding to this your honor she was saying archbishop flaherty will not be testifying that he was with the defendant on the night of the murder he doesnt corroborate mr doohers alibi for the time of the murder therefore his only possible connection to this case is to serve as a character witness and once he does that thomasinos eyebrows lifted slightly and he spoke right up i know the law counsellor but i still question the relevance of the proposed testimony of either of your two witnesses your honor if the court please farrell was on his feet mark dooher has lived most of the last year under the shadow of these ridiculous accusations unsubstantiated slander without any shred of evidence to support them even if the prosecution had dug up some witnesses to bolster these baseless charges they will be talking about alleged crimes from thirty years ago this is very remote in time these remarks brought the first unanimity from the disparate factions in the gallery and it was negative everyone except the reporters was here with some kind of agenda and farrell was trying to nip in the bud any discussion of the social issues represented by the testimonies of diane price and chas brown remote in time my ass one of the gallery women yelled he still raped her she was ejected from the courtroom for her pains when thomasino had restored order farrell stood again and found himself making a speech your honor any examination of these charges will involve a substantial waste of court time litigating ancient history this whole trial and we see proof of this already in this courtroom will end up being about an alleged rape and alleged homicide that happened years ago and thousand of miles from here its going to confuse and prejudice the jury and its just plain not fair to introduce this flimsy stuff how are we supposed to defend against allegations from a couple of substance abusers who say nothing for thirty years then come out of the woodwork at the first sign of a tv camera at the explosion following this question which farrell expected thomasino slammed his gavel five times glared did it again he ordered three more people out after the bailiffs had gotten them removed a deathly silence ensued i want everyone to understand this thomasinos voice was barely audible forcing everyone to listen he pointed a finger at the back of the courtroom waving it back and forth to include everybody you people watching these proceedings are not a part of it and any attempt to make yourselves part of it will force my hand any more outbursts i will clear this courtroom he pointed his gavel at farrell you may proceed mr farrell carefully farrell got the message the judge understood that he had purposely provoked the gallery this wasnt going to be tolerated he deemed it prudent to wrap it up ms jenkins hasnt got any real evidence in this case so shes thrown in these baseless charges in the hope of convicting my client through attrition she would have us believe these witnesses will testify about mr doohers character but thats precisely not what theyre going to be doing theyre going to be accusing him of other crimes for which the prosecution has no evidence they have no place in this courtroom jenkins had heard enough we do have evidence then formally charge him farrell shot back the gallery didnt exactly rumble behind them but thomasino held up his gavel and whatever noise was starting came to an abrupt end i would ask counsel to address their remarks to the court not to one another he was silent a moment then continued the defendant is on trial here for killing his wife that is all he has been charged with and that is what this trial is going to be about farrell nodded with satisfaction if this were the judges decision that the jury wasnt going to hear from either chas brown or diane price it was a good sign for them therefore thomasino was going on it is the courts ruling under section of the evidence code that the proposed testimony of chas brown regarding the alleged murder of an unnamed person committed by the defendant is vietnam some twentyeight years ago is inadmissible it is much more prejudicial than probative not only is the alleged event remote in time any discussion of it would be unduly consumptive of court time especially ms jenkins in light of the fact that mr brown did not see this alleged murder and therefore cannot testify that this murder happened at all there was a muffled chorus of rightons and yeahs from the gallery but thomasinos glare put a quick stop to it however the judge continued although equally remote in time the character testimony of diane price regarding her alleged rape is that of a firsthand witness your honor farrell could see the way this might go and he had to object this alleged rape never took place and even if it did it has nothing to do with the crime mr dooher is charged with you cant allow mr farrell the issue is only going to arise if you bring up character in the first place if you do then as you know the prosecution can bring rebuttal witnesses if you in turn wish to attack the credibility of those witnesses you may yes your honor but thomasino cut him off by addressing jenkins ms jenkins it is the courts ruling that you may call diane price as a character witness once that issue has been tendered by the defense thank you your honor but i must tell you that i will instruct the jury as to how to consider this proposed testimony this is not going to turn into a rape trial there was another buzz in the gallery and this time the judge did bring his gavel down he looked at his watch mr farrell ms jenkins any other lastminute motions youd like the court to consider before we begin jury selection no all right then well take a twentyminute recess while the first panel gets settled in the tedium of jury selection consumed the rest of the morning and judging from thomasinos thoroughness as he directed the voir dire it was going to continue to be a slow process sixteen prospective jurors out of the first panel of sixty had already been dismissed because of their familiarity with the case this was an enormous percentage indicative of the intense media coverage to date and the trial was only beginning it was going to get much worse the defense team had rented a small room next to a bail bondsmans office across the street from the hall of justice and wes split off from them on the way over to get sandwiches which inadvertently left christina and mark alone they entered the room together and closed the solid wooden door christina put her briefcase on the desk and turned around mark had been a couple of steps behind her and the room was cramped in any event they stood a foot apart christina had been figuratively backing away for months suddenly now the physical being that had been sheila dooher no longer stood as a barrier between them the opening volleys in the trial signalled a new phase mark had to recognize it now too he had to know that christina would be there for him she met his eyes i dont know about you she said but i could use a hug farrell could feel it as soon as he came into the room with the sandwiches something had transpired in here there was a palpable sense that hed interrupted hey cowboys he said christina was leaning against the window sill combing her hair with her fingers mark was sitting on the desk swinging his feet like a schoolboy wes decided hed unpack the bags and keep on talking give whatever it was a chance to dissipate so i was thinking we just wouldnt call flaherty thatll avoid the whole can of worms dooher jumped right on it weve got to call him he said we get one good catholic on the jury and i think we can guarantee that and the archbishop tells that person i couldnt have done anything they said i did which we know is the truth and at the very least the jurys hung and besides we want diane price to testify against me christina moved from the window no mark we but emboldened dooher stood grabbed his soft drink and popped the top on it i know originally we said no but did you hear thomasino in there even the judge thinks its bullshit it will make jenkins look like shes grasping at straws its a question of credibility so then you christina crossexamine her i do why not wes but wes knew the answer to that because youre a woman itll be much more effective if you start talking about the drugs mrs price has taken and how many men she slept with in college and whether or not she ever reported this alleged rape and why it kind of slipped her mind for the intervening decades in short you eat her for lunch shaking her head christina was staring at the floor what wes asked i dont want to do that i dont want to eat anybody for lunch i feel sorry for her dont you guys understand that i do mark said excuse me but fuck that im glad you two are so sensitive it gives me a warm feeling deep down inside farrell spun himself a little circle in the tiny room heres lesson one a trial is a war you dont take prisoners you destroy everything in your path because if you dont make no mistake it will destroy you sympathy does not belong here farrell reined himself in slightly listen christina this diane price is trying to send your client to jail for most of the rest of his life and that makes her my enemy and shes lying that makes her your enemy im not used to thinking that way dooher to the rescue wes you could do it it doesnt have to be christina farrell got to escape velocity in record time of course i could do it mister goddamn rogers could do it we could phone it in and get it done but christina here being a woman could do it best and thats what weve got to go with our best shot every time out thats how you win its the only way you win farrell glared at them both all right wes all right youre cute when youre mad anybody ever tell you that no he said nobody ever has christina how about you farrell was gratified to see that shed gone a little pale maybe she was finally beginning to understand what shed gotten herself into but she put up a brave front no she said i think youre cuter when youre not mad when thomasino called the lunch recess glitsky made his way out through the tide of humanity in the gallery and then no commented his way past the reporters in the hallway he took the stairs rather than the crowded elevator up to homicide to his square feet partially enclosed by dry wall he intended to eat his bagel and apple in peace and maybe get in some administrative work before court reconvened at but there was paul thieu up out of his own desk before glitsky was a step into the room and another person long hair eyes burning pumpedup unhappy and unkempt at a glance glitsky recognized the symptoms this guy was cranked up high on methamphetamines you remember chas brown thieu asked glitsky was about to nod shake his hand be polite but brown didnt give him the chance whats this i dont get to be a witness all the time i spend with you guys and what do i get out of it for me huh thieu popped in chas heard about thomasinos ruling from his friends in the courtroom hed been kind of hoping hed get a couple more days at the marriot the city put its witnesses in various hotels and chas had evidently been looking forward to a bit of a longer vacation abe was low affect it wasnt our decision chas we wanted you there but the judge ruled against us we lose why the guy kills one guy then another guy then his wife youre telling me theyre not related no i think theyre related then why man no proof no proof there was even a murder me saying it thats not proof glitsky kept it cool you didnt see it chas you werent a witness all the saigon records if any were destroyed he shrugged repeated it we lose weve been over this thieu said what do you want us to do chas you want another night at the marriot he threw a hopeful glance at glitsky no i want i mean i told everybody i was going to be in this trial and now glitsky thought even that tiny drop of limelight had evaporated he imagined it was probably disappointing but mostly he just wanted chas to go away he wasnt needed anymore and crankedup s in the hall of justice were something he could do without and doohers going to get off isnt he we hope not chas thats why were having a trial but they cant hear about the guy he killed over there no im afraid not that son of a bitch he repeated he never pays for anything does he in that moment something shifted for glitsky hed met brown before and always hed been less than completely sober but never particularly hostile to dooher now granted he was cranked up and that could do it but suddenly there seemed to be a different edge i thought you didnt really have any personal gripe with dooher glitsky said defiant i dont who said i did youre acting like it chas nobody said it im not acting like anything i havent seen the dude in like ten years this straightened thieu up he had interviewed brown at least five times and had never heard this i thought it had been more like twentyfive chas browns eyes shined flashed from glitsky to thieu he backed up a step put his hands into his jeans pockets ten twentyfive whats the difference fifteen years glitsky said brown shrugged so so which one is it chas thieu picked it up did you see dooher ten years ago maybe maybe eleven i dont know glitsky what about i dont know this same thing the two inspectors looked at each other glitsky nodded and thieu talked you talked to mark dooher about this saigon murder ten years ago what about it brown scratched at his beard rolled his eyes around let out a long breath i was having you know like i couldnt find much work i was looking through the paper and saw dooher at this charity thing and it said he did a lot of that so i figured hey hes doin pretty good maybe he could help out an old buddy you tried to blackmail him glitsky said first i just asked him if he could spare a little you know it wasnt like strongarm and whatd he do did he pay you chas was shaking his head he threw me out the son of a bitch said nobodyd believe a lowlife like me anyway he just laughed at me didnt give a shit my life was in the toilet why didnt you ever mention this before chas thieu asked i thought it would make me look bad i dont know and you wanted to testify to get back at him it made perfect sense to glitsky it was all about macho posturing power and payback yeah show the bastard he looked at the faces of the two inspectors hey it dont mean he didnt kill the guy chapter thirty one idont know about you but i could use a hug dooher kept reliving the moment savoring the sweetness of it the smell of her the press of her breasts up against him her arms around him inside the coat of his suit theyd stood there holding fast to one another for a long time perhaps thirty seconds forty hed started to become aroused and she felt it making a small noise deep in her throat leaning into him then pulling back looking up inviting the kiss that came tentative and gentle at first then openmouthed consuming then wes was outside saying something to someone in the hall she crossed over to the window and he sat on the desk that night the defense team was allbut living together theyd all had dinner at a french restaurant on clement street as was their routine farrell drove dooher home both of them were beat after the long day in the courtroom there would be plenty of time to secondguess jury selection christina hadnt called him and he hadnt called her then all day today the sexual tension and farrell seemed to take extra care that mark and christina were never alone at home after another late dinner and another day of jury selection dooher changed into a pair of khakis and a black cotton sweater then barefoot he wandered downstairs into his library and stood at the window christina was coming up the walk through the gate into the patio except for the kitchen lights the house was dark snooping media types might believe that the house was empty he opened the door can you see fine they got to the kitchen she wore the hood up on a heavy ski parka flipping the parka back she blew a strand of hair away from her mouth okay im nervous he stepped forward and gathered her in when he released her there was no kiss he gave her a wistful halfsmile then retreated to the counters can i get you a cup of coffee some wine you want to take off your coat she said wine would be good and shrugged out of the parka draping it over one of the stools mark busied himself in the refrigerator getting out the bottle opening it taking down the glasses coming over to her he slid a glass before her and pulled up another stool he held up his glass and she touched it a ringing chime just so you understand christina he began i didnt plan on this on yesterday i didnt either its not the kind of thing you plan mark sipped his wine and now i dont know what to do with it i dont know how you feel i dont know anything do you know how you feel not really confused i suppose guilty as hell though in this context thats a poor choice of words i mean she reached over and covered his hand i know what you mean you think its still too soon i dont know what too soon is but i know what this is what yesterday was me too he smiled at her im not talking about the feeling she squeezed his hand i am he moved his hand away no its more than that and i dont think i can trust it i dont trust it what you and i being thrown together like this the stress of this situation you helping to defend me me dependent on you its a false environment driving us together through no fault of our own he put his glass down and broke a lopsided grin youre making fun of me she leaned toward him a bit okay but im being serious i think we deserve a better chance than that especially that you do he sighed i never thought i would love anybody again and now here it is and the timings all wrong everythings all wrong not everything she said almost she was shaking her head you feel like you love me and i love you thats not almost everything wrong thats almost everything right he twirled his wine glass tiny circles on the counter and if they find me guilty of murder i dont get out of prison until youre older than i am now they wont find you guilty you didnt do it i would have said theyd never have gotten me to trial because i didnt do it but guess what she sipped her wine so what are you saying he looked down sighed again raised his eyes im trying to tell you i love you he said and ive got two temptations the first is to take you upstairs and not think about what any of it means or where it might go i choose door one she said he reached over and touched her face and the second is to pretend it isnt here none of this to pretend that yesterday was a moment of weakness but i dont think it was i think it was real so real im terrified were going to threaten it and how would we do that threaten it he closed his eyes briefly and took a last deep breath by doing anything about it he went on right now were in a pressure cooker i think we ought to wait until were out of it until we can see where we are i know where ill be ill be right here if you are so will i so maybe we should acknowledge this what we have this connection and then put it on a shelf until the time is right and when will that be mark when this is over when they find me not guilty it shouldnt be long now a couple of weeks a month after the drama and the prying eyes then well see where we are but this i dont trust it it would be too easy for both of us to get caught up in the romance of it i dont think so its not a matter of thinking christina the reality is persuasive enough here i am the classic tragic figure innocent man unfairly accused and you are my savior he softened things covering her hand with his im not saying the feeling isnt there im saying maybe its not us the real people we are feeling them its the roles were in and theyre temporary and i cant have us be temporary i couldnt live with that her eyes held steadily on him and suddenly a spark of humor flared the last noble man in america and i had to go and find him she came forward and pressed her lips to his cheek holding them there you dont trust the rush do you the rush isnt going away christina if the real stuff is here the rush will find its way back she kissed him again okay searching his face in the meantime ill be a professional i wont feed the gossip mills i wont give them any ammunition but when this is over this is fair warning im going to be here for you the chronicle photographer with the nightvision camera caught them kissing at the front door nothing passionate although they did stand together embracing for nearly two minutes saying good night it was plenty chapter thirty two the gallery wasnt a presence for glitsky anymore mark doohers fate was going to be determined inside the bar rail glitsky glanced across the courtroom at the defense table and felt his blood quicken with hate it was a reaction he rarely felt he had dealt with many despicable people many of whom had committed heinous crimes but his own feelings for them had almost never gotten personal dooher was different not only had he attacked glitsky on a variety of grounds threatening his career and reputation the reverberations were still echoing but killing his wife that struck at the heart of things the defendant sat his expression serene while on either side of him his acolytes tried not to appear nervous and angry though to glitskys practiced eye they were failing this he knew was probably in reaction to the chronicles story and accompanying picture dooher and christina kissing on his darkened front porch christinas mouth was set her eyes cast downward she was pretending to read from a folder in front of her but she looked up too often to be reading wes farrell seemed somewhat cooler he was a pro and knew you didnt show your feelings to the jurors but glitsky had overheard him answering one of doohers questions at the defense table the two men didnt seem to be best friends anymore in spite of thomasinos detailed approach to questioning prospective jurors once he had winnowed out the people whod known about the case and the other obvious exclusions victims of other crimes family members of lawenforcement people jury selection had gone rapidly now it was thursday of the first week the lunch recess was behind them and the show was getting under way amanda had told glitsky that she didnt subscribe to the belief that there was a fine art to picking members of the jury in spite of all the fancy theories people had it was more or less a crap shoot evidently wes farrell felt the same way amanda basically preferred married women to single men for this type of case and asians if she could get them but those seemed to be her only criteria farrell liked men who had jobs but both attorneys seemed inclined mostly to keep things moving and now the new and improved amanda jenkins was facing the panel of twelve glitsky tried to take some clues from the jurors faces but he didnt know what he might be looking for none of them particularly avoided his gaze although none held it either they were focused on amanda not him there were seven women and five men five of the jurors two of the men and three of the women were what glitsky would call well dressed another five had thrown on something at least marginally respectful of the remaining two a younger white man with a halfgrown beard and long hair wore a faded army fatigue shirt untucked and unbuttoned over a tshirt amanda had let him stay because she guessed hed be prejudiced against lawyers such as dooher it was a surprise when farrell left him unchallenged another middleaged very heavyset hispanic man wore jeans and a blue denim shirt that he evidently had gone to work in many times farrell had apparently wanted him because he was catholic and amanda told abe she hadnt objected because she thought he was pretending to be dumber than he was there were four asians three women and a man two hispanics one and one three africanamericans two and one and three whites one and two glitsky had no idea what the demographics meant and amanda in her nononsense style had set him straight over lunch nobody has a clue now she was about to address them and glitsky thought that her softer image notwithstanding her body language put her at a slight disadvantage she was holding a yellow legal pad for a prop standing slightly hipshot before the jury box amanda made no bones about the fact that she did not like juries about having to explain every fact or nuance so a moron could understand it about the cutthroat legal world in which she found herself glitsky thought she wore all these feelings on her tailored sleeves her forced smile betraying all of it at least it did to abe he hoped he was wrong nevertheless no one was in this room to make friends he supposed a serious demeanor wasnt the worst handicap a lawyer could have although all the successful trial attorneys he knew allowed a great deal more personality to peek through when they got in front of a jury ladies and gentlemen of the jury good afternoon she checked her notes maybe the pad wasnt a prop after all took a deep breath and began as judge thomasino told you the prosecutions opening statement is to acquaint you with the evidence in the case the evidence that the people of the state of california will use to demonstrate the facts that we will then assemble to prove and prove beyond a reasonable doubt the truth that on june th of this year mark dooher she turned and pointed for effect the defendant here willfully and with malice aforethought murdered his wife sheila im going to be presenting evidence about what happened on that day a tuesday the weather was exceptionally pleasant sunny with temperatures in the low seventies and at about fourthirty the defendant throughout the trial jenkins would try to depersonalize dooher by avoiding his name whenever possible called his wife sheila dooher and suggested that he take off work early and they have a romantic evening together sounds nice doesnt it glitsky wasnt surprised to hear farrells first objection nearly guttural with some suppressed emotion but clear enough his focus missing this morning was coming back glitsky knew that though the alleged idyll between dooher and his wife might have sounded nice it wasnt up to jenkins to portray it as such thomasinos eyebrows lifted up and down sustained it didnt slow jenkins she took her eyes off the jury to consult her pad then went right back to it in his own statement to the police the defendant admitted what happened next he left his office downtown and on his way home made a stop at dellaromas liquor and delicatessen on ocean avenue for a bottle of dom perignon champagne and an assortment of meats and vegetables he went home and he and his wife shared the champagne and the hors doeuvres then because she was tired mrs dooher went upstairs for a nap the defendant went to the driving range listening to it glitsky was confronted again it happened to varying degrees every time he came to court in other cases with the chasm of difference between his essentially freewheeling job of gathering evidence and the courts job of objectively analyzing it but jenkins evidently realized how benign it all sounded because she stopped a minute walked to the prosecution table to break her own rhythm and took a sip of water she turned back to the jury thats what the defendant told the police what the defendant did not tell police was that even then he was planning to kill his wife the plan was a simple one the defendant had long ago obtained for his own use a prescription of chloralhydrate a strong sedative he said he needed because he had trouble sleeping chloralhydrate is often commonly referred to as knockout drugs and thats how the defendant intended to use it he would puncture some of the gel tabs and slip some of the drug into his wifes champagne he would help put her to bed he would go to a nearby driving range to establish an alibi then he would return stab his wife to death in her sleep and make it look like a burglary he almost got away with it what the defendant did not know was that his wife was already taking two other powerful drugs benadryl for her allergies and nardil for depression when the defendant gave his wife the chloralhydrate the dose combined with the alcohol and these other drugs in her system was enough to kill her there was an audible stir in the courtroom this was evidently a surprise to people whod only read the articles as far as the grisly stabbing thomasino gently tapped his gavel and quiet returned jenkins continued if mrs dooher had been allowed to remain unmolested as she lay dead in her bed mark dooher would probably not be in this courtroom today charged with her murder but mr dooher is a lawyer he is a clever man and farrell was up out of his seat your honor thomasino sustained him again and this time jenkins turned to the judge and apologized to him then to the jury she didnt mean to characterize the defendant jenkins was playing well for the jury friendly courteous professional intending to stab his wife to death the defendant instead poisoned her to death legally it makes no difference either killing is murder in the first degree factually it makes all the difference in the world the defendants miscalculation got him caught thats because much of the evidence deliberately planted by the defendant to suggest a burglary much of the evidence designed to explain sheila doohers violent death at the hands of a knifewielding attacker takes on a very different light once we know sheila dooher was poisoned to death it shows the calculated and methodical attempt of a coldblooded murderer to conceal guilt were going to show you a knife a classic murder weapon complete with mark doohers fingerprints youre going to hear from witnesses who help to piece together the real story of what happened on that evening of june th and that is this that the defendant having made sure his wife would be sleeping soundly drugged with chloralhydrate left his house by the side door without activating the alarm system and reached above the door unscrewing the porch light so the driveway would be dark upon his return then he drove to the san francisco golf club not to the olympic club which is closer to his house and where he is a member and bought two large buckets of golf balls after hitting a few balls he walked through a break in the fence went to his car and drove home we know he drove home because one of the neighbors emil balian recognized his car with its personalized plates parked on the street down from his house at between eight and nine pm yes glitsky knew balian had said that but he thought that if ever a witness were born to be broken it was the neighborhood busybody whod already changed details in his identification story three times glitsky thought that farrell would destroy him on crossexamination but as drysdale had said balian was very nearly the key to the case sometimes you had to take what you could get by now it was dark out and the defendant entered his darkened house upstairs in his bedroom he plunged a knife into his wifes heart as he thought she lay sleeping he tore her bedclothes and threw blankets around simulating a struggle he poured a vial of blood that he had stolen from his doctors lab around the body he tore the wedding and engagement rings from sheila doohers hand and then rifled the bureau in the room taking other jewelry including his own rolex watch then he went back to the driving range climbed back through the fence its all a goddamn lie glitsky was startled nearly out of his seat dooher was suddenly on his feet pointing at jenkins who stood openmouthed stunned at the outburst and it wasnt over and youre a goddamn liar thomasino whod been listening intently to jenkins reacted as if hed been jolted by electricity he reached for his gavel missed it and it fell behind the desk so he had to stand himself mr dooher you sit down mr farrell you control your client you hear me sit down i said glitsky was up and the two bailiffs were moving across to farrells table but wes held up his hands motioning them back come on mark easy christina too was up an arm around doohers back whispering to him but dooher glared at one and all i cannot believe i am hearing so much bullshit everybody in the courtroom heard him dooher turned to the jury and suddenly his voice was in the normal conversational range none of this happened this way he said not any of it thomasino had found his gavel and slammed it down again mr farrell ill gag your client if you dont yes your honor a hand on doohers arm pulling him down whispering through clenched teeth mark sit down get a grip would you then farrell to thomasino again your honor if i could ask for a short recess but thomasino was shaking his head not during an opening statement mr farrell you control your client and let ms jenkins finish up and if there are any more interruptions ill hold you in contempt hows that clear what the hell was that what are you trying to do kill yourself out there farrell in their tiny room across the street was himself now nearly out of control there was spittle on his lips and he seemed almost struck with palsy now pacing now hovering in front of his client dooher again had hoisted himself up on to the desk he was swinging his feet relaxed christina stood at the window arms crossed over her chest thomasino was going to allow jenkins all the time she needed to wrap up her opening statement but it turned out that she only made it another ten minutes before she asked for a recess doohers interruption had poleaxed her and what had begun as a reasonably compelling recital of events had degenerated into a disjointed shopping list of purported evidence whose relevance and connection seemed to elude jenkins herself she kept referring to her notes stumbling over her words until she finally gave it up wes relax dooher said its all right youre going to have a heart attack youre goddamn right im going to have a heart attack i deserve a heart attack what were you doing in there what was that all about how could you lose your temper like that dooher actually broke a grin i didnt this is funny theres a joke here maybe im missing i didnt lose my temper wes well damn mark that was one hell of an imitation christina came forward daring to speak for the first time since wes had dressed down both mark and herself for their incredible stupidity and duplicity and every other negativity he could think of over the kiss she talked to dooher what do you mean you didnt lose your temper he turned to her palms up the grin faded it was an act i thought it would humanize me for the jury farrell seemed to sag and let out a chuckle without a trace of humor in it his eyes went to christina back to the client this is what in the trade we call a bad idea what it did for the jury mark was made you look like a guy with no respect for the law some kind of hothead wait wait wait dont you see i dont see christina do you see she didnt answer dooher included them both all right ill spell it out jenkins is up there painting this picture im cold i plan things to the nth degree and here i am sitting at the defense table trying to keep some kind of impassive face while jenkins just goes on and on lie after outrageous lie so i react who wouldnt react its natural whats unnatural is just sitting there cold and unfeeling playingright into their hands i wanted to show them who i was well you did that youre damn straight wes i looked them right in the eye and told them none of it was true you dont think thats going to have an effect oh im sure it is i just dont think its going to be the one you wanted here you are supposedly a good practicing lawyer and youre not showing respect for the system because they got it wrong dont you see that ive been falsely accused of something i didnt do and its gotten all the way to this fiasco of a trial how can i have respect for that how can i even pretend to but to yell at the jury no i didnt yell at the jury i very carefully avoided doing that i looked at them as people and thats how they are going to see me farrell glanced at christina as though he would ask for her help but simply shook his head there was a knock on the door and dooher slid off the desk and opened it the cop from the hall said that judge thomasino wanted to see mr farrell in his chambers right now farrell stood why dont you two try to keep your hands off each other while im gone he said and quit the room which left the two of them alone dooher turned hes mad at us theres a good call i suppose i should have told him before i disrupted the sacred order of the court but the moment just came and i took it if idve warned wes hed have counselled me not to do it anyway what did you think i dont know mark i havent done any other trials i dont know how they play out it shocked me when it happened but now hearing you explain it it might work it wont hurt me im sure of that thats not what wes is mad about anyway she let herself down on to one of the wooden chairs i know she said its us but we told him we werent going behind his back it wasnt about the trial he didnt believe us youre the master of insight today arent you first wes is mad at us and then wes doesnt believe us maybe we should mend a few fences i dont think thats a bad idea mark went over to the window and separated the blinds looking out over bryant street and downtown beyond im just not willing to concede he said that theres a telescopicsight camera set up on nob hill trained on this window he crossed back over to her and took her in his arms judge thomasinos chambers were neither large nor imposing furnished as they were in functional danish three tall teak bookshelves closed in the walls and various diplomas honors and commendations in wooden frames seemed to have been stuck randomly on the green drywall a robust ficus sprawled in the corner by a large window one of remingtons brass cowboys graced a broad teak coffee table but that was the extent of the decorative touches the rug was faded brown berber over the halls linoleum jenkins and glitsky were seated in low leather chairs in front of the judges desk and they both turned at the bailiffs knock it was farrell and glitsky stood ceding pride of place to the attorneys he was here because amanda had asked him to be farrell didnt sit but walked to the front of thomasinos desk im glad youre here amanda he began i wanted to apologize for my client and to you judge im sorry thomasino barely acknowledged the words with an ambiguous gesture then got right to it i asked you down here mr farrell to see if you can give me any reason why i shouldnt yank your clients bail you should know that i already told ms jenkins that if she asked id do it im thinking of doing it in any event if you want a mistrial your client can do sixty days next door meaning in jail while he waits for his new court date to contemplate whether he wants to interrupt the proceedings again glitsky wouldnt have thought farrell could sag any further than he had when he walked in but he did visibly jenkins took it up ill be honest with you wes she said you and i know this is the first murder ive gotten to trial my colleagues in the das office are starting to wonder why im on the payroll if im never actually in trial i dont want to wait another sixty days minimum thomasino intoned minimum she repeated and i think the argument can be made that the outburst was potentially as prejudicial to your client as it might have been selfserving a rueful nod we were just discussing that farrell said so its a wash jenkins concluded glitsky admired the way jenkins delivered it it sounded genuine enough although he knew the truth was quite different as the recess had been called jenkins had sent glitsky upstairs to get art drysdale and tell him she was asking to get doohers bail revoked drysdale had made a quick phone call cryptic enough but it must have been to chris locke and then accompanied abe back to department where jenkins sat still fuming at the prosecution table from glitskys perspective there was no question that locke had some personal political connection to this case the da didnt want to see it postponed to let it remain unresolved much as he had asked for the unreasonably low bail he was doing the archbishop a favor as drysdale had been explaining that the da did not want to ask for bail to be revoked thomasino had sent word that he wanted to see jenkins in his chambers and discuss that very thing and drysdale had supplied her with the reason she was to give for not wanting it farrell for his part was a drowning man whod just gone down for the third time opened his eyes underwater and saw the lifebuoy he reached for it your honor i will not let this kind of thing happen again the glare thomasino growled once settled into his chair all right now theres one other thing the two opposing attorneys looked at each other wondering i dont know how much control you have over your clients behavior mr farrell id gather not very much but perhaps you could exert some influence over your second chair i dont want to sequester this jury but if we get too many more stories about mr dooher and ms carrera im not going to have any choice a mans accused of killing his wife its the better part of valor to keep his dick in his pants excuse me amanda at least until a jurys had a chance to make up its mind now ive told the jury not to watch television or read newspapers but we all know what will happen if the defendant keeps getting on the front page thats not in anyones interest are we in agreement here yes your honor good thomasino paused for a couple of seconds he looked at his watch im going to adjourn for today giving you mr farrell a lot of time to make these points to your client and your associate id use as much of it as you need farrell could only nod whatever the judge wanted thats what he wanted too chapter thirty three so glitsky was off early it wasnt yet three oclock on a thursday afternoon and no one expected him upstairs so he signed out a car from the city lot and drove himself home found a parking spot directly in front of his duplex and let himself in rita was sleeping on the couch which was okay she got up with them all at and she kept the place spotless she also got up with abe when any of the boys called out in the night and if she needed to take a nap to catch up glitsky was all for it in the kitchen a pot of thick black sauce mole he now knew simmered on the stove steaming the windows filling the room with its heady smell a couple of disjointed chickens were thawing on the counter he opened the kitchen window a crack and heard isaac down in the trees he was lucky with his backyard though he shared it with his downstairs neighbors there was plenty of room and along its border a bicycle path traced the edge of the presidio back when there had been money for such amenities the city had built a small playground a set of swings parallel bars a slide thirty yards down the path glitsky let himself out the back door and down the steps across the yard through the lengthening shadows on to the bike path hed pushed pretty hard at the idea of the boys playing together sticking together the family and this was one of those miraculous days when it was working they were seeing who could sail farthest out of the swing set one of the activities glitsky felt better hearing about than actually witnessing and today theyd added a new wrinkle a stick that two of them held while the third one sailed going for height and distance and broken legs he thought chipped teeth ruined knees but he watched from a small distance life is risk he told himself theyre enjoying the moment let it happen and then jacob landed sprawled in the tanbark and rolling over saw his father he let out a whoop dad and came running over stopping himself a split second before what would have been an embarrassing hug but he did let his father put his arm around him what are you doing home yeah its still light out isaac sauntering up put in the barb glitsky knew he was working all the time but didnt see a way to change it and he was home now wasnt he i thought wed go get a christmas tree oj stabbed a fist into the air and screamed yeah and was already running back toward the house while the other two tore off after him even abe broke into a trot at night rita put down the foldabed and slept behind a screen in the living room in the front of the duplex that fact wasnt in the front of glitskys mind when he bought the largest tree he could find and now the neverspacious living room was all but impassable his own overstuffed easy chair and ottoman had been relegated to the kitchen to make space for the tree which made the kitchen tight as well rita had lost more than half of her precious counter space the scent of the new christmas tree permeated the house and rita had made hot spiced apple juice they had lou rawls doing christmas out of the speakers the lights were strung up the old bulbs and now the boys were hanging tinsel glitsky sat hunched on his ottoman in the open doorway between the kitchen and living room drinking his mulled cider taking it all in as though from a great distance rita was on the couch directing the boys to any open spaces on the tree he had come home early hed taken the boys out for the tree and now he was home in the midst of his family wishing he was anywhere else wishing he could try harder not to show it flo wasnt here everything else was here and not his wife so what exactly was the point when the telephone rang glitsky knew it was work it was always work and isaac yelled that he shouldnt answer it let the machine get it but he was already up at the wallphone in the kitchen it was amanda jenkins im working on motive she said and tomorrow its fish or cut bait no got a minute abe no hello even but there was no fighting it like it or not he was in trial time and simple politeness suffered as a matter of course he took a sip of his juice the tang of cinnamon she was breezing right on i want your take on his second chair carrera i know weve been trying to decide between insurance and whether his wife was a drunk an embarrassment but im just watching the tube and this picture of the two of them kissing its turned up the heat i saw the picture amanda we talked about it remember it wasnt exactly xrated i wouldnt even give it an r its a goodnight kiss at his house theyre alone in the dark she countered so what so in spite of all the tabloid speculation its really the first actual proof that these two have something going and if they do its a lot stronger than anything else weve got that picture doesnt prove anything theyre not upstairs in his bedroom halfdressed anything like that this is a kiss like you give your mother besides even if you had major groping how are you going to prove they had something seven eight months ago which is when it would have had to be i dont have to prove it she said we can assert it show this picture let the jury draw the inference glitsky moved some dirty dishes to one side and seated himself on the crowded counter he of course had wrested with this issue himself so he decided to give jenkins the argument that had stopped him that assumes she was in on it too she might have helped him plan it abe now shes defending him for it its not that farfetched then youll have to explain why we didnt charge her too because there was no proof of conspiracy we just couldnt arrest her without glitsky sipped the juice giving her time to hear herself to wind down this was the lastminute panic to bolster a case that hed seen dozens of times it sucks doesnt it she asked insurance he said juries tend to understand money you think its your decision jenkins sighed something tells me its her abe you dont need motive amanda you might just want to let it go prove the facts a long pause then okay and then a click and a dialtone no hello no goodbye trial time across town in his apartment wes farrell sat at his formica kitchen table which was littered with yellow legal pads manila folders three days worth of newspapers a manual typewriter four coffee mugs and a thick threering binder that hed divided into sections labelled evidence argument witnesses and so on each of these sections was further divided into subsections and each subsection contained colorcoded tabs in a particular order farrell had been living with this binder for the past six months and by now felt he could wake up and put his finger on anything he wanted in pitch darkness bart was under the table and the clock radio which had been keeping him company with old rock n roll suddenly broke into jingle bells immediately he reached over and turned the dial and thought hed found another soft rock station when he realized it was mary chapin carpenter telling her lover that everything they got they got the hard way somehow he couldnt find the will to turn it off hed been consciously avoiding country music since he and sam split but this song intelligently invoking passion and spark and inspiration was ripping him up sitting back he ran his hands through his thinning hair then reached for one of the mugs of tepid coffee he forced down a swallow his eyes roamed the empty apartment the same blank walls thriftstore furniture the same space hed called sam twice after the first big fight and theyd had a couple of bigger ones after and now thomasino had ruled that diane price was going to be allowed to testify after all and christina was going to take her part and sam would probably be in the courtroom counselling her shaking his head to clear it this was going nowhere he flipped off the radio he and sam were finished pulling his typewriter through the debris he thought hed put this negative energy to some good use by working on some notes for his opening statement but as he reached for his legal pad he had to move the morning chronicle and the picture hit him again jesus he thought could it be aside from the strategic disaster the photo represented he was having trouble overcoming his own sense of personal betrayal though mark and christina had both denied that anything untoward had taken place between them the fact that theyd met at marks house at night alone without telling him about it was more than unsettling it had thrown him back on his own demons this was the real reason for the tantrum hed thrown at them this morning before they went to court this wasnt just another trial for him where hed have to pump himself up with some secondhand thirdrate rationalization that his actions were relatively important it was far more personal a last opportunity dropped into his lap by a benevolent fate finally to do something meaningful with his life with the responsibility and the commitment to marks defense something had already changed inside himself motivating him to summon the discipline he needed to lose the extra weight hed carried for years giving him confidence to try a new facesoftening mustache a crisp and stylish haircut hed present the new improved wes farrell to the world and to that end had bought five new suits one for each day of the working week ten shirts ten ties two pairs of shoes perhaps these changes werent fundamental but they indicated that his image of himself of who he could be was changing he even started vacuuming his apartment cleaning up his dinner dishes on the same day that he ate off them unprecedented this trial was going to be his last chance it was life itself a test of all he was and could be he had to believe and then this morning hed opened the newspaper and in a twinkling the foundation seemed to give psychically it shook him as the earthquake had and following that hed sat at this table trying and failing to ignore the other signposts on the trail that had led them all to here the party at doohers marks decision to bring christina on as a summer clerk joe averys transfer to los angeles which had preordained joe and christinas breakup sheilas death and now finally the two of them mark and christina nearly united viewed from farrells perspective the progression was linear and ominous he tried to tell himself that it didnt necessarily mean what it could mean wes knew mark who he was what he was and mark could never have done what he was accused of it was impossible wes wasnt religious but doohers innocence was an article of faith for him if he didnt know mark he knew nothing this was why as the preparation for trial had uncovered enough unpleasant assertions about mark to make even farrell feel uncomfortable he had never truly doubted assertions were just that he had told himself time and again they werent proven people often with axes to grind would say things farrell had tried to look objectively at all this alleged wrongdoing and came away convincing himself that it was all smoke and mirrors there was absolutely no evidence tying mark dooher to any other murders or rapes or anything else but now there was christina she was a fact as was her connection to mark and worse because of her the seed of wess own doubt had germinated he closed his eyes picturing her in his mind a beautiful woman no question about it he himself was not immune to the power of beauty what man was but that did not mean his friend had killed to have her farrell kept trying to tell himself that marks lifelong luck had delivered christina to him at the moment he needed her most after his wife was gone for whatever comfort and hope she could give him but suddenly after last night this was a hard sell christina this is sam please dont hang up i wont i argued with myself all day about calling you i kissed him good night sam thats all there was to it this whole media frenzy is insane but you know youre with him i represent him im his lawyer thats not what i mean i know i knew back when we were still friends im sorry i have no comment okay thats all right i dont need a comment but i just had to try to tell you because we were friends because you do know so much about the psychology of rape that you and wes are both wrong about mark dooher i can prove sam stop youll get a chance to prove everything you want to at the trial that wont prove what im talking about im telling you sit and talk to her youll be convinced shes telling the truth shes im going to hang up now sam mark didnt do that he couldnt have done that why are you so blind why wont you even consider it goodbye sam chapter thirty four farrell was running on pure adrenaline hed slept less than five hours but this was precisely the moment that all the nights of insomnia had been in service of he reminded himself that the trial was simpler than life all he had to do here was refute the prosecutions arguments and mark dooher was going to walk he could do that in his sleep in california the defense has the option of delivering its opening statement directly following the prosecutions where it has the general effect of a rebuttal or it can choose to wait and use its opening statement to introduce its own version of events its case in chief farrell chose the former he didnt believe he was going to get surprised by any prosecution witness he knew the direction he was going to take deny deny deny and he wanted to prime the jury at the outset that there was reason to question every single point jenkins had raised hed thought it out in detail he would begin casually standing beside dooher at the defense table he would not consult any notes his defense was from his heart he wouldnt use a prepared speech his body language would scream that the truth was so obvious and he believed it so passionately that it spoke for itself by contrast jenkins had stood delivering the rest of her opening statement for the better part of the morning consulting her legal pad over and over laboriously spelling out her case in chief farrell sipped from his water glass and stood up youve all heard ms jenkinss opening statement shes given you a version of the events of june th that she says shes going to prove beyond a reasonable doubt there is no way she can do that because those actions of mr dooher that she got right did not happen for the reasons she contends and the rest of them she simply got wrong im going to strip this story of ms jenkinss sinister interpretation and give you the facts on that tuesday mark dooher purchased champagne and brought it home because he was a loving husband he made a phone call from his office to his home on the afternoon of june th and asked his wife if she would like him to come home early he made a date with her ladies and gentlemen of the jury after nearly thirty years of marriage mark and sheila dooher were having a romantic interlude a date before he got home his wife took a dose of benadryl because she suffered from allergies she helped herself toa glass or two of champagne sheila dooher was fortyseven years old and she was neither senile nor dimwitted she could make her own decisions and did on matters of what she ate and drank she had been taking the menopause drug nardil for over a year many times in front of many witnesses she drank alcohol within this timeframe several witnesses will testify that sheila dooher was skeptical of her doctors recommendations to avoid certain foods and alcohol tragically it looks like mrs dooher was equally careless about mixing drugs farrell sipped again from his water glass slowing himself down jenkins hadnt objected once all eyes were glued to him he was rolling what happened next the doohers had a late lunch nothing more sinister than that sheila dooher went up to her bedroom to take a nap she was tired and she took a sedative her husbands chloralhydrate ms jenkins has told you that mark dooher gave her the chloralhydrate rubbish absolute rubbish there is not one witness not one shred of evidence that even suggests that this is the case ms jenkins says it is so because she needs it to be so to convict mark dooher she cannot prove it because it never happened jenkins now did get up objecting that farrell was being argumentative farrell supposed he was but knew jenkins had made the objection as much as anything to throw off his rhythm it wasnt going to work she was sustained by thomasino and farrell moved out from the desk now and went on a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth so the jury could see what a good guy he was magnanimous at this silly interruption it also gave him his third opportunity to repeat the sequence that had led to sheilas death after which and what were mr doohers actions after his wife had gone upstairs well he did not set the burglar alarm in his house a prosecution witness mr doohers nextdoor neighbor frances matsun will tell you he then reached up and appeared to be doing something with the light bulb over the side door mr dooher does not remember this perhaps there was a cobweb on it he doesnt know next he drove to the san francisco golf club now youll remember that ms jenkins made rather a big issue of the fact that mr dooher belongs to the olympic club and on this night chose not to go to his own clubs driving range but rather to a public range it is going to be for you to decide how big an issue this was but i will tell you that mr dooher is a personable man objection sustained im sorry mr dooher has many business contacts at his club and he didnt want to have to be he paused smiling now at the jury including them in the humor personally interactive he wanted to spend the time working on his golf swing without interruption the golf pro at the drivingrange shop will testify that mr dooher bought two buckets of balls and sometime later returned with two empty buckets he will also testify that mr dooher and he discussed golf clubs and corrections to his swing and exchanged other pleasantries in short that mr doohers actions appeared completely normal farrell shrugged in tacit apology to the jury for the time this was taking he was on their side and all must agree that this was clearly a waste of everyones time when he got home mr dooher did the dishes and drank a beer after which he went upstairs and discovered his wifes body horrified he punched up nine one one we will play the recording of this call for you and again you can decide if the voice you hear is believable or not but we are not finished yet after the police came to begin their investigation mr dooher cooperated fully with inspector glitsky and here farrell stopped and theatrically gestured across the courtroom who is the gentleman sitting there at the prosecution table he gave a full and voluntary statement and answered every question until inspector glitsky had no more to ask farrell deemed this a reasonable moment to pause going back to his table he took another drink of water glanced at dooher and christina and turned back to the jury box now as to some of the other allegations and alleged evidence the prosecution has put in front of you the tainted blood sample the knife with mr doohers fingerprints on it the surgical glove found at the scene and so on we are at a disadvantage we cant explain everything thats one of the problems with being innocent you dont know what happened you dont know what someone else did your honor jenkins said counsel is arguing again thomasino scowled which farrell took to be a good sign he had been arguing no doubt but thomasino had allowed himself to get caught up in it and resented being reminded of his lapse still he sustained jenkinss objection and told farrell to stick to the evidence farrell met some eyes in the panel im going to say a few words now about motive the prosecution has told you that mr dooher killed his wife to collect an insurance policy worth one point six million dollars this is their stated motive i urge you to remember it farrell went on to explain that the defense would disclose all financial records of mr dooher personally and those of his eminently solvent firm he was nearly debtfree his ik money fully vested amounted to over savings accounts held another he owned his home nearly outright and it had most recently been appraised for over a million dollars in short while one point six million dollars was not chump change so long as mr dooher continued with his regular lifestyle and did not plan to take up cruising the aegean in a fully crewed luxury yacht he didnt need any more money farrell spread his hands ladies and gentlemen the prosecution cannot prove that mark dooher had a motive to kill his wife because he had no motive the prosecution cannot prove he poisoned his wife because he did not they will not prove he is guilty because he is innocent its as simple as that at the end of this trial when you see that the prosecution has not proven these baseless accusations i will ask for the verdict of not guilty to which my client is entitled for lunch dooher mending fences took them all to fringale a tiny bistro a couple of blocks from the courtroom they were at a table in the back corner and wes desultorily picking at a dish of white beans with duck didnt seem to be responding positively to the gesture by contrast dooher was in a celebratory mood enjoying a double order of foie gras with a halfbottle of pinot noir all for himself hell he wasnt working he was spectating christina oblivious to the attention she was receiving from the other patrons and their waiter her water glass had been refilled four times had forgotten sams call and the kiss and was enthusing over farrells performance you know wes i believe you could make a living at this it was a great statement dooher agreed you put all that in your nine nine five this was a motion that farrell had earlier filed under california penal code section that there wasnt sufficient evidence to convict dooher i cant believe thomasino let this turkey go on farrell kept his head bowed over his food his shoulders slumped anyone seeing him would have trouble identifying him as the showman whod worked such wonders in the court less than an hour before its a long way from over mark youll notice i did gloss over a few of what from our perspective are nonhighlights christina put her fork down what do you mean i mean the hole in the fence at the driving range blood missing from marks doctors office marks fingerprints on the murder weapon dooher was concentrating on his little toast points spreading his foie gras with perfect evenness you hit all that he took a bite savoring it you said we couldnt know that was the problem with being innocent it could have been your finest moment but christina was staring at wes something else eating at her shed never heard him use this tone before and it worried her he must still be upset about the kiss she knew that wes had been angry yesterday but christina had assumed that his fury would blow itself out but now she wondered if it went deeper she reached over and touched his hand i want to tell you something she said quietly he raised his bloodhounds eyes youre still mad at us and you think weve lied to you but me going over to marks that was an honest mistake i would not lie to you mark wouldnt lie to you dooher had stopped chewing listening intently and now he eyed farrell levelly if youve got doubts on that wes i want to hear them gradually farrell shook his head im just tired he said im going to sleep all weekend what the hell is he doing here mark asked christina and wes were having coffee and dooher was enjoying a snifter of calvados when abe glitsky entered the restaurant and made his way over to their table nodding all around friendly as you please he leaned over farrells shoulder ms carrera id like to ask you a few questions before court reconvenes i wonder if youd stop by my office on the fourth floor after youve finished your lunch howd you know we were here dooher asked glitsky favored him with the scarsplit smile spies he said theyre everywhere farrell was torn between the impulse to tell glitsky to shit in his hat and curiosity over what he wanted to talk about with christina he insisted he be present and glitsky said no he then reminded the lieutenant that he was entitled to all discovery in the case this didnt rate an answer glitsky simply asked again if christina would talk to him or not she told farrell she wanted to go she could take care of herself it would be best to find out what glitsky had on his mind whats this about sergeant actually its lieutenant now ive been promoted oh thats right i remember congratulations guarded but curious she sat kittycorner from glitsky at a scarred oak table in one of the interview rooms adjoining the homicide detail he left the door open and let her have the power position at the far end of the table he took his minirecorder from his jacket pocket and sat it on the table in front of them this is lieutenant abe glitsky star number he began and im speaking with christina reached over and grabbed the recorder flicking it off wait a minute what are you doing life was a constant surprise glitsky was thinking never before had anyone hardened criminal or antisocial cretin ever taken his tape recorder and turned it off he was sure this should be instructive but didnt know what it meant i thought you invited me up here to have a discussion thats correct so whats this the tape is how we do interrogations youre interrogating me you got it right the first time ms carrera were having a discussion but its pursuant to my investigation of mark dooher well im not going to answer i represent the man lieutenant hes my client anything between me and mark is privileged and you ought to know that actually not you only became a lawyer a couple of weeks ago isnt that true he knew it was true he didnt have to wait for her reply and even if a case could be made that you had an attorneyclient relationship before that not saying it could that relationship certainly didnt exist before mr dooher got charged with his wifes murder and thats the time i want to talk about it rocked her she sat back in her chair and took a breath studying him what for can i have the tape recorder back im not going to talk to you are you accusing me of something no maam if we come close to that and youd like to have your own lawyer present we can do this some other time but one way or another were going to do it her eyes narrowed no were not not now not ever if i dont choose to nobody ever has to talk to the police lieutenant not me not my client not anybody and you know it glitsky backpedalled he didnt want to lose her i thought this would be the most pleasant way you know what the newspapers are saying im the investigator in this case when questions come up its my job to get an answer for them even if it happened to be in the middle of the trial youre trying to get me to become a witness against my client she was getting angry herself now this is the most unprofessional thing ive ever heard of lieutenant and i really resent it i met mark dooher on mardi gras of last year say ten months ago there was absolutely nothing between us until after his wife was dead does that answer your question yes it does he said she looked at him for a long moment lieutenant glitsky do you remember when i came up here to talk about tania willows and levon copes and you sat in that chair out there she pointed through the open doorway and laughed until tears came to your eyes do you remember that sure and there was a moment right after that after your lieutenant came out and asked if you were okay when you and i looked at each other and something went click i dont mean sexually where we just got something together you remember glitsky nodded so were we intimate then thats not the kind of intimacy were talking about well then mark and i were not intimate are not intimate i care about him a great deal and while were speaking so frankly i dont know why youre persecuting him so horribly the evidence says he killed his wife ms carrera i dont think it does thats what you want to see glitsky held himself in check his voice flat because of my abiding hatred of the church of rome and my singlehanded campaign to bring it to its knees he gestured to the empty walls of the room they were in the external office with all the glamour of a train wreck or perhaps its my ambition to rise to the top of this dung heap you pick one of the above he had gotten to her lowering his voice glitsky leaned in toward her im trying to figure out why she put her elbows on the table their heads were inches apart lieutenant theres no why he didnt do it thats why you cant find a reason for it how about you ive told you i dont think he did it glitsky was shaking his head no how about if youre the reason if he killed sheila so hed be free to have you her eyes went dull she seemed to stare through him finally you know im sorry lieutenant you must live in the bleakest world there is youre telling me youve got mark killing his wife risking a murder trial and life in prison all on the remote chance that hell be free to have me who has made no commitment to him you flatter me but please its not impossible it is impossible she said its insane the only way thats even remotely feasible is if i she stopped if we did it together glitsky had his arms crossed he didnt respond except to reach over and turn the tape back on after a few seconds christina stood up leaning over she turned it off if you want to pursue this further lieutenant next time ill bring an attorney he was watching her her face a shifting kaleidoscope of emotions and reactions i just want to say one last thing he nodded all right i am so sorry about your wife i never had a chance to tell you that then she was gone glitsky remained in his chair legs stretched out arms crossed he had a couple of minutes before the lunch recess was over and he had to be back in court reaching under the table for the second tape recorder that was hidden there he pulled it out stopped the tape and rewound to the last seconds i am so sorry about your wife i never had a chance to tell you that he played it back again a third time it had struck him as genuine when she said it now it sounded sincere on the tape paul thieu poked his head in through the door howd it go he asked she looked rattled she had to stop at the door and take a few deep breaths then whats the matter nothing she didnt have anything to do with it dooher did it alone how do you know thieu asked glitsky sat still another minute i just know he said chapter thirty five farrells plans might have included sleeping all weekend but the weekend was a long afternoon away jenkins called john strout the coroner as her first witness the lanky southern gentleman was at home on the witness stand and gave a dispassionate and complete account of the medical issues surrounding sheilas death most if not all of these could have been stipulated by both parties that is they could have had the judge read to the jury the undisputed facts about the details of sheilas death but prosecutors always wanted to have the coroner make a murder seem real to the jury and in this case farrell had a small but he thought important point to make himself dr strout farrells fatigue had dissipated he was standing in the center of the courtroom listing slightly toward the jury in your testimony you often referred to the drug overdose that was the cause of sheila doohers death did you list this on the coroners report peoples one i sure did could we look at that page of peoples one a minute your honor let the jury pass it around thomasino hated this kind of theatrics of course the jury could reviewpeoples one although there was all kinds of information in the coroners report that had little or nothing to do with anything the jury needed to know but farrell wanted to keep them involved as they were passing it back and forth he said paying particular attention to the cause of death which you will notice does list drug overdose along with a significant amount of medical jargon he moved over directly in front of strout now doctor we had a talk you and i a couple of days ago and you gave me several other coroners reports from different cases that youve handled over the past months isnt that correct yes jenkins was on her feet irrelevant your honor whats the possible relevancy of the causes of death in unrelated cases thomasino leaned toward agreement mr farrell ill give you about one minute to make your point farrell had the other coroners reports entered as defense exhibits a through d and then came back to the witness lets start with manner of death here in defense a dr strout what does it say here for the jurys benefit please under cause of death it says drug overdose farrell did his imitation of thomasino raising his eyebrows in fact doctor in each of defense a through d the cause of death is listed as drug overdose isnt that true it is satisfied farrell nodded and moved a step closer to the witness all right hed primed the pump and now farrell was ready to strike oil dr strout do a lot of people die of drug overdose every year yes hundreds thomasino leaned forward over the bench your minutes about up counsellor my next question brings in sheila dooher your honor the judge nodded impatiently all right go ahead and what about the overdoses that these hundreds of people die of every year except for the specific drugs involved are these drug overdoses particularly different from that suffered by sheila dooher farrell darted a quick glance at thomasino at least hed brought his questioning back to people involved in this case but strout was frowning i dont understand the question every case is different though there are similarities if the same drugs cause the death he waited for farrell to clarify what he wanted in the hundreds of drug overdose deaths every year is there a common feature that might point to a murder rather than say an accident or a suicide strout considered a minute generally id say no and in mrs doohers case specifically was there any medical indication that shed been murdered no so doctor correct me if im wrong but based on your autopsy it sounds to me as if you dont know whether sheila dooher was murdered or not do you well the introduction of so many different drugs within such a limited time just shut down the respiratory apparatus its likely she had a malignant hypertensive response potential cardiac arrhythmias and then subsequently severe hypotension excuse me doctor but in your opinion was this a crime or an article in the new england journal of medicine objection jenkins he knew was out of her seat he didnt have to turn around thomasino grunted sustained farrell shot a glance at the jury he knew it never hurt to put in a dig when things got pedantic farrell was just a regular guy a lay person like these longsuffering jurors there were traces of smiles on a few faces he turned back to strout ill repeat the question doctor you dont know whether sheila dooher was murdered or not do you its somewhat unusual to see so many different drugs excuse me again doctor but its a yes or no question you dont know whether sheila dooher was murdered or not do you strout had to admit it i dont know you dont know whether sheila dooher was murdered is that your testimony yes thank you it didnt take amanda jenkins long to realize that wes farrell wasnt the modest intellect lowrung attorney he pretended to be hed hurt her on his opening statement and then again with strout she thought it was time she put some of her own points on the board and she stood and told the court that the people would call sergeant george crandall crandall had been a marine and though today he wore a business suit still looked and acted like a marine he stood up in the gallery and walked a ramrod up to the witness stand where he preempted the clerk raising his hand and swearing to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help him god without any prompting obviously crandall had been here before controlling his own show he sat down and nodded at jenkins crandall sat up straight but completely at home in the witness box knowing it was going to be a while he unbuttoned his suit jacket though he did not lean back in the chair nor did he cross his legs jenkins spent a moment or two establishing that crandall was an expert homicide investigator with fifteen years of experience and was now in fact head of the police departments crime scene investigation unit he had arrived at the murder scene within an hour of the call were you the first policeman on the scene no sergeants glitsky and thieu of homicide were already there as well as the lieutenant and sergeant from taraval station and some patrolmen and had these people found anything relating to the murder by the time you arrived farrell knew amanda would be using the word murder a lot that day trying to condition the jury to accept what she couldnt prove he couldnt do anything about it and let it go would you tell us sergeant what you found at the scene of the murder one of the first things we found is what we did not find and what was that sergeant we found there was no sign of a forced entry at the side door or anywhere else for that matter no sign of forced entry no we believe that egress was through the side door by the driveway because we found a surgical glove and a knife near that door jenkins produced these and they were entered as peoples exhibits and the knife matches other knives found in the defendants kitchen is that right before crandall could even think about answering glitsky noticed some quick back and forth at the defense table for the first time christina stood up your honor weve stipulated that the knife belonged to the doohers glitsky moved uncomfortably in his seat jenkins hadnt gotten her sea legs yet and he felt for her her first murder case had gone high profile and sideways and she wasnt doing well she appeared to be groping for another direction a specific question but she couldnt seem to frame it except in a general way was there anything else about this side door fortunately crandall was on her side inclined to help he noddedthe sergeant from taraval reported that the light over the door had been out when they arrived but he turned it and it went back on this was technically hearsay but nobody objected the alarm system also was not turned on upstairs in the master bedroom mrs dooher was in the bed and how was she lying on her side on her side not on her back no on her left side jenkins moved back to glitskys table and he gave her a surreptitious thumbsup as she gathered some material sergeant crandall would you look at these crimescene photographs and tell us if you recognize them jenkins handed them over and crandall agreed that they were accurate the jury got to look at them crandall continued mentioning the tossed blanket and sheets the missing jewelry the blood he then described the lividity that had been on mrs doohers shoulder based on your training and experience sergeant does this lividity help you reconstruct the crime scene yes it does glitsky had known crandall for a long time and knew he could be personable and even funny in a cop sort of way but here on the stand the man was a machine as the coroner has said when a person dies the blood settles into the down side of the skin due to gravity but didnt you just say that this lividity was on mrs doohers upper shoulder yes i did and what does that mean it means that she was moved after she was dead rolled halfover and why was that this time farrell stood on top of it objection your honor speculation the objection was sustained but jenkins was finally beginning to roll sergeant when you first entered the room did you have an impression of what had happened there crandall nodded yes and what was that it looked like a burglary that had been interrupted when the victim woke up that thered been a struggle and in that struggle the burglar had killed mrs dooher but dont we know that mrs dooher was already dead when she was stabbed thats right because of the lividity that was my assumption at the time she was dead when she was stabbed and had the nightclothes been ripped or partially ripped from the victim yes and had the bedding been thrown about thats right and was there blood spattered on the bed and on the floor under the bed and so on yes even though mrs dooher could not have struggled at all because she was already dead crandall said yes again and glitsky thought he didnt have to provide any speculation after this testimony what had happened ought to be clear enough jenkins came back to the table for her pad consulting it she faced crandall once more now sergeant crandall lets change direction for a moment what did you do with the blood samples you found at the scene of the murder i sent them for analysis to the crime lab farrell knew he had a hostile witness in crandall but it wasnt his style to pussyfoot he got up from the defense table crossed the floor of the courtroom and positioned himself about two feet in front of the witness he smiled warmly sergeant crandall id like to begin by talking about the side door where youve testified that there was no sign of forced entry no sign at all crandall nodded thats right in your thorough investigation of the premises did you discover anyplace else where somebody might have broken into the house no whoever came in appeared to just open the door so there was no sign that anyone broke in farrell brought in the jury with a look none and no one had tried to make it look like a breakin either had they crandall paused a second before answering i dont know whether anyone had tried farrell appreciated this answer and he told crandall as much that is what i asked isnt it sergeant a nod but whether or not anyone had tried it didnt look like anyone had tried to make it look like a burglary did it no all right thank you lets leave that for a moment farrell took a few steps over to the exhibit table and lifted something from it i call your attention to peoples exhibit number two the kitchen knife which we all agree belonged to the defendant and his wife did you have this knife tested for fingerprints yes and what did you find we found the defendants fingerprints on the knife as well as those of his wife anybody elses no just those two all right now did you discover anything about the defendants fingerprints that would indicate that he held this knife during or after it was plunged into his wifes chest for example were there fingerprints over blood on the knife or fingerprints in blood no nothing at all to indicate that the defendant had ever used this knife as anything other than an ordinary kitchen implement no nothing at all jenkins spoke from behind farrell asked and answered thomasino agreed sustaining her farrell nodded genially glanced over at the jury and included them in his good humor all right sergeant i think were getting somewhere here on all this evidence that was found at the murder scene id like to ask you now about the surgical glove peoples three that was found outside the house by the side door that showed no sign of forced entry did you submit this glove to rigorous lab analysis yes of course of course and what did you find on it any fingerprints no no fingerprints the rubber does not hold fingerprints we did find some spots of mrs doohers blood only mrs doohers blood yes only mrs doohers a lot of blood crandall shook his head i wouldnt say a lot a few drops splattered and smudged but again nothing at all that ties this piece of evidence to the defendant nothing at all is that right yes thats right good farrell brought his hands together histrionically delighted with the results of his questions so far now sergeant dont the police routinely wear surgical gloves just like this one when they are investigating crime scenes jenkins stood up objecting but thomasino let the question stand and crandall had to answer it yes sometimes just like this one sometimes yes sometimes hmmm so you personally have access to gloves just like this one objection your honor sergeant crandall isnt on trial here but farrell spoke right up your honor im trying to establish that the glove could just as easily have come from the police presence at the scene absolutely nothing has been offered to connect this glove with the defendant thomasino nodded and sighed it seems to me youve done that already mr farrell lets move on to the next point farrell bowed acquiescent sergeant youve told us that your initial impression upstairs before you knew about the lividity in mrs doohers shoulder was that a burglary had occurred and shed woken up and the burglar had stabbed her after a struggle do i have that right yes crandall shifted in his seat farrell keeping him to short answers on simple factual questions had succeeded in making him appear restless edgy and he wasnt finished yet in other words the room looked to your practiced eye as though a burglary had been in progress isnt that correct thats the way it looked to me until i looked more carefully at the body it was made to look like a burglary your honor jenkins stood at her table how many times do we have to hear the same question thomasino nodded lets move it along mr farrell youve established that the scene looked to sergeant crandall like a burglary had been interrupted im sorry your honor i just wanted it to be clear farrell turned to the jury and bowed slightly an apology turning back facing the judge and the witness box his voice was mild so sergeant based on your training and experience you reached the conclusion that mr dooher had been the person in the room who had faked this burglary crandall did not respond quickly yes id say thats right he wanted it to look like a burglary and so he left the side door open so thered be no sign of a burglars forced entrance is that your contention i dont know why he left the door open or even if he did he might have let himself in with a key indeed he might have sergeant so what evidence did you uncover that shows that mr dooher as opposed to someone else did any of this objection argumentative this had been farrells intention so it didnt surprise him when thomasino sustained her moving a step or two closer to the witness box he had his hands in his jacket pockets just to recount for the jury sergeant so far weve established that none of the evidence found at the scene in any way places mr dooher there at the time of the stabbing of his wife isnt that the case not directly but farrell held up a finger stopping him not only not directly sergeant youve testified that there was nothing at all these were your own words nothing at all then you concluded that mr dooher attempted to make it look as though a burglary had taken place when in fact he returned to his home to kill his wife and yet he apparently took no great pains to create a false impression of illegal entry which surely would have aided his deception then he left no evidence behind none at all that would implicate another person no thats not true there was the blood farrell gave every impression of relief that crandall had reminded him of that thorny problem ah yes the blood the blood the tainted blood but of course thats not your area is it no its not farrell had wounded crandall and had him in his sights again he was going to bring him down sergeant in your thorough investigation of the crime scene you must have found a great deal of evidence that mark dooher in fact lived in this house isnt that right yes of course did you find his fingerprints fibers from his clothing hairs and so forth yes we did and would you have expected to find those things of course farrell gave him another smile a simple yes is fine sergeant thank you now did you find anything you would not have expected to find relating to mark dooher like what i dont know sir im asking you but ill rephrase it for you did you find anything specific either at the crime scene itself or in mr doohers car or his office or in your subsequent analysis of lab results and blood tests and so forth that based on your training and experience led you to suspect that mark dooher had killed his wife crandall didnt reply farrell pressed his advantage and isnt it true that you found no physical evidence either in the bedroom itself or on the person of mrs dooher that linked mark dooher with this crime crandall hated it his face had flushed with suppressed anger i suppose if you sergeant isnt it true that you found no evidence linking mark dooher with this crime isnt that true he spit it out yes another smile thank you wes beamed up at thomasino thats all for this witness your honor chapter thirty six had glitsky not encountered similar situations dozens of times before he wouldnt have believed it it still amazed him amandas next witness whod been sitting out here in the hallway fortyfive minutes ago had disappeared so glitsky was out in the echoing linoleum corridor chatting with a severely displeased george crandall crandall had vented his pique about farrells crossexamination for a couple of minutes and now was telling glitsky about a book he was going to write based on his truelife experiences as a bigcity cop really though i dont have much more than a title at this stage i got friends who say thats the important part anyway you get a good title you sell a lot of books whats the title glitsky asked him wait first heres the idea you know all these celebrities who grow up and remember that somebody abused them when they were seven and thats why theyve been married eight times and theyve got substanceabuse problems and if all of us normal people just tried to understand them theyd be happier sure i worry about them all the time exactly so ill call it who gives a shit what do you think glitsky liked it a lot but didnt think it would sell very many books he was starting to tell that to crandall but had to cut the discussion short amanda jenkins was ascending the stairs holding the arm of a tall disheveled young man with hornrimmed glasses the crimelab specialist the blood guy ray drumm mr drumm exquisite boredom oozing from every pore endured a twominute lecture from judge thomasino on the relative merits of wandering off leaving the hall of justice to smoke a cigarette outside when you were due to testify in a murder trial contempt of court was mentioned but didnt seem to make much of an impact finally drumm was sworn in and took his seat in the witness chair like most of the professional lawpersons in the building glitsky had no use for drumm a career bureaucrat who wasnt yet thirtyfive years old drumm was taciturn when he wasnt being simply obstinate perhaps he was truly brain dead but glitsky didnt think it was that he had the attitude i got my job i cant get fired bite me but jenkins couldnt let her feelings show though abe knew she shared his own getting information from drumm was pulling teeth under the best of circumstances god forbid you did something to put his back up and jenkins had already interrupted his precious cigarette he sat slumped on his elbow but she greeted him cordially then began leading him through the blood issues bringing him around to the samples found in the room and what did you find in analyzing these samples a roll of the eyes drumm had much more important things to do at this moment clearly he sighed there were two different blood types mrs doohers and another one was the second one mr doohers no do you know whose blood it was we know it was apositive we ran dna tests and farrell was up shot out of a cannon your honor this is the first the defense has heard about dna testing the prosecution has said they couldnt just a minute just a minute this was jenkins voice raised thomasino gavelled the room quiet jenkins turned to the witness mr drumm you did not in fact run dna on this blood did you perhaps you were thinking of mrs doohers blood he shrugged maybe that was it i thought you were talking about her jenkins looked round at farrell what could she do about this idiot and then turned back to drumm no i was asking about the other blood sample from the murder scene the blood type of that second sample what was that i just said apositive jenkins shook her head no mr drumm you just said mrs doohers blood type was apositive were they both apositive drumm couldnt have cared less did i say that they wasted another minute or two while the reporter read back what hed said and then drumm asked to see his lab results again and jenkins got them from her table and brought them to him he turned a page turned a page turned back a page mr drumm have you found the blood type glitsky wanted to take out his gun and shoot off the guys kneecap wake him up or maybe shoot him in the head put him to sleep im looking drumm said yeah here it is apositive for the second blood and while were here what was mrs doohers blood type as though he hadnt just a second before reviewed the report drumm scanned it again she was opositive did you run dna testing on the second sample no and why not i dont know nobody asked me to jenkins was hoping against hope that drumm would supply the useful information that they hadnt run dna because they had nothing to compare it to the blood had belonged to a man who was dead and cremated but then certainly without meaning to drumm gave her something the dna didnt matter anyway this brought an audible reaction from the gallery nothing approaching an outburst more a sustained hum thomasino tapped his gavel and it disappeared why didnt it matter whose blood was mixed with mrs doohers at the murder scene because the blood did not come directly from a body it came from a vial jenkins questioned him to bring out the edta angle and the picture gradually began to emerge in other words mr drumm the second blood discovered at the murder scene was brought there looks like it farrells direction was becoming clear he wasnt going to take up much of mr drumms incredibly valuable time his crossexamination consisted of two questions mr drumm did you find any of mr doohers blood in either of the two samples you analyzed and mr drumm did you find any of mr doohers blood on either the knife or surgical glove that were found at the scene the answer to both was no peter harris didnt like testifying for the prosecution against one of his patients from the witness box he raised a hand greeting dooher the jury certainly noticed but jenkins needed him to put the tainted blood in doohers hands dr harris are you the defendants personal physician i am and on what date did the defendant have his last appointment with you harris by now knew the date by heart but he pulled out a pocket notebook and appeared to be reading from it it was a routine physical friday may thirtyfirst at twothirty friday may thirtyfirst at twothirty thank you now doctor do you draw blood from patients in your office yes certainly often a shrug ten times a day sometimes more its a routine procedure jenkins nodded yes and when you draw blood what do you do with it well that depends on the reason we drew the blood in the first place glitsky saw jenkins straighten her back take a deep breath he was glad she was slowing herself down her questions werent precise enough she wasnt getting what she wanted she tried again what i meant doctor is when you draw this blood you put it in vials dont you yes and what happened to these vials we send them to the lab good before you send them to the lab do you lock them up no are they within anyones reasonable reach harris was uncomfortable with this but was trying his best to be cooperative again he looked over at dooher gave him a nervous apologetic smile sometimes on a counter or a tray or by a nurses station something like that is that what you mean yes before you can take these vials to the lab they are often left sitting out in your office accessible to anyone who wanted to take one is that right a wry expression not so much anymore but yes do you lose a lot of these vials doctor no have you ever lost a vial yes a couple of times did you lose a vial on friday may thirtyfirst yes we did and whose blood was that the blood missing from your office on may thirtyfirst the patient was leo banderas and what blood type does mr banderas have apositive glitsky shifted his gaze over to the defense table this testimony was going to be doohers darkest hour the defense team seemed to know it too and the three of them sat rapt waiting for what was going to come next do you happen to know doctor what time mr banderass appointment was for on that friday may thirtyfirst slowly though he knew the answer harris reached for his little book and checked it one last time one fortyfive or fortyfive minutes before the defendants appointment for the third time harris made eye contact with mark dooher then he nodded to jenkins thats right jenkins glanced up at the wall clock it was late enough that thomasino would adjourn for the weekend the minute she let harris go and the jury would have a couple of days to live with this most unlikely of coincidences thank you doctor thats all she turned sweetly to farrell your witness but farrell had barely moved to get up when thomasino interrupted ladies and gentlemen its a quarter to five and i think weve all had a long week well adjourn now until your honor there was a shrillness now to farrells voice an edge of panic your honor if the court pleases i just have a few quick questions for this witness and then we can start out fresh on monday morning and the doctor wont have to come back downtown to court he added helpfully the judge looked again at the clock shook his head no and whacked his gavel he told farrell and the rest of the room that court was adjourned until monday morning at ninethirty chapter thirty seven glitsky thieu and jenkins were at a subterranean table in lou the greeks savoring their moment of glory glitsky and thieu were nursing iced teas but jenkins had a double martini halfgone and another full one in front of her it was friday by god and shed earned it i love this blood thing jenkins said even without the dna on banderas its pretty strong glitsky finished chewing some ice it could always be stronger he said but this is good thieu hadnt been in court and as usual wanted to know everything glitsky thought if he kept up the way hed been going soon he would he already knew everything about everything else when thieu had been filled in he said its a shame old leo died and got cremated before we knew what was up a sample of his blood to compare to what we found at doohers would sink our boy wouldnt it jenkins wasnt going to cry over that spilled milk the story the jury just heard the missing vial thats all we needed juries dont believe dna anyway they dont understand it paul does glitsky said i think he invented it in fact whats to understand thieu in fact had no problem with it its a fingerprint its there its you its not not am i wrong here nope glitsky answered thats the theory and a fine one it is too he started to slide out of the booth then stopped oh amanda in the rush i forgot the second chair christina i talked to her at lunch she didnt know about it shes not the motive thieu leaned forward i was thinking about that this afternoon abe and she still could be the motive even if she didnt know about it glitsky was shaking his head not if the two of them didnt have anything sexual going into it hows dooher going to know he can get her sure enough to kill his wife for it risk a trial all of this its too much thieu shrugged the guy loves games look at trang look at nguyen the price woman this is who this guy is i could see him doing it just for the challenge not even knowing how its going to come out with anyone else glitsky would have been tempted to laugh off this idea as too farfetched but thieu hadnt been wrong very often so far i hope youre wrong he said why cause if youre right its only a matter of time before shes next in the defense room when the door closed behind them christina hung the coat of her suit over a folding chair and walked to her window as she always did the winter night was closing in and over the hall across the street christmas lights were coming on in some of the downtown towers now mark spoke quietly youre thinking i might have done it after all arent you still facing the night she was silent he slid off the desk and she felt him begin to come up behind her before she saw his reflection in the window please she said dont he stopped i have no explanation for the blood christina i dont know anything about it a pause we joked about it at lunch about it being wess finest hour but in fact what he said was the truth the problem with being innocent is you dont know what happened yes ive heard that a couple of times now its got a nice rhythm to it as though its a universal law as though its got to be true it is true crossing her hands over her chest she barely trusted herself to breathe mark stood behind her christina weve known about this blood all along youve known about it finally she turned around all right ive known about it mark its been there all along no doubt i guess i just figured there had to be some explanation and eventually it would come out well eventually just happened and nothing came out he just looked at her what id like to know is how a vial of blood from your doctors office came to find its way into your wifes bed i dont know you dont know with an edge of despair dont you think i wish i knew wouldnt it be great if i could make something up something youd believe that we could tell the jury she didnt trust herself to answer to say anything the silence roared around her im going to say a few things christina his voice when it finally came was strangely beaten down she didnt remember ever hearing that tone before i know youll probably have thought of most of them but im going to go over them again then well see where we are he was sitting now behind her she hadnt noticed when hed moved she held herself cold wrapped in her own arms the first question he began how the vial from my doctors office got in sheilas bed well listen how do we know that happened how do we even know blood is missing how do we know that if it is it ended up at the scene she whirled dont patronize me mark he shook his head you think thats it you think im condescending to you thats the last thing id do christina she waited arms crossed ill tell you what we dont know and the first thing is that we dont know any blood is missing how do we know some lab technician at harriss didnt just drop a test tube and not want to admit it maybe hes done it before and if it happens again hes fired maybe mr banderass blood is still sitting at the lab with the wrong label on it he held up a hand his voice low im not saying it is christina i dont have a clue what is anymore but lets go on down with what else could have happened okay look at what they say they have a vial of apositive blood they dont know its banderas they didnt run dna for christ sake did they why isnt it just as likely that the police lab here made a mistake did you see that guy drumm this is the guy whose testimonys gonna put me away i dont think so maybe there was some of this edta left on the last slide they looked at maybe the guy who killed sheila had apositive blood and bled all over the place and the lab screwed it up are you saying people dont make mistakes on blood tests and if they did that to begin with you think theyll admit it now she was leaning now half sitting against the window sill so whats easier to believe that the guy who killed my wife got hold of a vial of apositive blood and poured it all over the room or that the killer just bled and why i dont really get this part at all why in the world would i assuming i did all this why would i dream up this blood idea at all what does it accomplish youve known me now for almost a year am i a moron if im trying to make it look like somebody else did it why do i use my own knife why do i leave my fingerprints all over it at last he ventured a step towards her all right he said levelly ill admit at this point its a matter of faith you cant know but why do you assume that everybody else has done their job that nobody made a mistake that everybody is telling the truth except me she raised her eyes i dont assume that mark im trying im listening his shoulders slumped his face for the very first time looked old to her diminished this was not arrogance she was sure but nakedness she was looking into the core of him i didnt do this he whispered he was not even pleading which would have made him suspect i swear to you i dont know what happened when the doorbell rang wes assumed it was the pizza delivery and buzzed the downstairs entrance opening his door he stepped out into the hallway to wait bart came up around him sniffed and walked to the head of the steps where his tail began to wag and he started making little whimpering noises bart farrell moved forward raising his voice delivery people got nervous around big dogs its okay he called out hes friendly he wont bite the dog started down the steps which hed been trained against bart its okay hes missed me sam stopped where she stood three steps from the top one hand absently petting bart the other hand clutched a leather satchel which hung over her shoulder hi she said hi his gut went hollow she was wearing a green jacket with the hood still up hair tucked into it jeans and hiking boots her face was halfhidden unreadable looking up at him and then she was fumbling with the satchel i wanted to bring you something we shouldnt be talking sam im not here to talk she pulled a red accordion file out of the satchel you need to see something he knew what he needed to see he needed to see her to have things be back the way theyd started but that couldnt happen theyd come to here and he was in the middle of a trial and she was with the enemy he couldnt forget that or he would lose im pretty busy right now i dont have time to read anything else ive got about all i can handle unless your friend dianes changing her story holding the file against her she threw back the jackets hood her eyes glistened with rage or regret wes please please what this is important this is critical not just for the trial for you but she didnt move and neither did he finally she nodded gave bart another pat lay the folder down on the steps and turned when she got to the door she didnt pause as he thought she might he would have a chance then to call out to see if but there was no hesitation at all the door closed behind her his intention was to leave it on the stairs but he didnt do that then once it was inside he decided he would just throw the damn thing in the trash but he didnt hed read all of the newspaper and magazine articles about diane price and hed about had it up to his earlobes with them clearly the woman was some kind of publicity hound whod struck gold with the touching story of the brutal rape that had cut short her promising future and forced her to a life of drugs and promiscuity right hed read somewhere that shed optioned her life story to some hollywood outfit and he thought that was just perfect she was a charlatan and a liar and had parlayed a couple of weeks with his famous client into a cottage industry among the politically correct he had nothing but contempt for her and what she stood for but now the accordion folder was on the milk crate in the other room while he sat at his kitchen table pretending to go over emil balians testimony about marks car as he chewed on his pizza and drank his second and third beers of the evening he kept the radio on low christmas carols he didnt want to hear any random country music none of emil balians story made any more sense than it had the fifth and sixth times hed reviewed it the nosy neighbor didnt know what car hed seen on the night of the murder the second period of the warriors game was like the second period of all basketball games farrell was coming to the opinion that they should change the rules of pro basketball give each team a hundred points and shorten the game to two minutes youd wind up with the same scores and save everybody a lot of wear and tear in the end he swore to himself flicked off the tube then the radio opened another beer and sat on his futon with the folder in his lap still hesitating what did sam mean this was for him not the trial there were a lot of pages the first was from a highschool yearbook diane taylor with a beaming smile the mortarboard graduation photo under it the list of organizations shed belonged to and awards shed won rally committee debate society chess club varsity cheerleader biology club swim team bank of america science award lifetime member california scholarship federation national merit semifinalist wes flipped to the next pages more yearbook the individual photos that showed her as shed been back then vivacious pretty popular but so what the newspapers were filled with file photos of mass murderers whod looked like this and done this much in high school you just couldnt tell wes had no trouble recalling his own highschool yearbook photo with his beatle haircut hed been voted best hair now he was fortyseven percent bald by actual count and that alone he thought pretty much said it all about the relevance of highschool pictures but he kept going turning the pages within the folder sipping his beer a change in focus now from photographs to xeroxes of report cards and transcripts senior year all as first semester at stanford as second and third semester as fourth semester a b c s and an incomplete so something happened during the spring semester of her sophomore year wes had seen this too a million times this was he doublechecked the date on the transcript drugs happened was what martin luther king got killed bobby kennedy the chicago democratic convention and humphrey and then richard nixon america fell apart wes wouldnt be surprised if set a record for grades going to hell somebody ought to do a study get a government grant but what did it mean it meant nothing it was yet another example of a person sam in this case seeing what she was already disposed to see he finished his beer and went to get another one he should go to sleep but something tugged him back to the futon to the folder he owed sam something didnt he no he didnt she was wrong here and he was right she had caused him all the pain not the other way around she was still hurting him the next stapled group of pages fortytwo of them contained xeroxes of diary entries in a confident female hand two to a page the first eightythree days of the year ending march rd he read it all diane was a chatty and charming diarist she was still swimming competitively she was taking german chemistry biology and western civ and she was worried that they were too easy that she wouldnt be prepared when she got to med school she had two close female friends maxine and sharon and on march th shed met mark dooher the first male mentioned in a romantic context within the pages no drugs no sex no innuendos of either on march th she went to an afternoon college baseball game with mark dooher burgers a kiss good night the last line on march nd mark and i mo a little first boyfriend this year whew thought it was my breath the last line on march rd tomorrow date with mark cant wait wes turned the last page of this section and frowned the next stapled section seemed to be more xeroxes of diary pages again two to a page beginning march th but these pages had no writing he flipped through page by page nothing for seventeen days where before march rd diane had never skipped more than a day then on april th the handwriting had changed subtly but recognizable even to wes it was more cramped somehow less confident didn t get out of bed too scared seeing everything different now what people are capable of now since mark from that im afraid ill see him and then what ive got to tell somebody but he said he d kill me i want to go home but i cant leave school without saying why but i cant think i cant talk to anybody god my mom how can i tell them and then another sheaf of blank pages until june th when presumably school got out wes was asking himself why hadnt he seen this before why hadnt sam given it to amanda jenkins if shed done that wes would have read it in the discovery documents but it hadnt been there but what did it mean anyway legally it was worthless purportedly this was nothing but copies of pages maybe from a diary of twentysome years before the entire package could have been reconstructed or originally created in the past month in no way was it evidence but as sam had said it wasnt meant to be evidence the pages werent for the trial they were for wes chapter thirty eight on monday morning at wes farrell stood before the witness box in department and said good morning to dr harris the two men had had a long talk on sunday afternoon discussing what they would say this morning harris had always liked mark dooher had liked sheila too the police had more or less set him up to make mark look bad and he was more than willing to try to work some damage control doctor farrell began on friday you testified that you lost a vial of blood from your office on may thirtyfirst have you ever located that vial of blood no in other words its lost thats right how did you discover it was lost it didnt come back from the lab when it was supposed to oh farrell was intriguedthis blood then was it supposed to go to a lab from your office yes we send our blood work out to the pacheco clinic where theyve got a lab facility is the pacheco clinic far from your office no a mile maybe a little more all right then now doctor how do they keep track of the blood they work on in this lab we have a requisition slip that we attach to the vials with tape then they fill in a report form for results lets back up a minute shall we you attach your requisition slip to these vials with tape yes what kind of tape regular scotch tape scotch tape on glass vials hmm is that sticky enough doctor does the tape ever come off if the vial gets wet sometimes yes all right did you discover that this missing vial of blood leo banderass blood never got to pacheco lab because it wasnt logged in was that it no not exactly theyre not logged in as such so you dont know whether this vial of blood ever got to the pacheco lab no i dont know it could have been delivered there and lost there isnt that true jenkins objected to the question as speculation and she was sustained but farrell thought hed made his point anyway he decided to move along he turned to the jury and gave them a relaxed smile dr harris you testified that youd lost other vials of blood from your office is that true yes many of them harris thought a minute over the years say three or four three or four has it ever happened to your knowledge that someone has dropped a vial of blood yes is this something dropping a vial of blood that could get someone fired if it happened a lot possibly your honor objection speculation again thomasino sustained jenkins and again farrell didnt care he was putting points on the board dr harris did you have the opportunity to review the lab report that mr drumm signed yes i did and the blood in the second vial was it the blood of your patient leo banderas i dont know there was no way to tell but the blood in the vial was apositive was it not yes but there was nothing to compare it with mr banderas died several months ago and was cremated theres no trace of his dna left so youre saying doctor that theres no way to tell if the blood in the second vial belonged to mr banderas or not is that right yes thats right then there is no particular reason to believe that the blood in the second vial the blood found at the crime scene had ever been in your office is there no in his free time over the weekend when he wasnt chatting with dr harris and amid all different kinds of soulsearching regarding diane price farrell had tried intermittently to focus on abe glitsky he wished hed had better luck formulating a plan because the lieutenant was in the witness box now and farrell was approaching him and didnt know what he was going to say glitskys testimony easily delivered over two hours with amanda jenkins leading him every step of the way had done some damage this was in large part due to glitskys air of authority on the stand if he had come to suspect mark dooher there had to be some reason he was a professional cop with no particular ax to grind in fact he was the head of homicide it looked to him as though the defendant was guilty thats why he had delivered doohers case to the da and why the grand jury had indicted him lieutenant youve given us mark doohers version of the events of june th and then your own interpretation of those events which led you to arrest him for the murder of his wife for the benefit of the jury can you tell us a specific instance of an untruth you uncovered in mr doohers statement to you on the night of the murder a great deal of it was untrue thats what all these other witnesses are here to talk about yes but do you have any proof you can show us that mr dooher lied say a creditcard receipt that proves he was really buying clothes downtown when he said he went to dellaromas deli anything like that i have statements of other witnesses glitsky repeated and the jury will get to decide who they believe among those witnesses lieutenant but to get back to my question now for the third time do you personally have something you can show us or describe for us that proves anything about mark doohers actions on the night of the murder glitsky kept his composure wishing that jenkins would object about something the testimony of the other prosecution witnesses taken together would constitute proof he hoped but he didnt have a smoking gun and farrell was nailing him for it i dont have a creditcard receipt no isnt it true lieutenant that you dont have anything that proves mark dooher told even one small lie not by itself no not by itself or not at all do you have something specific or dont you farrell was going to squeeze it out of him he glanced at jenkins couldnt she call this speculation or leading the witness or something evidently not no but farrell wasnt going to gloat over this minor victory he simply nodded satisfied and took aim at his next target now lieutenant glitsky as the investigator in charge of this case did you analyze the reports of the crimescene investigator sergeant crandall and the lab reports on blood submitted by mr drumm yes i did and yet didnt you hear both of those gentlemen testify that they found no evidence tying mark dooher to the scene no a look of surprise there was some whispering in the gallery a few of the jurors frowned and leaned forward in their seats farrell took a step towards him you did not hear them say that no sir that was a conclusion you drew this stopped farrell cold glitsky had maneuvered him into a trap crandalls testimony the knife the fingerprints did not preclude dooher from being on the scene neither did drumms tainted blood but two could play this game they were going to do a little dance your honor farrell said would you please instruct the witness to answer only the questions i ask him the judge did just that a rebuke for the jurys benefit see farrell was telling them lieutenant glitsky doesnt play by the rules farrell inclined his head an inch lieutenant did you hear dr strout identify the kitchen knife peoples three as the murder weapon yes and did you hear sergeant crandall testify that the only fingerprints on the knife belonged to mr and mrs dooher and were entirely consistent with normal household use yes and did you also hear sergeant crandalls testimony about the surgical glove found at the scene yes i did well then lieutenant i must ask you in your professional opinion why did mr dooher wear this surgical glove if he knew as he must have known that his fingerprints were already all over the murder weapon to point to a burglar to point to a burglar as soon as hed repeated glitskys answer farrell realized it was a critical mistake glitsky jumped on it before he could stop him without the glove theres no evidence of a burglar farrell kept his poker face on but these suddenly were bad cards he couldnt let it rest here and yet lieutenant didnt sergeant crandall testify there were no fingerprints on the glove yes there was absolutely nothing connecting this glove to mr dooher glitsky had to concede it thats right farrell decided that wisdom dictated a shift of emphasis this was where farrell knew it was going to get serious in a hurry and he took in a breath slowing down coming to a stop in the center of the courtroom in the jurys eyes here was a man wrestling with a moral dilemma finally he turned back to glitsky having come to his difficult decision lieutenant do you ever wear surgical gloves when you investigate a bloody crime scene jenkins stood and objected but thomasino overruled her the lieutenant nodded yes farrell saw no need to say more he had larger prey in his sights in the early portion of this year and especially in the latter half of april did you have occasion to spend a great deal of time in st marys hospital jenkins slammed a palm on the table and was up out of her chair your honor i object what does that question have to do with the death of sheila dooher but this time farrell wasnt going to wait meekly for a ruling im afraid it has everything to do with it your honor its relevance will become clear during my case either i make the point now or id like permission to recall lieutenant glitsky at that time the judges eyes were invisible under his brows he called a recess to see the attorneys in his chambers glitsky stayed in the witness box there was no place else he wanted to go anyway no one he wanted to talk to across the courtroom dooher and christina had their heads together conferring in whispers their body language so intimate it was embarrassing he tried to imagine dooher objectively in that moment a middleaged white male in the prime of his life he kept himself fit he looked good and clearly he could attract a beautiful younger woman studying him glitsky tried to imagine the moments of rage or had it been calm deliberation how was it possible that none of it showed and yet there was no visible sign no way to see what dooher had done except in what hed inadvertently left behind and yet glitsky knew dooher looked up perhaps feeling the long gaze on him his eyes came to glitsky for a fraction of an instant flat completely without reaction as though glitsky didnt exist and then he was back in his conversation with christina carrera in the gallery the huge crowds from the pretrial had slimmed somewhat with the judicial rulings on what issues were going to be allowed but still every seat appeared to be taken although just at the moment a knot of reporters had congealed around the bar rail they smelled a fresh kill coming and glitsky was afraid it was going to be him all right lieutenant do you remember the question i asked you if youd had occasion to spend a lot of time in st marys hospital in the spring of this year around the time of sheila doohers murder a wary look yes how many days i dont know exactly thirty or forty farrell was damned if he was going to ask why and get the sympathy flowing for what glitsky had gone through his wife had been dying of cancer the jury didnt need to know that for farrell this was a tough moment personally he felt for glitskys grief but so be it he had to have the testimony were you a patient or a visitor there lieutenant a visitor and during those thirty or forty days were you ever near a nurses station yes did you ever witness blood being drawn glitsky knew where this was going and cast a cold eye on jenkins but the attorneys must have slugged this one out in chambers the cavalry was not on the way yes do you remember ever seeing any vials of blood sitting out on a tray or a table or at a nurses station yes and were these vials guarded in any way or under lock and key no all right thank you lieutenant thats all lunch was a somber affair a fierce cold wet storm had blown in off the pacific while glitsky had been on the stand during the morning and christina was standing at her window watching the rain slanting down while her two companions sullenly finished their takeout chinese shed flown down to ojai on saturday morning back again last night shed needed to get some perspective get out of the glare of all of this to a degree it had worked but now the heaters had come on and smelled musty in the tiny room and mark and wes still hadnt gotten back to the people theyd been before shed kissed mark on his doorstep that kiss had changed wes profoundly in spite of his skills in the courtroom he appeared more distracted with every passing day more upset with her and especially with mark she wanted to shake wes out of his doubts shed had her round of them on friday all about the blood glitskys testimony had opened up another whole universe of possible explanations doubts had to be part of it if the prosecution didnt have some decent facts it wouldnt get cases past the grand jury and hadnt wes been the one whod drilled into her the notion that the facts arent as important as how you interpret them why couldnt he see that now she knew what was bothering wes this case wasnt about the facts to him it was about his confidence in mark and the kiss had undermined that she turned from the window about to say something try to lighten things up but just then the cop from the hall knocked and said they were reconvening emil balian had dressed well in a conservative dark suit with a white shirt and rep tie amanda jenkins had paid for his haircut which eliminated the unruly shocks of white hair which normally emanated einsteinlike from the sides of his scalp most importantly glitsky thought hed shaved or someone had shaved him abe thought all in all he looked pretty good respectable grave old abe had met balian on the day after the murder with paul thieu hed gone back to the scene early in the afternoon and there was an elderly man in plaid shorts and hawaiian shirt standing in the driveway saw all about it on the television he said without preamble as theyd gotten out of their car you guys the cops balian introduced himself saying he lived a couple of blocks over on casitas so this was the place huh too bad about the lady hed known her a little he knew just about everybody which was what happened when you walked as much as he did you got to know people stopping to chat while they worked on their gardens or brought in groceries or whatever emil worked for forty years as a mail carrier and just got in the habit of walking plus he had a touch of phlebitis and he was supposed to stroll three or four miles a day keep his circulation up balian wasnt shy he talked incessantly telling glitsky and thieu all about his life in the neighborhood he bought into st francis wood back when a working man could afford a nice house eleanor his wife had a job too and this was in the days before women worked like they do now they hadnt had any children so pretty much had their pick of neighborhoods money wasnt much of a problem back then not like it is now being on a fixed income during this extended recital glitsky kept trying to back away get to the house he knew they were going to have to canvass the area sometime for witnesses anyway he was reasonably certain that this old man was talking for the sheer pleasure of hearing himself talk but it turned out better than that jenkins crossed the floor and came to rest a couple of feet in front of the witness box mr balian she began would you tell us what you did on the evening of june th of this year i sure will i had supper with my wife eleanor at our home on casitas avenue and after supper like i always do i went out for a walk and what time was this it was just dusk maybe a little before say eight oclock thereabouts we always eat at seven sharp used to be six but about ten years ago we went to seven i dont know why really it just seemed more civilized or something so it was seven so to get the timing right was it seven oclock when you began dinner but near eight when you started your walk thats right was there any other way you could mark the time did you check your watch anything like that no i dont usually wear a watch in fact i dont ever wear a watch after i retired i said what do i need a watch for anymore and threw the old thing in my drawer yes well was there any other the time sure as i said it was near dusk when i left it was still light out and when i got back home maybe an hour later it was dark while i was out the streetlights came up so that ought to pinpoint it yes it would thank you jenkins turned back to where glitsky sat at the prosecution table and he gave her a reassuring nod the way balian answered questions drove amanda crazy and she didnt want to lose patience with him after all he was her witness the backbone of her case she took a breath turned and faced him again all right mr balian now on this walk did you happen to notice anything unusual yes i did there was a different car parked out in front of the murrays a different car what do you mean i mean the murrays dont own that car or else they just bought it so i wondered who it was might be visiting them was how i come to notice it can you describe the car mr balian it was a latemodel lightbrown lexus with a personalized license plate that read eskw jenkins entered a photograph of doohers car into evidence the vanity plate was meant to be sort of a humorous rendering of esq for esquire doohers advertisement that he was a lawyer and what street was this car parked on down the end of my own street casitas which is how far from ravenwood two blocks and did you ever see this car again i sure did the very next day which was how i remember it so clear balian was getting caught up in his story enthusiasm all over him glitsky knew that this was where he tended to embellish and hoped jenkins would be able to keep him reined in and where did you see this car it was parked in the driveway at ravenwood street thats why i was still standing out front when the police got there the next day i thought id go by and see the house where thered been the murder it was all on the tv and there was this same car the next day in the driveway so i was looking at it wondering what the connection was farrell got his blood up when it was time to perform leaning over to both dooher and christina as jenkins handed him the witness he whispered its almost unfair he rose slowly and made a little show of pretending to be reading something from a file in front of him getting his questions down from the table finally he raised his head and smiled at the witness mr balian on the night weve been talking about june th before you took your walk you had dinner with your wife at your home do you remember what you had for dinner that night at the opposite table christina saw glitsky and jenkins exchange a look they must have known what would be coming but that didnt make it any easier to sit through on the witness stand emil balian crossed his arms and frowned i dont know he said farrell looked down at the file before him again and creased his own brow you dont know and yet in your second interview with the police didnt you tell lieutenant glitsky that youd had corned beef and cabbage for dinner on that night i think i said that yes but ive got the transcript of that interview right here mr balian would you like to see it no thats all right i know i said it but in a later interview were you as sure of what you had for dinner balian nodded not really but that was a week or so after i first talked to the police and eleanor reminded me she thought wed had pork chops and applesauce that night tuesday if it was going to be important the night before was corned beef it doesnt have anything to do with the car he added petulantly do you remember now which dinner it was the corned beef or the pork chops no im not sure farrell put his pad down and walked around the table out into the center of the courtroom mr balian would you have had a drink with either of these dinners lets say the corned beef usually with corned beef id have a beer one beer a couple of beers sometimes a couple of beers and how about pork chops would you have a drink with pork chops sometimes white wine a glass or two yes but on this night you dont remember what you ate or if you had anything to drink exactly do you not exactly no you do admit however that you probably had a couple of drinks that was your habit with meals regardless whether it was corned beef or pork chops thats the first thing i said wasnt it that i didnt know yes it was mr balian that was the first thing you said that you didnt remember what youd eaten but now lets get on with what you say you do remember the car with the eskw license plates you saw this car parked on your street on tuesday night june th on more solid ground for a moment balian settled himself in the witness chair he loosened his collar at the knot of his tie i did it was in front of the murrays house and where were you did you walk right by it a pause i was across the street across the street did you cross over to look at this car more carefully no i could see it fine i didnt study it or anything i just noticed it the way you notice things it wasnt a car from our street okay fair enough is casitas a wide street by the way the petulance was returning its a normal street i dont know how wide farrell went back to his table and turned with a document in his hand he moved forward to the witness box the questions may have been barbed but his tone was neutral even friendly i have here a notarized survey of casitas avenue he had it marked defense e and it shows that the street is sixtytwo feet from side to side does that sound right mr balian if you say so but you had to be more than sixtytwo feet away when you saw the license plate that read eskw isnt that true i dont know why because you couldnt read the plate from directly across the street could you balian didnt answer directly and farrell believed the question might have struck him ambiguously so he helped him out from directly across the street youd only see the side of the car wouldnt you you would have had to have been diagonal to it to see the license plate isnt that so oh i see what youre saying i guess so yes maybe another ten twenty thirty feet away maybe i dont know i saw the car balian paused so how far were you from the car mr balian more than sixty feet correct i guess more than eighty feet maybe more than a hundred feet maybe not that much so perhaps a hundred feet is that fair farrell smiled at him manto man there was nothing personal here now when you saw this car from perhaps a hundred feet away objection jenkins had to try but she must have known the objection wasnt so much for substance as it was for solidarity her witness was beginning to shrivel farrell rephrased when you saw this car from across the street was it at the beginning of your walk or more toward the end of it the end of it i was coming around back to my street and so the streetlights were on were they not after another hesitation balian responded about the streetlights they had just come on they had just come on so it was still somewhat light out yes i could see clearly im sure you could but im a little confused havent you just testified that you walked for an hour and when you got back to your house it was dark didnt you tell that to ms jenkins yes i said that and this street you live on casitas is it a long way from the murrays house where you saw this car to your own home no seven or eight houses and did you continue your walk home after you saw this car in front of the murrays you didnt stop for anything chat with anybody no and youve said it was dark when you got home yes well then im simply confused here maybe you could explain it to us all how could it have been light or as you say just dark when you were seven or eight houses up the street i said the lights were on yes you did say that mr balian but you said they were just on implying it was still light out isnt that the case but it wasnt light out was it it was in fact dark i said the streetlights were on didnt i he repeated his voice now querulous shaking i didnt tell a lie i saw that car i saw the license plates it was the same car i saw the next day warfare farrell was thinking no other word for it he advanced relentlessly and it was a brown car you said didnt you you knew for sure that the car you saw the previous night had been brown because it had the same license plates yes when you first saw the car that night could you tell it was brown in the dark what kind of question is that of course it was brown it was the same car couldnt it have been dark blue or black or another dark color no it was brown farrell took a moment regrouping he walked back to the defense table consulted some notes turned then do you wear glasses mr balian the witness had his elbows planted on the arms of the chair his head sunken between his shoulders swallowed in the suit i wear reading glasses and you see perfectly clearly for normal activities yes twentytwenty vision another agonizing pause almost i dont need glasses to drive a car ive got fine vision young man for a man of your age im sure you do how old are you by the way mr balian chin thrust out balian was proud of it im seventynine years old and i see just as good as you do farrell paused and took a deep breath he didnt want balian to explode at him make him into the heavy but he had to keep going a couple more hits and it would be over and then the next day at what you knew was a murder scene you saw a similar car in a driveway to the one youd seen the previous night in the dark after youd had a couple of drinks and lieutenant glitsky showed up and suddenly it seemed it might have been the exact same car didnt it it was the same car a subtle shake of the head farrell indicating to the jury that no it wasnt and heres why when was the first time you talked to police mr balian i told you the next day and lieutenant glitsky asked if youd seen anything unusual in the neighborhood right right and you told him about the car and lieutenant glitsky pointed to the brown lexus parked in mr doohers driveway and asked you if that was the car didnt he yes and it looked like the car didnt it balian sat forward tired of all this im pretty sure it was the same car farrell nodded youre pretty sure thank you chapter thirty nine one of archbishop flahertys predecessors had organized the corporate santa claus party to give a yearend tax incentive for businesses to help provide toys games clothes and various other christmas presents for the underprivileged children in the city and county of san francisco this year the st francis yacht club was hosting the event which was the society sets unofficial launch of the seasons hectic party schedule over guests the cream of the citys business community had gathered for an evening of dining and dancing to bigband music mark dooher in his tuxedo was in his element among friends the room like the people in it was elegantly turned out dessert and coffee had been cleared away and the band had kicked into what some guests had decided was a danceable version of joy to the world christina had been amazed and gratified by the volume and apparent sincerity of expressions of support and sympathy for mark now they were alone at their table she held his hand under it look at wes she said to mark it looks like hes finally having some fun the bark of wes farrells laughter carried across the room even over the band everybody who wanted to buy wes a drink had succeeded and he wasnt feeling much pain dooher looked over benevolently he deserves it hes been doing a hell of a job but the guys been killing himself i didnt really know even knowing him my whole life that he had all that fight in him i think hes going to have himself a career after this christina squeezed his hand was silent a moment then said i dont know if i am surprised he looked at her what do you mean she shrugged i dont think this is the kind of law i want to do why not youre getting an innocent man off dont you feel good about that sure i feel great about that but how it has to be done her free hand reached for the salt shaker and poured a small pile of it on to the linen then traced circles with what shed poured last night i couldnt get my mind off poor mr balian how he looked when wes got finished with him and bringing up that stuff with lieutenant glitsky i know it has to be done they got it wrong but i cant tell you how much good it does me to hear you say that again i thought youd given up faith in me again she squeezed his hand you were right she said it is faith theres unanswered questions about almost everything else in life its just here they seem so ominous i know sometimes the past couple of months they almost had me thinking i did it after all i mean i remembered being at the driving range i remember coming home and finding sheila but when i first heard about balian or the blood i wondered where those things could have come from maybe i blanked went sleepwalking something maybe i did it he squeezed her hand but i didnt i cant blame you for having your doubts its just so hard to see these other people glitsky and mr balian and amanda jenkins doing what they do i have to think they really believe theyre right dooher was silent for a moment wrestling with it people get committed to their positions glitsky got himself committed and he sold it to jenkins i think thats whats got us to here but we cant let them ruin our lives weve got to fight back thats the world christina misunderstandings i dont know if people are malicious i dont like to think so but sometimes theyre just wrong and what are we supposed to do about that i know she said but seeing wes take them apart thats hard for me and if we do get to this diane price as one of their witnesses itll be me up there and it will feel personal and i dont know if that is me youll do fine but she was shaking her head no not that im not worried whether or not i can do it i know what im going to be asking her ive rehearsed it a hundred times as you guys say ill eat her for lunch but i have to tell you im not comfortable with it this isnt what i feel i was born to do he covered her hand with both of his leaned in toward her what do you think you were born to do christina i dont know really something less confrontational i guess there must be something in the law no he interrupted i dont mean with the law im not talking about your professional life youll do fine there whatever you decide i mean you personally what were you born to do her finger went back to spreading the salt around the band finished one song and started another i dont know anymore mark i dont think about that but you used to know she shrugged i used to have dreams now she trailed off biting down on her lip its stupid you grow up and all the variables have changed and what you thought you wanted isnt really an option anymore she met his eyes he raised her hand and turned her palm to him kissing it gently youre thinking an old man like me hell nearly fifty theres no way id want what you used to think you were born for i dont he touched her lips with his index finger which is babies a family a normal life like your parents have is that it is that what you used to think you were born for she pressed her lips together her eyes were liquid with tears and she nodded because he said we could do that we could have all the kids you want i didnt do so well the first time around maybe we could both start over together she leaned her head in against his he brought his arms up around her and felt her shoulders give holding her there against him he whispered whatever you want its doable christina we can do it whatever you want anything nat glitsky left a message for his son at homicide then braved the new storm that had just arrived air mail from alaska he got to abes duplex where he told rita she could take the night off he was driving his three grandsons downtown where they were going to meet their father at the imperial palace in chinatown for dim sum nats treat it had been a toughenough year for the family and after abes testimony at the trial nats personal seismograph sensitive to these things had picked up rumblings with the boys that made him uncomfortable now they were all on the first round of pot stickers their father hadnt shown up yet and the rumblings were continuing what i dont get jacob was grousing is no matter what time we plan something dads late even if its like five minutes from where he works your old mans busy jake hes in the middle of a trial on top of his regular job but it bothered nat too and checking his watch every five minutes he wasnt entirely successful at hiding it hell be here hes coming sos christmas isaac really wasnt saying much lately his mothers death had carved out a hole in his personality where the kid used to be and now a sullen gangly hurt teenager glared across the table at his grandfather isaac was the oldest and having the worst time of it but in nats view none of the boys was doing very well a waitress came by as one of them did every couple of minutes with a new selection of foods all kinds of sticky buns chicken beef and pork dishes various seafoods nat didnt keep kosher all the time vegetables and noodles each served on a small white plate a pile of which were accumulating quickly at the side of the table at the end of the meal the waiters would count the plates and compute the cost simple and efficient so you been reading about your father in the newspapers nat wasnt going to sidestep into it he knew what the undercurrent was about and knew there wasnt any solution except to talk about it but none of the boys answered so he persisted you taking grief at school oj sitting next to nat was the youngest and looked across the table to his older brothers for cues but they were pretending to be busy peeling aluminum foil from some chicken wings so he piped up i dont think dads a liar i dont think he cheated shut up oj jacob said hes doing what hes got to do thats all hes a cop its not the same whats not jake the rules nat didnt like hearing that your dads not breaking any rules jake hes got the same rules as everybody else isaac snorted you read the newspaper grandpa you watch any television yeah ive seen it well well what well what do you think i think this man dooher killed his wife and hes got a smart attorney your dad arrested him because he thought he did that you know he didnt take any blood from the hospital isaac looked down unconvinced jacob spoke up it doesnt really matter grandpa everybody thinks he did not everybody nat said i dont you boys shouldnt anybody starts telling that stuff to you you tell them theyre full of baloney but why do they keep saying it oj wanted to know because people dont know your father and people do know or they like to believe that there are cops out there who do bad things who cheat and lie and plant evidence so theyll win their cases but thats not your father you guys gotta believe in your old man hes going through a hard time right now just like you all are you got to help him get through it but isaac was shaking his head disagreeing why he doesnt help us with anything hes gone in the morning gone at nights gone on the weekends work work work and he dumps us off on rita he just doesnt want to be with us its obvious we remind him of mom if he did jake added hed be here oj was having a hard time holding back tears i just wish mom would come back then we wouldnt even need dad then it would be all right nat reached out a hand and put it over his youngest grandsons you do need your dad oj your mom really isnt coming back i know he said everybody always says that his voice was breaking i just wish she would though i dont think we do need dad grandpa isaac said i mean look right here wheres dad now who cares were taking care of each other quit crying oj im not crying leave him alone isaac jacob pushed at his older brother he can cry if he wants to im not crying you guys shh shh its okay nat smiled at the customers around them who were looking over at the disturbance lets try to keep restaurant voices all right oh and look here comes your dad now eleven oclock glitskys kitchen abraham they need you everybody needs me dad im sick to death of people needing me i dont have anything to give them just some time thats all they need some of your time i dont have any time dont you understand that every minute of my days and nights but this is your own blood you signed on for this not this way i didnt any way abraham they didnt ask to be here either not like this glitsky stopped pacing and lowered himself on to the ottoman which filled the centre of the small room his dad leaned against the refrigerator the two mens voices were low and harsh they didnt want to wake rita sleeping in the dim light of the christmas tree in the next room you know what went on in this trial today dad to me you have any idea of course nat touched his brow you think ive got swiss cheese up here but you know whats going to happen in the next couple of months here abraham you dont start paying attention youre going to lose these boys now which is more important im not going to lose them nat shook his head were you listening tonight theyre losing sight of you son they read about you in the newspaper they hear bad stories on the tube how do they know what to think they know glitsky said theyve got level heads they know me this abraham is malarkey they dont know anymore not for sure jacob tonight said you dont have the same rules as everybody else is that your message is that what you want to teach them he doesnt think that he said it you gonna say he didnt mean it it sounded like he meant it he needed some answer for his friends saying you broke the rules so thats what he came up with youre allowed to because youre a cop glitsky hung his heavy head after a minute he raised it again lord dad im tired whens this dooher madness going to end i keep thinking if i could just find more evidence something thats not ambiguous because otherwise hes gonna walk were going to lose nat pulled a kitchen chair up in front of his son so then he walks abraham its not the end of the world its one bad man thats all but it will look like me dont you see it will look like all the accusations against me are true which theyre not the people you work with they know that glitsky barked a short humorless laugh thats a beautiful theory dad it really is but the truth is this could be the end of my credibility first you wont lose your job abraham even if you do youll do something else but im a cop dad thats what i do its what i am nat shook his head before youre a cop youre a father after you stop being a cop youre a father your boys especially now they need a fatherthis is your main job the rest he shrugged nobody knows the rest there was a rush to winning no doubt about it wes was still at the bar at the yacht club pounding some more yuletide cheer mark had prodded him into coming along the public appearance would be important hed said especially for after the trial yesterday after wes had continued his onslaught against the prosecution taking apart emil balian on the stand the television news had picked up on him on the brilliant defense he was conducting this mornings chronicle headline had read key prosecution witness founders in dooher case the pundits were unanimously calling for a quick verdict of not guilty and wes was enjoying the celebrity suddenly the world seemed to understand that wes farrell was in fact the champion of the underdog and a tiger of a defense lawyer after five months of tedious trial preparation hours upon days spent studying transcripts and analyzing evidence in his dingy office or his dirty apartment after the breakup with sam and the doubts about his friend now at last he was getting some recognition for who he was for what he did the sweet sweet sweet nectar of success that had eluded him for so long it was nearly one oclock and the party was basically over the staff was folding up tables behind him the band was breaking down wes was alone at the bar just enjoying the living hell out of his sixth or seventh drink thinking that maybe it had all been worth it after all christina and mark had taken the limo home and hed need to get a cab later but that was all right he wasnt quite ready to call it quits yet mark his old pal had been right about coming down for this party mark and christina might have opened a few eyes when they walked in but it was he wes farrell whod been the sensation everybody had read the paper today watched the news over the past nights front page thank you yes it appeared he was winning winning winning kicking ass taking names jocko behind the bar had become his close personal friend imagine wes farrell the workingclass guy here all buddy buddy with the bartender at the st francis yacht club in his wallet farrell had at least half a dozen business cards of people he should call who might know some people whod need his services where had he been hiding they all wanted to know he felt a hand on his shoulder and the archbishop of san francisco was asking wes if they could have a nightcap together wes was finally after a lifetime of mediocrity moving into doohers circle god it was intoxicating and certainly one more drink with jim flaherty wouldnt hurt a little more of that oban single malt they touched their glasses together great party your excellency i hope you raised a million dollars three hundred and ten thousand in pledges he said a new record this is such a generous city flaherty savored his drink it looks like you had a pretty fair night yourself i saw you holding court in here most of the evening youre going to get mark off arent you it looks like it i dont want to jinx it but weve certainly got them on the run the archbishop sighed how did it even get to this farrell looked sideways at him its bad luck to make enemies in the police department glitskys a bad cop who just got promoted again a sidelong glance what was flaherty getting at he couldnt figure it exactly so he shrugged hes black its his turn then on a hunch the new farrell blurted it right out you having doubts about mark never its just the accusations you cant help but have them affect your view a little can you no i dont think so ive had a few myself doubts tell the truth you wonder how many other cases witnesses show up out of the woodwork who say they saw something or heard it or smelled it what is it power of suggestion i think it must be the archbishop sipped his drink your excellency farrell said quietly youre not getting cold feet about testifying for us are you no of course not good because i dont know if were going to need you but if we do i wouldnt like to open the door and then have it close on us no i understand they both stared out through the rainpocked glass faintly they heard the wind as it pushed the cypresses nearly to the ground lousy night out there isnt it flaherty said then you know when this is over and mark is found not guilty we ought to try to make this up to him somehow first he loses his wife which is horrible enough then the burden of this trial hes been through the wringer i dont know how hes surviving well marks a survivor plus hes in love again i think farrell sipped his drink and nodded you noticed he said laconically though i suppose if youve got to be in love with somebody shed do although the timing could be better couldnt it farrell agreed that it could sitting together at the bar each harboring his thoughts the two men sipped at their drinks the ships bell behind the bar chimed once and jocko said it was last call no im good farrell said and asked the bartender to call him a taxi bill carrera wasnt sleeping his daughters visit the previous weekend had brought to a head the fear that he had been living with since finding out shed joined up with doohers defense team so now downstairs looking out over the few remaining lights that remained on at this hour in ojai he sat in his deep wingchair the one he called his thinking chair in spite of the fact that bill was the kind of man who named things his bronco was trigger for example his tennis racket was slam he was not without intelligence or insight and he was worried sick about christina the light came on in the hallway and after a minute he felt a hand on his shoulder irene saying you should have just got me up how long have you been down here she came around and sat on the arm of the chair fortyfive minutes an hour he was suddenly aware of the ticking of the grandfather clock and then his wife said she wouldnt be with him if she thought he did it bill im not worried about whether she thinks he did it im worried about if he did it i think we have to trust her judgment on this like with brian with joe avery come on bill dont start that they were different but not so very different were they i wonder if weve failed her somehow that she cant he stopped its not her she hasnt met the right man and mark doohers the right man god help us bill we havent even met him but hes on trial for killing his wife hon im sorry they dont usually get to there unless usually he took a breath and let it out jesus so what are we supposed to do irene draped her arm over his head stand by her i think dont you hope she finally gets happy hope hes found not guilty but thats just the law how do you ever really believe it after all this i dont know if you do but if hes found not guilty weve got to support them dont you think that i dont know i dont understand why her life changed how it got so complicated and sad it just breaks my heart mine too she sighed which is why weve got to be with her bill if its right if finally this mark dooher can make her happy but he was shaking his head people dont make other people happy people make themselves happy thats what im worried about she tugged at his hair gently you make me happy no you were happy when i met you and we get along were lucky christinas got to decide that its up to her shes still thinking its all centered one way or another around some man and its not it is for me irene said it really is maybe im not a highly evolved life form but i believe choice of mate is relatively important in the scheme of things and thats why im going to embrace them if it all works out and do everything i can to see that it does and you should too chapter fourty on wednesday afternoon amanda jenkins rested for the prosecution having never really recovered or established her momentum she had called all of her witnesses the maintenance man at the san francisco golf club had shown the jury the cyclone fence by the end of the parking lot it had a large hole in it jenkins had trotted out paul thieu and the taraval cops and the nextdoor neighbor frances matsun who it turned out had never gotten along with mark dooher very well and who hadnt actually seen him screw the lightbulb from on to off at all on crossexamination farrell clarified it dooher had reached up fooled with it done something it looked like he might have unscrewed it jenkins tried not to show it but it was clear to glitsky that shed been beaten down by the relentless barrages that farrell had launched against her witnesses she was still trying to believe that the blood alone would be enough to convict and further that emil balian had convincingly put dooher near the scene it was a brave front jenkins pretending that the jury would come back with a guilty verdict especially if they got to call diane price on rebuttal if they could get her to paint the picture of a very different mark dooher glitsky admired her for not crumbling in public but she was getting killed and everybody knew it certainly the newspapers and television had reached their verdict this morning driving to work glitsky had heard his name on the radio while hed been channelsurfing and had forced himself to listen to his friendly local conservative radio talk jock who opined that the decision to bring mark dooher to trial at all on such shoddy evidence was an example of affirmative actions failure in the halls of the city glitsky a black and jenkins a woman had been promoted beyond their levels of competency and lets hear from you callers out there who think we ought to put an end to this nonsense and get back to hiring and promoting on merit alone the current had shifted nevertheless the morning began with a setback for the defense as soon as jenkins had finished her caseinchief wes farrell had filed a motion for directed verdict of acquittal which asked the judge to find that no reasonable juror could convict on the evidence presented by the prosecution this motion was routinely filed by the defense when the prosecution rested and was almost never granted if the judge did rule favorably on this motion he would dismiss the case and mark dooher would be free thomasino opened by denying the motion and jenkins whispered to glitsky the blood he nodded noncommittal farrell having elected to give an opening statement in rebuttal to jenkinss at the outset of the trial stood and told thomasino that the defense was ready to present its case and would like to start by calling the defendant mark dooher this was a calculated gamble but it showed the level of farrells confidence the defendant had the absolute right not to testify but a sympathetic demeanor and good story could go a long way toward humanizing a defendant and this was to the good also after doohers outburst on the first day hed worn a mask careful to show no emotion quietly paying attention to every word and nuance he would occasionally confer with his two attorneys when some point struck him he was interested and unbowed though not yet a person to the jurors dooher leaned over to christina and whispered wish me luck then placed a fraternal hand on farrells shoulder gave it a squeeze and walked around his attorney he approached the witness box in long strides to all appearances he was confident even eager finally to tell his story farrell came forward to the center of the courtroom and walked him through the familiar territory of the early afternoon the hors doeuvre the champagne and so on and after sheila said she was going upstairs for a nap what did you do then dooher looked toward the jury for a minute he didnt want to include them too often it would appear insincere as though he was playing for them but he knew it wouldnt hurt for it was only natural to acknowledge their presence i moped around the house for a while then i decided to go to the driving range so i went out to my car just a minute mark you went out to your car but before that at the back door do you remember what you did i dont remember anything specific no and yet weve heard mrs matsun testify that you stopped and did something with the electric light above the door do you remember doing that no there may have been cobwebs up in the light sometimes they gather there i might have cleared them away but i dont specifically remember doing anything a quick look towards the jury explaining i may have this of course had been rehearsed dooher wasnt denying anything that frances matsun had testified to he was being reasonable telling his own truth without attacking hers it played as they knew it would very well mark your house has an alarm system doesnt it a wry shake of the head yes it does did you turn it on when you left the house on this day these carefully prepared questions would defuse jenkinss contentions before she could even make them no i just walked out of the house didnt you lock the door behind you either no was this unusual why didnt you do either of these things dooher sat back a minute phrasing his response i guess the real reason is that neither of them even occurred to me why not well first it was light out i wasnt thinking about somebody breaking in wed never been broken into before but you didnt lock the door i go out to work every morning and dont lock the door behind me it wasnt like i was leaving an empty house sheila was there it never occurred to me she couldnt take care of herself we live in a safe neighborhood or i thought we did when i do check the locks its usually before turning in at night you know like people do what about the house alarm sheila doesnt didnt like the alarm why not because when we first got it installed three or four times she opened a door to walk outside to take out the garbage or whatever and it went off and she had some trouble overriding the turnoff switch or something anyway it was a hassle for her we didnt tend to use it unless we went on vacation or away for the weekend something like that i wasnt about to turn it on when she was just taking a nap upstairs if she woke up and went out for some reason and it went off shed have killed me then to the driving range where dooher bought two buckets of balls yes he remembered specifically which mat hed hit from he wore his most selfdeprecating expression im afraid that before all this an inclusive gesture indicating the world they were in i used to be vain about my about how i looked i didnt like to appear to flounder and this included my golf game i didnt want people anybody to see me when i was working on my swing maybe overcorrecting to find out what i was doing wrong your honor jenkins was showing her impatience this is all very fascinating but it doesnt answer the question of what mat he hit his golf balls from thomasino leaned over the bench just answer the question mr dooher it was the last mat at the very end to the left as you go out the door of the clubhouse farrell kept up the rhythm and you stayed hitting golf balls off that mat until when i think around ninethirty twenty to ten did you leave the mat at any time i went to the bathroom after the first bucket bought a coke in the office then went back out and finished hitting all right farrell led them all again through the gruesome discovery the emergency call waiting for the police it all came out compelling and believable as he told it now farrell shifted gears mark lieutenant glitsky has testified that i was present at your house when he interrogated you on the night of the murder why was i there i called you and you came did i come as your lawyer because you wanted to protect yourself from police questions because you knew youd be suspected of murdering your wife no none of that i called you as a friend why did you call me who happens to be your lawyer out of all of your friends i have known you for thirtyfive years you are my best friend thats why i called you farrell glanced at the jury then back to his client on another topic during your last visit to dr peter harriss office did you remove a vial of blood and take it with you dooher still obviously amazed at the ridiculousness of the question shook his head looked directly at the jury for the last time no no i did not and finally once and for all and remembering that you are testifying under solemn oath would you answer this question for the jury did you kill your wife this time there were no histrionics he sat forward took a breath let it out and answered in an even clear voice that rang through the courtroom as god is my judge i did not farrell nodded said thank you and turned on his heel your witness before jenkins got to the blowbyblow crossexamination of doohers movements throughout the afternoon and evening of june th she wanted to clear up one specific point she moved to the exhibit table and pulled two postersize exhibits that shed introduced as evidence during the questioning of the driving ranges maintenance man the first was a blowup photograph of the hitting area taken from out in the middle of the range and the other was a schematic rendering of the placement of the mats she put both of these next to one another on an easel next to the witness chair as you can see she said these exhibits represent the layout of the driving range just so were clear on where you hit your balls from would you please point out to the jury the mat that you stood on cooperative and relaxed dooher did so the very last mat youre sure of that i am yes this is the mat nearest the hole in the fence leading to the parking lot is it not i dont know about that id never noticed the hole in the fence although if your witness says so i guess its there jenkins stood unmoving in the center of the courtroom after twenty or thirty seconds the judge spoke to her ms jenkins she blinked and brought her attention back from where it had been her crossexamination lasted three and a half hours she got nothing what was that all about christina sat at the table in their anteroom eating from a pile of carrot and celery sticks on a paper plate while the men busied themselves with salami on sourdough rolls the exact mat you hit the balls from dooher shook his head i dont have any idea farrell was chewing staring out the window i dont like it shes got something else shes not showing us you mean new evidence christina couldnt envision it how could that be wes weve seen her discovery we know all her witnesses shed have had to tell us before this well that would be in the rules thats true but dooher was looking carefully at his friend anyway wes what could she have i dont know but it worries me its my job to worry dont worry dooher said i was there at the last mat hitting golf balls and thats all there is to it farrell nodded again lets hope so glitsky thought that richie browne believed doohers story in all its detail he was the golf pro at the range and could have been sent from central casting a wellformed man midthirties in slacks and a polo shirt he had gotten to know dooher in the three or four months prior to the murder when the defendant started frequenting his range instead of the olympics sure he was there the whole time youre sure im positive farrell turned and faced the jury including them in his certainty asking back over his shoulder were you aware of him the whole night browne took his time i remember him coming in we talked about some new clubs he was considering hed been working with some new graphite shafts on his woods and thought he was going to go with them buy a whole set so you know i was interested were talking a thousand bucks here so i was paying attention and was that when he came in yeah and did he seem anxious nervous keyedup objection calls for a conclusion glitsky noticed that jenkins was forward on the last three inches of her chair elbows on the table fingers templed at her lips he didnt know what had galvanized her at this late date when to him the conclusion was all but foreordained but something clearly had thomasino overruled her though farrell repeated the question and brown told him that dooher had been relaxed and genial he talked about golf clubs he didnt act any way and then when he went out to hit some balls when did you see him next i dont know exactly fifteen twenty minutes later i walked out to the door with a lady customer and saw him down at the end head down lost in it whack whack whack now mr browne mr dooher has testified that he came in and got a coke about halfway through your honor please jenkins shot up from her seat leading the witness thomasino was paying close attention to glitskys surprise he didnt rule right away spending a moment mulling then simply overruled farrell couldnt lose he kept right at it when did you see mr dooher next again i didnt notice the exact time he came in for a coke jenkins slapped her hand on her table in frustration maybe after his first bucket your honor my god jenkins up again farrell spread his palms i didnt ask anything your honor the witness has volunteered this information its speculation move to strike thomasino raised a calming hand yes it is yes it is he told the jury to disregard this last information and glitsky thought they could collectively do that about as easily as they could levitate on cue but the moment passed and farrell was finishing up and did you see mr dooher at any other time during the course of this evening sure when he left when hed finished hitting two buckets of golf balls objection speculation thomasino sustained her again but farrell didnt care he had gotten in nearly everything he wanted and was finishing up did you see mr dooher when he left yes and how was he acting then like he usually did normal he came in we talked a couple of minutes about his game he told me a joke he told you a joke yeah we talked a couple of minutes and then he asked me how you get a dog to stop humping your leg thats how i remember i saw him when he was leaving i was laughing you were laughing together it was a good joke browne paused looked over to the jury gave them the punchline you give him a blow job the courtroom went silent for a second then erupted into nervous laughter thomasino hit his gavel a few times order was restored and farrell gave richie browne to amanda jenkins for crossexamination mr browne im particularly interested in this coke you saw mr dooher get in the middle of his round of hitting golf balls in your interview with lieutenant glitsky regarding this night did you mention this trip to the coke machine i guess not i didnt remember at the time it came back to me later that it was that night and do you remember it now yes so to be absolutely clear mr browne is it your testimony now under oath that mr dooher bought a coke in the middle of hitting his round of golf balls that night browne squirmed i think he came and got a coke you think mr dooher came and got a coke youre not sure im pretty sure but not certain browne was physically reacting to the questioning sitting back in the witness chair arms crossed over his chest no not certain but i think it was that night mr browne youre not certain you saw the defendant come in midway through the evening and get a coke is that your testimony farrell took the opening asked and answered your honor thomasino agreed with him it was beginning to move quickly with farrells defense witnesses no sooner had richie browne passed out into the gallery area than farrell called marcela mendoza a fortytwoyearold former supervisor of medical technicians at st marys hospital after establishing her credentials and job duties during the twelve years shed worked at the hospital farrell asked ms mendoza working in the blood unit of the laboratory at the hospital did you ever experience a situation where blood that had been taken from a patient for tests got lost somehow yes commonly wait please before you answer that how many blood tests did you do well we did i guess six or seven hundred blood tests every week or so a hundred a day roughly thats about right and how often did a sample of blood get mislabeled or misplaced or lost on average in the twelve years you worked at the hospital objection your honor the defendants doctor didnt work at this hospital glitsky had the impression that farrell had been hoping that jenkins would say this very thing well your honor thats exactly the point we intend to show that the blood could have come from any one of a number of places thomasinos brows went up and down overruled proceed the question clearly made ms mendoza uncomfortable it wasnt a piece of information the public would feel very good about in fact while shed been working at the hospital she would not have answered any questions about lost blood both because she would not have wanted to and because she would have been ordered not to but farrells investigator had found her in august and convinced her that her expertise in this area could save the life of an innocent man id say wed lose one or two a week a week farrell who of course already knew the answer feigned shock one or two a week sometimes more sometimes less and this lost blood where does it go mendoza allowed herself a small smile if we knew that mr farrell it wouldnt be lost now would it all agreement farrell stepped closer to her now in your own personal experience ms mendoza did you ever have a lab technician drop a vial of blood and not report it yes and why was that they didnt want to get in trouble so they said they just never got the blood to do the tests on in the first place and are you personally familiar with a case like this yes could you explain it a little more fully one of my people did exactly what i just described and i didnt report it which was why i was let go this wasnt a point to press and farrell moved along ms mendoza about how many blood labs are there in the city big labs theres about eight or nine smaller labs doctors offices mobile units blood banks there are probably hundreds i dont know exactly certainly more than fifty yes and in your experience was there ever a problem with lost blood at any of these facilities in transit to and from doctors offices something like that ms mendoza didnt like it but she knew what she knewmost of the blood theres never a problem she said i realize that but sometimes of course sure the blood testimony continued to build relentlessly doubly damning glitsky thought because there really wasnt much amanda jenkins could do on crossexamination doctors and technicians from county general st lukes the masonic blood bank and several other locations all came to the stand and testified for ten minutes each all essentially saying the same thing blood got lost all the time it was possible maybe not probable and perhaps difficult but certainly possible for a person to pick up a vial of blood and walk out of a facility with it the worst moment from glitskys perspective came at the very end of the day when farrell called a sergeant eames from park station it was always unnerving when the defense called a lawenforcement person to testify for the past six years eames had worked on cases involving voodoo santeria and satanic worship all of which used blood from a variety of sources in their rituals eames was of the opinion that any cop in the city who wanted to get his hands on samples of human blood would have to look no further than the evidence locker of any district station on a typical saturday night chapter fourty one jim flaherty was alone in his spartan bedroom he sat at his desk intending to put the finishing touches on his yearly christmas sermon and then on this blessedly unbooked thursday evening he was going to get to sleep before midnight but first hed tune into the ten oclock news where he was heartened by the analysis of the events of the trial wes farrells parade of defense witnesses had demolished any lingering doubt about its outcome mark wasnt going to get convicted the prosecutions case was in rags flaherty told himself that hed never really entertained the notion that mark had killed sheila but the blood had come close to shaking his faith now though it looked as though farrell had put his finger into that potential hole in the dike and what mark had contended all along was true the blood could have come from anywhere and the missing blood from his own doctors office had been a terrible coincidence it was critical that flaherty be clear on this score farrell had asked him to be ready to testify about marks character beginning as early as tomorrow he opened his desk drawer and pulled out the sheaf of looseleaf papers and there was a knock on his door he loathed interruptions in his bedroom it was the only truly private place he had the only personal time he ever got but everyone on the staff here at the rectory knew that and protected his privacy so this must be important father herman his major domo stood in the hallway in the atease position and behind him hands clasped in front of him was eugene gorman pastor of st emydius seeing him flahertys stomach tightened and he put his hand over it herman was trying to explain that he had asked father gorman to wait downstairs and hed send the archbishop down to see him in the study but thats all right father this is an old friend you want to come in here gene i dont have anything but hard chairs to sit on when the door closed behind them flaherty walked across the room and sat on his desk gorman stood awkwardly and finally looking behind him sat down on the archbishops bed im sorry to bother you i wouldnt have if this werent an emergency its all right flaherty began were but gorman cut him off i have been examining my conscience now for months and i dont know what else to do i need for you to hear my confession flaherty cocked his head at the man across from him he seemed to have aged five years since theyd last spoken in may or june the light was dim a crucifix the only ornament in the room hung over flahertys bed gormans eyes were tortured pleading the archbishop nodded once boosted himself off the desk and crossed to the bed he put his hand behind gormans head and stood like that for a moment then he went over to his dresser and picked up his stole the sacramental cloth draping it over his shoulders he returned to the bed and sat down next to gorman making the sign of the cross gorman began bless me father for i have sinned i am living in a state of mortal sin in despair god will give you grace gene he wont abandon you but gorman didnt seem to hear he continued i am tormented by guilty knowledge and bound by the seal of the confessional its destroying me jim i cant function flaherty began to offer his counsel to gorman this was one of the heaviest burdens of the priesthood penitents had terrible secrets they needed to confess gorman couldnt hold it in any longer this was murder jim literal murder entering his apartment after another night on the town wes farrell was confronting another of the deadly sins pride the headiness of his success had not obliterated his doubts about his friend nor any moral qualms concerning his strategies at the trial but he would be damned if he would let any of that nonsense stand in his way now winning was what mattered winners had to learn to ignore those small voices of discontent the traces of timidity that hampered lesser souls that were indeed the hallmark of lesser souls wasnt it de gaulle who had said that to govern was to choose well wes thought that the sentiment translated well into his own situation he would no longer consider other paths he might have taken could have taken that were perhaps more righteous and less ambiguous no he had chosen to believe mark dooher chosen to defend him and those decisions had elevated him in his community and that was what mattered after a certain point you just didnt have to think about certain things anymore he had been reading about his exploits every day hearing himself described in the various media as brilliant dogged ruthless even charismatic he wasnt about to give any of this up by worrying too much about the vehicle that had propelled him to here it was faustian perhaps but hed often said hed sell his soul for this chance it might have disappointed him when hed been younger and more idealistic but right now all he could think was ill take it ill take it ill take it and while were at it give me more the time was he was entering his apartment filled with these thoughts a dinner at johns grill had turned into a testimonial from some of the other diners who had recognized him he was resolving to change his residence in the next couple of months get himself another house and a house cleaner to go with it a new car fix up the office as befitted his station the telephone was ringing and he crossed the room petting an ecstatic bart and picked it up wes this is jim flaherty the usually husky confident tone was missing your excellency how are you well im not too good to tell you the truth a long breath i might as well come right out with it wes im afraid ive decided im not going to be able to testify for you for mark about his character farrell pulled out a kitchen chair and sat heavily upon it he had been expecting to call the archbishop tomorrow and wrap up his defense but just two nights ago i realize that i know but something has come up what another pause im not at liberty to say archbishop father wait a minute you cant just excuse me wes this is a very difficult decision one of the hardest of my life but ive made it and thats all there is to say about it im sorry the line went dead farrell lifted the receiver away from his ear and looked at it as though it were alive youre sorry he put the phone down and stared at his wavy image reflected in the kitchen window flaherty sat alone again on the side of his hard bed hed wrestled with it for an hour or more trying to find some other interpretation for father gormans words he grudgingly admired gormans decision the way hed come to him for confession the strategy was flaherty thought positively jesuitical gorman never said doohers name never even implied whether it was a male or a female who had committed the murder or for that matter whether it was one of his parishioners he didnt technically break the seal of the confession but there was small doubt about what he was saying and none at all about whether it was true chapter fourty two a war had broken out in thomasinos chambers the lead attorneys the judge and glitsky had originally gathered to discuss logistics farrell had decided that after all he wasnt going to call character witnesses he didnt need them the defense was going to rest and then jenkins had dropped her bomb saying she would like to call a rebuttal witness then someone who wasnt on her original witness list a man who had been at the driving range during the time dooher claimed he was and who hadnt seen him glitsky was sitting in his chair off to the side and farrell looking again more as hed appeared earlier in the trial the king of insomnia was screaming shes known about this witness all along your honor if id known about this witness or his testimony i never would have asked mr dooher to take the stand and this witness is nowhere on any of her lists this is an incredible unbelievable egregious breach of professional ethics oh get a grip wes jenkins retorted its nothing of the sort its prop one fifteen she was referring to california proposition which eased the prosecutions obligations regarding discovery to the defense the law changes every once in a while wes youll be surprised to hear maybe you ought to try to keep up on it i keep up on the goddamn law as well as a goddamn rookie homicide prosecutor on her first case that shes blown all to hell because she doesnt know thomasino atypically wearing his robes in chambers had heard all he would tolerate glitsky was surprised hed let it go as far as it had and now he was slapping his hand down on his desk hard all right all right enough i said enough both attorneys sat breathing hard in front of the judges desk thomasino not jolly on his best day was a study in controlled rage his eyebrows pulled together until they met a muscle in his jaw vibrating under the pressure of holding it so tight gradually he gathered himself the face relaxed by small degrees this is a matter of law he said almost whispering not a matter of personality although ms jenkins i must admit to some discomfort about it surely you knew about this witness before this and if that were the case the name should have appeared in discovery the name they were discussing was michael ross in the early days of the investigation glitsky had gone out to the san francisco golf club and reviewed the creditcard receipts for the night of june th michael ross had paid for a bucket of golf balls by visa card and the transaction had been run up at pm glitsky had brought the receipt in to jenkins and theyd had a discussion about it in her cramped and airless office the moment was etched clearly in glitskys memory jenkinss eyes took on a faraway look as shed sat at her desk fingering the receipt he had figuratively seen the light bulb go on over her head why dont you go out and interview this fellow ross by yourself abe you dont even need to bring your tape recorder its probably nothing anyway and dont write it up until weve had a chance to talk about what hes told you glitsky had been a cop long enough he didnt need a road map jenkins wasnt suggesting anything illegal it could be said that she was trying to save abe the trouble of writing up lots of meaningless paperwork it wasnt even procedurally suspect he interviewed lots of people in the course of any investigation and often these interviews were casual limited irrelevant to the case there was no need to tape anything of course in this case glitsky knew what jenkins was really telling him she wanted to limit what she had to give to farrell as discovery she knew early on that their evidence case was weak and she was going to sandbag the defense if she got the chance which was what she was doing in thomasinos chambers early on this friday morning perry mason notwithstanding real trials were not supposed to deal in surprises the discovery process where the prosecution must turn over to the defense all evidence it possesses relating to the case is supposed to guarantee that the defense sees all the cards before the game its how those cards are played that determines the winner jenkins was supposed to provide farrell with a list of the prospective witnesses she might call during the course of the trial she didnt have to call every witness on the list or any of them but in theory she couldnt call anyone who wasnt on the list and michael ross hadnt been back in the war zone the soldiers continued to scuffle jenkins was holding up the faded yellow tissue with michael rosss name and visa number on it and pointing out that she had xeroxed it both sides and it had been turned over to wes farrell when hed requested discovery documents is that true mr farrell do you have a copy of this document so what your honor whats the document mean i even ask her back last june july sometime and she says it means what it means so i look on her witness list theres no michael ross shes not allowed to call him am i right im calling him in rebuttal farrell brought his own hand down on the edge of the armchair you knew all along you were going to call him dont give me that crap mr farrell thomasino too was heating up if i hear any more profanity out of you in this chambers or out of your witnesses or defendants in the courtroom im going to hold you in contempt were not streetfighting here and were not gangsta rappers and if you say so much as darn in my presence youd better have an unassailable reason for doing so farrell sat back in his chair sorry your honor i mean no disrespect well intention or no it is disrespectful and im not going to have it thomasinos eyes strafed the room came to rest on jenkins no one it seemed was going to get off easy here now as to this witness ms jenkins do you care to explain to me how you saw fit to include this creditcard slip in your discovery documents and yet at the same time omit the mans name from your witness list your honor hes a rebuttal witness i didnt know i was going to call him until mr dooher testified glitsky was kind of enjoying seeing farrell sputter sitting forward now seeking nonprofanities i believe that is not the truth your honor he finally said when did she interview this witness lieutenant glitsky interviewed him finally in on the action glitsky took the chance to goad farrell further about two weeks after your client killed his wife give or take but the attorney ignored the challenge two weeks he turned to the judge your honor two weeks she knew she was going to call him where were glitskys notes on the interview the transcription anything abe was glad to see jenkins cover for him for a change i didnt ask for a tape it was a preliminary interview ms jenkins thomasino said im not liking what im hearing here it sound to me like you deliberately tried to circumvent the discovery process damn darn straight she did the judge pointed a finger across the room and you lieutenant i find this hard to believe of you glitsky shrugged i just build em your honor i dont fly em judge jenkins wasnt having it how could i have put this man on my witness list he was no part of my case in chief what was he going to say that he didnt see mark dooher at the driving range what am i supposed to do provide a list of everybody who didnt see mark dooher at the driving range thats pretty much the whole city isnt it and in fact the prosecution rested its case against mr dooher without using mr ross if mr farrell here hadnt opened this whole can of worms by having his client testify we wouldnt be having this discussion right now it would never have come up all right all right again the warning hand palm up im going to let him testify farrell went ballistic your honor please but finally thomasinos fuse flared mr farrell if you please were going outside now into the courtroom and mr ross is going to testify thats my ruling and i dont want to hear another word about it michael ross was a twentyoneyearold student at san francisco state university clean cut well spoken well dressed from glitskys perspective he was the last hope if in fact it wasnt already way too late but jenkins no denying it had played this card masterfully mr ross she began on the evening of june th of this year would you tell us what you did between the hours of seven and ten pm ross had a fresh and open face and he sat forward in his chair enthusiastic yet serious well my wife and i put our daughter to bed he looked over at the jury she was just a year old and we put her down to bed at seven oclock then we had dinner together we barbecued hamburgers it was a really nice night and after dinner about eight i asked my wife if shed mind if i went and drove a few golf balls he seemed to think this might need some more explanation but hesitated then continued anyway i went to the san francisco golf clubs range and hit a large bucket of balls and then came back home and what time did you leave the range ross thought a moment i was home by ninethirty so i must have left at about ten after nine quarter after something like that jenkins produced the creditcard slip showing that ross had picked up his bucket of balls at and entered it into evidence as peoples exhibit number fourteen so mr ross while you were out in the drivingrange area did you go to a particular station to hit your bucket of balls i did and where was that i turned left out of the clubhouse and walked down to the third mat from the end the third from the end on the left side as you left the clubhouse yes again show and tell and jenkins produced the posters shed first used with the maintenance man and then during her crossexamination of mark dooher she mounted them on to the easel next to the witness box side by side could you point out to the jury mr ross just where you stood according to both of these visual aids he did and how far then were you from the first mat the one mr dooher has testified he used on this night ross stole a neutral glance at dooher i dont know exactly twenty or thirty feet id guess so mr ross to reiterate you went out with your bucket of golf balls at around eight twentyfive and you stood hitting shots from a mat and a tee three spots from the end on the left side finishing up at around ninefifteen is this an accurate rendition of the facts youve presented yes all right then during this period of time nearly an hour while you stood two mats away from the last mat on the left did you at any time see the defendant mark dooher at the last tee no i didnt see anybody there was nobody at the last tee a buzz coursed through the room glitsky noticed dooher leaning over whispering to christina farrell was sitting face set eyes forward his hands crossed on the desk in front of him jenkins pressed on did you see mr dooher anywhere there at the range at any time that night ross again spent a minute studying the defendant then said hed never seen him before in his life mr ross was there anybody on the second tee in other words on the tee next to you between you and the last tee no i was the last one down that way there was no one either at the first or second tee the whole time you were there hitting golf balls between eighttwentyfive and ninefifteen pm on june th of this year thats right nobody farrell tried to smile to convey the impression that this wasnt a problem glitsky didnt think he succeeded he looked a couple of days older than god mr ross he began youve testified that you hit a large bucket of golf balls on the night in question is that correct yes and how many balls are in a large bucket the witness seemed to be trying to visualize a bucket he smiled helpful id say eighty or a hundred a hundred golf balls and is it true that you were at your mat hitting these hundred golf balls for fifty minutes eight twentyfive until about ninefifteen ross did the math and nodded thats about right would that be about one ball every thirty seconds about yes farrell glanced over at the jury including them perhaps some members of the jury arent familiar with how things work at a driving range would you please describe in detail your actions to hit each golf ball this seemed to strike ross as mildly amusing but he remained cooperative and friendly i lean over pick a ball out of the bucket then either put it on a tee they have a builtup rubber tee you can use or lay it on the mat then i line up my shot check my position take a breath relax swing farrell seemed happy with this and then you do this again is that right do you do this every time you hit a ball pretty close id say yeah and would you say hitting a golf ball is a fairly intense activity does it take a lot of concentration ross laughed its like nothing else youre saying it is intense then arent you yes would you say you get yourself into almost a trancelike state objection the witness is not an expert in trances your honor jenkins was sustained but farrell was doing a good job drawing the picture if ross had hit a ball every thirty seconds going through his routine on each ball and he was concentrating deeply on every swing is it possible mr ross that someone could have been hitting balls a couple of mats away and concentrating as you were you might not have noticed no its not like youre not aware of whats around you its not then you recall how many other people were at the driving range that night dont you ross shrugged discomfort beginning to show it was a quiet night tuesday fewer than average were there twenty people there i dont know exactly something like that were they all men i dont know could you give us a rough breakdown as to the races of the people hitting golf balls blacks whites hispanics no was there someone on the other side of you behind you back toward the office a couple of mats over yes was this person a man or a woman a man i think you think how tall was he ross was shaking his head come on give me a break i dont know farrell came closer to him i cant give you a break mr ross hitting one golf ball every thirty seconds is it your testimony that you are positive without a doubt that for the entire time you hit your large bucket of golf balls there was no one on the last mat at the end ross didnt crack he knew what he knew thats right farrell went and got a drink of water giving himself time to think of his next line of questioning by the time he was back at the witness box he had it with the bonus of a chance to put in a dig at jenkins mr ross since we have just this morning learned that you would be a witness in this trial you have not spoken to anyone from the defense before have you no have you spoken before to anyone from the prosecution or the police yes did you give a sworn statement to them about the testimony youre giving today that they asked you to sign no this was about as far as farrell could go in attacking rosss credibility he had to go fishing again what do you study at college mr ross a welcome change for ross he brightened right up im a criminal justice major this surprised farrell but it didnt make him unhappy glitsky could almost see the bells ringing inside his head indeed by any chance do you plan to pursue a career in law enforcement yes i do id like to go to the san francisco police academy a pause farrell formulating it have you been following this case in the newspapers mr ross on television sure you know then dont you that your testimony is helpful to the prosecution here yes this was the best farrell was going to do he decided to quit while he was ahead thank you no further questions chapter fourty three diane price was less nervous than sam duncan which was why she was driving in the six months since shed first come to sam with her story her life had changed at first diane had been opposed to any public admission of what had happened between her and mark dooher it had been her own personal tragedy tawdry and shameful shed testify at the trial if she got the chance but until then shed keep a low profile live her normal life with her husband and kids she did not factor in the insatiable maw of the media the hotbutton buzz of her story the fact that she was attractive articulate and intelligent sam duncan asked her permission to go to thensergeant abe glitsky and tell him about the rape surely it was relevant to the murder charge dooher was facing hed agreed and called in amanda jenkins and within two weeks diane had been identified and the notoriety had begun the story in the chronicle had been followed by an interview in people mother jones put her on the cover and devoted half of their september issue to life after rape diane had been contacted by a movie producer and signed an option agreement on her life story shed been invited to speak at least a dozen times at first to small groups around san francisco but later to larger gatherings a now convention in atlanta a gender issues conference in chicago a sexual harassment seminar in phoenix and it was ironic she thought that all of this public discourse had been what had finally healed her private heart her husband don stood by her through the fifteen minutes of her fame and when the first flush had died down they were left with their home and their family and the bitterness that shed carried all the years that had finally prodded her to go to sam duncans rape crisis center in the first place had been replaced by a calm sense of empowerment she didnt need to talk about it anymore shed learned from the experience albeit the hard slow way but shed come to the belief that this was the only way people really benefited from pain or loss or hardship anyway first by acknowledging it and then over time to see how it had changed you and fit those changes into how you lived she became a regular volunteer at the rape crisis counselling center working alongside sam duncan helping other women perhaps keeping them from going where shed been it was fulfilling immediate therapeutic so today what she thought would be her one last public appearance didnt worry her amanda jenkins had called her early in the week and said she expected that wes farrell would begin calling his own character witnesses on thursday or friday and she would then be free to call diane was she ready and then last night thursday amanda had said she ought to come down to the hall of justice by noon the prosecution would probably be calling her to testify about mark doohers character in the early afternoon as it transpired of course farrell had decided not to use his character witnesses but there was no way for amanda jenkins to have gotten that word out to diane price before she left to come down by the time the attorneys had come back to the courtroom from their extended meeting about michael ross in thomasinos chambers sam and diane were on their way so she pulled into the allday lot no in out and the two women sat for a moment in the car a fierce cold and blustery wind whipped trash up the lane of the parking lot a milk carton bounced along and out of their sight like a tumbleweed you ready to go out into this sam asked her she had her hand on the doorhandle but didnt look as though she was prepared just yet huddled into an oversized down jacket sam looked tiny and vulnerable i think the real storms going to be inside diane said are you all right sure sam said too quickly youre nervous a nod dont worry i wont blow this i say what happened and they try to shake my story which they wont be able to do and then we leave and this whole thing is behind us and they put that bastard in jail where he belongs she looked over at sam still inside herself thats not it is it sam shook her head wes farrell diane had learned all about sam and wes another nod im going to hate him after he questions you i know i am thats all and i dont want to she blew out a quick breath its just the end of something the final end ill be gentle with him diane said then patted the other womans leg lets go okay they crossed bryant leaning into the wind and came to the steps of the hall where sam held open one of the huge glass double doors and they entered into the cavernous open lobby or not directly first a makeshift plywood wall funnelled visitors toward a doorframe to the side of which sat a desk manned by two uniformed policemen a couple of reporters had stationed themselves outside the courtrooms to be ready for just such arrivals and they attached themselves to the two women asking the usual inane questions as they fell into the desultory queue for the security check diane was wearing designer jeans a couple of layers of sweaters and a heavy raincoat a large leather carrybag slung over her shoulder moving forward with the line of people entering the hall trying to respond politely to the reporters and stay close to sam it didnt register to diane that the doorframe was the buildings metal detector until she was walking through it setting off the beeper oh shit she said as the policemen stopped them took the carryall from her and put it on the desk and told her to step back through the entrance again no wait reaching for the carryall trying to take it back from him well just go back and put this in the car ill just but it was too late the policeman alerted by the weight of it had already pulled it open and was reaching inside everybody else hold it step back what sam asked you the cop had diane by the arm and was moving her away to the side get over there put your hands against that wall do it now then to his partner gesturing to the line forming behind the doorframe keep them back get on the phone and get a female officer down here what is this sam demanded whats going on diane started to turn around i know but the officer yelled at her again against that wall dont you move then he lifted his hand out of the oversized purse he was holding a small chromeplated handgun at about the same moment back in their office across the street the mood had shifted from relief at getting a piece of michael ross to fury at wes farrells decision to abandon his character witnesses dooher was fuming what do you mean youre resting weve got to call jim flaherty farrell was calmly shaking his head were not calling flaherty were not doing character we have to do character wes character wins it for us weve already won it we dont need it farrell was giving it a more confident spin than he felt after the nearly disastrous testimony of michael ross which in spite of his cross remained a serious evidentiary chip for the prosecution wes wasnt going to tell mark that the archbishop had withdrawn as a witness unless he absolutely had to the momentum had shifted and farrells last and best hope was that he could save what hed already accomplished he still had a good chance to get mark an acquittal but he was holding all this close christina was standing by the doorway i thought you could never get enough youve said that a hundred times and now weve just had a hit from this ross character i think we do need more wes well i want to thank you both for your input but unless youre going to fire me mark this is my trial and im done weve won it ive got a closing argument thats irrefutable christina im sorry you dont get to crossexamine diane price im sorry we didnt use you and i believe you would take her apart but i dont want any hint of bad character about mark not now even if we can refute its not worth the risk when were so far up you both have got to trust me here ive done a pretty fair job so far i promise you its going to work but dooher wasnt ready to give it up how long have you known this that you werent going to call flaherty frankly mark i dont know there was always that possibility right from the beginning i wanted to keep the door open as long as i could in case i needed him but now its my judgment that i dont we dont christina spoke up again id like to know where they got michael ross what was that about how could he have been where he said he was he wasnt dooher said flatly they made him up glitsky and jenkins invented him christina believed it farrell could tell but it was more than any one witness or decision at this point wes knew that christina had bought the package with mark if the facts didnt fit then the facts must be wrong as a defense lawyer she was inexperienced as a person she was naive and she made the novices mistake she confused not guilty a legal concept that meant the prosecution had failed to establish guilt with innocent a fact of behavior but this was not the moment for these niceties farrell forced a relaxed tone how ross got to testify is a long and tedious story about attorney duplicity that id be happy to recount for you at our victory celebration but meanwhile id like to put this thing to bed before jenkins pulls any more quasilegal shenanigans out of her bag of tricks ones that might hurt us one last shot from the defendant youre sure we got it wes this is my life here he forced himself to meet doohers eyes i have no doubts by the lunch recess news of the arrest of diane price for carrying a concealed weapon had spread through the hall along with the myriad theories attendant upon any event of this nature she had been planning to assassinate dooher she was going to kill herself as a last desperate cry for help or maim herself as a publicity stunt dianes plea was that the whole thing was simply a mistake shed carried a gun for protection for years and years since a few months after the rape it was registered even though she had no license to carry it concealed on her person shed had no violent agenda she simply hadnt realized that there was a metal detector at the entrance to the hall of justice this explanation was of course dismissed by every lawenforcement professional in the building and diane was taken upstairs sam duncan abandoned scuffling to locate the crisis centers attorney diane spent three hours in custody before being cited and released on the misdemeanor every person in the courtroom the gallery as well as the principals was aware of the drama that had occurred outside during the lunch recess with this as a backdrop amanda jenkins stepped up and presented her closing argument the facts she said spoke for themselves and allowed for no other interpretation than that mark dooher had murdered his wife on the evening of june th the defendant had not been at the driving range when he said he was they had a witness whod positively identified his car near his house when the murder had been committed another witness whod been twenty feet from where dooher was supposed to have been and had never seen him why hadnt he seen him because dooher hadnt been there ladies and gentlemen hed been home stabbing his wife faking a burglary the prosecution had shown the linear connection between the blood taken from dr harriss office on the same day that dooher had been there indeed within minutes of when the defendant had been in the same examining room and then later this same blood not even close to the most common type of blood and tainted with edta had been splashed on sheila doohers bed and body no one else but mark dooher could have done this the jury must return jenkins concluded with a verdict of murder in the first degree farrell stood as though lost in thought scanning the yellow pages of his legal pad on the table in front of him for a last second before pushing back his chair and finally positioning himself in front of the jury box ladies and gentlemen he began then took another step forward and lowered his voice this was now simply a talk with these jurors whom hed come to know intimate and familiar i remember that back in school when i was first being taught how to write an essay i had a teacher mrs wilkins and she said if we only remembered three things about essays wed get an a in her class first he held up a finger first you write what you are going to say next you say it then number three you summarize what you just said he broke a smile homespun and sincere im a bit of a slow learner but i got an a in that course and ever since ive been comfortable with that essay formula which is why its lucky im a lawyer i suppose because thats a little bit what a trial is supposed to be like weve been here over the last couple of weeks listening to the evidence in this case trying to see if we can resolve one question and resolve it beyond a reasonable doubt does the evidence show that mark dooher the defendant over there he turned and pointed that mark dooher killed his wife back to the jury his voice now harsher in tone though still at only the volume of whisper im going to let you in on something ladies and gentlemen it does not not even close lets look for a last time at what the prosecution has given you to consider what they say they have proven he stopped and looked back over his shoulder at glitsky and jenkins a motive certainly a man who apparently has been happily married for over twentyfive years to the same woman would need some overwhelming and immediate reason to decide to kill his wife in cold blood the prosecutions theory is that mark dooher did it for the insurance money now forget for the moment the fact that mr dooher is a wellpaid attorney that he owns a house worth a million dollars and that his retirement is secure forget all that and focus on this question wheres the proof of this motive theory did the prosecution present any witnesses supporting any part of it they did not no proof no witnesses a bald assertion with no basis in fact farrell glanced at the clock he had a lot to say but suddenly he knew with relief that he was going to finish today it was nearly over he went to the table and drank some water then returned to the panel now lets talk for a minute about the evidence of the crime itself evidence found at the scene which they contend proves beyond a reasonable doubt an inextricable link between mark dooher and this murder he stood mute before the jury box making eye contact with each juror one by one the process took nearly fifteen seconds an eternity in the courtroom the silence hung heavily farrell nodded including them all thats right there is none none the kitchen knife with fingerprints on it those fingerprints were left by normal use around the house the surgical glove wheres the proof that it was mark doohers glove that he brought it to the scene there is none because that didnt happen no this glove was brought to the scene by the burglar by the murderer and left there thats all we know about it and it says nothing whatever about mr dooher so we have no proof that mark dooher was at the scene of the crime no direct or circumstantial evidence tying him to it next we must turn our attention to whether mark farrell began purposefully using doohers first name was even in the neighborhood mr balian says he saw his car parked a couple of blocks away when it should have been in the san francisco golf club parking lot but mr balian also says he recognized a brown lexus from diagonally across a wide street in the dark farrell shook his head i dont think so and mr ross didnt see what he said he didnt see at the driving range that night either he put his hand on the bar rail in front of the jury you know its funny about people you and me all of us you ever notice how sometimes we say something and were not too sure of it but we say it anyway maybe something weve seen or a story from a long time ago where we dont remember all the details so we kind of fill in whats missing with something plausible i think weve all had the experience after weve done this especially if weve told the story more than once of not being able to remember what parts exactly we filled in thats what happened to mr ross i dont think he purposely perjured himself under oath here no he was at the driving range that night or perhaps on some other night he was three mats from the end and he remembered not seeing anyone at the last mat but he told lieutenant glitsky it was this night and he was stuck with that story for those of you who might be familiar with sherlock holmes mr ross was the dog who did not bark in the night he saw no one this testimony even if it were true in all its details does not possess the same authority as if he said he saw mark picking his way through the hole in the fence perhaps mark wasnt there one time when mr ross looked up mark has admitted going to the bathroom and getting a coke that testimony was corroborated by the golf pro richie browne he says mark dooher was there the whole time so lets leave mr balian and mr ross the purported proof they offer is fatally flawed farrell let out a long sigh and gave another weary smile to the jurors youve heard that mr dooher carefully sedated his wife then after killing her he made the scene appear as though a burglar had done it now i ask you if you were going to plan this kind of elaborate charade if it were your intention to make it look like a burglar had been in your home dont you think youd leave some sign of a forced entry a broken window a kickedin door anything ladies and gentlemen this theory defies belief i dont know about you but i kept waiting for some witnesses to appear and say theyd seen mark drive up enter the house drive away anything but i never heard that not one witness came forward to say that all i heard was ms jenkins tell us she was going to prove it and i kept waiting and the proof never came and you know why because it didnt happen now judge thomasino will be giving you jury instructions but i want to say a word about the defenses burden of proof we dont have to prove anything and yet mark dooher chose to testify to go through three or four hours of ms jenkinss questions so that he could tell you what he did do on the night of june seventh so what do we have we have no proof of motive we have no proof that mark was at the scene of the crime when it occurred we have no proof that he was even in the neighborhood at the time in short there is no proof at all much less proof beyond a reasonable doubt that mark dooher is guilty of this crime there are no facts that convict him farrell was almost done ladies and gentlemen he said im a defense attorney its what i do for a living i defend people and try to convince a jury that the evidence in a case doesnt support a guilty verdict he drew a breath a trial was a war you had to do whatever it took to win it now hed gone this far and there was no turning back he had worked tirelessly to convince the good people of this jury that he was a man of honor worthy of their trust and now he was going to lie to them god help him he had to do it this case is different he said once in a career a guy like me gets a chance to tell a jury that his client isnt just not guilty but that hes innocent and thats what im telling you now mark dooher is innocent he didnt do it i know you know this too i know it part five chapter fourty four the way dooher saw it his acquittal should have restored him to his accustomed power influence and gentility hed been cleared of the charges after all that should have been the end of it and perhaps would have been if wes farrell had not led the charge of rats from the ship adding to the illusion that it was in fact sinking he supposed it was because he had never cultivated friends the way it had always worked was that people came to mark dooher not the other way around they had always needed something he could give them position money esteem but he did not need them he would give no one the satisfaction he had been the center of sheilas life providing her with a house and an income and children but even in the early years she had never been his equal that had been tacitly understood and farrell until the trial wes farrell wouldnt have dared presume that he was on the same level as dooher the mans entire existence had been lived at a rung below doohers his clearly defined role had always been as fawning admirer to whom mark permitted easy access because farrell amused him flaherty a friend hardly the archbishop was a man who needed doohers advice and guidance and who paid for it if he chose to believe that dooher harbored any real affection for him that was a need of his own nature not marks their social life had always been directed by sheila the occasional dinner in restaurants or at the olympic a night at the theater or a movie with longstanding acquaintances that had been about the extent of it mark never thought hed miss it and he didnt at least not specifically dooher should have realized that sheilas friends would shun both him and his new wife but he didnt miss anyones personal company there was an emptiness though a social void that filled him with a sense of isolation it wasnt fair and just he thought the ostracism was as complete as it would have been if hed been found guilty he and christina had married within a couple of months of the trial and now between them had no friends and very little business flaherty had led that abandonment somehow sometime during the trial the archbishop had lost faith in his innocence he had taken no joy in his acquittal hadnt even called to offer his congratulations in the weeks after the trial the legal work from the archdiocese had slowly but inexorably dried up and with it had gone the ancillary contracts from the network of agencies charities schools and businesses that were one way or the other tied to the catholic church in san francisco mccabe roth held on without the archdiocesan billings for seventeen months though the layoffs began almost immediately first to go were the word processors then the attorneys began having to double up on secretaries next the junior associates started getting their notices morale went into the toilet a splinter group of four senior partners left with their clients to form their own firm getting away from the dooher stranglehold christina went back to work but there was a lot of barely concealed resentment about her situation engaged then married to the managing partner she was avoided by the other associates and mistrusted by the partners still she was a game fighter and threw herself into her role of reestablishing her husbands credibility she and mark were together for the long haul if none of the lead attorneys would assign work to her then she would do business development taking prospective clients to lunch or dinner trying to help any way she could she fought the guilt that she had doubted him her actions must make that up to him she would stand by him when the world had let him go it was romantic and noble and filled her with a sense of mission and meaning they would make what her parents had made a life built on trust she told herself that she did not get pregnant to save the marriage it had always been her dream to have children a family a normal life but things with mark had gotten difficult his moods darker than anything she had seen in their early going but the failure of his firm his power dissipated that was devastating to a man a few weeks ago it had come to a head mark please just dont touch me all right its not working its not going to work he violently threw the covers off the bed in frustration then stood up and immediately snatched at his bathrobe wrapping it around him turning he grabbed the comforter from off the floor and threw it back on the bed snapping at her cover yourself would you for gods sake i dont need to cover myself his jaw set his angry eyes ran down the length of her body over the protruding belly the swollen breasts she could not believe he could look at her like that she loved the way her body had changed in the past eight months this just isnt doing it for me right now he said what isnt us if you must know you and me all these doubts what doubts i dont have you dont talk about them but i see them you think i dont see what youre thinking you think it turns me on to see you trying so goddamn hard im not trying anything mark come to bed just hold me we dont have to do anything i know dont have to do anything i want to do something dont you understand that but i cant i cant with you nothings happening he swore and stalked out of the room he hadnt felt any guilt or regret when he got arrested it actually played into his hands christina was sympathetically drawn to the grieving spouse who was tragically and wrongfully charged with murder she would help defend him it had been beautiful he couldnt have planned it better but now christina was ruining everything she pulled a flannel nightshirt over her head and came downstairs turned on the reading light next to where he sat in the library then crossed the room and lowered herself on to the couch i dont want to feel like its not working with us when were about to have this baby i dont like you thinking im not attractive like this my problem is not how you look i said it upstairs its us the way we are she settled back into the cushions her eyes flicked to the glass next to him nearly empty yeah ive been drinking i might be drinking more is that a problem she stared across at him why are you so hostile to me what have i done except stand by you support you dont you want this baby mark is that it defiantly he drained the rest of his drink before he answered her no thats not it he got up abruptly grabbed his glass and went over to the bar he poured another stiff one i have always dealt from power christina its the only way im comfortable what works is when you want me and i see how you look at me now i dont look at you any way mark but he was shaking his head you loved who i was when you met me when i was running the firm when i had a big dick you dont have to talk like that ill talk any way i want in my own house she shook her head and stood up thinking shed tried her best tonight okay she said but i dont have to listen to it in my house she was all the way to the door before he stopped her with a whisper dont you hear what im saying at all christina taking a step toward him she spoke evenly i dont recognize you marki know the firm failing is hard and i dont know how youre dealing with it but im not trying to take away any of your power ive been here for you ive kept trying even when she stopped when what all right a few more steps up to his chair she eased herself down on the arm of it even when i found out you lied to me even then narrowing his eyes giving nothing away when did i do that she had to get it out shed come this far maybe it would help i ran into darren mills a month ago two months something like that over at stonestown remember darren your old partner sure i remember darren what about him during your trial darren wound up doing a lot of work down in la with joe avery they got to be friends good for them she ignored that darren figured id be interested in how joe was doing hes still down there you know he got on with a new firm im happy for him she paused his venom was poisonous she put her hand protectively over her stomach darren mentioned joes transfer down to la how it had come on so suddenly a beat you told me joes transfer had been in the works for months i did darren said that wasnt true you sprang it on the managing committee a couple of weeks before it happened it stunned everybody joe hadnt even been up for partner for another year but of course they did what you told them they had to rubber stamp it dooher pulled a stool around and sat on it thats my terrible lie thats it yeah thats it and it made me think she paused and started over it made me remember your explosion in the courtroom when you blew up at amanda jenkins and then saying it had all been an act i got into the role he shrugged and so what did the other lie that whopper about joe avery what did that make you think that you stopped yourself from saying just now swallowing she met his gaze he was unflinching challenging her casually sipping from his glass he wanted her to get it out in the open it made me think you got rid of joe so hed be out of the way you knew it would break us up and then i could subtly court you while sheila was still alive and if you responded then i could kill her she crossed her arms okay he said lets say i did that im not saying you did oh but you are christina thats exactly what youre saying and if that were the case then you were part of it werent you and for a sweet person like yourself thats hard to take isnt it he came off the stool his hands in the pockets of his robe pacing in the area between them so lets say i did do it lets say i killed sheila because i had the hots for you and get this straight christina i did and you knew it youre not stupid you knew it so i killed her and now its been almost two years and i got away with it now you tell me this how does that change anything between us it changes who you aremark it would change everything hovering over her now he shook his head no it wouldnt he came down to one knee iam the same person she couldnt face any more of it and she closed her eyes tell me you didnt do that mark please youre scaring me to death and i suppose i killed victor trang for practice he put his hand around the back of her neck its your own guilt thats eating you up christina not mine i dont feel any guilt did you do it she repeated and the guy in vietnam too and raped diane price did you what does it matter please i have to know no he said you have to trust me she took his hand away from her neck holding it to keep it off her when i know youve lied to me when you act so convincingly when youre just so cruel i need to know mark i need to know who you are the eyes at long last softened shaking his head he let out a sigh i dont even remember this lie about joe avery christina i dont remember what it was about when i told it anything about it if i told you a lie im sorry the act i put on in the courtroom was a strategic decision the insane accusations got to me and i let myself lose my temper which i normally hold in pretty good check thats all that was but were they insane mark the accusations thats what im asking you how many times do i have to answer that question christina he hung his head god help the accused it never ends it can it can end right now whats it going to do for us or for me ill tell you again no i didnt do it and then some other doubt will come up in six months or a year or youll hear some new story about something i did or didnt do in the stone age no christina whats happening here is ive got to keep proving myself to you over and over again and im going to tell you the truth its wearing me down youre doing what wes has done what flaherty did what did they do mark what did they do they abandoned me goddamn it they didnt believe me dont you see they emasculated me except with you its more literal thats what tonight was about all these times it hasnt worked i cant take your doubts anymore whats happened is you cut my balls off mark no weve taken it this far i dont feel like im a man around you anymore im afraid the smallest slip of the tongue the tiniest slip in behavior and im back on the block being scrutinized and judged and asked over and over again well i cant do it my body doesnt lie im not loose im not having any fun nothings easy anymore it doesnt feel like you love me he put his hands under her shirt and ran them over her belly her breasts she didnt want that any part of it what was the matter with him couldnt he tell that but he had just told her it didnt feel like she loved him anymore and now if she told him to stop it would be worse she no longer felt she knew what the truth was maybe the whole thing was her fault her weakness in not being able to believe she understood why he wouldnt tell her again once and for all he was right it wouldnt be once and for all the last time she asked him it had been once and for all then too the question had been asked and answered how many times did she have to ask and what damage did it do to him each time he was going to be the father of their child and her own inability to trust was threatening all of them but it wasnt all her she knew that something had darkened in him his hands were still moving over her his breath quickening maybe the darkness had always been there and it had taken these troubles to make it visible but the way he treated her now talked to her it was coarse he had coarsened she didnt respond to it and never would she felt his hands on her he was strong and powerful and she realized that she was afraid her skin seemed to crawl under his touch after all theyd covered tonight she couldnt imagine that he felt amorous he pulled her shift up brought his mouth to her breasts god what made him work he yanked at the rope that held his robe and it fell open he was hard protruding he took her hand and put it on him exultant at the simple functioning heres something for you now he pulled her underpants off quickly now roughly afraid that the moment would pass again no words he was pushing her back into the chair opening her legs there was a savage set to his jaw and emptiness in his eyes she could do nothing to stop him chapter fourty five after the trial wes farrell gave up for a long time he decided not to cut his hair again until something anything made sense he stopped cleaning his apartment not much of his forte anyway enrolling in night classes he started taking history courses because everyone in them was already dead and couldnt hurt him anymore as part of his decision to quit the practice of the law entirely he gave up the lease on his north beach office he located and reattached the ten pounds hed lost for the trial cut off his fancy mustache and mothballed his fancy clothes the world was a sham people particularly charming winners were scum any form of idealism was delusion since a quick and painless suicide by say gunshot wound smacked of commitment he elected to pursue the more leisurely course of gradual alcohol poisoning there had been a short window of opportunity right as the trial was winding down during which he considered calling sam duncan after hed read diane prices diary he knew hed been an arrogant fool and was wrong on all counts after hed heard from flaherty and decided to abandon the character issue wes realized he would not have to crossexamine diane price he would not have to take her apart and that in turn might give wes the chance to tell sam that hed come to believe her he was a schmuck he loved her could they perhaps try again but wes wasnt mark dooher with his good timing and phenomenal luck he was the punching bag for a hostile universe the diane price fiasco with her rogue firearm took his play with sam out of the game since he was down anyway lydia chose this moment to confide to him the tender tale of her and doohers carnal union on the day of sheilas funeral so wes decided to sink for ever into his quagmire of drink and despair over humanity lydias story strengthened his resolve against women in general he couldnt let himself forget that any commitment in the love area was bogus and suspect and programmed for failure and hed had enough failure in what he took to be a sign of his mental health he forged a firmer bond with bart firing the graphic designer in his building who had been taking the dog out for walks wes started caring for bart albeit haphazardly on his own the dark period lasted seven or eight months but the race riots that nearly destroyed the city in the summer following the trial got his attention and he wound up being coerced by circumstances into helping a fellow student who was being framed for a racial murder and making an unlikely ally in abe glitsky finally hed done some good as a lawyer so he cut his long hair and broke out his old suits and started again and by then time had healed some of sams wounds as well he put the full court press on her with apologies and flowers and apologies and dinners and apologies he was an insensitive nonnineties type of guy but he was going to try and change and he meant it almost a year to the day after dooher had been found not guilty they moved together into the upper half of a railroadstyle victorian duplex on buena vista across from the park of the same name not two blocks from sams old place on ashbury not much further from the center they were sitting in striped fabric beach chairs on the tiny redwood deck that a previous tenant had built within the enclosure of peaks and gables on the rooftop they were planning to barbecue large scampi on the hibachi when the coals turned gray they were drinking martinis in the traditional stem glasses the latest cd from the singing group alabama wafted up through the skylight the country harmonies sweet in the soft breeze far down below and across the street they could see the lightgreen slope of the park the strollers and frisbee players the long shadows a slice of the downtown skyline beyond it was the last week of may the weather had been warm for two entire days in a row san franciscos abbreviated springtime to the west behind them a phalanx of fog was preparing for its june assault and it looked like it was going to be right on time and the long winter that was the citys summer would begin on the next day as a favorite topic of conversation mark dooher did not make it to the top of their personal hit parade so sam had been avoiding it for several hours but now she decided the moment was propitious guess who i saw this morning farrell dug out his olive sucked it then tossed it over to bart who caught it on the fly elvis he is alive you know it was in the enquirer at the counter absolute proof this time not like all those phony other times you know what im looking forward to she asked no dont answer right away because it kind of relates im looking forward to some day i ask you a question like guess who i saw today or you know what im looking forward to and you say who or what whichever word happens to apply in that given situation i think thats going to be a great day when that happens if it ever does wes nodded somberly id pay you a dollar if you could diagram that sentence if it was a sentence thats what i mean she said thats a perfect example it is a problem he agreed i must not be a linear thinker then reaching over and putting a hand over her knee leaving it there okay who christina carrera she saw him try to hide his natural reaction he took in the information with a slow breath threw a look off into the distance took his hand from her knee sipped at his drink how was she she was pregnant youre kidding yes im kidding no a glance still guarded wow she came by the center no sensing the question he was thinking just to visit catch up on all those good old times thats what she said how long did you believe her i didnt check my watch but less than three seconds good he said that was long enough give her story a fair chance what did she really want now see here if i were you id give you an answer like she wanted me to help her negotiate a new treaty between hong kong and china for the new millennium but i dont say stuff like that usually i try to be responsive thats because youre a better person than i am so what did she really want i dont know for sure just to talk with somebody she used to know take a reality check she was scared and didnt know how to admit it id be scared too did you tell her she was smart to be scared no that wouldnt have helped we talked well mostly i listened and she talked pretending she really had dropped in out of the blue to say hi she was in the neighborhood and after a while the pretense kind of ran out of gas and she got to it wes stood up and walked over to the roofs edge looking out across the park he beating her she was next to him an arm around his waist no she says not it doesnt look like it how pregnant is she a lot it looks like shes getting close then after a while maybe an afterthought to be polite she got around to asking a little about me what i was doing my personal life i told her about me and you not all the good parts i hope sam squeezed against him then lifted herself on to the edge of the roof when i mentioned you it was like i threw her a rope she said shed looked you up but didnt know what she could say she didnt believe youd talk to her wes was silent there was more than a little truth to what sam was saying he probably wouldnt have talked to christina if she just walked in on him during the trial the teams within the defense team had split up obviously and cleanly wes on one side christina and mark on the other afterwards as his doubts about dooher grew christina made it clear she didnt want to hear them her own agenda with mark her own priorities had taken over then when it was done wes had felt the tug of his misguided idealism again he had tried one last time to get to christina to get her to consider in spite of the not guilty verdict that their guy had done it maybe his timing had been wrong it certainly wouldnt have been the first time but she was already wearing an engagement ring that should have been his first clue she had asked him for proof for something new that they hadnt seen at the trial or during preparation for it and wes had really blown it then coming right out and telling her that mark had told him he told you he admitted it but wes had to be honest he always had to be honest someday he was sure it was going to do him some good but this hadnt turned out to be the day he said in so many words you mean he didnt tell you and he didnt admit it is that what youre saying at the time wes had ruefully reflected that she sounded like him on cross so by having christina watch him during the trial cop some of his moves he had probably helped turn her into a lawyer he wished hearing her now that he could work up some soaring sense of accomplishment but it just didnt come instead he admitted that dooher had not admitted and that had been that she wasnt going to consider it farrell thought she probably wouldnt believe it if mark himself told her shed worked herself up into being a true believer and wes farrells niggling doubts only served to reinforce for her the fact that she and mark were in this alone together shed told him about his problem he was jealous that mark had come to depend more upon her than on him that wess role in marks life was going to diminish that hed tried he really had ill consider it he said okay i have no i dont think so she asked if i would talk to you and you have he walked to the other end of the tiny hollow in the roof there was really nowhere else to go he turned back facing her they were going to have to expand this deck give him someplace to hide and what am i supposed to say to her that i didnt try to say last time i dont know maybe this time shell be disposed to believe you i dont care if she believes me i dont care what she believes his volume was rising he heard it and didnt like it he didnt want to yell at sam he loved sam this didnt have anything to do with the two of them he tightened down the control button shes living with a murderer sam what am i supposed to tell her exactly here i am listen hey look christina maybe it wouldnt be too good an idea if you kept living with your husband because see now how can i put a nice pleasant little spin on this for you he kills people once in a while not everyday you understand and im not saying hell kill you of course but just to be safe he shook his head no i dont think so he put his hand up to his forehead combed his hair back with his fingers and after that whats she going to do anyway leave she might it might save her life she could leave now save her own life its not my job no part of it is my job shit sam came toward him she always did this because it so often worked and put her arms around him i think she wants to know what you know wes thats all shes carrying his baby thats a hell of a commitment she cant just walk out shes got to be absolutely sure shell never be sure sam she knows everything i know already its all in her head damn it but his arms came up around her his head down to the hollow of her neck when he asked i told her tomorrow morning she said smiling sweetly up at him going up on her tiptoes to plant a kiss would that be a good time glitsky had moved in his deliberative way back to the land of the living nat at seventyeight started studying to become a rabbi he was doing aerobic walking from arguello to the beach every single day and was never going to die wasnt even going to age any further and for this abe was grateful glitskys oldest son isaac was graduating from high school in a couple of weeks and hed turned into a reasonable approximation of a young adult on the day after graduation he was leaving on a bicycle tour of the west coast with three friends he planned to be gone for most of the summer and had been accepted at ucla in the fall jacob his hip seventeenyearold had gone on what glitsky thought had been a mercy field trip to the opera with his godmother one of flos old college roommates over the howling derision of his brothers and his own misgivings jacob had spent an evening in san franciscos grand hall then another the experience the grandeur drama emotion tragedy had transformed him before too long he was going down for sunday matinees standing in the back buying discount tickets with his own money hed started buying cds first the old duplex had been filled with the strains of the three tenors doing songs but in short order hed branched out into arias then whole passages he would study the scores the librettos he began taking italian of all things as a special elective in school discovering that he had a rich baritone of his own jacob found an instructor who said it could be developed and the youngest boy changed his name living in the house of a halfblack cop the nickname oj had to go so now he was orel james his given name the boy looked more and more like his mother flo each day orel was still having a difficult time at school he remained withdrawn he did a lot of headphones time his walkman sega genesis ruled the rest of his waking hours and hed developed a stutter his older brothers didnt play with orel like they used to abe knew heartrending as it was that this was how it should be everybody was growing up the older boys had their lives orel wasnt their responsibility anyway it fell to glitsky no one else he accepted it and sometimes thought that somebody else needing him was what saved him what pulled him through it finally he had tostart coming home to help orel with homework to go to parent conferences about his boy to be free on weekends abe had played college football tight end at san jose state and pop warner needed coaches suddenly he found himself out among humanity fathers women noncops other children this was disorienting at first but then he and orel would go out for a shake afterwards and theyd have some things in common to talk about football then startlingly for both of them what they were feeling he started making it a point whenever he could to be home in time to tuck orel in at night to sit and see flos face in his sons and realize part of her was still there and listen to the stutter lessen as sleep closed in and then gradually starting to hear the boy himself his own voice and identity what he was saying his secrets and worries and hopes and sometimes he didnt know what this feeling was for his baby it was so strong where before he had barely known orel wondering marveling at the seeds that could spring up after the forest had been felled and cleared hed sit there orel sleeping with his breath coming deep and hed rest his hand on the boys chest in the dark empty filling up now he was washing the dinner dishes looking out his open back window into the presidio national park a glorious evening the sky above dark blue almost purple the days remaining light had a peculiar reddish glow fog over the ocean the older boys out doing important endofschool teenage things hadnt made it home for dinner he heard orel doing his spelling words with rita the letters coming out clearly one by one no stutter the telephone rang and he dried his hands picking it up on the third ring another change for the better it used to be on one always at home now when the phone rang it wasnt always for him girls would call for the boys also other guys for years glitskys greeting had been to growl his name now he picked up the receiver and said hello just like a regular citizen abe yeah this is kind of a strange call a voice as it were from the strange and distant past mostly strange glitsky standing at his kitchen wall phone on this thursday night couldnt place it he knew it but not well whoever it was had his home phone number so though mostly strange it couldnt be too distant then the tumblers fell wes very good lieutenant id even say excellent howve you been this fine past year ive been good wes what can i do for you farrell spent a couple of minutes running down some background on his meeting tomorrow with christina carrera glitsky listened without interrupting glitsky had survived the political fallout from the dooher trial and over the past year and a half had distinguished himself in his job to the point where he felt relatively secure in it but dooher was unfinished business any mention of him got all of abes attention right now farrell concluded if shes getting ready to walk away from him id like to give her a hand it looks to me shes gotten to where she knows what hes done but she still cant face it shes going to want something more glitsky was sitting on a chair at the kitchen table so what do you need from me i dont know i thought you might have come across some evidence since the trial glitsky was not unaware of the irony the defense lawyer whod convinced a jury that his client was not guilty was now asking if theyd turned up any new evidence to convince a colleague that hed been guilty after all i gave everything to amanda jenkins wes when dooher got off the investigation ended there was a pause how about trang that case is still open isnt it technically glitsky admitted that it was although by now it was what they called a skull case long gone and all but forgotten trang hasnt been taking up a lot of my time wes we got called off on that one you may remember farrell felt as though he deserved the rebuke but he persisted what im trying to do he said is give her a taste of what youve got what you had and then what i dont know it might save her life he threatening her i dont know but i dont know if he threatened sheila either or trang threats dont seem to come with the package glitsky knew what farrell was saying this man plotted and struck he wasnt going to telegraph any moves so what do you want he repeated maybe your file on trang i never saw any of that i dont know what you had repeating it got glitskys blood flowing maybe they could still get this guy maybe glitsky could close the circle once and for all with him but as was his way he kept the enthusiasm out of his voice we had the same kind of circumstantial case we built for the trial conflicting witness interviews a motive that only worked if you knew what you were looking for we never found the bayonet but you were sure personally glitsky went over the discrepancies between doohers version of his phone calls to victor trang on the night of his death the computer files trang had kept and the interviews with trangs mother and girlfriend all of that taken together i knew it wouldnt fly at a trial we needed some physical evidence that put him in trangs office the closest we got to that was the cellphone trace for me it was enough the da didnt agree you think it might be enough for christina glitsky considered it i dont see how it could hurt after wes has hung up he walked into the living room where sam was sitting in the window seat staring out at the fog whoever wrote that stuff about little cats feet she asked this stuff comes in on a steamroller wes got to her and looked out the bay window he could barely make out the lights directly across the street glitsky says hell send over some stuff but maybe not by the morning you know sam said i was listening to you in there talking to him what was the moment for you finally he didnt have to think for long diane price that diary when it was obvious that she wasnt lying she nodded youve still got that dont you somewhere in your wellorganized files i never throw anything out you know that she patted his cheek its one of your many charms chapter fourty six christina almost canceled the weather was terrible dense fog fortymileperhour gusts of drizzly wind temperature in the low forties on top of that the baby had kicked all night shed only slept three hours she was exhausted part of her wished she could undo having gone to see sam yesterday it put things in motion somehow made her feel as though she had betrayed mark but living with him had become a daily exercise in controlling fear daytoday mark wasnt acting in a threatening way he went off to his office one room and a reception area on the sixth floor of embarcadero one he would call sometime in the late morning to check and see how she was feeling often he wasnt in the office in the afternoon she didnt ask where hed gone he played golf kept in shape at the squash courts went to lunch with business acquaintances his world hadnt ended to the objective observer he was back almost to his normal charming confident self since their last episode though a fault line ran through their lives she couldnt shake the feeling that mark had manipulated her to a place where she didnt feel she could refuse to have sex with him fear she realized that the nebulous worries and doubts had coalesced into real fear the sex since then had been frequent impersonal so rough she was afraid for the baby he was her husband you had to trust your husband she could leave if it got any worse she told herself she would do that she would protect the baby that was the greatest imperative but she kept trying to be fair all of marks other friends had abandoned him could she join that parade she didnt trust herself that was the problem what if she were wrong this could all be her own paranoia the rush of hormones another typical episode in her seemingly lifelong quest to have her relationships fail she always found an excuse didnt she this was why she couldnt tell her mother though they talked on the telephone three times a week she could not bring herself to admit out loud that there was anything wrong in the marriage she and mark were happy happy happy she also couldnt afford to let her parents develop any doubts about mark shed worked so hard to convince them that he was innocent if this marriage failed it would kill her mother and christina would appear a fool to her father so yesterday she decided shed talk to someone she liked even though she knew that sam didnt have anything approaching an objective view and when shed found out that sam and wes farrell were together a couple she let herself revel in the sense that somehow she could get the answer wes would but again what could he do it was a mistake she knew what wes was going to say and once he did once it got to that stage there wouldnt be any more excuses she was having a baby any day now this was not the time she couldnt do it she couldnt go she would just call wes and cancel and say shed been having a bad day yesterday thats what it had been sitting on one of the stools by the marble counter in the kitchen she got the number from the phone book and wrote it on the pad by the phone she punched up the prefix then stopped and hung up watching the fog outside the baby kicked inside her a tear coursed down her cheek wes had rented a converted shopfront on irving street at th avenue compared to his old office in north beach this one was a hightech marvel in blond woods and glass block skylights and decorative plants he had a fulltime computer literate secretaryparalegal named ramon hed even broken down and decided an answering machine would be appropriate wes was behind his desk pretending to be taking notes from the evidence code christina sat in the teak and leather chair reading diane prices diary other than obviously exhausted wes thought she looked big surprise terrific she wore jeans a pair of wellworn hiking boots a black heavy sweater with a cowl neck he decided that sam had been right about dooher not beating her though perhaps wes thought nonnineties insensitive jerk that he was in some ways it might have been better if he had he knew christina was strong intelligent and aware enough not to accept anything overt of that nature if dooher hit her shed be gone but dooher wasnt overt that was his thing he could tell when she finished the first half of the diary where diane was going out with dooher the next night and she couldnt wait he imagined his own face had taken on the same confused expression she looked up at him it just ends keep reading he said when she got to the next entry the only other one she sat still for a long time then she flipped the final pages closing her hands over them finally staring at the floor or somewhere just above it she was finished he spoke carefully quietly i dont think she wrote that as a publicity stunt for the trial i think thats genuine christinas head was bobbing as though she were conferring with herself something happened she agreed he didnt push anyway i thought you should see it why didnt you show me this during the trial a good question he wasnt proud of himself and it showed on his face my first reaction was that if you read this you wouldnt be as effective if you had to cross her so it was need to know then after flaherty bailed on us i knew we werent going to do character so jenkins would never get a chance to call her it became moot but not for me wes it must have been obvious i was getting involved with mark if id seen this you wouldnt have believed it he said you would have called it a forgery or a fake of some kind think about it silence you remember that mike ross never caved under my pretty intense attack you know why because he knew what hed seen he was facing marks tee and saw a lot of air where mark should have been if hed been there which he wasnt she took a breath blew it out hard you want to meet this woman diane talk to her i know her pretty well by now theres nothing flaky about her mark raped her the tears started again without sound or movement of any kind he figured it was as opportune a time as any ive got to tell you something else christina her gaze came up to him expressionless on the day of sheilas funeral after everyone else had gone home mark and my exwife had sex on the floor in the living room of your house so much for the grieving husband she took it calmly as she had the rest nodding in shock wess intercom beeped softly he picked up his telephone i said no interr who he sighed okay send him back farrell stood by the door holding it open glitsky appeared in the hallway sorry i didnt call but i went in early and down to records found the file and had an appointment out here anyway you said you needed it sooner so i thought it would save time to run it by farrell took the file gesturing him inside i believe you know christina she had tried without great success to fix her eyes glitsky trained investigator that he was saw the blotched mascara the redness am i interrupting shaking her head no christina looked up at him i dont know what to do she said whats that file is that about mark its about victor trang farrell had the file in his hand and was moving back to his desk but if the lieutenants got five minutes he can probably do the short version it took more like a halfhour glitsky had pulled over the other wingchair from across the room and sat kittycorner to christina while wes perched himself on the end of his desk when hed finished abe spread his hands so unless you want to believe that trang was laying this elaborate scam on his mother and girlfriend creating bogus records in his own file that matched the exact times of real calls he got from dooher all the while knowing for a fact that he had turned down flahertys six hundred thousand dollar offer in the hopes of getting more he trailed off the conclusion was inescapable youre saying mark killed him too the eyes had dried by now had taken on a glassy look that glitsky had seen in survivors of hostage situations in a sense maybe thats what shed been through was going through still he nodded thats what i believe yes there is one other thing you ought to know it wasnt brought out at trial okay there were very distinctive stripes in blood on both victor trang and sheila dooher you can compare the crimescene shots the killer of both of them wiped the blade on their clothes and remember chas brown she nodded thomasino wouldnt let him testify yeah him his story the guy in vietnam andre nguyen the first interview we did with him he volunteered thatyour husband told him hed wiped his bayonet blade off on nguyens pajamas its the same mo you can believe me or dont but its as true as anything gets wes went on with the doubleteam one last thing christina and im glad abes around to hear it ive gone back over this case now nine ways from sunday and it was all by the book all the reasons mark gave us why glitsky was somehow out to get him we were just primed to believe them we got sold a bill of goods christina wasnt much in the mood for a lecture on how the justice system worked or didnt on how she and wes had been less than ept she pulled down her sweater and got herself to her feet i want to thank both of you for your time she said it was a dismissal she was picking up her purse grabbing her jacket from the peg next to the door if you decide to leave him wes said go someplace he wont think to look and let us know would you she nodded although she didnt really seem to be in agreement she was inside herself throwing them both a last ambiguous expression she went out the door farrell was back on the corner of the desk so whats she going to do glitsky shrugged i believe her exact words were that she didnt know if shes got brains shell get out i dont think brains is the problem this was something i had a pretty hard time with myself and shes pregnant with his baby thinking about it doesnt seem to help well i hope it helps a little i would hate to get another call about one of doohers wives if glitsky knew anything he knew about murderers the first killing was the hardest and if you got away with it the second was easier and if you got away with that but the topic rattled wes and he stuck with it why would he do that kill christina i dont know glitsky said maybe he wont but you think he might standing glitsky thought it was time for him to go he didnt like dealing in hypothetical his job did not begin until something had actually happened until then speculation wasnt much more than a parlor game but he didnt want to alienate farrell he might need him after all for the time being at least they were on the same side and glitsky had the germ of an idea yeah i think he might but why why did he kill nguyen or trang or his wife he didnt have to do any of those people did he so whats that leave ill tell you he likes it he likes tormenting you with it he likes rubbing my face in it he likes living with the fact that hes done it most of all though you want my take he likes the moment farrells shoulders were slumped his hands clasped in his lap and he nodded agreeing the funny thing is ive seen him that way youd think id have figured it out seen him what way i mean hurting people his kids sheila waiters anybody those moments when he was in the middle of hurting somebody you could tell there was some level at which he liked it but afterwards hed be so sorry go back to the charming act he shook his head disgusted with himself really all you had to do to stay marks friend was never to get in his way dont cross him let him have whatever he wanted which between the two of us wasnt a problem we wanted different things glitsky moved toward the door well he said you know now farrell took up the trang file you want this back i dont think christina needs it no its a copy why dont you look through it maybe your sharp attorneys eye will see something we missed although i doubt it he grabbed the doorknob abe one last thing really is there anything we can do about her ive got the same instinct as you do let the thing work itself out but sam wants to help shes not going to let it go glitsky shrugged glad it was farrells problem his girlfriends problem heres the deal wes hell either leave her alone or he wont i cant do anything until he does i hate that part farrell said if its any consolation abe replied its not my favorite either chapter fourty seven dooher saw that christinas car wasnt in the garage but didnt think anything of it it wasnt uncommon she had a life she wasnt a prisoner he let himself in through the side door and was immediately aware of the silence a profound and ominous stillness standing there in the laundry room by the alarm box he listened had the electricity been shut off he turned on the kitchen light no that wasnt it silence christina no answer probably out shopping he had been thinking theyd go out to dinner hed gotten himself a decent referral from one of his old partners today it looked like he was going to be getting work subbing on an asbestos lawsuit if it came through the job could be milked for a couple hundred hours christina would be glad to hear about it theyd celebrate get her out of the dumps shed been in lately it was really a pain tell the truth dealing on this level with female hormones he grabbed a beer from the refrigerator twisted off the cap once christina had this kid he was thinking hed talk her into getting a nanny and put her back to work she was better when she worked when he kept her busy she was one of those women who wanted to please you kept them focused on the trees they never saw the forest which basically scared them christina loved cutting the trees though she loved clearing the brush around the trunks pruning the foliage at the end of the day dooher would tell her what a good job shed done what needed to be done the next day shed been happy and she loved him because he counted on her he made her feel important needed fulfilled he could fix things between them he knew he could as a pure physical specimen she was worth all the trouble because she was who he deserved she was the one he wanted so hed tough it through the next couple of months and shed get back to the way shed been when shed been trying to save the firm hed get her back this interview today was a sign that things were turning around his potential new client didnt mention his notorious trial of over a year before it was all fading into the background where it belonged and about time too where was she he removed a frozen stein from the freezer opened the plastic container of chocolate chip cookies poured his beer there was the pile of mail on the marble counter and he walked over to it flipping through the usual bills and solicitations the telephone there she was calling in hello mark its irene christinas mother checking in how are you doing outstanding he said how about yourself she was great bill was great the world was a beautiful place marks business was going along fine no the weather here had turned cold again maybe he and christina should come down to ojai for a couple of days this month get away from the gray she was out shopping just now but hed tell her shed called and he was sure shed get back to her later tonight he reached for the little green postit square next to the telephone and pulled off the top page where there was a number in christinas handwriting popping the last of his cookie into his mouth washing it down with beer he went upstairs to get into something more comfortable lord it was a big house completely redone of course since christina had moved in more busy work more trees to trim there was no sign left of sheila he looked in at the library crossed the foyer climbed the circular stairway at the door to the bedroom he turned on the light and stopped still something here as when hed entered the house something felt wrong the top to christinas dresser had been cleared of all her bricabrac their wedding portrait pictures of her parents the small jewelry box a precious to her row of carved soapstone seals her perfumes what the hell he grabbed the handles of the top drawer her underwear and pulled it quickly out toward him then more quickly the next one down pants the next sweaters and shirts empty or nearly so empty enough he raced into the bathroom her toothbrush was gone her combs wait wait wait slow down shes having the baby he told himself she must have tried to call him and ran out of time shed driven herself to the hospital that was it but he had had the cellphone with him all day he would have gotten the call still he checked downstairs in the foyer closet the small suitcase was gone it was the one theyd packed for the delivery all right he thought shes in labor hed call the hospital and get down there but something else struck him the large suitcase was missing too at the phone now he called st marys to see if shed been admitted no unwilling to believe anything else he told himself again that she had to be in labor somewhere he tried the other hospitals shriners the university of california medical center he punched at the redial feature on the phone and waited while it rang irene carrera answered again but hed just spoken to her and shed known nothing surely if christina had been in labor and hadnt been able to reach him she would have called her mother he hung up without a word shed left him the postit hed stuck on the wall had a telephone number with christinas handwriting it might tell him something might be someplace to start looking he entered the numbers and listened to the message farrell okay he told himself okay just think shes gone but it couldnt have been too long ago and it probably wasnt very far and she hadnt yet told her mother that was for sure so she was staying close maybe she was planning to call him to give him a chance to talk her back she wasnt going to do that hed have to find her and get her and bring her back she was carrying his baby goddamn it even if he didnt want it it was his and women just didnt walk away from mark dooher he was not going to let that happen so she got farrells number but hadnt called him at least it hadnt been the last call from this phone the redial told him that he was trying to figure it the last call from this phone had been to her mother but he had just talked to irene and she knew nothing so what was going on and where did farrell come into it if she wasnt in labor he shouldnt be kidding himself she wasnt that meant shed at least looked up farrell it had to be for protection from him he hit farrells numbers again when the machine answered he spoke calmly wes its your old friend mark dooher would you call as soon as you get this message its very important about christina if shes in labor and you know it would you let me know im worried sick hanging up with exaggerated care dooher sat immobile on the kitchen stool farrell that neerdowell busybody doesnt he know better by now he ought to than to go head up against mark dooher if it came to a fight mark would destroy him he always had always would christina hadnt been lying to farrell and glitsky she didnt know what she was going to do the only certainty was that she had to get away from mark she had to protect the baby she would stay near her doctor jess yamagi if he delivered the baby it would be fine it was about all she was sure of anymore she had checked into a motel room on th avenue near golden gate park not far from the hospital a kind of exhausted clarity had kicked in she was too pregnant to get to her parents house anyway to do any real traveling at all with the stress shed had contractions on and off throughout the day the thought of having to face her parents with another failure was almost worse than the failure itself she would have to call them eventually to let them know downplaying it at first to get them used to the idea but it was going to be awful it would have to be done she knew that but later she realized she didnt have any important phone numbers the duncan farrell home was unlisted she had to call information for farrells number and left a message with him the crisis center was also closed up for the night she didnt leave a message the contractions were irregular but they were continuing she got into the bed turned the television on and pulled the covers up around her chapter fourty eight farrell had reached glitsky at his office near the end of the day and told him hed remembered something abe hadnt known it wasnt in the trang file but it might be important about jim flaherty since hed made lieutenant glitsky had learned that it was bad luck to subvert the regular channels and lines of command credibility was all if abe called on the da in his official capacity as the head of homicide and requested a meeting the da had to know he wasnt trying to sell bingo tickets glitsky first discussed farrells information with dan rigby the chief of police and rigby told him that if the da said it might go somewhere he could move on it otherwise it was a waste of company time having obtained rigbys permission glitsky called the da which was why he was back downtown on this friday night after a quick meal at home with rita and the boys he and paul thieu walked into the office of the new district attorney alan reston chris locke who had been the da during the dooher trial had gotten himself killed shot to death during one of the race riots that had rocked the city the preceding summer glitsky had come to admire reston a midthirties africanamerican he was as political as locke had been but unlike locke had within this century put quite a few actual criminals behind bars restons face was black marble smooth and unlined under a closely trimmed afro his tie alone had more colors than glitskys entire closet and the suit couldnt be bought for a week of abes pay but he was a professional prosecutor and for that glitsky could forgive the fancy clothes everybody shook hands the politician naturally remembered paul thieu by name and he directed both the officers to chairs in front of his desk he went around to his own seat and didnt waste anymore time on amenities what do you have he asked straight out how much do you know about mark dooher reston hadnt been in the city during the dooher trial so his recollection of it was vague glitsky went over the facts reston had his hands crossed on his desk and listening didnt so much as twiddle his thumbs when glitsky wound it up he waited ten seconds to make sure hed finished then spoke and the point is paul thieu popped in we never tried him for trang sir locke pulled us off the case and thomasino ruled any mention of our investigation inadmissible at the trial reston looked confused whos trang paul glitsky stopping his subordinate the point alan is that this mans a multiple murderer and im afraid hes going to do it again reston remained cool well then isnt the usual procedure to wait until he does then collect the evidence hes so kindly left us yes sir no question that is sop reston opened his hands well well that brings us back to victor trang he turned to thieu all right paul now it was a little bit like turning a terrier loose in under five minutes thieu outlined the entire history on the death of victor trang the proposed settlement on the amended complaint with the archdiocese the computer notes his mother and girlfriend dooher the vietnam connection the bayonet wiping the blood the cellphone again glitsky cut in paul could get a lot of information on the table in a hurry but it could overwhelm and restons eyes had begun to glaze we had a case building circumstantial but righteous and then locke pulled it why did he do that i think he did a favor for the archbishop reston frowned youre saying chris locke downloaded a murder investigation thats a hell of a strong accusation abe especially against someone who isnt around to deny it this response was expected and glitsky shrugged it off locke told rigby the chief of police that he wasnt going to try a circumstantial case against dooher he wanted to see physical evidence the bayonet an eyewitness or two fibers or soils or fabrics something this made sense to reston he wanted to win if it went to trial theres nothing sinister there i understand that and as it turned out we got a warrant and tore his place apart and didnt find anything reston shook his head im afraid i dont see where this is going you got some new evidence thieu unable to restrain himself up on the front of his chair the archbishop flaherty what about him glitsky hes the one who convinced locke to back off he talked locke into keeping the trang murder out of doohers trial i talked to doohers old lawyer today wes farrell a defense lawyer farrells a good guy he and dooher dont get along anymore his news was that flaherty went sideways on doohers character testimony he found something out you think we can find out flahertys not a fan of mine or id ask him myself since the trial hes pulled the plug on all contacts with doohers firm he should have led the cheering when dooher got off instead he cut him out im listening ask flaherty ask him what ask him why he and dooher arent playmates anymore and then we know something dont we weve got new evidence we try to build the case we brought up all the files you can check em out a guy named chas brown reston held up a hand i will fine and meanwhile we keep looking for the good stuff above all we take dooher off the street again maybe save a life or two whose i dont know his new wifes maybe my guess is shes leaving him and thats going to stir up the pot saving lives isnt the job abe i never said it was alan but wouldnt it be nice you want to get him dont you you got a hardon for dooher but glitsky had been down this road enough times he knew where the potholes were i see a way to take a dangerous man off the street legally its a skull case we can close thats all dooher is its nothing personal reston considered thats a very good answer telling glitsky he didnt believe him but he nodded okay ill call flaherty see what he says it didnt take any time at all glitsky and thieu were talking over the relative merits of a nowarrant arrest picking up a suspect without a warrant signed by a magistrate and had pretty much reached the conclusion that in doohers case it wouldnt be a great idea dooher wasnt acting like he was going to flee the jurisdiction hed committed no new crimes that they knew of if glitsky and thieu just went in and arrested him on their suspicions theyd open themselves up to charges of false arrest harassment police brutality on his desk the telephone sounded glitsky when he hung up he told thieu that it had been the da flaherty told reston hes got no personal knowledge of any crimes committed by mr dooher emphasis added if theres evidence he committed a crime we ought to pursue it vigorously his words thieu broke a grin what do you say lets do that very thing at sam had her feet up and was reclining in the barcolounger she was vastly enjoying the political philosophy of al franken laughing aloud every two minutes bart slept under the table and wes was in a chair at that table perusing the trang file there had to be something in it the doorbell rang and bart raised his head and barked wes looked a question over at sam this time of night we dont want any sam said i know he closed the trang file and stood up crossing the living room giving an affectionate tug on sams toe as he passed her he got to the stairs and turned on the outside light half of their front door was frosted glass and a mans silhouette was visible behind it farrell paused with a premonition then spoke to the door who is it mark dooher he opened the door halfway but kept a hand on it the sight of dooher on his stoop in the fog made his mouth go dry the damn physical reactions his heart was turning over what do you want thats not the friendliest greeting ive ever heard wes how about how you been or long time no see when farrell made no response dooher cut to it im trying to find my wife she here no shes not here why would she be here she called you today it wasnt a question you saw her i think you know where she is i dont have any idea where she is a coldness in the eyes i think shes here behind him wes heard sams voice at the top of the stairs who is it wes doohers eyes narrowed he tried to look up the stairs around farrell finally getting some are you she pretty get lost mark i dont know where christina is i didnt know she was leaving you though i dont blame her she got an earful of the evidence on victor trang today i think it kind of bothered her he turned around to sam its mark dooher so you did talk to her damn farrell had to stop giving things away he had to remember who he was talking to how did you know where i live a condescending smile parkers lord wes was pathetic when the parkers directory the lawyers guide to other lawyers had sent him their update form hed filled in his address here on buena vista he hadnt opened his new office yet hadnt wanted to lose any business stupid sam put her hand flat against his back he hadnt heard her come down the stairs dooher kept up with questions so what did christina say what did you talk about soybean futures mark maybe some pork bellies famous killers we have known dooher put his hand on the door youve always been a funny guy wes he popped the heel of his palm against the frosted pane where is she another shot with his palm rattling the window loud where the fuck is she suddenly sam was around wes slamming the door shut turning the deadbolt keep the hell away from here she yelled through the door bart set up a racket and wes leaned over patting him holding him by the collar getting him under control when he looked back up the shadow was gone he slumped against the wall sam had her back against the opposite wall im sorry she said i just didnt want no its okay hes gone now that was a good move she came toward him into his arms what did he want christinas left him he thought id know where she went i dont want him coming around here i dont either they started up the steps arms around one another you dont have to worry wes said hes just looking for her i do worry he didnt have to come by here he could have called you at work tomorrow wes thought about it hes not going to do anything to me he doesnt perceive me as a danger this was a threat him coming by here he was threatening you i dont think so what for for talking christina into leaving him i didnt do that she did that on her own she did it on her own after she talked with you at your office its a fine distinction wes shook his head theres no way she stared up into his face you want to promise me one thing you thought you knew him before remember that would you remember that he kissed her okay ill remember ravenwood street in the dark slumped behind the wheel of his city car glitsky had the lights off but had left the motor running and the heater on his hands encircled an oversized cardboard cup which had once held hot tea the drivers side window was down an inch across the street doohers house appeared and disappeared in the shifting fog fifteen minutes before glitsky had knocked on the front door and returned to his car to wait he was thinking about flaherty wishing he hadnt come on so aggressively back long ago when hed interviewed him but then again thats who abe had been back then a cop with a chip on his shoulder over flo over his life ready to explode at anybody even people who might help him alienating everyone ineffective the lexus pulled into the driveway glitsky got out of his car and reached the front door at about the same time a light came on in the back of the house he pushed the doorbell and listened to the eight tones lord we thank thee we bow our heads another light inside then overhead on the porch when dooher opened the door glitsky put a foot against it i thought youd be interested to hear that were looking into mr trangs murder again i wanted to give you the opportunity to confess to it now save us all a lot of time and trouble get a life private dooher moved to close the door but it wouldnt go glitsky kept talking youve been through one trial you know the heck it plays with your life you dont really want to go through that again and im betting you dont get bail this time just a hunch but id go with it what the hell are you doing here i just told you you got a warrant you dont have a warrant sergeant get off my property glitsky moved his foot im going to take that as a no on the confession but youre making a mistake dooher disgusted closed the door and turned out the overhead light glitsky thinking hed burned up his fridaynight fun quotient decided to go home he was almost across the patio when the light came back on he heard the door open the commanding voice glitsky reaching inside his jacket for his you never knew he revolved halfway around dooher stepped out on to the porch it was you brought the trang file over to farrells wasnt it he asked so nice i couldnt refuse and you saw my wife heres the thing mark in my business i generally ask the questions you want to talk about victor trang ill listen all night long but ive got nothing to say about your wife you saw her at farrells you know where she is now another question about your wife glitsky tsked and here i thought id made it so clear he shrugged not that it hasnt been a good time but ive really got to go i dont have a warrant and ive been ordered off the property unless you want to invite me in dooher seemed almost to enjoy the moment youre nearly as funny as my friend wes you know that glitsky and i admire that in a man really i do but you cant touch me you should realize that by now the fact is you just dont seem to be able to do your job do you though i guess being black and all thats not much of a problem you dont actually have to perform do you actually get anything done sometimes glitsky said his scar tight now he could feel it you might be surprised well you do your best then would you give it your best shot or was that what you did with sheila no that couldnt have been your best shot could it dooher took a few steps toward him made his own tsking sound oh thats right youd lost your own wife back then didnt you that must have been a hard time that would explain why you couldnt touch me then either why everything you did the voice got harsher rasping was such a total fucking waste of time you were sad werent you poor guy that was it that was why you were so incompetent see theres always a reason if you look hard enough for it i wonder what it will be when you screw this one up itll be fun to find out glitsky wouldnt take the bait it did his heart good to see the real man for the first time he half turned then stopped facing dooher oh and hey good luck finding your wife i wonder why shed leave you a beat must have something to do with performance dooher couldnt sleep he kept coming back to farrell what made a man valuable was imposing his will on the world he lived in it was winning big risk big prize and he was the alpha male hed won hed beaten glitsky beaten farrell beaten the whole system and it got him the mate he wanted the prime female and now hes supposed to feel guilty please peddle that twaddle to one of the sheep he kept coming back to farrell the whiner selling his losers vision to christina by making marks guilt the big issue hed got her to leave him tearing apart what mark had earned naked he wandered through the big house the library the kitchen the living room where hed fucked wess wife he wondered if he knew he should tell him outside it was freezing but he liked it liked the midnight stroll down his driveway without his clothes on he was untouchable he could do whatever he wanted he let himself into the garage his m was tucked into its shelf high up over his workbench and he took it down unwrapping the cloth shooting the bolt sighting down the barrel an idea forming but no he couldnt use anything as obvious as a rifle that could be traced to him he put the gun down on the workbench and picked up a crowbar hefting it against his palm doubts had tossed him from side to side on the bed for hours doubts about who he was doubts that hed gotten himself to here by wanting too much by lying by lust by murder by all the cardinal sins now this his world imploding christina leaving him was his punishment and maybe he deserved it fuck that a violent shiver ran through him he felt some coil release inside him and he brought the crowbar down in a deafening crash shattering the wood scattering hardware and the nowbroken glass from the storage jars over the m and the rest of the workbench farrell was the prime mover here hed brought glitsky back into it again after it should have been long over somehow farrell convinced christina that she had to move out the selfrighteous son of a bitch farrell whod never succeeded at anything who believed in fair play and the goodness of man was a slinking dog compared to the men who walked on this earth how dare he presume to judge what mark had done but now it was clear farrell wouldnt rest until he had brought dooher down to his level he needed a lesson in where he belonged in what his station was in who made the rules dooher wasnt going to let this continue hed take care of it in short order set the world back straight then go reclaim what was his chapter fourty nine diane price volunteered at the center on tuesday nights and saturday mornings she picked up the phone when it rang at im looking for samantha duncans number im sorry diane said i cant give that out over the telephone but i can call her and have her get back to you a frustrated sigh its just ive been awake half the night and im starting well never mind that would be good if you could ask samantha to call me she gave her room number the motel and who should samantha ask for a long hesitation christina carrera youre mark doohers wife diane said thats right and clearly christina had no idea to whom she was talking who diane was she wondered briefly if she should tell her then decided against it what would be the point oh on the phone the woman gave a low moan followed by a succession of quick breaths are you all right the breathing slowed the voice was normal again i think i might be starting labor can you call sam ill call her right away irene carrera walked out on to the pool deck where bill was taking his morning laps she watched the effortless glide of his body through the blue water then her gaze went up and out over ojai the peace of it the order she pulled up one of the mouldediron chairs as bill executed a swimmers turn and headed back up to the deep end shed let him finish his workout a few more carefree moments before she disturbed him their daughter was in trouble again irene had just gotten off the phone with mark he told her he hadnt been completely truthful when theyd talked last night christina hadnt been home at that time in fact she hadnt come home at all she was staring again out over the serenity of her valley whats that look for she hadnt noticed that bill had finished and was walking toward her toweling off his usual easy smile in place there was no avoiding it she had to tell him a puppet whose strings got cut her husband slumped into another chair as she spoke to him irene continued mark said she called him last night told him she needed some time to think but wouldnt say where she was shes hiding out bill let out a deep sigh staring into the space between him and his wife shes delivering his baby any time now and shes hiding out irene nodded mark said shed been acting unstable the last couple of weeks skittish crying jags seeing ghosts everywhere he called to ask us what we thought he should do he sounded a wreck anguish now bill why wouldnt she have called us he barely trusted himself to speak he would go up and find her somehow help mark if he had to though hed never warmed to the man i dont know hon but wasnt it going so well hadnt she shaking his head interrupting she didnt want us to know he said she didnt want to disappoint us so she wont call us shell call but his face betrayed his words bill she stood and came up next to him put her arms around him i know what youre thinking but weve got to keep mark in this picture he said nothing hes her husband he still believes in her i heard it in his voice if we hear from her we have to tell her that you dont leave you dont always leave we dont know the whole story irene maybe mark drove her in some but she stepped away fire in her eyes no thats always been her excuse and it wasnt an excuse with brian irene the bastard was married to somebody else knocked her up and dumped her thats not an excuse all right but what about joe avery what about all the other men maybe they werent good enough for her she glared at him spoken like a true father bill what do you mean by that i am her true father and every time she left some man it was always okay because they werent good enough for her and every time it broke her heart a little more but it was okay it was okay she was still daddys little girl irene no listen shes almost thirty years old shes picked a good man im convinced of that a good man i dont know that bill you do then tell me why shes left him i dont know but he called us this isnt someone whos beating her shes never said a bad word about him he doesnt know what to do so he comes to us doesnt that tell you something isnt that a good sign he didnt want to hear it but it needed to be said bill she married him its time she learned thats where her life belongs with her husband not with us we love her but she cant keep coming back to us shell never grow up shell never have a life they faced each other in the calm ojai morning blue jays were fighting for territory in the air above them one of the canyons off to their left echoed with the howl of a coyote they went on the assumption that you always made mistakes which was how they thought theyd catch you dooher had to admit that even he had made a few well to be honest hed made none with nguyen but there had been a couple of small errors with trang the cellphone business how could anybody be expected to know about that but with trang theyd only gotten as far as an investigation with sheila they got him all the way to trial so by objective standards he supposed he was slipping hed been forced to hurry his plans after avery had gone down to la if he didnt move fast he ran a risk with christina someone else might have come along and distracted her and he would have been back to where he started so hed had to strike when he did but the lack of planning had showed the knives were one of the problems though he favored a knife because you had control you put it where it needed to go and held it there feeling the life slip away until you knew youd done it but a knife was too much trouble too dirty hed had to throw the bayonet off the golden gate hed thought hed solved the problem with the kitchen knife the gyrations with the blood and the glove and the botched burglary but that had been close his cleverness had nearly done him in hed really learned a lot the trial had been instructive that way there were phone trails paper trails evidence trails eyewitnesses and trackers among the police for each of them so this time from the moment he began to move he wouldnt leave any hint glitsky would know how could he not know but there would be nothing he could do he wasnt going to leave any messages on answering machines all saturday morning no one answered at wes and sams and he hung up as soon as he heard the message begin after hed made his decision last night sleep came more easily indecision was the ruin of lesser men hed set his body clock for around and called the carreras down in ojai if he was going to locate his wife he would need irene sam didnt pick up and diane price called christina back at her motel and asked if there was anything she could do how far apart are the contractions she asked not close seven minutes they warned us about this in lamaze they wont admit me until its two or three minutes its going to be a while why are you in a motel diane asked thats a long story is there anybody with you no i could come why would you do that you used to volunteer at the center here too didnt you us guys ought to stick together dont you think diane thought saying anything about the further connection between them at this moment would be counterproductive she heard the breathing again when it returned to normal diane spoke again ive been through this with two kids of my own christina i could keep you company we could talk you need somebody with you how are you getting to the hospital i dont know diane made up her mind ill be there in ten minutes christina opened the door to her motel room the woman was bundled for the chill heavy woolen coat enormous leather carryall designer ski cap pulled down over dense graying hair but she smiled warmly projecting a calm confidence that christina found comforting she had beautiful graygreen eyes there was also something familiar about her do i know you how did you know i was mark doohers wife the smile remained the eyes seemed to know everything she didnt move forward but seemed content to wait out in the cold until this was cleared up until christina had accepted it she might not after all want her around after she knew and that would certainly be understandable sam said you were smart a proffered hand im diane price its nice to meet you at last chapter fifty at wes picked up on the second ring heard mark doohers voice im going to start by apologizing he didnt reply dooher continued i was out of line i shouldnt have come by your house made cracks about your girlfriend he paused look wes christina ran out on me i freaked out im sorry okay youre sorry nice talking to you he hung up that was our friend mark dooher again he told sam he said he was sorry i told him i was glad for him the subject made her nervous but she played along that wasnt what you said you said it was nice talking to him it was farrell agreed we had a full and frank discussion of the issues the phone rang again dont pick it up sam said but he already had wes dont hang up please you still there im here what do you want sam was telling him to hang up again i need to talk to you it must be your lucky day you are talking to me no you and me privately farrells voice had no inflection ill drive the hordes away from the extensions were talking privately right now we can talk like this or you can hang up your call dooher measured his silence finally he produced a sigh i dont starting again i need your help your legal help i may want to talk to the police another silence to let the ramifications sink in i dont want to say anything specific on the telephone you can understand that you want to turn yourself in is that what youre saying i dont believe in telephones much anymore wes you could work something out i dont want to say anything else over these lines i need to see you is why i called i need your help i cant live with it anymore the little shamrock the bar where wes and sam had met the fog obscured nearly everything outside the picture windows across lincoln the cypresses were spectral shadows in the netherworld sam sat across the table from wes holding both of his hands in both of hers neither had touched their irish coffees that morning theyd bundled up and gone out early for an aerobic workout a power walk from their duplex to the beach and back the bay to breakers race miles from the ferry building to ocean beach was in two weeks and sam ran it every year wes had no desire to try to die crammed shoulder to shoulder with assorted crazed runners walkers naked folks crossdressers and caterpillar floats but he didnt mind the exercise leading up to it they werent talking about the race though wes i am begging you please dont do this hes going to give himself up sam he wants me to negotiate how its done give himself up for what i dont know trang maybe i dont trust him but some part of wes evidently still did im surprised its taken him this long christina left and that made him see it see what that its wrong to kill your wife a lot of people get that concept right away youd be surprised he said he needs to talk sam so do you really believe hes going to admit killing anybody that hell go to jail maybe living with the guilt is a kind of jail a motto for the ages wes but then again maybe it isnt maybe thats not him its everybody it catches up with everybody wes listen to me people do live with guilt you know this youve defended criminals your whole life people dont care about guilt they care about getting caught mark isnt most people hes got a conscience no he doesnt farrell shook his head sticking to his guns you dont know him i do know him hes a killer you didnt hear him on the phone he needs help ive got to help him somebody else can help him call one of your lawyer friends call glitsky hell help him farrell had to smile at that though it wasnt much of a light moment he squeezed her hands sam if he needs me how can i not help him what kind of man would that make me a live one again he shook his head rolled his eyes please please yourself wes hes killed three people why wouldnt he kill you why would he kill me thats a better question he pulled his hands away looked at his watch i told him id be over there at three ive got to go dont please for me he came around the table put his arm around her shoulders and drew her to him sam dont ask that this isnt me against you this is somebody ive known my whole life reaching out to the only person he trusts trying to save himself theres nothing to worry about i love you ill be home in a couple of hours if im going to be late for any reason at all ill call two hours max fourthirty he tightened his arm around her but she resisted no no standing up she pulled away knocking over their table he watched her half running through the bar through the double doors and out never looking back at him when she got home she let the tears go on for a while thats why shed run damned if she was going to use tears to make her point to convince him to stay although a part of her wished she had in the kitchen drying her eyes on a paper towel she noticed the message light flashing on her answering machine pushing the button she heard diane price saying that shed talked to christina carrera she was in labor since sam wasnt home and terri had come in for her shift at the center diane was going to help christina maybe drive her to the hospital if she needed it shed call back when she had more information sam glared malevolently at the machine where is she diane where is she but the machine provided no answer and neither did terri when sam called back to the center paul thieu was in a small internal room no windows in the hall of justice where hed spent most of the morning on the computer hoping to find some heretofore unknown reference to victor trang or chas brown or anyone whod known either of them he didnt really know what he was looking for but this was an unturned stone and there might be something under it but so far and it had been three hours nothing deciding to give it a rest for a while thieu got out of his program blanked the screen as far as he knew he was the only person in the building who logged off the computer when he was finished using it it was a small point of pride he interlaced his fingers behind his head and leaned back stretching timing his lieutenant abe glitsky in on a saturday pumped up knocked on the doorsill pulled up a chair our plan wont work glitsky had dreamed it up and run it by thieu last night after hed returned from doohers the younger man had liked it theyd run a sting farrell was a real ally he could reestablish his contact with dooher and either wear a wire or failing that simply try to provoke him as glitsky had when he went to his house farrell would get him to say something incriminating the veneer had begun to crack they could get him but glitsky didnt think so anymore why not farrell is doohers lawyer anything they say is privileged thieu had thought of this and sold himself on a rebuttal to it he wont take a retainer hell go to dooher as a friend the relationship wont be a professional one glitsky told him this was wishful thinking besides if farrell denies it dooher will say he was the lawyer and farrell was his client it wont get past the da a scowl i hate it when youre right you know that i dont blame you my kids do too its infuriating glitsky had become almost human there is something else we can try a long shot is it legal glitskys expression conveyed shock that thieu could even think such a thing forget what he says try to make him do something what what physical evidence did we get with trang clothes the bayonet shoes nothing right which means tell me thieu thought a moment i give up it means he got rid of it he stabbed the guy and held him close and he got blood on himself then he had to get rid of what he wore no way around it another bad idea thieu was thinking abe this was two years ago those clothes all that stuff is gone burned up disintegrated not his rolex not sheilas jewelry thieu kept shaking his head the lieutenant must be tired you just said it the rolex was his wifes murder the burglary it isnt trang we cant touch it that stuffs been pawned anyway i dont think so paul we looked hard when it was fresh it didnt get fenced he got rid of it which makes it gone am i right but maybe not forgotten farrell righted the table in the shamrock he went into the bathroom and got most of the irish coffee washed off his pants he hadnt intended for sam to get so mad for himself to get so defensive they were both too hotheaded dooher the source of every fight theyd ever had disgusted he came out of the bathroom and pulled up a stool at the bar he was going to have a long beer and chill out and be late for his appointment with mark too bad let his exfriend wait for once he ordered a bass and put a napkin on his lap soaking up more of the damp the bartenders name was moses mcguire he was approaching his sixth decade with a new wife and a young child and seemed determined not to go placidly amid the noise and haste remembering what peace there may be in silence his nose had recently been broken for about the fifth time some unpleasantness about a softball game and he sported two black eyes and a bandage during farrells blue period as he called it he had spent more time here with mcguire than he had at his apartment with bart which had endeared farrell to mcguire the bass came sliding across the rail and mcguire leaned over smiling everything patched up between you lovebirds farrell sighed shes mad at me i guessed that i dont blame her theyre always right you know i dont know why we argue with em he sipped at his ale i know mcguire got called away on an emergency down by the picture window tommy a fixture had finished his fourth millers of the day and was slapping the latest empty on the bar there was more truth than farrell wanted to admit in what mcguire had said which of course meant that there was more truth than hed acknowledged in what sam was saying mark dooher was a dangerous man who studied his prey he knew trang worked alone and would meet him alone hed known sheila would never refuse a drink even a mickey that he put in her hand he knew farrell was an idealist who believed in the goodness of man in confessions healing power in forgiveness he also knew he would come when beckoned so dooher had beckoned and farrell was going chapter fifty one dooher looked wrung out with bags under his eyes and a deep pallor to his skin under an uncharacteristic stubble he wore a sam spade overcoat an old felt hat and a pair of tattered running shoes a grieving husband he blew out in frustration christinas got to call somebody wouldnt you think who would she call i dont know not me dooher stepped out on to his porch about last night i dont know what to say farrell waved it off we going somewhere theres something i want to show you i bet your heater still doesnt work good bet farrell said well take the lexus that all right sure they walked back down the driveway past the infamous side door farrell let dooher go into the garage he waited outside nervous the garage door opened and dooher backed out sliding into the passenger seat farrell noticed that he d put on his driving gloves and cast him a sideways look dooher gave him a weak smile alea jacta est i guess the die is cast they both understood the reference julius caesars words as he crossed the rubicon after which he would either rule rome or be killed as a threat to the republic dooher was saying he was crossing over taking the irrevocable step he was going to turn himself in he put the car in gear and they began to move they drove out to the beach up to golden gate park back halfway through it then south on sunset boulevard a straight and usually scenic shot to lake merced today in the fog the scenic aspect wasnt evident but the road wasnt crowded and dooher drove slowly talking about the lives theyd lived together trying farrells patience finally he couldnt listen to it anymore i didnt come out here with you to talk about old times mark to talk about us you said you had something to show me you want to tell me what it is the everenigmatic dooher didnt answer directly i want you to understand what happened wes thats what i want what you want isnt a burning issue with me anymore im not going to understand what you did thats not going to happen dooher kept driving eyes on the road and what did i do you killed sheila mark you may have killed victor trang too andre nguyen how am i supposed to understand that did i ever say i had fuck you mark let me out pull over but he didnt he kept driving you think i did all that i know you did some of it and any part of its enough christ you all but told me after the trial dooher was shaking his head no you misinterpreted that bullshit shrugging dooher kept his tone relaxed you wearing a wire wes glitsky hook you up thats why you really agreed to come today isnt it to set me up the great manipulator was wearing farrell down theres no wire mark i came because you called me and thats who i am he said i didnt call you you called me you couldnt take it anymore whatever it is remember dooher spent a long time not saying anything driving slowly through the deep fog finally he sighed heavily what do i need to do what do you want me to do i want my wife back there was real anguish in his voice i want you to forgive me farrell asked him to pull over at a gas station just off sloat boulevard theyd made a big circle from where theyd begun in st francis wood he had he believed forced the play though it wasnt over yet he told dooher he had to use the can this wasnt true it was nearing the time hed told sam he would be home and he wasnt going to make it he didnt want her to worry i know i said two hours but i was late getting here i had another beer is why another hour tops no listen its perfectly safe hes sam hes beaten an earful i know that too no were one more hour i promise he had more to say but she hung up on him contractions every four minutes three centimeters dilated three only three ive got to be more than three diane was next to christina in one of the labor rooms at st marys holding her hand doling out ice chips jess yamagi christinas doctor checked the monitors ignoring her outburst everythings going along fine he said but its going to be a while he gave her a reassuring pat and turned to diane you okay with this she nodded im here for the duration you bring along any music yamagi asked you could use a phone if you want youre going to have some time christina might as well enjoy it another contraction began and diane helped her breathe through it yamagi was frowning at the monitors what christina asked nothing a dip in the babys heartbeat its normal during contractions well keep an eye on it christina looked over at the beeping machine ill take that phone now where are you hon mom its okay im okay im in labor at st marys everythings fine wheres mark is he with you he called this morning hes so worried no mom no mark isnt here he said youd left him she didnt have the strength to come out with all of it she sighed just for now mom until we figure some things out cant you figure them out together chris having a baby thats a time you cant get back i know that but it was so tiring trying to explain mom you have to trust me everything will be all right ill tell you all about it after the babys born but mark he deserves to mom please dont tell him dont say anything to mark promise me farrells rising hopes when hed called sam had been dashed when he got back in the car the critical moment dooher vulnerable had shifted again dooher had begun driving heading north now he had not yet confessed and farrell was at the end of his tolerance this wasnt going to work suddenly he saw it clearly hard by the golden gate bridge is a parking area favored by pedestrians who want to walk the three miles across it sepulchral in the fog the place was otherwise deserted now in the late afternoon a perennial gale battered the evergreens that bordered the northern lip of the lot where below the trees a cliff dropped nearly a hundred feet to the beach below dooher parked the car opened his door and got out farrell sat a minute in his seat then did the same they heard the foghorns moaning deeply the wind here on the headland raking the trees what are we doing here farrell asked youll see this is it what i wanted to show you come on walk with me out on the bridge farrell took a few steps then stopped im not going with you mark you can tell me here dooher wasnt giving up im not going to throw you off wes is that what youre thinking im thinking that im done im going home doohers face clouded what do you mean i mean i thought you needed me id give you a chance but you dont want a chance you want me out of the way dooher stepped close hurt wes this is me mark dooher weve been friends since weve been kids its paranoid to think thats right it may be and you think i would dooher couldnt even say it it was too absurd over everyones advice mark i wanted to help you be your lawyer and maybe even your friend one last time now ive got to tell you its going to be over soon and youre going to need a lawyer and its not going to be me he hesitated then came out with it glitsky knows where you hid the stuff doohers face cracked slightly he moved toward farrell it was a flat and desolate stretch of bare earth thirty yards deep by eighty in length really not much more than a widening of the western shoulder of lake merced boulevard though hidden from the road itself by a stand of windbent dwarf cypress the lexus inched forward over the area to where it dropped off steeply dooher pulled the car up near to the edge here an eastern finger of the lake extended nearly to the fence that bordered it inaccessible from shore it was rarely fished it was also deep the underwater topography continuing the steep slant that dropped off from the turnout in the fog the lake itself was only intermittently visible dooher put the car into park but didnt turn off the engine under his driving gloves his hands hurt but they were not bleeding he got out and walked to the edge looking out over the water then around behind him it was as it always was no sign of anyone at the edge of the lot the incline fell off at a good angle for perhaps forty feet of sedge grass dotted with scrub brush dooher picked his way down hands in his pockets crabwalking when his head got below the level of the lot the minimal road noise from sunset dissipated and he suddenly heard the lap of the lakewater this was where hed ditched the evidence within twenty minutes dooher was in his garage placing the running shoes into the bottom of the grocery bag then the gloves carefully folding the old sam spade overcoat so that it fit he put the bag on to the passenger seat of the lexus and drove the halfmile to ocean avenue where he left it in the side doorway of the st vincent de paul thrift shop back in his kitchen he realized hed worked up an appetite so he poured himself a glass of milk and grabbed a handful of frozen chocolate chip cookies then went to the phone to call irene carrera see if shed heard yet from her daughter chapter fifty two three generations of glitskys were at the movies watching james and the giant peach when the beeper on abes belt began vibrating he reached over his youngest son and nudged his fathers arm holding up the little black box back in five he said nat caught up in the animation barely nodded in the lobby he faced the disorientation hed always experienced when he saw movies in the daytime even on such dark days as this one but his eyes adjusted and he checked the readout walked to the pay phone and punched up the numbers lieutenant this is sam duncan wes farrells friend sure is wes there no thats why im calling i dont know what else to do mark dooher called wes earlier today and asked him to meet with him glitsky was aware of the muscle that began working in his jaw he convinced wes he was going to turn himself in i know what i knew that he paged me and i called him back at some bar he told me all about it hes not back yet you let him go how could you let him go mark doohers a murderer and now hes probably still at doohers he was meeting him there right have you tried calling there i just did theres nobody home no answer wes said hed be home in two hours then he called to say he was going to be later its been almost four hours now thats why i called you somethings happened he would have called me again he knew i was worried he would have called glitsky was silent for a long moment lieutenant im here im thinking have you tried his office an exasperated sigh ive tried everywhere lieutenant dooher called him and he went and glitsky chewed the side of his mouth another second or two then made his decision this time he was moving out before he was certain there had been a crime if it was before if it wasnt already too late irene carrera debated with herself over the right thing to do the birth of a child was the strongest bonding experience a couple could have together she was torn distraught mark had called her again please as soon as irene heard anything hed implored her would she call and let him know he was desperate he needed her and though christina might not realize it herself he told irene her daughter needed him too it had ripped irene up having to lie to mark not even to tell him that shed heard from christina but what else could she do irene wrestled with it couldnt get it worked out she wished bill were here they would come to the right decision together she knew hed be calling her when he got to san francisco but first he had to take the afternoon shuttle from santa barbara to lax then wait for his evening flight he wouldnt get there until very late tonight meanwhile irene knew that if christina succeeded in excluding her husband from this moment of birth there was a far greater chance that they would never be able to patch up whatever had come between them on the other hand if mark were there with her if they went through it together husband and wife it might be the very last chance for christinas happiness even though it would be against her daughters express wishes in the pink moment irene paced the ridge of her property overlooking the valley agonizing over the greater good glitsky left orel with his grandfather at the movies and ran a block and a half to where hed parked his cityissue car he made it to doohers house by seven oclock he should have heard from paul thieu long ago he tried to page him but there was no response what was going on where had everything gone wrong glitsky didnt much care about probable cause anymore with mark dooher he was going to take the man downtown on some pretext get him off the streets before he struck again the house on ravenwood street was dark dooher wasnt there but glitsky got out of his car wanting to make sure crossing the front patio getting to the porch ringing the bell waiting empty there was no way he could explain away his actions to anyone if he were discovered he would be reprimanded perhaps fired he was wearing his own pair of gloves standing inside a suspects house he had entered without permission and without a warrant and that was the plain fact of it he was in the wrong the side door by the driveway had been left unlocked so dooher hadnt lied about everything during his trial hed testified and standing under the cold and darkened portico glitsky had remembered that he tended to leave the side door unlocked when he went out the alarm deactivated now he stood in the kitchen where so long ago hed sat and had tea with sheila dooher when hed come in he turned on the light in the laundry and the overflow lit the counters dimly on the way here hed considered pulling over and making a another call to sam duncan bringing her up to date on farrell but there was no uptodate with farrell he might be going to die if he wasnt dead already what could he tell her that couldnt wait another hour until they knew something but here in the kitchen it gnawed at him again he remembered the last moments with flo where he hadnt been able to do anything but had sat by the bed holding her hand perhaps shed felt something some pressure from him some love in the last seconds maybe it had made some difference digging in his breast pocket he fished out the piece of paper on which hed written sams number hed at least tell her what he knew he crossed the kitchen in a few strides stood by the telephone hesitated briefly then picked it up but instead of punching sams numbers he noticed the redial key and without really considering pressed it there were eleven quick beeps long distance hello a pleasant cultured female voice hello this is lieutenant abraham glitsky san francisco homicide who am i speaking with please oh my god homicide yes maam in san francisco who am i is christina all right tell me shes all right christina christina carrera my daughter is she all right i dont know maam i hope so right now im trying to locate her husband mark dooher do you know where he might be he said he was going directly to the hospital the hospital what hospital why was he going to the hospital to be with christina shes at st marys in labor shes having her baby and dooher knows shes there yes i told him the voice had lost its modulation when was this i dont know exactly maybe a halfhour ago not even that long he called me again and i just thought glitsky didnt need to hear any more chapter fifty three diane was in the postdelivery room she squeezed christinas hand its all right she said youre allowed to cry hes beautiful handsome i mean beautiful christina said jess yamagi leaned over her laid a finger against the babys cheek brought his hand up to christinas shoulder im going to let you hold him for a couple of minutes chris but his temperature is a degree or two low which is perfectly normal were going to put him under the lamp and warm him up until hes stabilized and then what then we wash him off and bundle him up and bring him to you meanwhile you get a little rest if you can he squeezed her shoulder you did good chris great job you too diane christina couldnt take her eyes from her baby who seemed to be staring back at her shed always thought that infants were born with their eyes closed but her son was wideeyed memorizing her a nurse appeared and showed christina the little plastic hospital tag they put around the babys ankle baby boy dooher her husbands name startled her slightly but the tag was already made up it wasnt so important it had to be changed right away everybody worries were going to mix up their children in the nursery so we show you this to put your mind at ease the nurse went on all the babies get one diane volunteered christina was staring through the mist down at her son id know this guy anywhere i could pick him out of a thousand other babies the nurse smiled again i know you could sweetheart then picking him up hell be back in no time dont worry it wrenched her to have the baby taken but it wouldnt be for very long it was a normal procedure she turned to diane the rock and squeezed her hand again the fatigue kicking in shed just close her eyes for a minute like the rest of life it was simplicity itself if carried off with grace and assurance dooher was the natural father of the child the legal father he had as much right to be here as christina did im sorry im so late he said to the nurse at the admitting station after hed presented his id proving that he was who he said he was im just in from the airport ive been back east all week i knew this would happen when i was out of town i knew it how is christina the nurse doublechecked his id then christinas admitting record verifying that yes he was the husband they lived at the same address they were careful here babies had been known to disappear looking up satisfied the nurse seemed to see mark for the first time the nervous father your wife got moved to her room a couple of minutes ago mr dooher room right down that hallway shes resting now doing fine and congratulations you have a baby boy dr yamagi diagnosed the lieutenant to be on the edge of hysteria his blue eyes were dilated in his darkskinned face an unusual combination but the man glitsky wasnt here about genetics hed come in through the emergency entrance always a fun place on a saturday night probably so that he could park as close to the hospital as possible waste no time yes i delivered the dooher boy yamagi said maybe fortyfive minutes ago is the mother all right christina yes she was anyway why glitsky didnt answer that question he had his own have you seen the father mark dooher has he been here yamagi shook his head no christina had a friend helping her diane this name didnt seem to register id like to see them talk to her she may be resting glitsky nodded ill wake her up the doctor rode up the elevator with the silent homicide lieutenant they passed the nurses station without a word and yamagi escorted glitsky into the maternity wing itself past the double doorway that segregated the new mothers from the sick and the injured this was the happy part of the hospital with bright stencils decorating the walls and the hallway filled with flowers and balloons and somehow a sense of optimism glitsky noted it all but little of it registered yamagi pushed open a door at the end of the hall room the overhead light was turned off but glitsky recognized christina in her bed her eyes closed under a directional light another woman was reading modern maternity she looked up when the men entered breaking into a welcoming smile at yamagi then a questioning glance at glitsky she dropped her magazine into the carryall shoulder purse on the floor next to her chair she stood up hi doctor shes sleeping no thats all right diane im awake christina was already pushing herself upright getting ready to hold her son is the baby here she opened her eyes trying to get focused she took in diane and yamagi then blinked as though having trouble with her vision lieutenant glitsky he nodded ms carrera what are you doing she came straight up grimacing with effort my son is my son all right hes fine yamagi answered reassuringly well have him in here in a couple of minutes christina leaned back relief all over her yamagi came up to the bed he held the switch to raise one end of it propping christina into a more comfortable position you get some rest she nodded a little you ready for your boy please okay ill pass the word and theyll bring him along then lieutenant is everything here okay for you glitsky had already checked the corners it was a private room with no place to hide mark dooher wasnt here good yamagi looked at his watch christina be sure to ask for help if you need anything theyll wheel in another bed if you want diane to stay ill be back first thing in the morning you want me to show you the way out lieutenant glitsky didnt like this he didnt know what had happened with farrell dooher knew christina had come here and yet apparently he hadnt something wasnt right maybe a lot of things id like to stay on a minute i have a couple of questions this wouldnt have been yamagis choice but christina read the indecision in his face and spoke up its okay with me yamagi yielded id appreciate it if you kept it short then all of you as the door closed behind the doctor glitsky took a step toward the bed have you seen your husband i was sure he was coming here why would he be here he doesnt know im here glitsky considered that he had to tell her yes he does your mother told him a long dead moment as it sank in dooher didnt go right in to see christina he needed to see her all right to explain things but he wanted to find his baby first that would make it all clearer he looked through the glass and read the identifying tag baby boy dooher was under the warming light a tiny red heart was stuck to his chest keeping track of his temperature he pushed open the door to the newborn nursery inside he stood quietly the proud new father overwhelmed with emotion a little lost a pretty young nurse approached him can i help you sir in the role dooher gave her his best smile shading it with a touch of selfdeprecation my new boy i saw him through the glass in there i just got here i missed the birth i wonder if i could hold him a second its the dooher baby he had his identification out again and this nurse too looked it over then handed it back to him but she was shaking her head its against the rules technically im sorry he sighed heartbroken met her eyes at home he d showered and shaved then dressed with casual elegance he looked good and he knew it well i certainly dont want to break any rules the nurse looked into the adjoining spaces around behind her she leaned in toward him ill get you a mask she said well make an exception youll have to wash your hands they were going to be bundling the boy up right now his mother had asked for him would mr dooher like to take the baby in to his wife that would be great he said id like that what hed do he thought was act like shed never left him like it had never happened he would let her know that he understood what had happened her emotions had gotten the better of her and shed given into panic shed be vulnerable right now and he didnt want to scare her away he would be kind and gentle solicitous he had to prove to her that she could trust him she had always been able to trust him whatever he might have done he wouldnt do anything to hurt her but the situation would also work to his advantage hed walk into her room and shed see him holding the baby he had gotten to their son in the hospital without her knowing about it she couldnt have stopped him whatever she had done a message would get delivered there now wouldnt it he wouldnt have to say a thing she would come back to him they wouldnt ever have to mention these past couple of days this was how training worked there had to be periods of pain of testing of finding out how far the chain would go until you felt it choke well christina had found out dooher didnt remember the births or much of the infancy of his other children hed been putting in yeoman hours when theyd been born in those days men went to work they didnt change diapers so the size of this baby surprised him so small nearly weightless they had wrapped it tight it arms cocooned in its blue blanket the nurse hed charmed earlier escorted him out of the nursery reminding him to keep the neck supported to cover the head and shield it from any drafts while they were in the hallway at the door to dooher turned to her would you mind if i just go in alone and surprise her who could say no to such a reasonable request christina was looking past glitsky the door was beginning to open and it would be the nurse with her no this couldnt be in her dreams something like this would happen but this wasnt a dream dooher stopped inside the door well look at this a little impromptu party corporal glitsky of all people no one said a word dooher made sure the door was closed behind him his eyes swept the room and alighted on diane price whos this he asked christina spoke up protectively shes a nurse practitioner here mark she helped with the labor dooher accepted this well thank you very much a shift of focus and how are you christina she forced herself to speak calmly im fine mark it went all right no real complications im glad a pause though it wasnt exactly how we planned was it im sorry she said her eyes never left her son i dont know what happened yesterday mark i guess i lost sight of things for a minute i guess so that happens sometimes moments of stress another silence can i have my baby please i have to feed it actually he smiled at her its not just your baby its our baby isnt that right of course thats what i meant its our baby i meant our baby she held out her hands and hes hungry mark thank you for bringing him in but ill take him now okay he shook his head no i dont think so not quite yet he didnt even recognize her diane wasnt prepared for the wave of anger that swept over her he looked impossibly the same as she remembered him from college and now he stared directly at her and saw nothing she wasnt there it all flooded back the experience was etched in acid afterward she had been curled up on the top of her bed great pain down there too hurt for tears this couldnt have happened to her her blouse torn open had been still around her shoulders a distinct memory she remembered lying there in a fetal position holding the scrap of her blouse collar in her fist as though it offered some protection hed ripped the rest off he was pulling up his pants tucking himself in she could still hear the sound his breath had made hed said nothing when he looked down at her just like now she hadnt been there she found herself speaking in the same even tones christina had been using the baby needs to be fed sir he didnt like the diversion snapped at her im talking to my wife the baby needs to be fed diane repeated this time dooher glared at her who are you do i know you glitsky broke in give her the kid dooher a disappointed expression not right yet private christina and i have a few things weve got to work out first he turned to her i want you back home christina was glued to the child i was upset mark with the hormones i guess i got scared of course ill come back youre the father id never think of raising the boy without his father it seemed to anger him further youre just trying to get your hands on this baby arent you christina youd say anything now wouldnt you no thats not true but the baby is hungry mark he hasnt eaten yet christina had reintroduced diane to glitsky so he knew who she was it would complicate matters if dooher realized it glitsky had his gun inside his jacket hed drawn it only occasionally in his career and had never fired it at a person if this turned out to be the first time he wanted to know what was behind his target he moved to his left stay where you are dooher backed up a step a wider angle on the room whatever youre trying to do its a bad idea im not doing anything youre moving i dont want you to move and if i do what then are you threatening to hurt your baby if i do is that it it didnt faze him im holding my child sergeant thats all what are you doing here i heard you were here i wanted to talk about wes farrell a turn of his mouth i dont know anything about wes farrell the baby mewled quietly christina mark please let me hold him glitsky looked to christina back to mark let her have him dooher he shook the baby shushed at it dont shake him diane said you shut up im talking to the corporal here diane saw it clearly he was going to wind up killing the child all right glitsky said talk to me i told you i dont know anything about farrell we were supposed to have a meeting today he didnt show up glitsky was impassive we found him he wasnt dead not yet christina was staring at dooher oh god mark not wes not your best friend glitsky pushed at it you thought the fall finished him didnt you i dont know what youre talking about the baby began to cry please mark let me take him he shook his head at his wife backed up another step looking down at the infant shh at christina wes wasnt any friend of mine hes the one who poisoned you about me who made you leave me so you killed him glitsky said the baby wailed shh more roughly shhh dont shake him please dont shake him mark but he was back on glitsky holding the baby against his shoulder both hands around the tiny body shaking him up and down i thought you said he wasnt dead when we found him i said when we found him he wasnt dead glitsky played the trump we followed you to the lake from where who did what are you talking about give it up dooher its over we know where to look were going to find everything arent we and then what you find a bag of wet clothes big deal you cant connect them to me i dont need to i can connect farrell to you dooher shook his head you cant prove anything just like with trang just like with sheila that old proof keeps on fucking with you doesnt it private so wes farrell fell off a cliff he died so what glitskys scar stretched white through his lips so he didnt die thats what dooher took in a breath he nodded bitterly amused as if wes farrell matters he pulled the child closer to him holding it with one arm pointing with the other you think sheila victor trang wes farrell you think i feel bad for what happened the baby began crying again and he pulled it roughly against him pressing the infants face into his body mark please youre hurting him diane was in slomo she stood up she lifted the purse from the floor sit down dooher barked at her no she took a step toward him christina pleading please diane no mark just let him breathe let your son breathe dooher pointed at his wife i had to have you dont you understand that after the trial i told wes i was sorry for what id put him through if id made life hard for him id make it up to him christina had her hands out the baby the baby anything he said just let her have the baby okay mark fine we can talk about that he included glitsky this nigger cant prove anything theyll never convict me we could start again christina i could make it up to you i could dooher glitsky said let the baby go diane moved forward he glared across at her i told you to stop right there give me the baby she said back off dooher slammed a palm against the wall behind him what do you think youre doing the baby got a breath and managed another piercing yell dooher took it in both of his hands he held it up in front of him he kept shaking it shut up damn it shut up diane price dropped her carryall purse to the floor and lunged forward glitsky started to react reached inside his jacket there was no time the gun was a metallic blur in her right hand moving toward doohers head the sharp flat report she let the gun fall it clattered to the floor diane grabbed for the child as dooher collapsed the room hung for an instant in surreal suspension glitsky smelled the cordite his hand was still on his own weapon but there was no need it was over the baby began crying again diane was bringing it over to christina when the door flew open a nurse and two attendants rushing in after the noise from the shot they stopped in the doorway diane laid christinas son in her arms he was killing the baby she said i had to stop him that would be her story glitsky knew it was a good one her eyes pleaded with him did he understand what she was saying guy says hes sorry and thinks thats enough i dont think so glitsky nodded at her he was going to arrest her but she posed no danger at the moment he held out a hand to stop the influx of other staff crowding to the door he crossed the room and went down to one knee next to the still and crumpled body almost as an afterthought he picked up the small gun he felt for a pulse the throat at the carotid artery twitched once under his fingers then he felt nothing he leaned over closer its lieutenant he whispered chapter fifty four after his fight with sam in his heart farrell had still wanted to believe that dooher was turning himself in that the guilt had gotten to him but the more he considered it the wiser it seemed to cover his bases so hed called glitsky and the lieutenant had given him his marching orders in the event that dooher did not confess if the meeting began to look like an ambush farrell was to extricate himself as quickly as he could remembering to drop the bait glitsky knows where you hid the stuff thieu would be tailing them so the threat to farrell would be minimal minimal farrell had liked that it was a gamble but their only chance if dooher took the bait if he went to make sure his hiding place was still secure thieu would follow dooher would lead them to the evidence thieu would call glitsky when hed found something and thats what had happened but not soon enough for farrell they hadnt planned on the fog and theyd underestimated doohers dispatch always stronger faster more determined than farrell dooher had walked up close concealing his intention then come at him like an enraged bull a blow to the solar plexus then another to the face had driven farrell backward and dooher had kept coming forcing him off the pavement on to the steep angle under the trees all the way to where the land fell off and the air began now monday thieu and glitsky were playing lunchtime chess at one of the open tables on market street the sun was bright overhead the air still glitsky was thinking mate in three moves but his concentration got diverted when a barechested man in sandals and shorts stopped to watch the endgame carrying an enormous wooden cross he just stood there looking on with his companion who was a fashionably dressed businesswoman in her midthirties the cross glitsky noticed had a wheel at its base to facilitate pulling the thing along he moved his bishop and the man shook his head blew it he said and moved on pulling his cross chatting with his friend daily life in the city studying the board glitsky realized the man was right thieu made his move one move and tried not to smile it wasnt a really good try though glitsky started putting away his pieces his brow was not clear throughout the game theyd been discussing their sting operation how it had gone so wrong i still dont understand how you lost farrell thieu was holding the bag i didnt lose farrell i never had farrell you followed him glitsky said thieu explained what had happened two cars abe he said we always tail with two cars you know that we waited by the lot by the bridge when they pulled in there when the lexus pulled out i followed dooher down to merced there was nothing to call you about until we found the bags the guys in the second car didnt find farrell right away and they had better things to do than report to us like get him out of there try to keep him alive what im curious about is the price woman after this glitsky was laconic odds are shell get her movie deal not precisely what i meant abe i know paul i know what you meant they crossed market negotiating a stalled mini bus spewing out a stream of unhappy campers when they had forded it glitsky told thieu that the da hadnt yet decided on the charge for price my guess is reston will go with manslaughter shell plead and get some community service maybe not even that if i have any real influence which i dont community service for killing a guy using deadly force paul to save a life the situation called for it i was there he was going to kill the baby thats what im going to say its what prices lawyer is going to say itll fly thieu was skeptical how was dooher going to do that exactly kill the kid i mean did he have a gun a knife what was he going to do he was shaking it kills infants every day you know that paul weve got that nice poster on the column never never never shake a baby im sure youve seen it so she had to shoot him dead glitsky shrugged mustve seemed like a good idea at the time youre cute with those tubes coming out of you mmmmfff i know i agree oh listen i brought you a present
