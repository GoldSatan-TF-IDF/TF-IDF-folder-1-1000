laurell k hamilton circus of the damned book of the anita blake vampire hunter series there was dried chicken blood imbedded under my fingernails when you raise the dead for a living you have to spill a little blood it clung in flaking patches to my face and hands id tried to clean the worst of it off before coming to this meeting but some things only a shower would fix i sipped coffee from a personalized mug that said piss me off pay the consequences and stared at the two men sitting across from me mr jeremy ruebens was short dark and grumpy id never seen him when he wasnt either frowning or shouting his small features were clustered in the middle of his face as if some giant hand had mashed them together before the clay had dried his hands smoothed over the lapel of his coat the dark blue tie tie clip white shirt collar his hands folded in his lap for a second then began their dance again coat tie tie clip collar lap i figured i could stand to watch him fidget maybe five more times before i screamed for mercy and promised him anything he wanted the second man was karl inger id never met him before he was a few inches over six feet standing he had towered over ruebens and me a wavy mass of shortcut red hair graced a large face he had honesttogod muttonchop sideburns that grew into one of the fullest mustaches id ever seen everything was neatly trimmed except for his unruly hair maybe he was having a bad hair day ruebenss hands were making their endless dance for the fourth time four was my limit i wanted to go around the desk grab his hands and yell stop that but i figured that was a little rude even for me i dont remember you being this twitchy ruebens i said he glanced at me twitchy i motioned at his hands making their endless circuit he frowned and placed his hands on top of his thighs they remained there motionless selfcontrol at its best i am not twitchy miss blake its ms blake and why are you so nervous mr ruebens i sipped my coffee i am not accustomed to asking help from people like you people like me i made it a question he cleared his throat sharply you know what i mean no mr ruebens i dont well a zombie queen he stopped in midsentence i was getting pissed and it must have shown on my face no offense he said softly if you came here to call me names get the hell out of my office if you have real business state it then get the hell out of my office ruebens stood up i told you she wouldnt help us help you do what you havent told me a damn thing i said perhaps we should just tell her why we have come inger said his voice was a deep rumbling bass pleasant ruebens drew a deep breath and let it out through his nose very well he sat back down in his chair the last time we met i was a member of humans against vampires i nodded encouragingly and sipped my coffee i have since started a new group humans first we have the same goals as hav but our methods are more direct i stared at him havs main goal was to make vampires illegal again so they could be hunted down like animals it worked for me i used to be a vampire slayer hunter whatever now i was a vampire executioner i had to have a death warrant to kill a specific vampire or it was murder to get a warrant you had to prove the vampire was a danger to society which meant you had to wait for the vampire to kill people the lowest kill was five humans the highest was twentythree that was a lot of dead bodies in the good ol days you could just kill a vampire on sight what exactly does more direct methods mean you know what it means ruebens said no i said i dont i thought i did but he was going to have to say it out loud hav has failed to discredit vampires through the media or the political machine humans first will settle for destroying them all i smiled over my coffee mug you mean kill every last vampire in the united states that is the goal he said its murder you have slain vampires do you really believe it is murder it was my turn to take a deep breath a few months ago i would have said no but now i just didnt know im not sure anymore mr ruebens if the new legislation goes through ms blake vampires will be able to vote doesnt that frighten you yes i said then help us quit dancing around ruebens just tell me what you want very well then we want the daytime resting place of the master vampire of the city i just looked at him for a few seconds are you serious i am in deadly earnest ms blake i had to smile what makes you think i know the masters daytime retreat it was inger who answered ms blake come now if we can admit to advocating murder then you can admit to knowing the master he smiled ever so gently tell me where you got the information and maybe ill confirm it or maybe i wont his smile widened just a bit now whos dancing he had a point if i say i know the master what then give us his daytime resting place ruebens said he was leaning forward an eager nearly lustful look on his face i wasnt flattered it wasnt me getting his rocks off it was the thought of staking the master how do you know the master is a he there was an article in the postdispatch it was careful to mention no name but the creature was clearly male ruebens said i wondered how jeanclaude would like being referred as a creature better not to find out i give you an address and you go in and what stake him through the heart ruebens nodded inger smiled i shook my head i dont think so you refuse to help us ruebens asked no i simply dont know the daytime resting place i was relieved to be able to tell the truth you are lying to protect him ruebens said his face was growing darker deep frown wrinkles showed on his forehead i really dont know mr ruebens mr inger if you want a zombie raised we can talk otherwise i let the sentence trail off and gave them my best professional smile they didnt seem impressed we consented to meeting you at this ungodly hour and we are paying a handsome fee for the consultation i would think the least you could do is be polite i wanted to say you started it but that would sound childish i offered you coffee you turned it down ruebenss scowl deepened little anger lines showing around his eyes do you treat all your customers this way the last time we met you called me a zombieloving bitch i dont owe you anything you took our money my boss did that we met you here at dawn ms blake surely you can meet us halfway i hadnt wanted to meet with ruebens at all but after bert took their money i was sort of stuck with it id set the meeting at dawn after my nights work but before i went to bed this way i could drive home and get eight hours uninterrupted sleep let ruebenss sleep be interrupted could you find out the location of the masters retreat inger asked probably but if i did i wouldnt give it to you why not he asked because she is in league with him ruebens said hush jeremy ruebens opened his mouth to protest but inger said please jeremy for the cause ruebens struggled visibly to swallow his anger but he choked it down control why not ms blake ingers eyes were very serious the pleasant sparkle seeping away like melting ice ive killed master vampires before none of them with a stake how then i smiled no mr inger if you want lessons in vampire slaying youre going to have to go elsewhere just by answering your questions i could be charged as an accessory to murder would you tell us if we had a better plan inger said i thought about that for a minute jeanclaude dead really dead it would certainly make my life easier but but i dont know i said why not because i think hell kill you i dont give humans over to the monsters mr inger not even people who hate me we dont hate you ms blake i motioned with the coffee mug towards ruebens maybe you dont but he does ruebens just glared at me at least he didnt try to deny it if we come up with a better plan can we talk to you again inger asked i stared at ruebenss angry little eyes sure why not inger stood and offered me his hand thank you ms blake you have been most helpful his hand enveloped mine he was a large man but he didnt try using his size to make me feel small i appreciated that the next time we meet anita blake you will be more cooperative ruebens said that sounded like a threat jerry ruebens smiled a most unpleasant smile humans first believes the means justifies the end anita i opened my royal purple suit jacket inside was a shoulder holster complete with a browning hipower mm the purple skirts thin black belt was just sturdy enough to be looped through the shoulder holster executive terrorist chic when it comes to survival jerry i believe that too we have not offered you violence inger said no but ol jerry here is thinking about it i just want him and the rest of your little group to believe im serious mess with me and people are going to die there are dozens of us ruebens said and only one of you yeah but whos going to be first in line i said enough of this jeremy ms blake we didnt come here to threaten you we came for your help we will come up with a better plan and talk to you again dont bring him i said of course inger said come along jeremy he opened the door the soft clack of computer keys came from the outer office goodbye ms blake goodbye mr inger its been really unpleasant ruebens stopped in the doorway and hissed at me you are an abomination before god jesus loves you too i said smiling he slammed the door behind them childish i sat on the edge of my desk and waited to make sure they had left before going outside i didnt think theyd try anything in the parking lot but i really didnt want to start shooting people oh i would if i had to but it was better to avoid it i had hoped flashing the gun would make ruebens back off it had just seemed to enrage him i rotated my neck trying to ease some of the tension away it didnt work i could go home shower and get eight hours uninterrupted sleep glorious my beeper went off i jumped like id been stung nervous me i hit the button and the number that flashed made me groan it was the police to be exact it was the regional preternatural investigation team the spook squad they were responsible for all preternatural crime in missouri i was their civilian expert on monsters bert liked the retainer i got but better yet the good publicity the beeper went off again same number shit i said it softly i heard you the first time dolph i thought about pretending that id already gone home turned off the beeper and was now unavailable but i didnt if detective sergeant rudolf storr called me at halfpast dawn he needed my expertise damn i called the number and through a series of relays finally got dolphs voice he sounded tinny and faraway his wife had gotten him a car phone for his birthday we must have been near the limit of its range it still beat the heck out of talking to him on the police radio that always sounded like an alien language hi dolph whats up murder what sort of murder the kind that needs your expertise he said its too damn early in the morning to play twenty questions just tell me whats happened you got up on the wrong side of bed this morning didnt you i havent been to bed yet i sympathize but get your butt out here it looks like we have a vampire victim on our hands i took a deep breath and let it out slowly shit you could say that give me the address i said he did it was over the river and through the woods way to hell and gone in arnold my office was just off olive boulevard i had a fortyfiveminute drive ahead of me one way yippee ill be there as soon as i can well be waiting dolph said then hung up i didnt bother to say goodbye to the dial tone a vampire victim id never seen a lone kill they were like potato chips once the vamp tasted them he couldnt stop at just one the trick was how many people would die before we caught this one i didnt want to think about it i didnt want to drive to arnold i didnt want to stare at dead bodies before breakfast i wanted to go home but somehow i didnt think dolph would understand police have very little sense of humor when theyre working on a murder case come to think of it neither did i the mans body lay on its back pale and naked in the weak morning sunlight even limp with death his body was good a lot of weights maybe jogging his longish yellow hair mixed with the stillgreen lawn the smooth skin of his neck was punctured twice with neat fang marks the right arm was pierced at the bend of the elbow where a doctor draws blood the skin of the left wrist was shredded like an animal had gnawed it white bone gleamed in the fragile light i had measured the bite marks with my trusty tape measure they were different sizes at least three different vamps but i would have bet everything i owned that it was five different vampires a master and his pack or flock or whatever the hell you call a group of vampires the grass was wet from early morning mist the moisture soaked through the knees of the coveralls i had put on to protect my suit black nikes and surgical gloves completed my crimescene kit i used to wear white nikes but they showed blood too easily i said a silent apology for what i had to do then spread the corpses legs apart the legs moved easily no rigor i was betting that he hadnt been dead eight hours not enough time for rigor mortis to set in semen had dried on his shriveled privates one last joy before dying the vamps hadnt cleaned him off on the inside of his thigh close to the groin were more fang marks they werent as savage as the wrist wound but they werent neat either there was no blood on the skin around the wounds not even the wrist wound had they cleaned the blood off wherever he was killed there was a lot of blood theyd never be able to clean it all up if we could find where he died wed have all sorts of clues but in the neatly clipped lawn in the middle of a very ordinary neighborhood there were no clues i was betting on that theyd dumped the body in a place as sterile and unhelpful as the dark side of the moon mist floated over the small residential neighborhood like waiting ghosts the mist was so low to the ground that it was like walking through sheets of drizzling rain tiny beads of moisture clung to the body where the mist had condensed beads collected in my hair like silver pearls i stood in the front yard of a small limegreen house with white trim a chainlink fence peeked around one side encircling a roomy backyard it was october and the grass was still green the top of a sugar maple loomed over the house its leaves were that brilliant orangeyyellow that is peculiar to sugar maples as if their leaves were carved from flame the mist helped the illusion and the colors seemed to bleed on the wet air all down the street were other small houses with autumnbright trees and bright green lawns it was still early enough that most people hadnt gone to work yet or school or wherever there was quite a crowd being held back by the uniform officers they had hammered stakes into the ground to hold the yellow donotcross tape the crowd pressed as close to the tape as they dared a boy of about twelve had managed to push his way to the front he stared at the dead man with huge brown eyes his mouth open in a little wow of excitement god where were his parents probably gawking at the corpse too the corpse was paperwhite blood always pools to the lowest point of the body in this case dark purplish bruising should have set in at buttocks arms legs the entire back of his body there were no marks he hadnt had enough blood in him to cause lividity marks whoever had murdered him had drained him completely good to the last drop i fought the urge to smile and lost if you spend a lot of time staring at corpses you get a peculiar sense of humor you have to or you will go stark raving mad whats so funny a voice asked i jumped and whirled god zerbrowski dont sneak up on me like that is the heap big vampire slayer jumping at shadows he grinned at me his unruly brown hair stuck up in three separate tufts like hed forgotten to comb it his tie was at halfmast over a pale blue shirt that looked suspiciously like a pajama top the brown suit jacket and pants clashed with the top nice pajamas he shrugged ive got a pair with little choochoos on them katie thinks theyre sexy your wife got a thing for trains i asked his grin widened if im wearing em i shook my head i knew you were perverted zerbrowski but little kids jammies thats truly sick thank you he glanced down at the body still smiling the smile faded what do you think of this he nodded towards the dead man wheres dolph in the house with the lady who found the body he plunged his hands into the pockets of his pants and rocked on his heels shes taking it pretty hard probably the first corpse shes seen outside of a funeral thats the way most normal folks see dead people zerbrowski he rocked forward hard on the balls of his feet coming to a standstill wouldnt it be nice to be normal sometimes i said he grinned yeah i know what you mean he got a notebook out of his jacket pocket that looked as if someone had crumbled it in their fist geez zerbrowski hey its still paper he tried smoothing the notebook flat but finally gave up he posed pen over the wrinkled paper enlighten me oh preternatural expert am i going to have to repeat this to dolph id like to just do this once and go home to bed hey me too why do you think im wearing my jammies i just thought it was a daring fashion statement he looked at me mmhuh dolph walked out of the house the door looked too small to hold him hes sixnine and built bulky like a wrestler his black hair was buzzed close to his head leaving his ears stranded on either side of his face but dolph didnt care much for fashion his tie was tight against the collar of his white dress shirt he had to have been pulled out of bed just like zerbrowski but he looked neat and tidy and businesslike it never mattered what hour you called dolph he was always ready to do his job a professional cop down to his socks so why was dolph heading up the most unpopular special task force in st louis punishment for something that much i was sure of but id never asked what i probably never would it was his business if he wanted me to know hed tell me the squad had originally been a pacifier for the liberals see were doing something about supernatural crime but dolph had taken his job and his men seriously they had solved more supernatural crime in the last two years than any other group of policemen in the country he had been invited to give talks to other police forces they had even been loaned out to neighboring states twice well anita lets have it thats dolph no preliminaries gee dolph its nice to see you too he just looked at me okay okay i knelt on the far side of the body so i could point as i talked nothing like a visual aid to get your point across just measuring shows that at least three different vampires fed on the man but dolph said hes quick but i think that every wound is a different vampire vampires dont hunt in packs usually they are solitary hunters but not always what causes them to hunt in packs he asked only two reasons that ive ever come across first one is the new dead and an older vampire is teaching the ropes but thats just two pairs of fangs not five second a master vampire is controlling them and hes gone rogue explain a master vampire has nearly absolute control over his or her flock some masters use a group kill to solidify the pack but they wouldnt dump the body here theyd hide it where the police would never find it but the bodys here zerbrowski said out in plain sight exactly only a master thats gone crazy would dump a body like this most masters even before vampires were legally alive wouldnt flaunt a kill like this it attracts attention usually attention with a stake in one hand and a cross in the other even now if we could trace the kill to the vampires that did it we could get a warrant and kill them i shook my head slaughter like this is bad for business and whatever else vampires are theyre practical you dont stay alive and hidden for centuries unless youre discreet and ruthless why ruthless dolph said i stared up at him its utterly practical someone discovers your secret you kill them or make them one of your children good business practices dolph nothing more like the mob zerbrowski said yeah what if they panicked zerbrowski asked it was almost dawn when did the woman find the body dolph checked his notebook fivethirty its still hours until dawn they didnt panic if weve got a crazy master vampire what exactly does that mean it means theyll kill more people faster they may need blood every night to support five vampires a fresh body every night zerbrowski made it a question i just nodded jesus he said yeah dolph was silent staring down at the dead man what can we do i should be able to raise the corpse as a zombie i thought you couldnt raise a vampire victim as a zombie dolph said if the corpse is going to rise as a vampire you cant i shrugged the whatever that makes a vampire interferes with a raising i cant raise a body that is already set to rise as a vamp but this one wont rise dolph said so you can raise it i nodded why wont this vampire victim rise he was killed by more than one vampire in a mass feeding for a corpse to rise as a vampire you have to have just one vampire feeding over a space of several days three bites ending with death and you get a vampire if every vampire victim could come back wed be up to our butts in bloodsuckers but this victim can come back as a zombie dolph said i nodded when can you do the animating three nights from tonight or really two tonight counts as one night what time ill have to check my schedule at work ill call you with a time just raise the murder victim and ask who killed him i like it zerbrowski said its not that easy i said you know how confused witnesses to violent crimes are have three people see the same crime and you get three different heights different hair colors yeah yeah witness testimony is a bitch zerbrowski said go on anita dolph said it was his way of saying zerbrowski shut up zerbrowski shut up a person who died as the victim of a violent crime is more confused scared shitless so that sometimes they dont remember very clearly but they were there zerbrowski said he looked outraged zerbrowski let her finish zerbrowski pantomimed locking his lips with a key and throwing the key away dolph frowned i coughed into my hand to hide the smile mustnt encourage zerbrowski what im saying is that i can raise the victim from the dead but we may not get as much information as youd expect the memories we do get will be confused painful but it might narrow the field down as to which master vampire led the group explain dolph said there are only supposed to be two master vampires in st louis right now malcolm the undead billy graham and the master of the city theres always the possibility weve got someone new in town but the master of the city should be able to police that well take the head of the church of eternal life dolph said ill take the master i said take one of us with you for backup i shook my head cant if he knew i let the cops know who he was hed kill us both how dangerous is it for you to do this dolph asked what was i supposed to say very or did i tell them the master had the hots for me so id probably be okay neither ill be all right he stared at me eyes very serious besides what choice do we have i motioned at the corpse well get one of these a night until we find the vampires responsible one of us has to talk to the master he wont talk to police but he will talk to me dolph took a deep breath and let it out he nodded he knew i was right when can you do it tomorrow night if i can talk bert into giving my zombie appointments to someone else youre that sure the master will talk to you yeah the problem with jeanclaude was not getting to see him it was avoiding him but dolph didnt know that and if he did he might have insisted on going with me and gotten us both killed do it he said let me know what you find out will do i said i stood up facing him over the bloodless corpse watch your back he said always if the master eats you can i have your nifty coveralls zerbrowski asked buy your own you cheap bastard id rather have the ones that have enveloped your luscious body give it a rest zerbrowski im not into little choochoos what the hell do trains have to do with anything dolph asked zerbrowski and i looked at each other we started giggling and couldnt stop i could claim sleep deprivation id been on my feet for fourteen straight hours raising the dead and talking to rightwing fruitcakes the vampire victim was a perfect end to a perfect night i had a right to be hysterical with laughter i dont know what zerbrowskis excuse was there are a handful of days in october that are nearly perfect the sky stretches overhead in a clear blue so deep and perfect that it makes everything else prettier the trees along the highway are crimson gold rust burgundy orange every color is neonbright pulsing in the heavy golden sunlight the air is cool but not cold by noon you can wear just a light jacket it was weather for taking long walks in the woods with someone you wanted to hold hands with since i didnt have anyone like that i was just hoping for a free weekend to go away by myself the chances of that were slim and none october is a big month for raising the dead everyone thinks that halloween is the perfect season for raising zombies it isnt darkness is the only requirement but everyone wants an appointment for midnight on halloween they think spending all hallows eve in a cemetery killing chickens and watching zombies crawl out of the ground is great entertainment i could probably sell tickets i was averaging five zombies a night it was one more zombie than anyone else was doing in one night i should never have told bert that four zombies didnt wipe me out my own fault for being too damn truthful of course truth was five didnt wipe me out either but i was damned if id tell bert speaking of my boss i had to call him when i got home he was going to love me asking for the night off it made me smile just thinking about it any day i could yank berts chain was a good day i pulled into my apartment complex at nearly one in the afternoon all i wanted was a quick shower and seven hours of sleep i had given up on eight hours it was too late in the day for that i had to see jeanclaude tonight joy but he was the master vampire of the city if there was another master vampire around hed know it i think they can smell each other of course if jeanclaude had committed the murder he wasnt likely to confess but i didnt really believe hed done it he was much too good a business vampire to get messy he was the only master vampire id ever met who wasnt crazy in some way psychotic or sociopath take your pick all right all right malcolm wasnt crazy but i didnt approve of his methods he headed up the fastestgrowing church in america today the church of eternal life offered exactly that no leap of faith no uncertainty just a guarantee you could become a vampire and live forever unless someone like me killed you or you got caught in a fire or hit by a bus i wasnt sure about the bus part but id always wondered surely there must be something massive enough to damage even a vampire beyond healing i hoped someday to test the theory i climbed the stairs slowly my body felt heavy my eyes burned with the need to sleep it was three days before halloween and the month couldnt end too soon for me business would start dropping off before thanksgiving the decline would continue until after new years then itd start picking up i prayed for a freak snowstorm business drops off if the snow is bad people seem to think we cant raise the dead in deep snow we can but dont tell anyone i need the break the hallway was full of the quiet noises of my dayliving neighbors i was fishing my keys out of my coat pocket when the door opposite mine opened mrs pringle stepped out she was tall slender thinning with age white hair done in a small bun at the back of her head the hair was perfectly white mrs pringle didnt bother with dyes or makeup she was over sixtyfive and didnt care who knew it custard her pomeranian pranced at the end of his leash he was a round ball of golden fur with little fox ears most cats outweighed him but hes one of those little dogs with a bigdog attitude in a past life he was a great dane hello anita mrs pringle smiled as she said it youre not just getting in from work are you her pale eyes were disapproving i smiled yeah i had an emergency come up she raised an eyebrow probably wondering what an animator would have for an emergency but she was too polite to ask you dont take good enough care of yourself anita if you keep burning the candle at both ends youll be worn out by the time youre my age probably i said custard yapped at me i did not smile at him i dont believe in encouraging small pushy dogs with that peculiar doggy sense he knew i didnt like him and he was determined to win me over i saw the painters were in your apartment last week is it all repaired i nodded yeah all the bullet holes have been patched up and painted over im really sorry i wasnt home to offer you my apartment mr giovoni says you had to go to a hotel yeah i dont understand why one of the other neighbors didnt offer you a couch for the night i smiled i understood two months ago i had slaughtered two killer zombies in my apartment and had a police shootout the walls and one window had been damaged some of the bullets had gone through the walls into other apartments no one else had been hurt but none of the neighbors wanted anything to do with me now i suspected strongly that when my twoyear lease was up i would be asked to leave i guess i couldnt blame them i heard you were wounded i nodded just barely i didnt bother telling her that the bullet wound hadnt been from the shootout the mistress of a very bad man had shot me in the right arm it was healed to a smooth shiny scar still a little pink how did your visit with your daughter go i asked mrs pringles face went all shiny with a smile oh wonderful my last and newest grandchild is perfect ill show you pictures later after youve had some sleep that disapproving look was back in her eyes her teacher face the one that could make you squirm from ten paces even if you were innocent and i hadnt been innocent for years i held up my hands i give up ill go to bed i promise you see you do she said come along custard we have to go out for our afternoon stroll the tiny dog danced at the end of his leash straining forward like a miniature sled dog mrs pringle let three pounds of fluffy fur drag her down the hall i shook my head letting a fuzzball boss you around was not my idea of dog ownership if i ever had another dog id be boss or one of us wouldnt survive it was the principle of the thing i opened the door and stepped inside the hush of my apartment the heater whirred hot air hissing out of the vents the aquarium clicked on the sounds of emptiness it was wonderful the new paint was the same offwhite as the old the carpet was grey couch and matching chair white the kitchenette was pale wood with white and gold linoleum the twoseater breakfast table in the kitchen was a little darker than the cabinets a modern print was the only color on the white walls the space where most people would have put a fullsize kitchen set had the thirtygallon aquarium against the wall a stereo cattycorner from it heavy white drapes hid the windows and turned the golden sunlight to a pale twilight when you sleep during the day you have to have good curtains i flung my coat on the couch kicked my dress shoes off and just enjoyed the feeling of my bare feet on the carpet the panty hose came off next to lie wrinkled and forlorn by the shoes barefoot i padded over to the fish tank the angelfish rose to the surface begging for food the fish are all wider than my outspread hand they are the biggest angels ive ever seen outside of the pet store i bought them from the store had breeding angelfish that were nearly a foot long i stripped off the shoulder holster and put the browning in its second home a specially made holster in the headboard if any bad guys snuck up on me i could pull it and shoot them that was the idea anyway so far it had worked when the drycleanonly suit and blouse were hung neatly in the closet i flopped down on the bed in my bra and undies still wearing the silver cross that i wore even in the shower never know when a pesky vampire is going to try to take a bite out of you always prepared that was my motto or was that the boy scouts i shrugged and dialed work mary our daytime secretary answered on the second ring animators incorporated how may we serve you hi mary its anita hi whats up i need to talk with bert hes with a prospective client right now may i ask what this is pertaining to him rescheduling my appointments for tonight ooh boy ill let you tell him if he yells at someone it should be you she was only halfkidding fine i said she lowered her voice and whispered client is on her way to the front door hell be with you in a jiffy thanks mary she put me on hold before i could tell her not to muzak seeped out of the phone it was a butchered version of the beatles tomorrow id have rather listened to static mercifully bert came on the line and saved me anita what time can you come in today i cant cant what cant come in today at all his voice had risen an octave you got it why the hell not cursing at me already a bad sign i got beeped by the police after my morning meeting i havent even been to bed yet you can sleep in dont worry about meeting new clients in the afternoon just come in for your appointments tonight he was being generous understanding something was wrong i cant make the appointments tonight either anita were overbooked here you have five clients tonight five divide them up among the other animators i said everybody is already maxed listen bert youre the one who said yes to the police youre the one who put me on retainer to them you thought it would be great publicity it has been great publicity he said yeah but its like working two fulltime jobs sometimes i cant do both then drop the retainer i had no idea itd take up this much of your time its a murder investigation bert i cant drop it let the police do their own dirty work he said he was a fine one to talk about that him with his squeakyclean fingernails and nice safe office they need my expertise and my contacts most of the monsters wont talk to the police he was quiet on the other end of the phone his breathing came harsh and angry you cant do this to me weve taken money signed contracts i asked you to hire extra help months ago i hired john burke hes been handling some of your vampire slayings as well as raising the dead yeah johns a big help but we need more in fact i bet he could take at least one of my zombies tonight raise five in one night im doing it i said yes but john isnt you that was almost a compliment you have two choices bert either reschedule or delegate them to someone else i am your boss i could just say come in tonight or youre fired his voice was firm and matteroffact i was tired and cold sitting on the bed in my bra and undies i didnt have time for this fire me you dont mean that he said look bert ive been on my feet for over twenty hours if i dont get some sleep soon im not going to be able to work for anybody he was silent for a long time his breathing soft and regular in my ear finally he said all right youre free for tonight but you damn well better be back on the job tomorrow i cant promise that bert dammit anita do you want to be fired this is the best year weve ever had bert part of thats due to the articles on me in the postdispatch they were about zombie rights and that government study youre on you didnt do them to help promote our business but it worked didnt it how many people call up and ask specifically for me how many people say theyve seen me in the paper how many heard me on the radio i may be promoting zombie rights but its damn good for business so cut me some slack you dont think id do it do you his voice snarled through the phone he was pissed no i dont i said his breath was short and harsh you damn well better show up tomorrow night or im going to call your bluff he slammed the receiver in my ear childish i hung up the phone and stared at it the resurrection company in california had made me a handsome offer a few months back but i really didnt want to move to the west coast or the east coast for that matter i liked st louis but bert was going to have to break down and hire more help i couldnt keep this schedule up sure itd get better after october but i just seemed to be going from one emergency to another for this entire year i had been stabbed beaten shot strangled and vampirebit in the space of four months there comes a point where you just have too many things happening too close together i had battle fatigue i left a message on my judo instructors machine i went twice a week at four oclock but i wasnt going to make it today three hours of sleep just wouldnt have been enough i dialed the number for guilty pleasures it was a vampire strip joint chippendales with fangs jeanclaude owned and managed it jeanclaudes voice came over the line soft as silk caressing down my spine even though i knew it was a recording you have reached guilty pleasures i would love to make your darkest fantasy come true leave a message and i will get back to you i waited for the beep jeanclaude this is anita blake i need to see you tonight its important call me back with a time and place i gave him my home number then hesitated listening to the tape scratch thanks i hung up and that was that hed either call back or he wouldnt he probably would the question was did i want him to no no i didnt but for the police for all those poor people who would die i had to try but for me personally going to the master was not a good idea jeanclaude had marked me twice already two more marks and i would be his human servant did i mention that neither mark was voluntary his servant for eternity didnt sound like a good idea to me he seemed to lust after my body too but that was secondary i could have handled it if all he wanted was physical but he was after my soul that he could not have i had managed to avoid him for the last two months now i was willingly putting myself within reach again stupid but i remembered the nameless mans hair soft and mingling with the stillgreen lawn the fang marks the paperwhite skin the fragility of his nude body covered with dew there would be more bodies to look at unless we were quick and quick meant jeanclaude visions of vampire victims danced in my head and every one of them was partially my fault because i was too chickenshit to go see the master if i could stop the killings now with just one dead id risk my soul daily guilt is a wonderful motivator i was swimming in black water strong smooth strokes the moon hung huge and shining making a silver pathway on the lake there was a black fringe of trees i was almost to shore the water was so warm warm as blood in that moment i knew why the waters were black it was blood i was swimming in a lake of fresh warm blood i woke instantly gasping for breath eyes searching the darkness for what something that had caressed my leg just before i woke something that lived in blood and darkness the phone shrilled and i had to swallow a scream i wasnt usually this nervous it was just a nightmare dammit just a dream i fumbled for the receiver and managed yeah anita the voice sounded hesitant as if its owner might hang up who is this its willie willie mccoy even as he said the name the rhythm of the voice sounded familiar the phone made it distant and charged with an electric hiss but i recognized it willie how are you the minute i said it i wished i hadnt willie was a vampire now how okay could a dead man be im doing real well his voice had a happy lilt to it he was pleased that i asked i sighed truth was i liked willie i wasnt supposed to like vampires any vampire not even if id known him when he was alive how ya doing yourself okay whats up jeanclaude got your message he says ta meet him at the circus of the damned at eight oclock tonight the circus whats he doing over there he owns it now ya didnt know i shook my head realized he couldnt see it and said no i didnt he says to meet im in a show that starts at eight which show he said youd know which one well isnt that cryptic i said hey anita i just do what im told ya know how it is i did know jeanclaude owned willie lock stock and soul its okay willie its not your fault thanks anita his voice sounded cheerful like a puppy who expected a kick and got patted instead why had i comforted him why did i care whether a vampire got its feelings hurt or not answer i didnt think of him as a dead man he was still willie mccoy with his penchant for loud primarycolored suits clashing ties and small nervous hands being dead hadnt changed him that much i wished it had tell jeanclaude ill be there i will he was quiet for a minute his breath soft over the phone watch your back tonight anita do you know something i should know no but i dont know whats up willie nuthin nuthin his voice was high and frightened am i walking into a trap willie no no nuthin like that i could almost see his small hands waving in the air i swear anita nobodys gunnin for you i let that go nobody he knew of was all he could swear to then what are you afraid of willie its just that theres more vampires around here than usual some of em aint too careful who they hurt thats all why are there more vampires willie where did they come from i dont know and i dont want to know ya know i got ta go anita he hung up before i could ask anything else there had been real fear in his voice fear for me or for himself maybe both i glanced at the radio clock on my bedstand i had to hurry if i was going to make the appointment the covers were toasty warm over my legs all i really wanted to do was cuddle back under the blankets maybe with a certain stuffed toy penguin i knew yeah hiding sounded good i threw back the covers and walked into the bathroom i hit the light switch and glowing white light filled the small room my hair stuck up in all directions a mass of tight black curls thatd teach me not to sleep on it wet i ran a brush through the curls and they loosened slightly turning into a frothing mass of waves the curls went all over the place and there wasnt a damn thing i could do with it except wash it and start over there wasnt time for that the black hair made my pale skin look deathly or maybe it was the overhead lighting my eyes were so dark brown they looked black two glittering holes in the pastiness of my face i looked like i felt great what do you wear to meet the master of the city i chose black jeans a black sweater with bright geometric designs black nikes with blue swooshes and a blueandblack sport bag clipped around my waist color coordination at its best the browning went into its shoulder holster i put an extra ammo clip in the sport bag along with credit cards drivers license money and a small hairbrush i slipped on the short leather jacket id bought last year it was the first one id ever tried on that didnt make me took like a gorilla most leather jackets were so longsleeved i could never wear them the jacket was black so bert wouldnt let me wear it to work i only zipped the jacket halfway up leaving room so i could go for my gun if i needed to the silver cross swung on its long chain a warm solid weight between my breasts the cross would be more help against vampires than the gun even with silvercoated bullets i hesitated at the door i hadnt seen jeanclaude in months i didnt want to see him now my dream came back to me something that lived in blood and darkness why the nightmare was it jeanclaude interfering in my dreams again he had promised to stay out of my dreams but was his word worth anything no answer to that i flicked off the apartment lights and closed the door behind me i rattled it to make sure it was locked and i had nothing left to do but drive to the circus of the damned no more excuses no more delays my stomach was so tight it hurt so i was afraid so what i had to go and the sooner i left the sooner i could come home if only i believed that jeanclaude would make things that simple nothing was ever simple where he was concerned if i learned anything about the murders tonight id pay for it but not in money jeanclaude seemed to have plenty of that no his coin was more painful more intimate more bloody and i had volunteered to go see him stupid anita very stupid there was a bouquet of spotlights on the top of the circus of the damned the lights slashed the black night like swords the multicolored lights that spelled the name seemed dimmer with the huge white lights whirling overhead demonic clowns danced around the sign in frozen pantomime i walked past the huge cloth signs that covered the walls one picture showed a man that had no skin see the skinless man a movie version of a voodoo ceremony covered another banner zombies writhed from open graves the zombie banner had changed since last id visited the circus i didnt know if that was good or bad probably neither i didnt give a damn what they did here except except it wasnt right to raise the dead just for entertainment who did they have raising zombies for them i knew it had to be someone new because i had helped kill their last animator he had been a serial killer and had nearly killed me twice the second time by ghoul attack which was a messy way to die of course the way he died had been messy too but i wasnt the one who ripped him open a vampire had done that you might say i eased him on his way a mercy killing riight it was too cold to be standing outside with my jacket halfunzipped but if i zipped it all the way id never get to my gun in time freeze my butt off or be able to defend myself the clowns on the roof had fangs i decided it wasnt that cold after all heat and noise poured out to meet me at the door hundreds of bodies pressed together in an enclosed space the noise of the crowd was like the ocean murmurous and large sound without meaning a crowd is an elemental thing a word a glance and a crowd becomes a mob a different being entirely from a group there were a lot of families mom dad the kiddies the children had balloons tied to their wrists and cotton candy smeared on their faces and hands it smelled like a traveling carnival corn dogs the cinnamon smell of funnel cakes snow cones sweat the only thing missing was the dust there was always dust in the air at a summer fair dry choking dust kicked into the air by hundreds of feet cars driving over the grass until it is greycoated with dust there was no smell of dirt in the air but there was something else just as singular the smell of blood so faint youd almost think you dreamed it but it was there the sweet copper scent of blood mingled with the smells of cooking food and the sharp smell of a snow cone being made who needed dust i was hungry and the corn dogs smelled good should i eat first or accuse the master of the city of murder choices choices i didnt get to decide a man stepped out of the crowd he was only a little taller than me with curly blond hair that fell past his shoulders he was wearing a cornflowerblue shirt with the sleeves rolled up showing firm muscular forearms jeans no tighter than the skin on a grape showed slender hips he wore black cowboy boots with blue designs tooled into them his trueblue eyes matched his shirt he smiled flashing small white teeth youre anita blake right i didnt know what to say it isnt always a good idea to admit who you are jeanclaude told me to wait for you his voice was soft hesitant there was something about him an almost childlike appeal besides im a sucker for a pair of pretty eyes whats your name i asked always like to know who im dealing with his smile widened stephen my name is stephen he put out his hand and i took it his hand was soft but firm no manual labor but some weightlifting not too much enough to firm not explode men my size should not do serious weightlifting it may look okay in a bathing suit but in regular clothes you took like a deformed dwarf follow me please he sounded like a waiter but when he walked into the crowd i followed him he led the way towards a huge blue tent it was like an oldfashioned circus tent id only seen one in pictures or the movies there was a man in a striped coat yelling almost showtime folks present your tickets and come inside see the worlds largest cobra watch the fearsome serpent be taken through amazing feats by the beautiful snake charmer shahar we guarantee it will be a show you will never forget there was a line of people giving their tickets to a young woman she tore them in half and handed back the stubs stephen walked confidently along the line without waiting we got some dirty looks but the girl nodded to us and in we went tiers of bleachers ran up to the top of the tent it was huge nearly all the seats were full a soldout show wowee there was a blue rail that formed a circle in the middle a onering circus stephen scooted past the knees of about a dozen people to a set of steps since we were at the bottom up was the only way to go i followed stephen up the concrete stairs the tent may have looked like a circus tent but the bleachers and stairs were permanent a minicoliseum i have bad knees which means that i can run on a flat surface but put me on a hill or stairs and it hurts so i didnt try to keep up with stephens smooth running glide i did watch the way his jeans fit his snug little behind though looking for clues i unzipped the leather jacket but didnt take it off my gun would show sweat glided down my spine i was going to melt stephen glanced over his shoulder to see if i was following or maybe for encouragement he flashed a smile that was just lips curling back from teeth almost a snarl i stopped in the middle of the steps watching his lithe form glide upward there was an energy to stephen as if the air boiled invisibly around him a shapeshifter some lycanthropes are better than others at hiding what they are stephen wasnt that good or maybe he just didnt care if i knew possible lycanthropy was a disease like aids it was prejudice to mistrust someone for an accident most people survived attacks to become shapeshifters it wasnt a choice so why didnt i like stephen as well now that i knew prejudiced moi he waited at the top of the stairs still pretty as a picture but the air of energy contained in too small a space like his motor was on high idle shimmered around him what was jeanclaude doing with a shapeshifter on his payroll maybe i could ask him i stepped up beside stephen there must have been something in my face because he said whats wrong i shook my head nothing i dont think he believed me but he smiled and led me towards a booth that was mostly glass with heavy curtains on the inside hiding whatever lay behind it looked for all the world like a miniature broadcast booth stephen went to the curtained door and opened it he held it for me motioning me to go first no you first i said im being a gentleman here he said i dont need or want doors opened for me im quite capable thank you a feminist my my truthfully i just didnt want ol stephen at my back but if he wanted to think i was a hardcore feminist let him it was closer to the truth than a lot of things he walked through the door i glanced back to the ring it looked smaller from up here muscular men dressed in glittering loincloths pulled a cart in on their bare shoulders there were two things in the cart a huge woven basket and a darkskinned woman she was dressed in hollywoods version of a dancing girls outfit her thick black hair fell like a cloak sweeping to her ankles slender arms small dark hands swept the air in graceful curves she danced in front of the cart the costume was fake but she wasnt she knew how to dance not for seduction though it was that but for power dancing was originally an invocation to some god or other most people forget that goosebumps prickled up the back of my neck creeping into my hair i shivered while i stood there and sweated in the heat what was in the basket the barker outside had said a giant cobra but there was no snake in the world that needed a basket that big not even the anaconda the worlds heaviest snake needed a container over ten feet tall and twenty feet wide something touched my shoulder i jumped and spun stephen was standing nearly touching me smiling i swallowed my pulse back into my throat and glared at him i make a big deal about not wanting him at my back then let him sneak up behind me real swift anita real swift because hed scared me i was mad at him illogical but it was better to be mad than scared jeanclaudes just inside he said he smiled but there was a very human glint of laughter in his blue eyes i scowled at him knowing i was being childish and not caring after you furface the laughter slipped away he was very serious as he stared at me how did you know his voice was uncertain fragile a lot of lycanthropes pride themselves on being able to pass for human it was easy i said which wasnt entirely true but i wanted to hurt him childish unattractive honest his face suddenly looked very young his eyes filled with uncertainty and pain shit look ive spent a lot of time around shapeshifters i just know what to look for okay why did i want to reassure him because i knew what it was like to be the outsider raising the dead makes a lot of people class me with the monsters there are even days when i agree with them he was still staring at me with his hurt feelings like an open wound in his eyes if he started to cry i was leaving he turned without another word and walked through the open door i stared at the door for a minute there were gasps screams from the crowd i whirled and saw it it was a snake but it wasnt just the worlds biggest cobra it was the biggest freaking snake id ever seen its body was banded in dull greyish black and offwhite the scales gleamed under the lights the head was at least a foot and a half wide no snake was that big it flared its hood and it was the size of a satellite dish the snake hissed flicking out a tongue that was like a black whip id had a semester of herpetology in college if the snake had been a mere eight feet or less i would have called it a banded egyptian cobra i couldnt remember the scientific name to save myself the woman dropped to the ground in front of the snake forehead to the ground a mark of obedience from her to the snake to her god sweet jesus the woman stood and began to dance and the cobra watched her shed made herself a living flute for the nearsighted creature to follow i didnt want to see what would happen if she messed up the poison wouldnt have time to kill her the fangs were so damn big theyd spear her like swords shed die of shock and blood loss long before the poison kicked in something was growing in the middle of that ring magic crawled up my spine was it magic that kept the snake safe or magic that called it up or was it the snake itself did it have power all its own i didnt even know what to call it it looked like a cobra perhaps the worlds biggest yet i didnt even have a word for it god with a little g would do but it wasnt accurate i shook my head and turned away i didnt want to see the show i didnt want to stand there with its magic flowing soft and cold over my skin if the snake wasnt safe jeanclaude would have had it caged right right i turned away from the snake charmer and the worlds biggest cobra i wanted to talk to jeanclaude and get the hell out of here the open door was filled with darkness vampires didnt need lights did lycanthropes i didnt know gee so much to learn my jacket was unzipped all the way the better for a fast draw though truthfully if i needed a fast draw tonight i was in deep shit i took a deep breath and let it out no sense putting it off i walked through the door into the waiting darkness without looking back i didnt want to see what was happening in the ring truth was i didnt want to see what was behind the darkness was there another choice probably not the room was like a closet with drapes all the way around there was no one in the curtained darkness but me where had stephen gone if he had been a vampire i would have believed the vanishing act but lycanthropes dont just turn into thin air so there had to be a second door if i had built this room where would i put an inner door answer opposite the first door i swept the drapes aside the door was there elementary my dear watson the door was heavy wood with some flowering vine carved into it the doorknob was white with tiny pink flowers in the center of it it was an awfully feminine door of course no rules against men liking flowers none at all it was a sexist comment forget i thought it i did not draw my gun see im not completely paranoid i turned the doorknob and swung the door inward i kept pushing until it was flush against the wall no one was hiding behind it good the wallpaper was offwhite with thin silver gold and copper designs running through it the effect was vaguely oriental the carpeting was black i didnt even know carpet came in that color a canopy bed took up most of one side of the room black gauzy curtains covered it made the bed indistinct misty like a dream there was someone asleep in a nest of black covers and crimson sheets a line of bare chest showed it was a man but a wave of brown hair covered his face like a shroud it all looked faintly unreal as if he was waiting for movie cameras to roll a black couch was against the far wall with bloodred pillows thrown along it a matching love seat was against the last wall stephen was curled up on the love seat jeanclaude sat on one corner of the couch he wore black jeans tucked into kneehigh leather boots dyed a deep almost velvet black his shirt had a high lace collar pinned at the neck by a thumbsize ruby pendant his black hair was just long enough to curl around the lace the sleeves were loose and billowing tight at the wrists with lace spilling over his hands until only his fingertips showed where do you get your shirts i asked he smiled dont you like it his hands caressed down his chest fingertips hesitating over his nipples it was an invitation i could touch that smooth white cloth and see if the lace was as soft as it looked i shook my head mustnt get distracted i glanced at jeanclaude he was staring at me with those midnight blue eyes his eyelashes were like black lace she wants you master stephen said there was laughter in his voice derision i can smell her desire jeanclaude turned just his head staring at stephen as can i the words were innocent but the feeling behind them wasnt his voice slithered around the room low and full of a terrible promise i meant no harm master no harm stephen looked scared i didnt blame him jeanclaude turned back to me as if nothing had happened his face was still pleasantly handsome interested amused i dont need your protection oh i think you do i whirled and found another vampire standing at my back i hadnt heard the door open she smiled at me without flashing fang a trick that the older vampires learn she was tall and slender with dark skin and long ebony hair that swung around her waist she wore crimson lycra bike pants that clung so tight you knew she wasnt wearing underwear her top was red silk loose and blousy with thin spaghetti straps holding it in place it looked like the top to slinky pajamas red highheeled sandals and a thin gold chain set with a single diamond completed the outfit the word that came to mind was exotic she glided towards me smiling is that a threat i asked she stopped in front of me not yet there was a hint of some other language in her voice something darker with rolling sibilant sounds that is enough jeanclaude said the dark lady twirled around black hair like a veil behind her i dont think so yasmeen the one word was low and dark with warning yasmeen laughed a harsh sound like breaking glass she stopped directly in front of me blocking my view of jeanclaude her hand stretched towards me and i stepped back out of reach she smiled wide enough to show fangs and reached for me again i stepped back and she was suddenly on me faster than i could blink faster than i could breathe her hand gripped my hair bending my neck backwards her fingertips brushed my skull her other hand held my chin fingers digging in like fleshy metal my face was immobile between her hands trapped short of taking my gun out and shooting her there was nothing i could do and if her movement was any clue id never get the gun out in time i see why you like her so pretty so delicate she halfturned towards jeanclaude nearly giving me her back but still holding my head immobile i never thought youd take in a human she made it sound like i was a stray puppy yasmeen turned back to me i pressed my mm into her chest no matter how fast she was she would be hurt if i wanted it i can feel how old a vampire is inside my head its part natural ability and part practice yasmeen was old older than jeanclaude i was betting she was over five hundred if she had been the new dead hightech ammo at pointblank range would have shredded her heart killed her but over five hundred and a master vampire it might not kill her or then again it might something flickered over her face surprise and maybe just a touch of fear her body was statuestill if she was breathing i couldnt tell my voice sounded strained from the angle she held my neck but the words were clear very slowly take your hands away from my face put both hands on top of your head and lace your fingers together jeanclaude call off your human id do what she says yasmeen his voice was pleased how many vampires have you killed now anita eighteen yasmeens eyes widened just a bit i dont believe you believe this bitch ill pull this trigger and you can kiss your heart goodbye bullets cannot harm me silverplated can move off me now yasmeens hand slid away from my hair and jaw slowly i said she did what i asked she stood in front of me with her longfingered hands clasped across her head i stepped away from her gun still pointed at her chest now what yasmeen asked a smile still curled her lips her dark eyes were amused i didnt like being laughed at but when tangling with master vampires you let some things slide you can put your hands down i said yasmeen did but she continued to stare at me as if id sprouted a second head where did you find her jeanclaude the kitten has teeth tell yasmeen what the vampires call you anita it sounded too much like an order but this didnt seem the time to bitch at him the executioner yasmeens eyes widened then she smiled flashing a lot of fang i thought youd be taller it disappoints me too sometimes i said yasmeen threw back her head and laughed wild and brittle with an edge of hysteria i like her jeanclaude shes dangerous like sleeping with a lion she glided towards me i had the gun up and pointed at her it didnt even slow her down jeanclaude tell her i will shoot her if she doesnt back off i promise not to hurt you anita i will be oh so gentle she swayed over to me and i wasnt sure what to do she was playing with me sadistic but probably not deadly could i shoot her for being a pain in the ass i didnt think so i can taste the heat of your blood the warmth of your skin on the air like perfume her gliding hipswinging walk brought her right in front of me i pointed the gun at her and she laughed she pressed her chest against the tip of my gun so soft wet but strong i wasnt sure who she was talking about her or me neither option sounded pleasant she rubbed her small breasts against the gun her nipples caressing the gun barrel dainty but dangerous the last word was a whispered hiss that flowed over my skin like ice water she was the first master id ever met who had some of jeanclaudes voice tricks i could see her nipples hardening through the thin material of her shirt yikes i pointed the gun at the floor and stepped away from her jesus are all vampires over two hundred perverts i am over two hundred jeanclaude said i rest my case yasmeen let a warm trickle of laughter spill out of her mouth the sound caressed my skin like a warm wind she stalked towards me i backed up until i hit the wall she put a hand on either side of the wall near my shoulders and began to lean in like she was doing a pushup id like to taste her myself i shoved the gun into her ribs too low for her to rub herself against it nobody lays a fang on me i said tough girl she leaned her face over me lips brushing my forehead i like tough girls jeanclaude do something with her before one of us gets killed yasmeen pushed away from me elbows locked as far away as she could get without moving her hands her tongue flicked over her lips a hint of fang but mostly wet lips she leaned back into me lips halfparted but she wasnt going for my neck she was definitely going for my mouth she didnt want to taste me she wanted to taste me i couldnt shoot her not if she just wanted to kiss me if shed been a man i wouldnt have shot her her hair fell forward over my hands soft like thick silk her face was all i could see her eyes were a perfect blackness her lips hovered just above my mouth her breath was warm and smelled of breath mints but under the modern smell was something older the sweet foulness of blood your breath smells like old blood i whispered into her mouth she whispered back lips barely caressing my mouth i know her lips pressed into mine a gentle kiss she smiled with our lips still touching the door opened nearly pinning us to the wall yasmeen stood up but kept her hands around my shoulders we both looked at the door a woman with nearly white blond hair looked wildly around the room her blue eyes widened as she saw us she screamed high and wordless ragefilled get off of her i frowned up at yasmeen is she talking to me yes yasmeen looked amused the woman did not she ran towards us hands outstretched fingers curled into claws yasmeen caught her in a blurring moment of pure speed the woman thrashed and struggled her hands still reaching for me what the hell is going on i asked marguerite is yasmeens human servant jeanclaude said she thinks you may steal yasmeen away from her i dont want yasmeen yasmeen shot me a took of pure anger had i hurt her feelings i hoped so marguerite look shes yours all right the woman screamed at me wordless and guttural what might have been a pretty face was screwed up into something bestial id never seen such instant rage it was frightening even with a loaded gun in my hand yasmeen had to lift the woman off her feet holding her struggling in midair im afraid jeanclaude that marguerite is not going to be satisfied unless she answers the challenge what challenge i asked you challenged her claim to me did not i said yasmeen smiled the serpent must have smiled at eve that way pleasant amused dangerous jeanclaude i didnt come here for whatever the hell is going on i dont want any vampire let alone a female one i said if you were my human servant ma petite there would be no challenge because once one is bound to a master vampire it is an unbreakable bond then what is marguerite worried about that yasmeen may take you as a lover she does that from time to time to drive marguerite into jealous rages for some reason i do not understand yasmeen enjoys it oh yes i do enjoy it yasmeen turned towards me with the woman still clasped in her arms she was holding the struggling woman easily no strain of course vampires can bench press toyotas what was one mediumsize human to that so what exactly does this mean to me personally jeanclaude smiled but there was an edge of tiredness to it was he bored or angry or just tired you must fight marguerite if you win then yasmeen is yours if you lose yasmeen is marguerites wait a minute i said what sort of fight pistols at dawn no weapons yasmeen said my marguerite is not skilled in weapons i dont want her hurt then stop tormenting her i said yasmeen smiled it is part of the fun sadistic bitch i said yes i am jesus some people you couldnt even insult so you want us to fight barehanded over yasmeen i couldnt believe i was even asking this question yes ma petite i took a deep breath looked at my gun looked back at the screaming woman then holstered my gun is there any way out of this besides fighting her if you admit you are my human servant then there will be no fight there will be no need for one jeanclaude was watching me studying my face his eyes were very still you mean this was a setup i said the first warm rumblings of anger chased up my gut a setup ma petite i had no idea yasmeen would find you so enticing bullshit admit you are my human servant and all ends here and if i dont then you fight marguerite fine i said lets do it what would it cost you to admit what is true anita jeanclaude asked i am not your human servant i will never be your human servant i wish youd just accept that and leave me the fuck alone he frowned ma petite such language fuck off he smiled then as you like ma petite he sat up on the edge of the couch maybe so he could see better yasmeen any time you are ready wait i said i took off my jacket and wasnt sure where to lay it the man who had been sleeping on the blackcanopied bed reached a hand through the black gauze ill hold it for you he said i stared at him for a minute he was naked from the waist up his arms stomach chest showed signs of weightlifting just enough not too much he either had a perfect tan or was naturally dark complected hair fell in a wavy mass around his shoulders his eyes were brown and very human that was nice to see i handed him my jacket he smiled a quick flash of teeth that chased the last signs of sleep from his face he sat up with the jacket in one hand arms encircling his knees that were still hidden under the black and red covers he laid his cheek on his knees and managed to look winsome are you quite done ma petite jeanclaudes voice was amused with an edge of laughter that wasnt humor at all it was mockery but whether he was mocking me or himself i couldnt tell im ready i guess i said put her down yasmeen let us see what happens i heard stephen say twenty on marguerite yasmeen said no fair i cant bet against my own human servant ill spot you both twenty that ms blake wins that came from the man in the bed i had a second to glance at him to see him smile at me then marguerite was coming she slapped at my face and i blocked it with my forearm she fought like a girl all openhanded slaps and fingernails but she was fast faster than a human maybe she got that from being a human servant i dont know her fingernails raked down my face in a sharp painful line that was it no more ms nice guy i held her off with one hand she dug her teeth into that hand i hit her with my right fist as hard as i could turning my body into it it was a nice solid hit to the solar plexus marguerite stopped biting my hand and bent over hands covering her stomach she was gasping for breath good my left hand had a bloody imprint of her teeth in it i touched my left cheek and came away with more blood damn that hurt marguerite knelt on the floor relearning how to breathe but she was staring up at me the look in her blue eyes said the fight wasnt over as soon as she got her breath back she would start again stay down marguerite or ill hurt you she shook her head she cant give up ma petite or you win yasmeens body if not her heart i dont want her body i dont want anyones body now that is simply not true ma petite jeanclaude said stop calling me ma petite you bear two of my marks anita you are halfway to being my human servant admit that and no one else need suffer tonight yeah right i said marguerite was getting to her feet i didnt want her on her feet i moved in before she could stand and footswept her legs out from under her i forced her shoulders backwards at the same time and i rode her down i got her right arm in a joint lock she tried to get up i increased the pressure and she lay back down give up the fight no it was only the second coherent thing id heard her utter i will break your arm break it break it i dont care her face was wild enraged god there was no way to reason with her great using the joint lock as a lever i turned her over on her stomach increasing the pressure to almost breaking but not quite breaking her arm might not stop the fight i wanted it over with i used my leg and one arm to keep the joint lock on but knelt over her upper body until my weight would keep her pinned i took a handful of yellow hair and pulled her neck back i released her arm and brought my right arm across her neck with my elbow in front of her adams apple and the arm squeezing the arteries on both sides of her neck i put my right hand on my left wrist and squeezed she scratched at my face but i buried my eyes in her back and she couldnt reach me she was making small helpless sounds because she didnt have enough air to make big ones her hands scratched at my right arm but the sweater was thick she pushed the sleeve up exposing my bare arm and began to shred the skin with her nails i buried my face deeper into her back and squeezed until my arms shook and i was gritting my teeth everything i had was in that one arm pressing into her slender throat her hands stopped scratching me they beat against my arm like dying butterflies it takes a long time to choke someone into unconsciousness the movies make it look easy quick clean it isnt easy it isnt quick and it sure as hell isnt clean you can feel the pulse on either side of the neck pounding against your arm while you squeeze the life out of it the person struggles a lot more than in the movies and as far as choking someone to death you better hold on for a long time after they stop moving marguerite went slowly limp a body part at a time when she was just dead weight in my arms i let her go slowly she lay on the floor unmoving i couldnt even see her breathe had i squeezed too long i touched her neck and found the carotid pulse strong and even just out of it not dead good i stood and walked back towards the bed yasmeen went to her knees beside marguerites still form my love my only one has she hurt you shes just unconscious i said shell come to in a few minutes if you had killed her i would have torn your throat out i shook my head lets not start this shit again ive had about all the grandstanding i can take for one night the man in bed said youre bleeding blood was dripping down my right forearm marguerite may not have been able to do any real damage but the scratches were deep enough that some of them might leave scars great i already had a long thin scar on the underside of my right arm from a knife even with the scratches my right arm had fewer scars than my left workrelated injuries blood was dripping down my arm rather steadily the blood didnt show on the black carpeting a good color if you planned to bleed much in a room yasmeen was helping marguerite to her feet the woman had recovered very quickly why because she was a human servant of course sure yasmeen walked towards the bed towards me her lovely face had thinned until the bones showed through her eyes were bright almost feverish fresh blood and i havent fed tonight control yourself yasmeen you have not taught your servant good manners jeanclaude yasmeen said she was looking very unkindly at me leave her alone yasmeen jeanclaude was standing now every servant must be tamed jeanclaude you have let it go far too long i looked over yasmeens shoulder at him tamed it is an unfortunate stage in the process he said his voice was neutral as if he were talking about taming a horse damn you i pulled my gun i held it twohanded in a teacup grip nobody was taming me tonight out of the corner of my eye i saw someone stand up on the other side of the bed the man was still under the covers it was a slender woman her skin the color of coffee with cream her black hair was cut very close to her head she was naked where the hell had she come from yasmeen was about a yard from me tongue playing over her lips fangs glistening in the overhead light ill kill you do you understand that ill kill you i said youll try fun and games arent worth dying for i said after a few hundred years thats all that is worth dying for jeanclaude unless you want to lose her call her off my voice was higher than i wanted it to be afraid at this range the bullet should take out her entire chest if it worked there would be no resurrecting her as the undead her heart would be gone of course she was over five hundred years old one shot might not do it lucky i had more than one bullet i caught movement from the corner of my eye i was halfturned towards it when something flattened me to the ground the black woman was on top of me i brought the gun around to fire not giving a damn if she was human or not but her hand grabbed my wrists squeezing she was going to crush my wrists she snarled in my face all teeth and a low growl the sound should have had fur around it and pointy teeth human faces werent supposed to look that way the woman jerked the browning out of my hands like taking candy from a baby she held it wrong like she didnt know which end of the gun went where an arm came around her waist and pulled her backwards off me it was the man on the bed the woman turned on him snarling yasmeen leapt for me i scooted backwards putting the wall at my back she smiled not so tough without your weapon are you she was suddenly kneeling in front of me i hadnt seen her come not even a blur of motion she appeared beside me like magic she had her body up against my knees pinning me to the wall yasmeen dug her fingers into my upper arms and jerked me towards her her strength was incredible she made the black shapeshifter seem fragile yasmeen no it was jeanclaude coming to my aid at last but he was going to be too late yasmeen bared her teeth raised her neck back for the strike and i couldnt do a damn thing she pulled me in tight against her arms locked behind my back if id been pressed any tighter id have come out on the other side i screamed jeanclaude heat something was burning inside my sweater over my heart yasmeen hesitated i felt her whole body shudder what the hell was happening a tongue of bluewhite flame curled up between us i screamed and yasmeen echoed it we screamed together as we burned she fell away from me bluewhite flame crawled over her shirt flames licked around a hole in my sweater i shrugged out of the shoulder holster and pulled the burning sweater off my cross still burned with an intense bluewhite flame i jerked the chain and it snapped i dropped the cross to the carpet where the flames smoldered then died there was a perfect crossshaped burn on my chest just above my breast over the beat of my heart the burn was covered in blisters already a seconddegree burn yasmeen had ripped her own blouse off she had an identical burn but lower down between her breasts because she was taller than i was i knelt on the floor in just my bra and jeans tears were trailing down my face i had a bigger crossshaped burn scar on my left forearm a vampires human followers had branded me thinking it was funny theyd laughed right up to the minute i killed them a burn is a bitch inch for inch a burn hurts worse than any other injury jeanclaude stood in front of me the cross glowed a whitehot light no flames but then he wasnt touching it i looked up to find him shielding his eyes with his arm put it away ma petite no one else will harm you tonight i promise you that why dont you just back off and let me decide what im going to do he sighed i was childish to let it get so far out of hand anita forgive me for my foolishness it was hard to take the apology seriously while he cowered behind his arm not daring to look at my glowing cross but it was an apology from jeanclaude that was a lot i picked the cross up by its chain i had broken the clasp getting it off id need a new chain before it could go around my neck again i picked my sweater up in my other hand there was a melted hole bigger than my fist in it right over the chest area the sweater was ruined no help there where do you hide a glowing cross when you arent wearing a shirt the man in the bed handed my leather jacket to me i met his eyes and saw in them concern a little fear his brown eyes were very close to me and very human it was comforting and i wasnt even sure why the shoulder holster was flopping down around my waist like suspenders i shrugged back into the straps they felt strange next to my bare skin the man handed me my gun butt first the black shapeshifter stood on the other side of the bed still naked glaring at us i didnt care how hed gotten my gun from her i was just glad to have it back with the browning in its holster i felt safer though id never tried wearing a shoulder holster over bare skin i suspected it was going to chafe oh well nothings perfect the man held out a handful of kleenex to me the red sheets had slid down exposing a long nude line of his body to about midthigh the sheet was perilously close to failing off him all together your arm he said i stared down at my right arm it was still bleeding a little it hurt so much less than the burn i had forgotten about it i took the kleenex and wondered what he was doing here had he been having sex with the naked woman the shapeshifter i hadnt seen her in the bed had she been hiding under it i cleaned up my arm as best i could didnt want to bleed too heavily on the leather jacket i slipped the jacket on and put the stillglowing cross in my left pocket once it was hidden the glow would stop the only reason yasmeen and i had gotten in trouble was that the sweater had a loose weave and her top had left a lot of bare flesh vampire flesh touching a blessed cross was always volatile jeanclaude stared down at me now that the cross was safely hidden i am sorry ma petite i did not mean to frighten you tonight he held one hand down towards me the skin was paler than the white lace that covered it i ignored his outstretched hand and used the bed to help me stand he lowered his hand slowly his dark blue eyes were very still looking at me it never works as i want it to with you anita blake why is that maybe you should take the hint and leave me alone he smiled a bare movement of lips im afraid it is too late for that whats that supposed to mean the door swung open banging against the wall and bouncing back a man stood in the doorway eyes wide sweat running down his face jeanclaude the snake he seemed to be having trouble breathing as if he had run all the way up the stairs what about the snake jeanclaude asked the man swallowed his breathing slowing its gone crazy what happened the man shook his head i dont know it attacked shahar its trainer shes dead is it in the crowd not yet we will have to finish this discussion later ma petite he moved for the door and the rest of the vampires followed at his heels stephen went with them well trained the slender black woman slipped a loose dress black with red flowers on it over her head a pair of red high heels and she was out the door the man was out of the bed naked there was no time to be embarrassed he was struggling into a pair of sweats this wasnt my problem but what if the cobra got into the crowd not my problem i zipped the jacket up enough to hide the fact i was shirtless but not so high up i couldnt draw my gun i was out the door and into the bright open space of the tent before the nameless man had slipped on his sweat pants the vampires and shapeshifters were at the edge of the ring fanning out into a circle around the snake it filled the small ring with blackandwhite coils the bottom half of a man in a glittering loincloth was disappearing down the cobras throat thats what had kept it out of the crowd it was taking time to feed sweet jesus the mans legs twitched kicking convulsively he couldnt be alive he couldnt be but the legs twitched as they slid out of sight please god let it just be a reflex dont let him still be alive the thought was worse than any nightmare i could remember and i have a lot of material for nightmares the monster in the ring wasnt my problem i didnt have to be the bloody hero this time people were screaming running arms full of children popcorn bags and cotton candy were getting crushed underfoot i waded into the crowd and began pushing my way down a woman carrying a toddler fell at my feet a man climbed over them i dragged the woman to her feet taking the baby in one arm people shoved past us we shuddered just trying to stand still i felt like a rock in the middle of a raging river the woman stared at me eyes too large for her face i pushed the toddler into her arms and wedged her between the seats i grabbed the arms of the nearest large male sexist that i am and shouted help them the mans face was startled as if i had spoken in tongues but some of the panic faded from his face he took the womans arm and began to push his way towards the exit i couldnt let the snake get into the crowd not if i could stop it shit i was going to play hero dammit i started fighting against the tide to go down when everybody else was coming up and over an elbow caught me in the mouth and i tasted blood by the time i fought my way through this mess it would all be over god i hoped so i stepped out of the crowd like i was flinging aside a curtain my skin tingled with the memory of shoving bodies but i stood alone on the last step the screaming crowd was still up above me struggling for the exits but here just above the ring there was nothing the silence lay in thick folds against my face and hands it was hard to breathe through the thick air magic but whether vampire or cobra i didnt know stephen stood closest to me shirtless slim and somehow elegant yasmeen had on his blue shirt hiding her naked upper body she had tied the shirt up to expose a tanned expanse of tummy marguerite stood beside her the black woman stood on stephens right she had kicked off her high heels and stood flatfooted in the ring jeanclaude stood on the far side of the circle with two new blond vampires on either side he turned and stared at me across the distance i felt his touch inside me where no hand was ever meant to go my throat tightened sweat broke on my body nothing at that moment would have made me go closer to him he was trying to tell me something something private and too intimate for words a hoarse scream brought my attention to the center of the ring two men lay broken and bleeding to one side the cobra reared over them it was like a moving tower of muscle and scale it hissed at us the sound was loud echoing the men lay on the ground at its feet tail one of them twitched was he alive my hands squeezed the guardrail until my fingers ached i was so scared i could taste bile at the back of my throat my skin was cold with it you ever have those dreams where snakes are everywhere so thick on the ground you cant walk unless you step on them its almost claustrophobic the dream always ends with me standing in the middle of the trees with snakes dripping down on me and all i can do is scream jeanclaude held out one slender hand towards me the lace covered everything but the tips of his fingers everyone else was staring at the snake jeanclaude was staring at me one of the wounded men moved a soft moan escaped his lips and seemed to echo in the huge tent was it illusion or had the sound really echoed it didnt matter he was alive and we had to keep him that way we what was this we stuff i stared into jeanclaudes deep blue eyes his face was utterly blank wiped clean of any emotion i understood he couldnt trick me with his eyes his own marks had seen to that but mind tricksif he worked at itwere still possible he was working at it it wasnt words but a compulsion i wanted to go to him to run to him to feel the smooth solid grip of his hand the softness of lace against my skin i leaned against the railing dizzy i gripped it to keep from falling what the hell were these mind games now we had other problems didnt we or didnt he care about the snake maybe it had all been a trick maybe he had told the cobra to run amuck but why every hair on my body raised as if some invisible finger had just brushed it i shivered and couldnt stop i was staring down at a pair of very nice black boots high and soft i looked up and met jeanclaudes eyes he had left his place around the cobra to come to me it beat the hell out of me going to him join with me anita and we have enough power to stop the creature i shook my head i dont know what youre talking about he brushed his fingertips down my arm even through the leather jacket i could feel his touch like a line of ice or was it fire how can you be hot and cold at the same time i asked he smiled a bare movement of lips ma petite stop fighting me and we can tame the creature we can save the men he had me there a moment of personal weakness against the lives of two people what a choice once i let you inside my head that far itll be easier for you to come in next time my soul is not up for grabs for anybodys life he sighed very well it is your choice he started to turn away from me i grabbed his arm and it was warm and firm and very very real he turned to me eyes large and drowning deep like the bottom of the ocean and just as deadly his own power kept me from falling in alone i would have been lost i swallowed hard enough for it to hurt and pulled my hand away from him i had the urge to wipe my hand against my pants as if i had touched something bad maybe i had will silver bullets hurt it he seemed to think about that for a second i do not know i took a deep breath if you stop trying to hijack my mind ill help you youll face it with a gun rather than with me his voice sounded amused you got it he stepped away from me and motioned me towards the ring i vaulted the rail and landed beside him i ignored him as much as i was able and started walking towards the creature i pulled the browning out it was nice and solid in my hand a comforting weight the ancient egyptians worshipped it as a god ma petite she was edjo the royal serpent cared for sacrificed to adored it isnt a god jeanclaude are you so sure im a monotheist remember its just another supernatural creepycrawlie to me as you like ma petite i turned back to him how the hell did you get it past quarantine he shook his head does it matter i glanced back at the thing in the middle of the ring the snake charmer lay in a bloody heap to one side of the snake it hadnt eaten her was that a sign of respect affection dumb luck the cobra pushed towards us belly scales clenching and unclenching it made a dry whispering sound against the rings floor he was right it didnt matter how the thing had gotten into the country it was here now how are we going to stop it he smiled wide enough to flash fangs maybe it was the we if you could disable its mouth i think we could deal with it the snakes body was thicker than a telephone pole i shook my head if you say so can you injure the mouth i nodded if silver bullets work on it yeah my little marksman he said can the sarcasm i said he nodded if you are going to try to shoot it i would hurry ma petite once it wades into my people it will be too late his face was unreadable i couldnt tell if he wanted me to do it or not i turned and started walking across the ring the cobra stopped moving forward it waited like a swaying tower it stood there if something without legs could stand and waited for me whiplike tongue flicking out tasting the air tasting me jeanclaude was suddenly beside me i hadnt heard him come hadnt felt him come just another mind trick i had other things to worry about right now he spoke low and urgent i think only i heard i will do my best to protect you ma petite you were doing a great job up in your office he stopped walking i didnt i know you are afraid of it anita your fear crawls through my belly he called soft and faint as wind i whispered back not sure he would even be able to hear me stay the fuck out of my mind the cobra watched me i held the browning in a twohanded grip pointed at the things head i thought i was out of striking distance but i wasnt sure how far away is safe distance from a snake thats bigger than a mack truck two states away three i was close enough to see the snakes flat black eyes empty as a dolls jeanclaudes words blew through my mind like flower petals i could even have sworn i smelled flowers his voice had never held the scent of perfume before force it to follow you and give us its back before you shoot the pulse in my neck was beating so hard it hurt to breathe my mouth was so dry i couldnt swallow right i began to move ever so slowly away from the vampires and shapeshifters the snakes head followed me as it had followed the snake charmer if it started to strike id shoot it but if it would just keep moving with me id give jeanclaude a chance at its back of course silver bullets might not hurt it in fact the thing was so damn big the ammo i had in the browning might not do more than irritate it i felt like i was trapped in one of those monster movies where the giant slime monster keeps coming no matter how much you shoot it i hoped that was just a hollywood invention if the bullets didnt hurt it i was going to die i flashed on the image of the mans legs kicking as they went down the lump was still visible in the snakes body like it had fed on a really big rat the tongue flicked out and i gasped swallowing a scream god anita control yourself its just a snake a giant maneating cobra snake but still only a snake yeah right every hair on my body stood at attention the power that id felt the snake charmer calling up was still here it wasnt enough that the thing was poisonous and had teeth big enough to spear me with it had to be magic too great just great the smell of flowers was thicker closer it hadnt been jeanclaude at all the cobra was filling the air with perfume snakes dont smell like flowers they smell musty and once you know what they smell like you never forget it nothing with fur ever smelled like that a vampires coffin smells a bit like snakes the cobra turned its giant head with me come on just a little farther i was speaking to the snake which is pretty stupid since theyre deaf the smell of flowers was thick and sweet i shuffled around the ring and the snake shadowed me maybe it was habit i was small and had long dark hair though not nearly as long as the dead snake charmer maybe the beastie wanted someone to follow come on pretty girl come to mama i whispered so low my lips barely moved just me and the snake and my voice i didnt dare look across the ring at jeanclaude nothing mattered but my feet shuffling over the ground the snakes movements the gun in my hands it was like some kind of dance the cobra parted its mouth tongue flicking giving me a glimpse of scythelike fangs cobras have fixed fangs not retractable like a rattlesnakes nice to know i remembered some of my herpetology though i bet dr greenburg had never seen anything like this i had a horrible impulse to giggle instead i sighted down my arm at the things mouth the scent of flowers was strong enough to touch i squeezed the trigger the snakes head jerked backwards blood splattering the floor i fired again and again the jaws exploded into bits of flesh and bone the cobra opened its ruined jaws hissing i think it was screaming its telephonepole body slashed the ground whipping back and forth could i kill it could just bullets kill it i fired three more shots into the head the body turned on itself in a huge wondrous knot the black and white scales boiled over each other frenzied bloodspattered a loop of body rolled out and punched my legs out from under me i came up on knees and one hand gun in the other hand ready to point another coil smashed into me it was like being hit by a whale i lay halfstunned under several hundred pounds of snake one striped coil pinned me to the ground the beast reared over me blood and pale drops of poison running down its shattered jaws if the poison hit my skin it would kill me there was too much of it not to i lay flat on my back with the snake writhing across me and fired at it i just kept squeezing the trigger as the head rushed down on me something hit the snake something covered in fur dug teeth and claws into the snakes neck it was a werewolf with furry manshaped arms the cobra reared pressing me under its weight the smooth belly scales pushed at my nearly naked upper body like a giant hand squeezing it wasnt going to eat me it was going to crush me to death i screamed and fired into the snakes body the gun clicked empty shit jeanclaude appeared over me his pale lacecovered hands lifted the coil off me as if it wasnt a thousand pounds of muscle i scooted backwards on hands and feet i crabwalked until i hit the edge of the ring then i popped the empty clip and got the extra out of my sport bag i didnt remember firing all thirteen rounds but i must have i jacked a round into the chamber and i was ready to rock and roll jeanclaude was elbow deep in snake he pulled a piece of glistening spine out of the meat splitting the snake apart yasmeen was tearing at the giant snake like a kid with taffy her face and upper body were bathed in blood she pulled a long piece of snake intestine out and laughed i had never really seen vampires use every bit of their inhuman strength i sat on the edge of the ring with my loaded gun and just watched the black shapeshifter was still in human form she had gotten a knife from somewhere and was happily carving the snake up the cobra whipped its head into the ground sending the werewolf rolling the snake reared and came smashing down its ruined jaws plunged into the black womans shoulder she screamed one fang came out the back of her dress poison squirted from the fang splashing onto the ground poison and blood soaked into the back of her dress i moved forward gun ready but i hesitated the cobra was flinging its head from side to side trying to shake the woman off the fang was too deeply imbedded and the mouth too damaged the cobra was trapped and so was the woman i wasnt sure i could hit the snakes head without hitting her the woman was screaming shrieking her hands clawed helplessly at the snake shed dropped her knife somewhere a blond vampire grabbed the black woman the snake reared back lifting the woman in his jaws worrying her like a dog with a toy she shrieked the werewolf jumped on the snakes neck riding it like a wild horse there was no way to shoot without hitting someone now dammit i had to just stand there watching the man from the bed was running across the ring had it taken him that long to slip into the grey sweat pants and zippered jacket the jacket was unzipped and flapped as he ran exposing most of his tanned chest he was unarmed as far as i could tell what the hell did he think he could do dammit he knelt beside the two men who had been alive when all the shit started he dragged one of them away from the fight it was good thinking jeanclaude grabbed the woman he gripped the fang that speared her shoulder and snapped it off the crack was loud as a rifle shot the womans shoulder stretched away from her body bones and ligaments snapping she gave one last shriek and went limp he carried her towards me laying her on the ground her right arm was hanging by strands of muscle he had freed her from the snake and damn near pulled her arm off help her ma petite he left her at my feet bleeding and unconscious i knew some first aid but jesus there was no way to put a tourniquet on the wound i couldnt splint the arm it wasnt just broken it was ripped apart a breath of wind oozed through the tent something tugged at my gut i gasped and looked up away from the dying girl jeanclaude stood beside the snake all the vampires were tearing at the body and still it lived a wind ruffled the lace on his collar the black waves of his hair the wind whispered against my face pulling my heart up into my throat the only sound i could hear was the thunder of my own blood beating against my ears jeanclaude moved forward almost gently and i felt something inside me move with him it was almost like he held an invisible line to my heart pulse blood my pulse was so fast i couldnt breathe what was happening he was on the snake hands digging in the flesh just below the mouth i felt my hands dig into the writhing flesh my hands digging at bone snapping it my hands shoving in almost to the elbow it was slick wet but not warm our hands pushed then pulled until our shoulders strained with the effort the head tore away to land across the ring the head flopped mouth snapping at empty air the body still struggled but it was dying now i had fallen to the ground beside the wounded woman the browning was still in my hand but it wouldnt have helped me i could hear again feel again my hands werent covered in blood and gore they had been jeanclaudes hands not mine dear god what was happening to me i could still feel the blood on my hands it was an incredibly powerful sensory memory god something touched my shoulder i whirled gun nearly shoved into the mans face it was the man in the grey sweats he was kneeling beside me hands in the air his eyes staring at the gun in my hands im on your side he said my pulse was still thumping in my throat i didnt trust myself to speak so i just nodded and stopped pointing the gun at him he took off his sweat jacket maybe we can stop some of the blood with this he wadded the jacket up and shoved it against the wound shes probably in shock i said my voice sounded strange hollow you dont look so good yourself i didnt feel so good either jeanclaude had entered my mind my body it had been like we were one person i started to shiver and couldnt stop maybe it was shock i called the police and an ambulance he said i stared at him his face was very strong high cheekbones square jaw but his lips were softer making it a very sympathetic face his wavy brown hair fell forward like a curtain around his face i remembered another man with long brown hair another human tied to the vampires he had died badly and i hadnt been able to save him i caught sight of marguerite on the far side of the ring watching her eyes were wide her lips halfparted she was enjoying herself god the werewolf pulled back from the snake the shapeshifter looked like a very classy version of every wolfman that had ever stalked the streets of london except it was naked and had genitalia between its legs movie wolfmen were always smooth sexless as a barbie doll the werewolfs fur was a dark honey color a blond werewolf was it stephen if it wasnt then he had disappeared and i didnt think jeanclaude would allow that a voice yelled everybody freeze across the ring were two patrol cops with their guns out one of them said jesus christ i put my gun away while they were staring at the dead snake the body was still twitching but it was dead it just takes longer for a reptiles body to know its dead than most mammals i felt light and empty as air everything had a faintly unreal quality it wasnt the snake it was whatever jeanclaude had done to me i shook my head trying to clear it to think the cops were here i had things i needed to do i fished the little plastic id card out of my sport bag and clipped it to the collar of my jacket it identified me as a member of the regional preternatural investigation team it was almost as good as a badge lets go talk to the cops before they start shooting the snakes dead he said the wolfman was tearing at the dead thing with a long pointed muzzle ripping off chunks of meat i swallowed hard and looked away they may not think the snake is the only monster in the ring oh he said it very softly as if the thought had never occurred to him before what the hell was he doing with the monsters i walked towards the police smiling jeanclaude stood there in the middle of the ring his white shirt so bloody it clung to him like water outlining the point of one nipple hard against the cloth blood was smeared down one side of his face his arms were crimson to the elbows the youngest vampire a woman had buried her face in the snakes blood she was scooping the bloody meat into her mouth and sucking on it the sounds were wet and seemed louder than they should have been my names anita blake i work with the regional preternatural investigation team ive got id whos that with you the uniform nodded his head in the mans direction his gun was still pointed vaguely towards the ring i whispered out of the corner of my mouth what is your name richard zeeman he said softly out loud i said richard zeeman just an innocent bystander that last was probably a lie how innocent could a man be who woke up in a bed surrounded by vampires and shapeshifters but the uniform nodded what about the rest of them i glanced where he was staring it didnt look any better the manager and some of his people they waded into the thing to keep it out of the crowd but they aint human right he said no i said they arent human jesus h christ the guys back at the station arent going to believe this one his partner said he was probably right i had been here and i almost didnt believe it a giant maneating cobra jesus h christ indeed i was sitting in a small hallway that served as the performers entrance to the big tent the lighting was permanently dim as if some of the things rolling through wouldnt like a lot of light big surprise there there were no chairs and i was getting a little tired of sitting on the floor id given a statement first to a uniform then to a detective then rpit had arrived and the questioning started all over again dolph nodded to me and zerbrowski shot at me with his thumb and forefinger that had been an hour and fifteen minutes ago i was getting a wee bit tired of being ignored richard zeeman and stephen the werewolf were sitting across from me richards hands were clasped loosely around one knee he was wearing white nikes with a blue swoosh and no socks even his ankles were tan his thick hair brushed the tops of his naked shoulders his eyes were closed i could gaze at his muscular upper body as long as i wanted to his stomach was flat with a triangle of dark hair peeking above the sweat pants his upper chest was smooth perfect no hair at all i approved stephen was cuddled on the floor asleep bruises blossomed up the left side of his face blackpurple and that raw red color a really bad bruise gets his left arm was in a sling but hed refused to go to the hospital he was wrapped in a grey blanket that the paramedics had given him as far as i could tell it was all he was wearing i guess hed lost his clothes when he shapeshifted the wolfman had been bigger than he was and the legs had been a very different shape so the skintight jeans and the beautiful cowboy boots were history maybe that was why the black shapeshifter had been naked had that been why richard zeeman was naked as well was he a shapeshifter i didnt think so if he was he hid it better than anybody id ever been around besides if he had been a shapeshifter why didnt he join the fight against the cobra hed done a sensible thing for an unarmed human being hed stayed out of the way stephen who had started out the night looking scrumptious looked like shit the long blond curls clung to his face wet with sweat there were dark smudges under his closed eyes his breathing was rapid and shallow his eyes were struggling underneath his closed lids dream nightmare do werewolves dream of shapeshifted sheep richard still looked scrumptious but then a giant cobra hadnt been slamming him into a concrete floor he opened his eyes as if he had felt me staring at him he stared back brown eyes neutral we stared at each other without saying anything his face was all angles highsculpted cheekbones and firm jaw a dimple softened the lines of his face and made him a little too perfect for my taste ive never been comfortable around men that are beautiful low selfesteem maybe or maybe jeanclaudes lovely face had made me appreciate the very human quality of imperfection is he all right i asked who stephen he glanced down at the sleeping man stephen made a small noise in his sleep helpless frightened definitely a nightmare should you wake him you mean from the dream he asked i nodded he smiled nice thought but he wont wake up for hours we could burn the place down around him and he wouldnt move why not you really want to know sure ive got nothing better to do right now he glanced up the silent hallway good point he settled back against the wall bare back searching for a more comfortable piece of wall he frowned so much for a comfortable wall stephen changed back from wolfman to human in less than a twohour time span he said it like it explained everything it didnt so i asked usually a shapeshifter stays in animal form for eight to ten hours then collapses and changes back to human form it takes a lot of energy to shapeshift early i glanced down at the dreaming shapeshifter so this collapse is normal richard nodded hell be out for the rest of the night not a great survival method i said a lot of werewolves bite the dust after collapsing the human hunters come upon them after theyve passed out how do you know so much about lycanthropes its my job he said i teach science at a local junior high i just stared at him youre a junior high science teacher yes he was smiling you looked shocked i shook my head whats a school teacher doing messed up with vampires and werewolves just lucky i guess i had to smile that doesnt explain how you know about lycanthropes i had a class in college i shook my head so did i but i didnt know about shapeshifters collapsing youve got a degree in preternatural biology he asked yep me too so how do you know more about lycanthropes than i do i said stephen moved in his sleep flinging his good arm outward the blanket slid off his shoulder exposing his stomach and part of a thigh richard drew the blanket back over the sleeping man covering him like tucking in a child stephen and i have been friends a long time i bet you know things about zombies that i never learned in college probably i said stephens not a teacher is he no he smiled but it wasnt pleasant school boards frown on lycanthropes being teachers legally they cant stop you yeah right he said they firebombed the last teacher who dared to teach their precious children lycanthropy isnt contagious while in human form i know that i said he shook his head sorry its just a sore topic with me my pet project was rights for zombies why shouldnt richard have a pet project fair hiring practices for the furry it worked for me you are being tactful ma petite i would not have thought it of you jeanclaude was in the hallway i hadnt heard him walk up but id been distracted talking with richard yeah that was it could you stamp your feet next time im getting sick of you sneaking up on me i wasnt sneaking ma petite you were distracted talking to our handsome mr zeeman his voice was pleasant mild as honey and yet there was a threat to it you could feel it like a cold wind down your spine whats wrong jeanclaude i asked wrong what could possibly be wrong anger and some bitter amusement flowed through his voice cut it out jeanclaude whatever could be the matter ma petite youre angry why my human servant does not know my every mood shameful he knelt beside me the blood on his white shirt had dried to a brownish stain that took up most of the shirt front the lace at his sleeves looked like crumpled brown flowers do you lust after richard because hes handsome or because hes human his voice was almost a whisper intimate as if hed said something entirely different jeanclaude whispered better than anyone else i knew i dont lust after him come come ma petite no lies he leaned towards me longfingered hand reaching for my cheek there was dried blood on his hand youve got blood under your fingernails i said he flinched his hand squeezing into a fist point for my side you reject me at every turn why do i put up with it i dont know i said truthfully i keep hoping youll get tired of me i am hoping to have you with me forever ma petite i would not make the offer if i thought i would grow bored i think i would get tired of you i said his eyes widened a bit i think it was real surprise you are trying to taunt me i shrugged yes but its still the truth im attracted to you but i dont love you we dont have stimulating conversations i dont go through my day saying i must remember to share that joke with jeanclaude or tell him about what happened at work tonight i ignore you when you let me the only things we have in common are violence and the dead i dont think thats much to base a relationship on my arent we the philosopher tonight his midnight blue eyes were only inches from mine the eyelashes looked like black lace just being honest we wouldnt want you to be less than honest he said i know how you despise lies he glanced at richard how you despise monsters why are you angry with richard am i he said you know damn well you are perhaps anita i am realizing that the one thing you want is the one thing i cannot give you and what do i want me to be human he said softly i shook my head if you think your only shortcoming is being a vampire youre wrong really yeah youre an egotistical overbearing bully a bully he sounded genuinely surprised you want me so you cant believe that i dont want you your needs your desires are more important than anyone elses you are my human servant ma petite it makes our lives complicated i am not your human servant i have marked you anita blake you are my human servant no i said it was a very firm no but my stomach was tight with the thought that he was right and i would never be free of him he stared at me his eyes were as normal as they ever got dark blue lovely if you had not been my human servant i could not have defeated the snake god so easily you mindraped me jeanclaude i dont care why you did it a look of distaste spread across his face if you choose the word rape then you know that i am not guilty of that particular crime nikolaos forced herself on you she tore at your mind ma petite if you had not carried two of my marks she would have destroyed you anger was bubbling up from my gut spreading up my back and into my arms i had this horrible urge to hit him and because of the marks you can enter my mind take me over you told me it made mind games harder on me not easier did you lie about that too my need was great tonight anita many people would have died if the creature had not been stopped i drew power where i could find it from me yes you are my human servant just by being near me you increase my power you know that i had known that but i hadnt known he could channel power through me like an amplifier i know im some sort of witchs familiar for you if you would allow the last two marks it would be more than that it would be a marriage of flesh blood and spirit i notice you didnt say soul i said he made an exasperated sound low in his throat you are insufferable he sounded genuinely angry goody dont you ever force your way into my mind again or what the words were a challenge angry confused i was on my knees beside him nearly spitting into his face i had to stop and take a few deep breaths to keep from screaming at him i spoke very calmly low and angry if you ever touch me like that again i will kill you you will try his face was nearly pressed against mine as if when he inhaled he would bring me to him our lips would touch i remembered how soft his lips were how it felt to be pressed against his chest the roughness of his crossshaped burn under my fingers i jerked back and felt almost dizzy it had only been one kiss but the memory of it burned along my body like every bad romance novel youd ever read leave me alone i hissed it in his face hands balled into fists damn you damn you the office door opened and a uniformed officer stuck his head out there a problem out here we turned and stared at him i opened my mouth to tell him exactly what was wrong but jeanclaude spoke first no problem officer it was a lie but what was the truth that i had two vampire marks on me and was losing my soul a piece at a time not something i really wanted to be common knowledge the police sort of frown on people who have close ties with the monsters the officer was looking at us waiting i shook my head nothings wrong officer its just late could you ask sergeant storr if i can go home now whats the name anita blake storrs pet animator i sighed yeah that anita blake ill ask the uniform stared at the three of us for a minute you got anything to add to this he was speaking to richard no the uniform nodded okay but keep whatever isnt happening to a dull roar of course always glad to cooperate with the police jeanclaude said he nodded his thanks and went back into the office we were left kneeling in the hallway the shapeshifter was still asleep on the floor his breathing made a quiet noise that didnt so much fill the silence as emphasize it richard was motionless dark eyes staring at jeanclaude i was suddenly very aware that jeanclaude and i were only inches apart i could feel the line of his body like warmth against my skin his eyes flicked from my face down my body i was still wearing only a bra underneath the unzipped jacket goosebumps rolled up my arms and down my chest my nipples hardened as if he had touched them my stomach clenched with a need that had nothing to do with blood stop it i am doing nothing ma petite it is your own desire that rolls over your skin not mine i swallowed and had to look away from him okay i lusted after him great fine it didnt mean a thing riight i scooted away from him putting my back to the wall not looking at him as i spoke i came here tonight for information not to play footsie with the master of the city richard was just sitting there meeting my eyes there was no embarrassment just interest as if he didnt know quite what i was it wasnt an unfriendly look footsie jeanclaude said i didnt need to see his face to hear the smile in his voice you know what i mean ive never heard it called footsie before stop doing that what i glared at him but his eyes were sparkling with laughter a slow smile touched his lips he looked very human just then what did you want to discuss ma petite it must be something very important to make you come near me voluntarily i searched his face for mockery or anger or anything but his face was as smooth and pleasant as carved marble the smile the sparkling humor in his eyes was like a mask i had no way of telling what lay underneath i wasnt even sure i wanted to know i took a deep breath and let it out slowly through my mouth alright where were you last night i looked at his face trying to catch any change of expression here he said all night he smiled yes can you prove it the smile widened do i need to maybe i said he shook his head coyness from you ma petite it does not become you so much for being slick and trying to pull information from the master are you sure you want this discussed in public you mean richard yes richard and i have no secrets from one another ma petite he is my human hands and eyes since you refuse to be whats that mean i thought you could only have one human servant at a time so you admit it his voice held a slow curl of triumph this isnt a game jeanclaude people died tonight believe me ma petite whether you take the last marks and become my servant in more than name is no game to me there was a murder last night i said maybe if i concentrated just on the crime on my job i could avoid the verbal pitfalls and he prompted it was a vampire victim ah he said my part in this becomes clear im glad you find it funny i said dying from vampire bites is only temporarily fatal ma petite wait until the third night when the victim rises then question him the humor died from his eyes what is it that you are not telling me i found at least five different bite radiuses on the victim something flickered behind his eyes i wasnt sure what but it was real emotion surprise fear guilt something so you are looking for a rogue master vampire yep know any he laughed his whole face lit up from the inside as if someone had lit a candle behind his skin in one wild moment he was so beautiful it made my chest ache but it wasnt a beauty that made me want to touch it i remembered a bengal tiger that id seen once in a zoo it was big enough to ride on like a pony its fur was orange black cream oystershell white its eyes were gold the heavy paws wider than my outspread hand paced paced back and forth back and forth until it had worn a path in the dirt some genius had put one barred wall so close to the fence that held back the crowd i could have reached through and touched the tiger easily i had to ball my hands into fists and shove them in my pockets to keep from reaching through those bars and petting that tiger it was so close so beautiful so wild so tempting i hugged my knees to my chest hands clasped tight together the tiger would have taken my hand off and yet there was that small part of me that regretted not reaching through the bars i watched jeanclaudes face felt his laughter like velvet running down my spine would part of me always wonder what it would have been like if i had just said yes probably but i could live with it he was staring at me the laughter dying from his eyes like the last bit of light seeping from the sky what are you thinking ma petite cant you read my mind i asked you know i cannot i dont know anything about you jeanclaude not a bloody thing you know more about me than anyone else in the city yasmeen included he lowered his eyes almost embarrassed we are very old friends how old he met my eyes but his face was empty blank old enough thats not an answer i said no he said it is an evasion so he wasnt going to answer my question what else was new are there any other master vampires in town besides you malcolm and yasmeen he shook his head not to my knowledge i frowned whats that supposed to mean exactly what i said youre the master of the city arent you supposed to know things are a little unsettled ma petite explain that he shrugged and even in the bloodstained shirt it looked graceful normally as master of the city all other lesser master vampires would need my permission to stay in the city but he shrugged againthere are those who think i am not strong enough to hold the city youve been challenged let us just say i am expecting to be challenged why i asked the other masters were afraid of nikolaos he said and theyre not afraid of you it wasnt a question unfortunately no why not they are not as easily impressed as you are ma petite i started to say i wasnt impressed but it wasnt true jeanclaude could smell it when i lied so why bother so there could be another master in the city without your knowledge yes wouldnt you sort of sense each other perhaps perhaps not thanks for clearing that up he rubbed fingertips across his forehead as if he had a headache did vampires get headaches i cannot tell you what i do not know would the i groped for a word and couldnt find onemore mundane vampires be able to kill someone without your permission mundane just answer the damn question yes they could would five vampires hunt in a pack without a master vampire to referee he nodded very nice choice of word ma petite and the answer is no we are solitary hunters given a choice i nodded so either you malcolm yasmeen or some mysterious master is behind it not yasmeen she is not strong enough okay then you malcolm or a mysterious master do you really think i have gone rogue he was smiling at me but his eyes held something more serious did it matter to him what i thought of him i hoped not i dont know you would confront me thinking i might be insane how indiscreet of you if you dont like the answer you shouldnt have asked the question i said very true the office door opened dolph came out notebook in hand you can go home anita ill check the statements with you tomorrow i nodded thanks heh i know where you live he smiled i smiled back thanks dolph i stood up jeanclaude stood in one smooth motion like he was a puppet pulled up by invisible strings richard stood slower using the wall to stand as if he were stiff standing richard was taller than jeanclaude by at least three inches which made richard sixone almost too tall for my taste but no one was asking me and could we talk to you some more jeanclaude dolph said jeanclaude said of course detective he walked down the hall there was a stiffness in the way he moved did vampires bruise had he been hurt in the fight did it matter no no it didnt in a way jeanclaude was right if he had been human even an egotistical son of a bitch there might have been possibilities im not prejudiced but god help me the man has to at least be alive walking corpses no matter how pretty are just not my cup of tea dolph held the door for jeanclaude dolph looked back at us youre free to go too mr zeeman what about my friend stephen dolph glanced at the sleeping shapeshifter take him home let him sleep it off ill talk to him tomorrow he glanced at his wristwatch make that later today ill tell stephen when he wakes up dolph nodded and closed the door we were alone in the buzzing silence of the hallway of course maybe it was just my own ears buzzing now what richard said we go home i said rashida drove i frowned who the other shapeshifter the woman whose arm was torn up i nodded take stephens car rashida drove us both i shook my head so youre stranded looks that way you could call a cab i said no money he almost smiled fine ill drive you home and stephen and stephen i said i was smiling and i didnt know why but it was better than crying you dont even know where i live it could be kansas city if its a tenhour drive youre on your own i said but if its reasonable ill drive you is meramec heights reasonable sure let me get the rest of my clothes he asked you look fully dressed to me i said ive got a coat around here somewhere ill wait here i said youll watch stephen something like fear crossed his face filled his eyes what are you afraid of i asked airplanes guns large predators and master vampires i agree with two out of four i said ill go get my coat i slid down to sit beside the sleeping werewolf well be waiting then ill hurry he smiled when he said it he had a very nice smile richard came back wearing a long black coat it looked like real leather it flapped like a cape around his bare chest i liked the way the leather framed his chest he buttoned the coat and tied the leather belt tight the black leather went with the long hair and handsome face the grey sweats and nikes did not he knelt and picked stephen up in his arms then stood the leather creaked as his upper arms strained stephen was my height and probably didnt weigh twenty pounds more than i did petite richard carried him like he wasnt heavy my my grandmother what strong arms you have is my line the better to hold you with he was looking at me very steadily i felt heat creeping up my face i hadnt meant to flirt not on purpose you want a ride or not my voice was rough angry with embarrassment i want a ride he said quietly then can the sarcasm i wasnt being sarcastic i stared up at him his eyes were perfectly brown like chocolate i didnt know what to say so i didnt say anything a tactic i should probably use more often i turned and walked away fishing my car keys out as i moved richard followed behind stephen snuffled against his chest pulling the blanket close in his sleep is your car very far a few blocks why stephen isnt dressed for the cold i frowned at him what you want me to drive the car around and pick you up that would be very nice he said i opened my mouth to say no then closed it the thin blanket wasnt much protection and some of stephens injuries were from saving my life i could drive the car around i satisfied myself with grumbling under my breath i cant believe im a doortodoor taxi for a werewolf richard either didnt hear me or chose to ignore it smart handsome junior high science teacher degree in preternatural biology what more could i ask for give me a minute and id think of something the car rode in its own tunnel of darkness the headlights were a moving circle of light the october night closed behind the car like a door stephen was asleep in the back seat of my nova richard sat in the passenger seat halfturned in his seat belt to look at me it was just polite to look at someone when you talk to them but i felt at a disadvantage because i had to watch the road all he had to do was stare at me what do you do in your spare time richard asked i shook my head i dont have spare time hobbies i dont think i have any of those either you must do something besides shoot large snakes in the head he said i smiled and glanced at him he leaned towards me as much as the seat belt would allow he was smiling too but there was something in his eyes or his posture that said he was serious interested in what i would say im an animator i said he clasped his hands together left elbow propped on the back of the seat okay when youre not raising the dead what do you do work on preternatural crimes with the police mostly murders and he said and i execute rogue vampires and and nothing i said i glanced at him again in the dark i couldnt see his eyes their color was too dark for that but i could feel his gaze probably imagination yeah id been hanging around jeanclaude too long the smell of richards leather coat mingled with a faint whiff of his cologne something expensive and sweet it went very nicely with the smell of leather i work i exercise i go out with friends i shrugged what do you do when youre not teaching scuba diving caving bird watching gardening astronomy his smile was a dim whiteness in the near dark you must have a lot more free time than i do actually the teacher always has more homework than the students he said sorry to hear that he shrugged the leather creaked and slithered over his skin good leather always moved like it was still alive do you watch tv he asked my television broke two years ago and i never replaced it you must do something for fun i thought about it i collect toy penguins the minute i said it i wished i hadnt he grinned at me now were getting somewhere the executioner collects stuffed toys i like it glad to hear it my voice sounded grumpy even to me whats wrong he said im not very good at small talk i said you were doing fine no i wasnt but i wasnt sure how to explain it to him i didnt like talking about myself to strangers especially strangers with ties to jeanclaude what do you want from me i said im just passing the time no you werent his shoulderlength hair had fallen around his face he was taller thicker but the outline was familiar he looked like phillip in the shadowed dark phillip was the only other human being id ever seen with the monsters phillip sagged in the chains blood poured in a bright red flood down his chest it splattered onto the floor like rain torchlight glittered on the wet bone of his spine someone had ripped his throat out i staggered against the wall as if someone had hit me i couldnt get enough air someone kept whispering oh god oh god over and over and it was me i walked down the steps with my back pressed against the wall i couldnt take my eyes from him couldnt look away couldnt breathe couldnt cry the torchlight reflected in his eyes giving the illusion of movement a scream built in my gut and spilled out my throat phillip something cold slithered up my spine i was sitting in my car with the ghost of guilty conscience it hadnt been my fault that phillip died i certainly didnt kill him but but i still felt guilty someone should have saved him and since i was the last one with a chance to do it it should have been me guilt is a many splendored thing what do you want from me richard i asked i dont want anything he said lies are ugly things richard what makes you think im lying finely honed instinct i said has it really been that long since a man tried to make polite small talk with you i started to look at him and decided not to it had been that long the last person who flirted with me was murdered it makes a girl a little cautious he was quiet for a minute fair enough but i still want to know more about you why why not he had me there how do i know jeanclaude didnt tell you to make friends why would he do that i shrugged okay lets start over pretend we met at the health club health club i said he smiled health club i thought you looked great in your swimsuit sweats i said he nodded you looked cute in your sweats i liked looking great better if i get to imagine you in a swimsuit you can look great sweats only get cute fair enough we made pleasant small talk and i asked you out i had to look at him are you asking me out yes i am i shook my head and turned back to the road i dont think thats a good idea why not he asked i told you just because one person got killed on you doesnt mean everyone will i gripped the steering wheel tight enough to make my hands hurt i was eight when my mother died my father remarried when i was ten i shook my head people go away and they dont come back sounds scary his voice was soft and low i didnt know what had made me say that i didnt usually talk about my mother to strangers or anybody else for that matter scary i said softly you could say that if you never let anyone get close to you you dont get hurt is that it there are also a lot of very jerky men in the twentyonetothirty age group i said he grinned ill give you that nicelooking intelligent independent women are not exactly plentiful either stop with the compliments or youll have me blushing you dont strike me as someone who blushes easily a picture flashed in my mind richard zeeman naked beside the bed struggling into his sweat pants it hadnt embarrassed me at the time it was only now with him so warm and close in the car that i thought about it a warm flush crept up my face i blushed in the dark glad he couldnt see i didnt want him to know i was thinking about what he looked like without his clothes on i dont usually do that of course i dont usually see a man buck naked before ive even gone out on a date come to think of it i didnt see men naked on dates either were in the health club sipping fruit juice and i ask you out i stared very hard at the road i kept flashing on the smooth line of his thigh and lower things it was embarrassing but the harder i tried not to think about it the clearer the picture seemed to get movies and dinner i said no he said something unique caving you mean crawling around in a cave on a first date have you ever been caving once did you enjoy it we were sneaking up on bad guys at the time i didnt think much about enjoying it then you have to give it another chance i go caving at least twice a month you get to wear your oldest clothes and get really dirty and no one tells you not to play in the mud mud i said too messy for you i was a biolab assistant in college nothings too messy for me at least you can say you get to use your degree in your work i laughed true i use my degree too but i went in for educating the munchkins do you like teaching very much those two words held a warmth and excitement that you didnt hear much when people talked about their work i like my job too even when it forces you to play with vampires and zombies i nodded yeah were sitting in the juice bar and ive just asked you out what do you say i should say no why i dont know you sound suspicious always i said never taking a chance is the worst failure of all anita not dating is a choice not a failure i was feeling a wee bit defensive say youll go caving this weekend the leather coat crinkled and moved as he tried to move closer to me than the seat belt would allow he could have reached out and touched me part of me wanted him to which was sort of embarrassing all on its own i started to say no then realized i wanted to say yes which was silly but i was enjoying sitting in the dark with the smell of leather and cologne call it chemistry instant lust whatever i liked richard he flipped my switch it had been a long time since i had liked anybody jeanclaude didnt count i wasnt sure why but he didnt being dead might have something to do with that alright ill go caving when and where great meet in front of my house at say ten oclock on saturday ten in the morning i said not a morning person he asked not particularly we have to start early or we wont get to the end of the cave in one day what do i wear your oldest clothes ill be dressed in coveralls over jeans ive got coveralls i didnt mention that i used my coveralls to keep blood off my clothes mud sounded a lot more friendly great ill bring the rest of the equipment you need how much more equipment do i need a hard hat a light maybe knee pads sounds like a boffo first date i said it will be he said his voice was soft low and somehow more private than just sitting in my car it wasnt jeanclaudes magical voice but then what was turn right here he said pointing to a side street third house on the right i pulled into a short blacktopped driveway the house was half brick and some pale color it was hard to tell in the dark there were no streetlights to help you see you forget how dark the night can be without electricity richard unbuckled his seat belt and opened the door thanks for the ride do you need help getting him inside my hand was on the key as i asked no i got it thanks though dont mention it he stared at me did i do something wrong not yet i said he smiled a quick flash in the darkness good he unlocked the back door behind him and got out of the car he leaned in and scooped stephen up holding the blanket close so it didnt slide off he lifted with his legs more than his back weightlifting will teach you that a human body is a lot harder to lift than even free weights a body just isnt balanced as well as a barbell richard shut the car door with his back the back door clicked shut and i unbuckled my seat belt so i could lock the doors through the stillopen passenger side door richard was watching me over the idling of the cars engine his voice carried locking out the boogeymen you never know i said he nodded yeah there was something in that one word that was sad wistful innocence lost it was nice to talk with another person who understood dolph and zerbrowski understood the violence and the nearness of death but they didnt understand the monsters i closed the door and scooted back behind the steering wheel i buckled my seat belt and put the car in gear the headlights sparkled over richard stephens hair like a yellow splash in his arms richard was still staring at me i left him in the dark in front of his house with the singing of autumn crickets the only sound i pulled up in front of my apartment building at a little after am id planned to be in bed a long time before this the new crossshaped burn was a burning acideating ache it made my whole chest hurt my ribs and stomach were sore stiff i turned on the dome light in the car and unzipped the leather jacket in the yellow light bruises were blossoming across my skin for a minute i couldnt think how id gotten hurt then i remembered the crushing weight of the snake crawling over me jesus i was lucky it was bruises and not broken ribs i clicked off the light and zipped the jacket back up the shoulder straps were chafing on my bare skin but the burn hurt so much more that the bruises and the chafing seemed pretty darn minor a good burn will take your mind off everything else the light that usually burned over the stairs was out not the first time id have to call the office once it opened for the day and report it though if you didnt report it it didnt get fixed i was three steps up before i saw the man he was sitting at the head of the stairs waiting for me short blond hair pale in the darkness his hands sat on the top of his knees palms up to show that he didnt have a weapon well that he didnt have a weapon in his hands edward always had a weapon unless someone had taken it away from him come to think of it so did i long time no see edward three months he said long enough for my broken arm to heal completely i nodded i got my stitches out about two months ago he just sat on the steps looking down at me what do you want edward couldnt it be a social call he was laughing at me quietly its two oclock in the freaking morning it better not be a social call would you rather it was business his voice was soft but it carried i shook my head no no i never wanted to be business for edward he specialized in killing lycanthropes vampires anything that used to be human and wasnt anymore hed gotten bored with killing people too easy is it business my voice was steady no tremble good for me i could draw the browning but if we ever drew down on each other for real hed kill me being friends with edward was like being friends with a tame leopard you could pet it and it seemed to like you but you knew deep down that if it ever got hungry enough or angry enough it would kill you kill you and eat the flesh from your bones just information tonight anita no problems what sort of information i asked he smiled again friendly ol edward riight can we go inside and talk about it its freezing out here he said the last time you were in town you didnt seem to need an invitation to break into my apartment youve got a new lock i grinned you couldnt pick it could you i was genuinely pleased he shrugged maybe it was the darkness but if it hadnt been edward id have said he was embarrassed the locksmith told me it was burglarproof i said i didnt bring my battering ram with me he said come on up ill fix coffee i stepped around him he stood and followed me i turned my back on him without worrying edward might shoot me someday but he wouldnt do it in the back after telling me he was just here to talk edward wasnt honorable but he had rules if he planned to kill me hed have announced it told me how much people were paying him to off me watched the fear slide through my eyes yeah edward had rules he just had fewer of them than most people did but he never broke a rule never betrayed his own skewed sense of honor if he said i was safe for tonight he meant it it would have been nice if jeanclaude had had rules the hallway was middleofthenight middleoftheweek hadtogetupinthemorning quiet my day living neighbors were all asnooze in their beds without care i unlocked the new locks on my door and ushered edward inside thats a new look for you isnt it he asked what what happened to your shirt oh suave comebacks thats me i didnt know what to say or rather how much to say youve been playing with vampires again he said what makes you think so i asked the crossshaped burn on your ah chest oh that fine i unzipped the jacket and folded it over the back of the couch i stood there in my bra and shoulder holster and met his eyes without blushing brownie point for me i undid the belt and slipped out of the shoulder holster then took it into the kitchen with me i laid the gun still in its holster on the countertop and got coffee beans out of the freezer wearing just my bra and jeans in front of any other male alive or dead i would have been embarrassed but not edward there had never been sexual tension between us we might shoot each other one fine day but wed never sleep together he was more interested in the fresh burn than my breasts howd it happen he asked i ground the beans in the little electric spice mill id bought for the occasion just the smell of freshly ground coffee made me feel better i put a filter in my mr coffee poured the coffee in poured the water in and pushed the button this was about as fancy as my cooking skills got im going to get a shirt to throw on i said the burn wont like anything touching it edward said i wont button it then are you going to tell me how you got burned yes i took my gun and walked into the bedroom in the back of my closet i had a longsleeved shirt that had once been purple but had faded to a soft lilac it was a mans dress shirt and hung down nearly to my knees but it was comfortable i rolled the sleeves up to my elbows and buttoned it halfway up i left it gapping over the burn i glanced in the mirror and found that most of my cleavage was covered perfect i hesitated but finally put the browning hipower in its holster behind the headboard edward and i werent fighting tonight and anything that came through the door with its new locks would have to go through edward first i felt pretty safe he was sitting on my couch legs out in front of him crossed at the ankle hed sunk down until the top of his shoulders rested on the couchs arm make yourself at home i said he just smiled are you going to tell me about the vampires yes but im having trouble deciding exactly how much to tell you the smile widened naturally i set out two mugs sugar and real cream from the refrigerator the coffee dripped into the little glass pot the smell was rich warm and thick enough to wrap your arms around how do you like your coffee fix it the way youd fix it for yourself i glanced back at him no preference he shook his head still resting against the couch arm okay i poured the coffee into the mugs added three sugars and a lot of cream to each stirred and sat them on the twoseater breakfast table youre not going to bring it to me you dont drink coffee on a white couch i said ah he got up in one smooth motion all grace and energy hed have been very impressive if i hadnt spent most of the night with vampires we sat across from each other his eyes were the color of spring skies that warm pale blue that still manages to look cold his face was pleasant his eyes neutral and watching everything i did i told him about yasmeen and marguerite i left out jeanclaude the vampire murder the giant cobra stephen the werewolf and rick zeeman which meant it was a very short story when i finished edward sat there sipping his coffee and staring at me i sipped coffee and stared back that does explain the burn he said great i said but you left out a lot how do you know because i was following you i stared at him choking on my coffee when i could talk without coughing i said you were what following you he said his eyes were still neutral smile still pleasant why ive been hired to kill the master of the city you were hired for that three months ago nikolaos is dead the new master isnt you didnt kill nikolaos i said i did true you want half the money i shook my head then whats your complaint i got my arm broken helping you kill her and i got fourteen stitches and we both got vampire bit i said and cleansed ourselves with holy water edward said which burns likes acid i said edward nodded sipped his coffee something moved behind his eyes something liquid and dangerous his expression hadnt changed id swear to it but it was suddenly all i could do to meet his eyes why were you following me edward i was told you would be meeting with the new master tonight who told you that he shook his head that inscrutable smile curling his lips i was inside the circus tonight anita i saw who you were with you played with the vampires then you went home so one of them has to be the master i fought to keep my face blank too blank so the effort showed but the panic didnt show edward had been following me and i hadnt known it he knew all the vampires i had seen tonight it wasnt that big a list hed figure it out wait a minute i said you let me go up against that snake without helping me i came in after the crowd ran out it was almost over by the time i peeked into the tent i drank coffee and tried to think of a way to make this better he had a contract to kill the master and i had led him right to him i had betrayed jeanclaude why did that bother me edward was watching my face as if he would memorize it he was waiting for my face to betray me i worked hard at being blank and inscrutable he smiled that close canaryeating grin of his he was enjoying himself i was not you only saw four vampires tonight jeanclaude the dark exotic one who must be yasmeen and the two blonds you got names for the blonds i shook my head his smile widened would you tell me if you had maybe the blonds arent important he said neither of them were master vamps i stared at him forcing my face to be neutral pleasant attentive blank blank is not one of my better expressions but maybe if i practiced enough that leaves jeanclaude and yasmeen yasmeens new in town that just leaves jeanclaude do you really think that the master of the freaking city would show himself like that i put all the scorn i could find into my voice i wasnt the best actor in the world but maybe i could learn edward stared at me its jeanclaude isnt it jeanclaude isnt powerful enough to hold the city you know that hes what a little over two hundred not old enough he frowned at me good its not yasmeen true you didnt talk to any other vampires tonight you may have followed me into the circus edward but you didnt listen at the door when i met the master you couldnt have the vamps or the shapeshifters would have heard you he acknowledged it with a nod i saw the master tonight but it wasnt anyone who came down to fight the snake the master let his people risk their lives and didnt help his smile was back the master of the city doesnt have to be physically present to lend his power you know that no he said i dont i shrugged believe it or not i prayed please let him believe he was frowning youre not usually this good a liar im not lying my voice sounded calm normal truthful honestyrus if jeanclaude really isnt the master then you know who is the question was a trap i couldnt answer yes to both questions but hell id been lying why stop now yes i know who it is tell me he said i shook my head the master would kill me if he knew i talked to you we can kill him together like we did the last one his voice was terribly reasonable i thought about it for a minute i thought about telling him the truth humans first might not be up to tangling with the master but edward was we could kill him together a team my life would be a lot simpler i shook my head and sighed shit i cant edward wont he said i nodded wont if i believe you anita it means i need the name of the master it means you are the only human who knows that name the friendly banter seeped out of his face like melting ice his eyes were as empty and pitiless as a winter sky there was no one home that i could talk to you dont want to be the only human who knows the name anita he was right i didnt but what could i say take it or leave it edward save yourself a lot of pain anita tell me the name he believed hot damn i lowered my eyes to look down into my coffee so he wouldnt see the flash of triumph in my eyes when i looked back up i had my face under control me and meryl streep i dont give in to threats you know that he nodded he finished his coffee and sat the mug in the middle of the table i will do whatever is necessary to finish this job i never doubted that i said he was talking about torturing me for information he sounded almost regretful but that wouldnt stop him one of edwards primary rules was always finish a job he wouldnt let a little thing like friendship ruin his perfect record you saved my life and i saved yours he said it doesnt buy you anything now you understand that i nodded i understand good he stood up i stood up we looked at each other he shook his head ill find you tonight and ill ask again i wont be bullied edward i was finally getting a little mad he had come in here asking for information now he was threatening me i let the anger show no acting needed youre tough anita but not that tough his eyes were neutral but wary like those of a wolf id seen once in california id just walked around a tree and there it had been standing i froze i had never really understood what neutral meant until then the wolf didnt give a damn if it hurt me or not my choice threaten it and the shit hit the fan give it room to run and it would run but the wolf didnt care it was prepared either way i was the one with my pulse in my throat so startled that id stopped breathing i held my breath and wondered what the wolf would decide it finally loped off through the trees id relearned how to breathe and gone back down to the campsite i had been scared but i could still close my eyes and see the wolfs pale grey eyes the wonder of staring at a large predator without any cage bars between us it had been wonderful i stared up at edward now and knew that this too was wonderful in its way whether i had known the information or not i wouldnt have told him no one bullied me no one that was one of my rules i dont want to have to kill you edward he smiled then you kill me he was laughing at me you bet i said the laughter seeped out of his eyes his lips his face until he stared at me with his neutral predator eyes i swallowed and remembered to take slow even breaths he would kill me maybe maybe not is the master worth one of us dying i asked its a matter of principle he said i nodded me too we know where we stand then he said yeah he walked towards the door i followed and unlocked the door for him he paused in the doorway youve got until full dark tonight the answer will be the same i know he said he walked out without even glancing back i watched him until he disappeared down the stairs then i shut the door and locked it i stood leaning my back against the door and tried to think of a way out if i told jeanclaude he might be able to kill edward but i didnt give humans to the monsters not for any reason i could tell edward about jeanclaude he might even be able to kill the master i could even help him i tried picturing jeanclaudes perfect body riddled with bullets covered in blood his face blown away by a shotgun i shook my head i couldnt do it i didnt know why exactly but i couldnt hand jeanclaude over to edward i couldnt betray either of them which left me assdeep in alligators so what else was new i stood on the shore under a black fringe of trees the black lake lapped and rolled away into the dark the moon hung huge and silver in the sky the moonlight made glittering patterns on the water jeanclaude rose from the water water was streaming in silver lines from his hair and shirt his short black hair was in tight curls from being wet the white shirt clung to his body making his nipples clear and hard against the cloth he held out his hand to me i was wearing a long dark dress it was heavy and hung around me like a weight something inside the skirt made it stick out to either side like a tiny malformed hoop a heavy cloak was pushed back over my shoulders it was autumn and the moon was harvestfull jeanclaude said come to me i stepped off the shore and sank into the water it filled the skirt soaking into the cloak i tore the cloak off letting it sink out of sight the water was warm as bath water warm as blood i raised my hand to the moonlight and the liquid that streamed down it was thick and dark and had never been water i stood in the shallows in a dress that i had never imagined by a shore i did not know and stared at the beautiful monster as he moved towards me graceful and covered in blood i woke gasping for air hands clutching at the sheets like a lifeline you promised to stay out of my dreams you son of a bitch i whispered the radio clock beside the bed read pm id been asleep for ten hours i should have felt better but i didnt it was as if id been running from nightmare to nightmare and hadnt really gotten to rest the only dream i remembered was the last one if they had all been that bad i didnt want to remember the rest why was jeanclaude haunting my dreams again hed given his word but maybe his word wasnt worth anything maybe i stripped in front of the bathroom mirror my ribs and stomach were covered in deep nearly purple bruises my chest was tight when i breathed but nothing was broken the burn on my chest was raw the skin blackened where it wasnt covered in blisters a burn hurts all the way down as if the pain burrows from the skin down to the bone a burn is the only injury where i am convinced i have nerve endings below skin level how could it hurt so damn bad otherwise i was meeting ronnie at the health club at three ronnie was short for veronica she said it helped her get more work as a private detective if people assumed she was male sad but true we would lift weights and jog i slipped a black sports bra very carefully over the burn the elastic pressed in on the bruises but everything else was okay i rubbed the burn with antiseptic cream and taped a piece of gauze over it a mans red tshirt with the sleeves and neck cut out went over everything else black biker pants jogging socks with a thin red stripe and black nike airs completed the outfit the tshirt showed the gauze but it hid the bruises most of the regulars at the health club were accustomed to my coming in bruised or worse they didnt ask a lot of questions anymore ronnie says i was grumpy at them fine with me i like to be left alone i had my coat on gym bag in hand when the phone rang i debated but finally picked it up talk to me i said its dolph my stomach tightened was it another murder whats up dolph we got an id on the john doe you looked at the vampire victim yeah i let out the breath id been holding no more murders and we were making progress what could be better calvin barnabas rupert friends called him cal twentysix years old married to denise smythe rupert for four years no children he was an insurance broker we havent been able to turn up any ties with the vampire community maybe mr rupert was just in the right place at the wrong time random violence he made it a question maybe if it was random we got no pattern nothing to look at so youre wondering if i can find out if cal rupert had any ties to the monsters yes he said i sighed ill try is that it im late for an appointment thats it call me if you find out anything his voice sounded positively grim youd tell me if you found another body wouldnt you he gave a snort of laughter make you come down and measure the damn bites yeah why your voice sounds grim the laughter dribbled out of his voice youre the one who said thered be more bodies you changed your mind on that i wanted to say yes ive changed my mind but i didnt if there is a pack of rogue vampires well be seeing more bodies can you think of anything else it could be besides vampires he asked i thought about it for a minute and shook my head not a damn thing fine talk to you later the phone buzzed dead in my hand before i could say anything dolph wasnt much on hello and goodbye i had my backup gun a firestar mm in the pocket of my jacket there was just no way to wear a holster in exercise clothes the firestar only held eight bullets to the brownings thirteen but the browning tended to stick out of my pocket and make people stare besides if i couldnt get the bad guys with eight bullets another five probably wouldnt help of course there was an extra clip in the zipper pocket of my gym bag a girl couldnt be too cautious in these crimeridden times ronnie and i were doing power circuits at vic tannys there were two full sets of machines and no waiting at on a thursday afternoon i was doing the hip abductionhip adduction machine you pulled a lever on the side and the machine went to different positions the hip adduction position looked vaguely obscene like a gynecological torture device it was one of the reasons i never wore shorts when we lifted weights ronnie either i was concentrating on pressing my thighs together without making the weights clink weights clinking means youre not controlling the exercise or it means youre working with too much weight i was using sixty pounds it wasnt too heavy ronnie lay on her stomach using the leg curl flexing her calves over her back heels nearly touching her butt the muscles under her calves bunched and coiled under her skin neither of us is bulky but were solid think linda hamilton in terminator ronnie finished before i did and paced around the machines waiting for me i let the weights ease back with only the slightest clink its okay to clink the weights when youre finished we eased out from the machines and started running on the oval track the track was bordered by a glass wall that showed the blue pool a lone man was doing laps in goggles and a black bathing cap the other side was bordered by the free weight room and the aerobics studio the ends of the track were mirrored so you could always see yourself running face on on bad days i could have done without watching myself on good days it was kind of fun a way to make sure your stride was even arms pumping i told ronnie about the vampire victim as we ran which meant we werent running fast enough i increased my pace and could still talk when you routinely do four miles outside in the st louis heat the padded track at vic tanny is just not that big a challenge we did two laps and went back to the machines what did you say the victims name was again she sounded normal no strain i increased our pace to a flatout run all talking ceased arm machines this time regular pullover for me overhead press for ronnie then two laps of the track then trade machines when i could talk i answered her question calvin rupert i said i did twelve pullovers with pounds of all the machines this one is easiest for me weird huh cal rupert she asked thats what his friends called him i said why she shook her head i know a cal rupert i watched her and let my body do the exercise without me i was holding my breath which is bad i remembered to breathe and said tell me when i was asking questions around humans against vampires during that rash of vampire deaths cal rupert belonged to hav describe him for me blond blue or grey eyes not too tall well built attractive there might be more than one cal rupert in st louis but what were the odds that theyd look that much alike ill have dolph check it out but if he was a member of hav it might mean the vampire kill was an execution what do you mean some of hav thinks the only good vampire is a dead vampire i was thinking of humans first mr jeremy ruebenss little group had they killed a vampire already was this retaliation i need to know if cal was still a member of hav or if hed joined a new more radical group called humans first catchy ronnie said can you find out for me if i go down there asking questions theyll burn me at the stake always glad to help my best friend and the police at the same time a private detective never knows when having the police owe you one may come in handy true i said i got to wait for ronnie this time on leg machines she was faster upper body was my area ill call dolph as soon as were finished here maybe its a pattern a hell of a coincidence if its not we started around the track and ronnie said so have you decided what youre wearing to catherines halloween party i glanced at her nearly stumbling shit i said i take that to mean you forgot about the party you were bitching about it only two days ago ive been a little busy okay i said but it wasnt all right catherine maisongillett was one of my best friends id worn a pink prom dress with puff sleeves in her wedding it had been humiliating wed all told the great lie of all bridesmaids we could cut the dress short and wear it in normal life no way or i could wear it at the next formal occasion i was invited to how many formals are you invited to once you graduate college none at least none where id willingly wear a pink puffsleeved hoopskirted reject from gone with the wind catherine was throwing her very first party since the wedding the halloween festivities started long before dark so that i could make an appearance when someone goes to that much trouble you have to show up dammit i made a date for saturday i said ronnie stopped running and stared at me in the mirror i kept running if she wanted to ask questions shed have to catch me first she caught me did you say date i nodded saving my breath for running talk anita her voice was vaguely threatening i grinned at her and told her an edited version of my meeting with richard zeeman i didnt leave out much though he was naked in a bed the first time you saw him she was cheerfully outraged i nodded you do meet men in the most interesting places she said we were jogging on the track again whens the last time i met a man what about john burke other than him jerks did not count she thought about that for a minute she shook her head too long yep i said we were on our last machine the last two laps then stretching showers and done i didnt really enjoy exercising neither did ronnie but we both needed to be in good shape so we could run away from the bad guys or run them down though i hadnt chased after many villains lately i seemed to do a lot more running away we moved over to the open area near the racquetball courts and the tanning rooms it was the only place with enough room to stretch out i always stretched before and after exercising id had too many injuries not to be careful i started rotating the neck slowly ronnie followed me i guess ill have to cancel the date dont you dare ronnie said invite him to the party i looked at her youve got to be kidding a first date surrounded by people he doesnt know who do you know besides catherine she asked she had a point there ive met her new husband you were in the wedding ronnie said oh yeah ronnie frowned at me be serious ask him to the party make plans for the caving next week two dates with the same man i shook my head what if we dont like each other no excuses ronnie said this is the closest youve been to a date in months dont blow it i dont date because i dont have time to date you dont have time to sleep either but you manage it she said ill do it but he may say no to the party i would rather not go myself why not i gave her a long look she looked innocent enough im an animator a zombiequeen having me at a halloween party is redundant you dont have to tell people what you do for a living im not ashamed of it i didnt say you were ronnie said i shook my head just forget it ill make the counteroffer to richard then well go from there youll want a sexy outfit for the party now she said do not i said she laughed do too all right all right a sexy outfit if i can find one in my size three days before halloween ill help you well find something shed help me wed find something it sounded sort of ominous predate jitters who me at that afternoon i was on the phone to richard zeeman hi richard this is anita blake nice to hear your voice his voice was smiling over the phone i could almost feel it i forgot that ive got a halloween party to go to saturday afternoon they started the party during daylight so i could make an appearance i cant not show up i understand he said his voice was very carefully neutralneutral cheerful would you like to be my date for the party i have to work halloween night of course but the day could be ours and the caving a rain check i said two dates this could be serious youre laughing at me i said never shit do you want to go or not if you promise to go caving a week from saturday my solemn word i said its a deal he was quiet on the phone for a minute i dont have to wear a costume for this party do i unfortunately yes i said he sighed backing out no but you owe me two dates for humiliating myself in front of strangers i grinned and was glad he couldnt see it i was entirely too pleased deal what costume are you wearing he asked i havent got one yet i told you i forgot the party i meant it hmm he said i think picking out costumes should tell a lot about a person dont you this close to halloween well be lucky to find anything in our size he laughed i might have an ace up my sleeve what he laughed again dont sound so damn suspicious ive got a friend whos a civil war buff he and his wife do recreations you mean like dress up yes will they have the right sizes what size dress do you wear that was a personal question for someone whod never even kissed me seven i said i would have guessed smaller im too chesty for a six and they dont make six and a halfs chesty woo woo stop it sorry couldnt resist he said my beeper went off damn whats that sound my beeper i said i pressed the button and it flashed the numberthe police i have to take it can i call you back in a few minutes richard ill wait with bated breath im frowning at the phone i hope you know that thanks for sharing that ill wait here by the phone call me when youre done with sob work cut it out richard whatd i do bye richard talk to you soon ill be waiting he said bye richard i hung up before he could make any more pitiful me jokes the really sad part was i thought it was cute gag me with a spoon i called dolphs number anita yeah we got another vampire victim looks the same as the first one except its a woman damn i said softly yeah were over here at desoto thats farther south than arnold i said so he said nothing just give me the directions he did itll take me at least an hour to get there i said the stiffs not going anywhere and neither are we he sounded discouraged cheer up dolph i may have found a clue talk veronica sims recognized the name cal rupert description matches what are you doing talking to a private detective he sounded suspicious shes my workout partner and since she just gave us our first clue id sound a little more grateful if i were you yeah yeah hurrah for the private sector now talk a cal rupert was a member of hav about two months ago the description matches revenge killings he asked maybe half of me hopes its a pattern at least wed have some place to start looking he made a sound between a laugh and a snort ill tell zerbrowski you found a clue hell like that all us dick tracy crimebusters speak police lingo i said police lingo i could feel the grin over the phone you find any more clues you let us know aye aye sergeant can the sarcasm he said please i always use fresh sarcasm never canned he groaned just get your butt out here so we can all go home the phone went dead i hung up richard zeeman answered on the second ring hello its anita whats up the message was from the police they need my expertise a preternatural crime he asked yeah is it dangerous to the person who was killed yeah you know thats not what i meant he said its my job richard if you cant deal with it maybe we shouldnt date at all hey dont get defensive i just wanted to know if you would be in any personal danger his voice was indignant fine ive got to go what about the costumes do you want me to call my friend sure will you trust me to pick your costume he asked i thought about that for a few heartbeats did i trust him to get me a costume no did i have time to hunt up a costume on my own probably not why not i said beggars cant be choosers well survive the party and then next week well go crawl in the mud i cant wait i said he laughed neither can i ive got to go richard ill have the costumes at your apartment for inspection ill need directions i gave him directions i hope you like your costume me too talk to you later i hung the receiver on the pay phones cradle and stared at it that had been too easy too smooth hed probably pick out a terrible costume for me wed both have a miserable time and be trapped into a second date with each other eek ronnie handed me a can of fruit juice and took a sip of her own she had cranberry and i had ruby red grapefruit i couldnt stand cranberry whatd cutesie pie say please dont call him that i said she shrugged sorry it just sort of slipped out she had the grace to look embarrassed i forgive you this once she grinned and i knew she wasnt repentant but id ribbed her often enough about her dates turnabout is fair play payback is a bitch the sun was sinking in a slash of crimson like a fresh bleeding wound purple clouds were piling up to the west the wind was strong and smelled like rain ruffo lane was a narrow gravel road barely wide enough for two cars to pass each other the reddish gravel crunched underfoot wind rustled the tall dry weeds in the ditch the road disappeared over the rise of a hill police cars marked and plain were lined up along one side of the road as far as i could see the road disappeared over the rise of a hill there were a lot of hills in jefferson county i was already dressed in a clean pair of overalls black nikes and surgical gloves when my beeper went off i had to scramble at the zipper and drag the damn thing out into the dying light i didnt have to see the number i knew it was bert it was only a half hour until full dark if that my boss was wondering where i was and why i wasnt at work i wondered if bert would really fire me i stared down at the corpse and wasnt sure i cared the woman was curled on her side arms shielding her naked breasts as if even in death she was modest violent death is the ultimate invasion she would be photographed videotaped measured cut open sewn back up no part of her inside or out would be left untouched it was wrong we should have been able to toss a blanket over her and leave her in peace but that wouldnt help us prevent the next killing and there would be a next one the second body was proof of that i glanced around at the police and the ambulance team waiting to take the body away except for the body i was the only woman i usually was but tonight for some reason it bothered me her waistlength hair spilled out into the weeds in a pale flood another blonde was that coincidence or not two was a pretty small sample if the next victim was blond then wed have a trend if all the victims were caucasian blond and members of humans against vampires wed have our pattern patterns helped solve the crime i was hoping for a pattern i held a penlight in my mouth and measured the bite marks there were no bite marks on the wrists this time there were rope burns instead theyd tied her up maybe hung her from the ceiling like a side of beef there is no such thing as a good vampire who feeds off humans never believe that a vampire will only take a little that it wont hurt thats like believing your date will pull out in time just trust him yeah right there was a neat puncture wound on either side of the neck there was a bit of flesh missing from her left breast as if something had taken a bite out of her just above the heart the bend of her right arm was torn apart the ball joint was naked in the thin beam of light pinkish ligaments strained to hold the arm together the last serial murderer that id worked on had torn the victims into pieces i had walked on carpet so drenched with blood that it squelched underfoot i had held pieces of intestine in my hand looking for clues it was the new worstthingideverseen i stared down at the dead woman and was glad she hadnt been torn apart and it wasnt because i figured it had been an easier death though i hoped it had and it wasnt because there were more clues because there werent it was just that i didnt want to see any more slaughtered people id had my quota for the year there is an art to holding a penlight in your mouth and measuring wounds without drooling on yourself i managed the secret was sucking on the end of the flashlight from time to time the thin beam of the flashlight shone on her thighs i wanted to see if she had a groin wound like the man i wanted to be sure this was the work of the same killers it would be a hell of a coincidence if there were two vampire packs hunting separately but it was possible i needed to be as sure as i could that we had just one rogue pack one was plenty two was a screaming nightmare surely god would not be that unkind but just in case i wanted to see if she had a groin wound the mans hands had shown no rope marks either the vampires were getting more organized or it was a different group her arms had been glued over her chest tied in place by rigor mortis nothing short of an axe was going to move her legs not until final rigor went away which would be fortyeight hours or so i couldnt wait two days but i didnt want to chop the body into pieces either i got down on all fours in front of the corpse i apologized for what i was about to do but couldnt think of anything better the flashlights thin beam trembled over her thighs like a tiny spotlight i touched the line that separated her legs and pushed my fingers in that line trying to feel by fingertip if there was a wound there it must have looked like i was groping the corpse but i couldnt think of a more dignified way to do it i glanced up trying not to feel the solid rubberiness of her skin the sun was just a splash of crimson in the west like dying coals true darkness slipped over the sky like a flood of ink and the womans legs moved under my hands i jumped nearly swallowing the flashlight nervous me the womans flesh was soft it hadnt been a moment ago the womans lips were halfparted hadnt they been closed before this was crazy even if she had been a vampire she wouldnt rise until the third night after death and shed died from multiple vampire bites in one massive blood feast she was dead just dead her skin shimmered white in the darkness the sky was black if the moon was up in those blackpurple clouds i couldnt see it yet her skin shimmered as if touched by moonlight she wasnt exactly glowing but it was close her hair glimmered like spider silk spread over the grass shed just been dead a minute ago now she was beautiful dolph loomed over me at sixnine he loomed even when i was standing up with me kneeling he was gigantic i stood up peeled off one surgical glove and took the penlight out of my mouth never touch anything youre likely to put in your mouth after touching the open wounds of a stranger aids you know i shoved the penlight into the breast pocket of the coveralls i took off the other glove and crumpled them both into a side pocket well dolph said does she look different to you i asked he frowned what the corpse does it look different to you he stared down at the pale body now that you mention it it looks like shes asleep he shook his head were going to have to call an ambulance and have a doctor pronounce her dead shes not breathing would you want the fact that you werent breathing to be the only criterion i thought about that for a minute no i guess not dolph leafed through his notebook you said a person who dies of multiple vampire bites cant rise from the dead as a vampire he was reading my own words back at me i was hoist on my petard thats true in most cases he stared down at the woman but not in this one unfortunately no i said explain this anita he didnt sound happy i didnt blame him sometimes even one bite can make a corpse rise as a vampire ive only read a couple of articles about it a very powerful master vamp can sometimes contaminate every corpse it touches whered you read the articles the vampire quarterly never heard of it he said i shrugged i have a degree in preternatural biology i must be on someones list for stuff like that a thought came to me that wasnt pleasant at all dolph yeah the man the first corpse this is its third night it didnt glow in the dark dolph said the womans corpse didnt look bad until full dark you think the mans going to rise he asked i nodded shit he said exactly i said he shook his head wait a minute he can still tell us who killed him he wont come back as a normal vamp i said he died of multiple wounds dolph hell come back as more animal than human explain that if they took the body to st louis city hospital then its safe behind reinforced steel but if they listened to me then its at the regular morgue call the morgue and tell them to evacuate the building youre serious he said absolutely he didnt even argue with me i was his preternatural expert and what i said was pretty much gospel until proven otherwise dolph didnt ask for your opinion unless he was prepared to act upon it he was a good boss he slipped into his car nearest to the murder scene of course and called the morgue he leaned out the open car door the body was sent to st louis city hospital routine for all vampire victims even ones our preternatural expert tells us are safe he smiled at me when he said it call st louis city and make sure theyve got the body in the vault room why would they transport the body to the vampire morgue and not put the body in the vault room he asked i shook my head i dont know but ill feel better after you call them he took a deep breath and let it go okay he got back on the phone and dialed the number from memory shows what kind of year dolphs been having i stood at the open car door and listened there wasnt much to hear no one answered dolph sat there listening to the distant ring of the phone he stared up at me his eyes asked the question somebody should be there i said yeah he said the man will rise like a beast i said itll slaughter everything in its path unless the master that made it comes back to pick it up or until its really dead theyre called animalistic vampires theres no colloquial term for them theyre too rare for that dolph hung up the phone and surged out of the car yelling zerbrowski here sarge zerbrowski came at a trot when dolph yelled you came running or else hows it going blake what was i supposed to say terrible i shrugged and said fine my beeper went off again dammit bert talk to your boss dolph said tell him to leave you the fuck alone sounded good to me dolph went off yelling orders the men scrambled to obey i slid into dolphs car and called bert he answered on the first ring not a good sign this better be you anita and if its not i said where the hell are you murder scene with a fresh body i said that stopped him for a second youre missing your first appointment yeah but im not going to yell youre being reasonable i said whats wrong nothing except that the newest member of animators inc is taking your first two appointments his name is lawrence kirkland just meet him at the third appointment and you can take the last three appointments and show him the ropes you hired someone howd you find someone so fast animators are pretty rare especially one who could do two zombies in one night its my job to find talent dolph slid into the car and i slid into the passenger seat tell your boss youve got to go ive got to go bert wait you have an emergency vampire staking at st louis city hospital my stomach clenched up what name he paused reading the name calvin rupert shit whats wrong he asked when did the call come in around three this afternoon why shit shit shit whats wrong anita bert asked why was it marked urgent zerbrowski slipped into the back of the unmarked car dolph put the car in gear and hit the sirens and lights a marked car fell into line behind us lights strobing into the dark lights and sirens wowee rupert had one of those dying wills bert said if he even had one vampire bite he wanted to be staked that was consistent with someone who was a member of hav hell i had it in my will do we have a court order of execution you only need that after the guy rises as a vampire weve got permission from the next of kin just go stake him i grabbed the dashboard as we bounced over the narrow road gravel pinged against the underside of the car i cradled the phone receiver between shoulder and chin and slipped into a seat belt im on my way to the morgue now i said i sent john ahead when i couldnt get you bert said how long ago i called him after you didnt answer your beeper call him back tell him not to go there must have been something in my voice because he said whats wrong anita we cant get any answer at the morgue bert so the vampire may have already risen and killed everybody and johns walking right into it ill call him bert said the connection broke and i shoved the receiver down as we spilled out onto new highway we can kill the vampire when we get there i said thats murder dolph said i shook my head not if calvin rupert had a dying will did he yeah zerbrowski slammed his fist into the back of the seat then well pop the son of a bitch yeah i said dolph just nodded zerbrowski was grinning he had a shotgun in his hands does that thing have silver shot in it i asked zerbrowski glanced at the gun no please tell me im not the only one in this car with silver bullets zerbrowski grinned dolph said silvers more expensive than gold city doesnt have that kind of money i knew that but i was hoping i was wrong what do you do when youre up against vampires and lycanthropes zerbrowski leaned over the back seat same thing we do when were up against a gang with uzi pistols which is i said be outgunned he said he didnt look happy about it i wasnt too happy about it either i was hoping that the morgue attendants had just run gotten out but i wasnt counting on it my vampire kit included a sawedoff shotgun with silver shot stakes mallet and enough crosses and holy water to drown a vampire unfortunately my vampire kit was sitting in my bedroom closet i used to carry it in the trunk minus the sawedoff shotgun which has always been illegal if i was caught carrying the vampire kit without a court order of execution on me it was an automatic jail term the new law had kicked in only weeks before it was to keep certain overzealous executioners from killing someone and saying gee sorry i by the way am not one of the overzealous honest dolph had cut the sirens about a mile from the hospital we cruised into the parking lot dark and quiet the marked car behind us had followed our lead there was already one marked car waiting for us the two officers were crouched beside the car guns in hand we all spilled out of the dark cars guns out i felt like id been shanghaied into a clint eastwood movie i couldnt see john burkes car which meant john checked his beeper more than i did if the vampire was safely behind metal walls i promised to answer all beeper messages immediately please just dont let me have cost lives amen one of the uniforms who had been waiting for us duckwalked to dolph and said nothings moved since we got here sergeant dolph nodded good special forces will be here when they can get to it were on the list what do you mean were on the list i asked dolph looked at me special forces has the silver bullets and theyll get here as soon as they can were going to wait for them i said no sergeant we are supposed to wait for special forces when going into a preternatural situation the uniform said not if youre the regional preternatural investigation team he said you should have silver bullets i said ive got a requisition in dolph said a requisition thats real helpful youre a civvie you get to wait outside so dont bitch he said im also the legal vampire executioner for the state of missouri if id answered my beeper instead of ignoring it to irritate bert the vampire would be staked already and we wouldnt be doing this you cant leave me out of it its more my job than it is yours dolph stared at me for a minute or two then nodded very slowly you should have kept your mouth shut zerbrowski said and youd get to wait in the car i dont want to wait in the car he just looked at me i do dolph started walking towards the doors zerbrowski followed i brought up the rear i was the polices preternatural expert if things went badly tonight id earn my retainer all vampire victims were brought to the basement of the old st louis city hospital even those who die in a different county there just arent that many morgues equipped to handle freshly risen vampires theyve got a special vault room with a steel reinforced everything and crosses laid on the outside of the door theres even a feeding tank to take the edge off that first blood lust rats rabbits guinea pigs just a snack to calm the newly risen under normal circumstances the mans body would have been in the vampire room and there would have been no problem but i had promised them that he was safe i was their expert the one they called to stake the dead if i said a body was safe they believed me and id been wrong god help me id been wrong st louis city hospital sat like a stubby brick giant in the middle of a combat zone walk a few blocks south and you could see tony awardwinning musicals straight from broadway but here we could have been on the dark side of the moon if the moon had slums broken windows decorated the ground like shattered teeth the hospital like a lot of innercity hospitals had lost money so they had closed it down but the morgue stayed open because they couldnt afford to move the vampire room the room had been designed in the early s when people still thought they could find a cure for vampirism lock a vampire in the vault watch it rise and try to cure it a lot of vamps cooperated because they wanted to be cured dr henry mulligan had pioneered the search for a cure the program was discontinued when one of the patients ate dr mulligans face so much for helping the poor misunderstood vampire but the vault room was still used for most vampire victims mostly as a precaution because these days when a vamp rose there was a vampire counsellor waiting to guide the newly risen to civilized vampirehood i had forgotten about the vampire counsellor it was a pioneer program thatd only been in effect a little over a month would an older vampire be able to control an animalistic vampire or would it take a master vampire to control it i didnt know i just didnt know dolph had his gun out and ready without silverplated bullets it was better than spitting at the monster but barely zerbrowski held the shotgun like he knew how to use it there were four uniformed officers at my back all with guns all ready to blast undead ass so why wasnt i comforted because nobody else had any freaking silver bullets except me the double glass doors swooshed open automatically seven guns were trained on the door as it moved my fingers were all cramped up trying not to shoot the damn door one of the uniforms swallowed a laugh nervous who us all right dolph said there are civilians in here dont shoot any of them one of the uniforms was blond his partner was black and much older the other two uniforms were in their twenties one skinny and tall with a prominent adams apple the other short with pale skin and eyes nearly glassy with fear each policeman had a crossshaped tie tack they were the latest style and standard issue for the st louis police the crosses would help maybe even keep them alive i hadnt had time to get my crucifixs chain replaced i was wearing a charm bracelet that dangled with tiny crosses i was also wearing an anklet chain not just because it matched the bracelet but if anything unusual happened tonight i wanted to have a backup its sort of a tossup which id least like to live without cross or gun better to have both you got any suggestions about how we should do this anita dolph asked it wasnt too long ago that the police wouldnt have been called in at all the good ol days when vampires were left to a handful of dedicated experts back when you could just stake a vamp and be done with it i had been one of the few the proud the brave the executioner we could form a circle guns pointing out it would up our chances of not getting snuck up on the blond cop said wont we hear it coming the undead make no noise i said his eyes widened im kidding officer i said hey he said softly he sounded offended i guess i didnt blame him sorry i said dolph frowned at me i said i was sorry dont tease the rookies zerbrowski said i bet this is his first vampire the black cop made a sound between a laugh and a snort his first day period jesus i said can he wait out in the car i can handle myself the blond said its not that i said but isnt there some kind of union rule against vampires on the first day i can take it he said i shook my head his first fucking day he should have been out directing traffic somewhere not playing tag with the walking dead ill take point dolph said anita to my right he pointed two fingers at the black cop and the blond you two on my left he pointed at the last two uniforms behind ms blake zerbrowski take the back gee thanks sarge he muttered i almost let it go but i couldnt im the only one with silver ammo i should have point i said youre a civvie anita dolph said i havent been a civvie for years and you know it he looked at me for a long second then nodded take point but if you get killed my ass is grass i smiled ill try to remember that i stepped out in front a little ahead of the others they formed a rough circle behind me zerbrowski gave me a thumbsup sign it made me smile dolph gave the barest of nods it was time to go inside time to stalk the monster the walls were twotone green dark khaki on the bottom puke green on top institutional green as charming as a sore tooth huge steam pipes higher than my head covered the walls the pipes were painted green too they narrowed the hallway to a thin passageway electrical conduit pipes were a thinner silver shadow to the steam pipes hard to put electricity in a building never designed for it the walls were lumpy where theyd been painted over without being scraped first if you dug at the walls layer after layer of different color would come up like the strata in an archaeological dig each color had its own history its own memories of pain it was like being in the belly of a great ship except instead of the roar of engines you had the beat of nearly perfect silence there are some places where silence hangs in heavy folds st louis city hospital was one of those places if id been superstitious which i am not i would have said the hospital was the perfect place for ghosts there are different kinds of ghosts the regular kind are spirits of the dead left behind when they should have gone to heaven or hell theologians had been arguing over what the existence of ghosts meant for god and the church for centuries i dont think god is particularly bothered by it but the church is enough people had died in this place to make it thick with real ghosts but id never seen any personally until a ghost wraps its cold arms around me id just as soon not believe in it but there is another kind of ghost psychic impressions strong emotions soak into the walls and floors of a building its like an emotional tape recorder sometimes with video images sometimes just sound sometimes just a shiver down your spine when you walk over a certain spot the old hospital was thick with shivery places i personally had never seen or heard anything but walking down the hallway you knew somewhere near at hand there was something something waiting just out of sight just out of hearing just out of reach tonight it was probably a vampire the only sounds were the scrape of feet the brush of cloth us moving there was no other sound when its really quiet you start hearing things even if its just the buzz of your own blood pounding in your ears the first corner loomed before me i was point id volunteered to be point i had to go around the corner first whatever lay around the bend it was mine i hate it when i play hero i went down on one knee gun held in both hands pointing up it didnt do any good to stick my gun around the corner first i couldnt shoot what i couldnt see there are a variety of ways to go around blind corners none of them foolproof it mostly matters whether youre more afraid of getting shot or getting grabbed since this was a vampire i was more worried about being grabbed and having my throat ripped out i pressed my right shoulder against the wall took a deep breath and threw myself forward i didnt do a neat shoulder roll into the hallway i just sort of fell on my left side with the gun held twohanded out in front of me trust me this is the fastest way to be able to aim around a corner i wouldnt necessarily advise it if the monsters were shooting back i lay in the hallway heart pounding in my ears the good news was there was no vampire the bad news was that there was a body i came up to one knee still searching the shadowed hallway for hints of movement sometimes with a vampire you dont see anything you dont even hear it you feel it in your shoulders and back the fine hairs on the back of your neck your body responds to rhythms older than thought in fact thinking instead of doing can get you dead its clear i said i was still kneeling in the middle of the hallway gun out ready for bear you through rolling around on the floor dolph asked i glanced at him then back to the hallway there was nothing there it was all right really the body was wearing a pale blue uniform a gold and black patch on the sleeve said security the mans hair was white heavy jowls a thick nose his eyelashes like grey lace against his pale cheeks his throat was just so much raw meat the spine glistened wetly in the overhead lights blood splashed the green walls like a macabre christmas card there was a gun in the mans right hand i put my back to the lefthand wall and watched the corridor to either side until the corners cut my view let the police investigate the body my job tonight was to keep us alive dolph crouched beside the body he leaned forward doing a sort of pushup to bring his face close to the gun its been fired i dont smell any powder near the body i said i didnt look at dolph when i said it i was too busy watching the corridor for movement the guns been fired he said his voice sounded rough clogged i glanced down at him his shoulders were stiff his body rigid with some kind of pain you know him dont you i said dolph nodded jimmy dugan he was my partner for a few months when i was younger than you are he retired and couldnt make it on the pension so he got a job here dolph shook his head shit what could i say im sorry didnt cut it im sorry as hell was a little better but it still wasnt enough nothing i could think of to say was adequate nothing i could do would make it better so i stood there in the bloodspattered hall and did nothing said nothing zerbrowski knelt beside dolph he put a hand on his arm dolph looked up there was a flash of some strong emotion in his eyes anger pain sadness all the above none of the above i stared down at the dead man gun still clasped tight in his hand and thought of something useful to say do they give the guards here silver bullets dolph glanced up at me no guessing this time it was anger why the guards should have silver bullets one of you take it and well have two guns with silver bullets dolph just stared at the gun zerbrowski zerbrowski took the gun gently as if afraid of waking the man but this vampire victim wasnt going to rise his head lolled to one side muscles and tendons snapped it looked like somebody had scooped out the meat and skin around his spine with a big spoon zerbrowski checked the cylinder silver he rolled the cylinder into the revolver and stood up gun in his right hand the shotgun he held loosely in his left hand extra ammo i asked zerbrowski started to kneel back down but dolph shook his head he searched the dead man his hands were candycoated in blood when he was done he tried to wipe the drying blood onto a white handkerchief but the blood stained the lines in his hands gathered around his fingernails only soap and scrubbing would get it off he said softly sorry jimmy he still didnt cry i would have cried but then women have more chemicals in their tear ducts it makes us tear up easier than men honest no extra ammo guess jimmy thought fived be enough for some dumbass security job his voice was warm with anger anger was better than crying if you can manage it i kept checking the corridor but my eyes kept going to the dead man he was dead because i hadnt done my job if i hadnt told the ambulance drivers that the body was safe theyd have put him in the vault and jimmy dugan wouldnt have died i hate it when things are my fault go dolph said i took the lead there was another corner i did my little kneelandroll routine again i lay half on my side gun pointed twohanded down the hallway nothing moved in the long green hallway there was something lying in the floor i saw the lower part of the guard first legs in pale blue blood drenched pants a head with a long brown ponytail lay to one side of the body like a forgotten lump of meat i got to my feet gun still hovering looking for something to aim at nothing moved except the blood that was still dripping down the walls the blood dripped slowly like rain at the end of the day thickening congealing as it moved jesus i wasnt sure which uniform said it but i agreed the upper body had been ripped apart as if the vampire had plunged both hands into her chest and pulled her spine had shattered like tinkertoys gobbets of flesh blood and bone sprinkled the hallway like gruesome flower petals i could taste bile at the back of my throat i breathed through my mouth in deep even breaths mistake the air tasted like bloodthick warm faintly salty there was an underlying sourness where the upper intestine and stomach had been broken open fresh death smells like a cross between a slaughterhouse and an outhouse shit and blood is what death smells like zerbrowski was scanning the hallway borrowed gun in hand he had four bullets i had thirteen plus an extra clip in my sport bag where was the second guards gun wheres her gun i asked zerbrowskis eyes flicked to me then to the corpse then back to scanning the hallway i dont see it id never met a vampire that used a gun but there was always a first time dolph wheres the guards gun dolph knelt in the blood and tried to search the body he moved the bloody flesh and pieces of cloth around like youd stir it with a spoon once the sight would have made me lose my lunch but it didnt anymore was it a bad sign that i didnt throw up on the corpses anymore maybe spread out look for the gun dolph said the four uniforms spread out and searched the blond was pasty and swallowed convulsively but he was making it good for him it was the tall one with the prominent adams apple that broke first he slid on a piece of meat that set him down hard on his butt in a pool of congealed blood he scrambled to his knees and vomited against the wall i was breathing quick shallow breaths the blood and carnage hadnt been enough but the sound of someone else throwing up just might be i pressed my shoulders into the wall and moved towards the next corner i will not throw up i will not throw up oh god please dont let me throw up have you ever tried to aim a gun while throwing your guts up its damn near impossible youre helpless until youre finished after seeing the guards i didnt want to be helpless the blond cop was leaning against the wall his face was shiny with a sick sweat he looked at me and i could read it in his eyes dont i whispered please dont the rookie fell to his knees and that was it i lost everything id eaten that day at least i didnt throw up on the corpse id done that once and zerbrowski had never let me live it down on that particular case the complaint was that id tampered with evidence if id been the vampire i would have come then while half of us were vomiting our guts out but nothing slithered around the corner nothing came screaming out of the darkness lucky us if youre all done dolph said we need to find her gun and what did this i wiped my mouth on the sleeve of my coveralls i was sweating but there hadnt been time to take them off my black nikes stuck to the floor with little squeech sounds there was blood on the bottom of my shoes maybe the coverall wasnt such a bad idea what i wanted was a cool cloth what i got was to continue down the green hallway making little bloody footprints behind me i scanned the floor and there it was footprints going away from the body back down the hall towards the first guard dolph i see them he said the faint footprints walked through the carnage and down the corner away from us away sounded good but i knew better we were here to get up close and personal dammit dolph knelt by the largest piece of the body anita i walked over to him avoiding the bloody footprints never step on clues the police dont like it dolph pointed at a blackened piece of cloth i knelt carefully glad that i was still in my overalls i could kneel in all the blood i wanted without messing my clothes always prepared like a good boy scout the womans shirt was charred and blackened dolph touched the material with the tip of his pencil the cloth flaked in heavy layers cracking like stale bread dolph poked a hole through one of the layers it crumbled a burst of ash and a sharp acrid smell came up from the body what the hell happened to her dolph asked i swallowed still tasting vomit at the back of my throat this wasnt helping its not cloth what is it then flesh dolph just looked at me he held the pencil like it might break youre serious thirddegree burn i said what caused this can i borrow your pencil i asked he handed it to me without a word i dug at what was left of her chest the flesh was so badly fried that her shirt melted into it i pushed the layers aside digging downward with the pencil the body felt horribly light and crisp like the burned skin of a chicken when id plunged half the length of the pencil into the burn i touched something solid i used the pencil to pry it upward when it was almost at the surface i put fingers inside the hole and pulled a lump of twisted metal from the burned flesh what is it dolph asked its whats left of her cross no he said the lump of melted silver glinted through the black ash this was her cross dolph it melted into her chest caught her clothing on fire what i dont understand is why the vampire kept contact with the burning metal the vampire should be nearly as burned as she is but its not here explain that he said animalistic vampires are like pcp addicts they dont feel pain i think the vampire crushed her to his chest the cross touched him burst into flames and the vampire stayed against her tearing her apart while they burned against any normal vampire she would have been safe so crosses cant stop this one he said i stared at the lump of metal apparently not the four uniforms were looking at the dim hallway a little frantically they hadnt bargained on the crosses not working neither had i the bit about not feeling pain had been a small footnote to one article no one had theorized that that would mean crosses didnt protect you if i survived id have to work up a little article for the vampire quarterly crosses melting into flesh wowee dolph stood up keep together people the crosses dont work one uniform said we gotta go back and wait for special teams dolph just looked at him you can go back if you want to he glanced down at the dead guard its volunteer only the rest of you go back outside and wait for special teams the tall one nodded and touched his partners arm his partner swallowed hard his eyes flicking to dolph then to the guards crispycrittered body he let his partner drag him away down the hall back to safety and sanity wouldnt it have been nice if we all could have gone but we couldnt let something like this escape even if i hadnt had an order of execution we would have had to kill it rather than take the risk of letting it get outside what about you and the rookie dolph asked the black cop ive never run from the monsters hes free to go back with the others the blond shook his head gun in hand fingers mottled with tension im staying the black cop gave him a smile that meant more than words hed made a mans choice or would that be a mature persons choice whatever he was staying one more corner and the vault should be in sight i said dolph glanced at the last corner his eyes met mine and i shrugged i didnt know what was going to be around the corner this vampire was doing things that i would have said were impossible the rules had been changed and not in our favor i hesitated on the wall farthest from the corner i pushed my back into the wall and slid slowly into sight around the corner i was staring down a short straight hallway there was a gun lying in the middle of the floor the second guards gun maybe on the lefthand wall there should have been a big steel door with crosses hanging on it the steel had exploded outward in a twisted silver mess theyd put the body in the vault after all i hadnt gotten the guards killed they should have been safe nothing moved there was no light in the vault it was just a blasted darkness if there was a vampire waiting in the room i couldnt see it of course i wasnt all that close either close did not seem to be a good idea clear as far as i can see i said you dont sound sure dolph said im not i said peek around the corner at whats left of the vault he didnt peek but he looked he let out a soft whistle zerbrowski said jesus i nodded yeah is it in there dolph asked i think so youre our expert why dont you sound sure dolph asked if you would have asked me if a vampire could plow through five feet of silversteel with crosses hung all over the damn place id have said no way i stared into the black hole but there it is does this mean youre as confused as we are zerbrowski asked yep then were in deep shit he said unfortunately i agreed the vault loomed up before us pitch black with a crazy vampire waiting inside just my cup of tea riight ill take point now dolph said he had the second guards gun in his hands his own gun was tucked out of sight he had silver bullets now hed go first dolph was good about that hed never order one of his men to do something he wouldnt do himself wish bert was like that bert was more likely to promise your firstborn child then ask if it was all right with you dolph hesitated at the open mouth of the vault the darkness was thick enough to cut it was the absolute darkness of a cave the kind where you can touch your eyeballs with your fingers and not blink he motioned us forward with the gun but he went past the darkness farther down the hallway the bloody footprints entered the darkness and came back out bloody footprints going down the hall around the corner i was getting tired of corners zerbrowski and i moved up to stand on either side of dolph the tension slid along my neck shoulders i took a deep breath and let it out slowly better look my hands not even shaking dolph didnt roll around on the floor to clear the corner he just went around back to the wall twohanded aim ready for bear a voice said dont shoot im not dead i knew the voice its john burke hes with me dolph glanced back at me i remember him i shrugged better safe then sorry i trusted dolph not to shoot john by accident but there were two cops here id never met always err on the side of caution when it comes to firearms words to survive by john was tall slender dark complected his short hair was perfectly black with a broad white streak in front it was a startling combination hed always been handsome but now that hed shaved off his beard he looked less like a hollywood villain and more like a leading man tall dark and handsome and knew how to kill vampires what more could you ask for plenty but thats another story john came around the corner smiling he had a gun out and better yet he had his vampire kit in one hand i came ahead to make sure the vampire didnt get loose while you were en route thanks john i said he shrugged just protecting the public welfare it was my turn to shrug anything you say wheres the vampire dolph asked i was tracking it john said how i asked bloody bare footprints bare footprints sweet jesus the corpse didnt have shoes but john did i turned towards the vault too late too slow too damn bad the vampire came out of the darkness moving too fast to see it was just a blur that smashed into the rookie driving him into the wall he screamed gun pressed to the vampires chest the gun was loud in the hallway echoing in the pipes the bullets came out the back of the vampire like theyd hit mist magic i moved forward trying to aim without hitting the rookie he was screaming one continuous sound blood sprayed in a warm rain i shot at the things head but it moved incredibly fast tossing the man against the other wall tearing at him there was a lot of yelling and movement but it all seemed far away slowed down it would all be over in a matter of moments i was the only one close enough with silver bullets i stepped in body brushing the vampire and put the barrel to the back of its skull a normal vampire wouldnt have let me do it i pulled the trigger but the vampire whirled lifting the man off his feet throwing him into me the bullet went wide and we crashed to the floor the air was knocked out of me for a second with the weight of two adult males on my chest the rookie was on top of me screaming bleeding dying i wedged the gun against the back of the vamps skull and fired the back of the head exploded outward in a fine spray of blood bone and heavier wetter things the vampire kept digging at the mans throat it should have been dead but it wasnt the vampire reared back bloodclotted teeth straining it had paused like a man breathing between swallows i shoved the barrel in its mouth the teeth grated on the metal the face exploded from the upper lip to the top of the head the lower teeth mouthed the air but couldnt get a bite the headless body raised up on its hands as if trying to get up i touched the gun to its chest and pulled the trigger at this distance i might be able to take out its heart id never actually tried to take out a vampire using just a pistol i wondered if it would work i wondered what would happen to me if it didnt a shudder ran through the things body it breathed outward in a long wordless sigh dolph and zerbrowski were there dragging the thing backwards i think it was dead already but just in case the help was appreciated john splashed the vampire with holy water the liquid bubbled and fizzed on the dying vampire it was dying it really was the rookie wasnt moving his partner dragged him off me cradling him against his chest like a child blood plastered the blond hair to his face the pale eyes were wide open staring at nothing the dead are always blind one way or another hed been brave a good kid though he wasnt that much younger than me but i felt about a million years old staring into his pale dead face he was dead just like that being brave doesnt save you from the monsters it just ups your chances dolph and zerbrowski had taken the vampire to the floor john was actually straddling the body with a stake and mallet in hand i hadnt used a stake in years shotgun was my choice but then i was a progressive vampire slayer the vampire was dead it didnt need to be staked but i just sat against the wall and watched better safe than sorry the stake went in easier than normal because id made a hole for it my gun was still in my hand no need to put it up yet the vault was still an empty blackness where there was one vampire there were often more id keep the gun out dolph and zerbrowski went to the ruined vault guns out i should have gotten up and gone with them but it seemed very important right now just to breathe i could feel the blood pumping through my veins every pulse in my body was loud it was good to be alive too bad i hadnt been able to save the kid yeah too bad john knelt beside me you all right i nodded sure he looked at me like he didnt believe it but he let it go smart man the light flashed on in the vault rich yellow light warm as a summers day jesus zerbrowski said i stood up and nearly fell my legs were shaky john caught my arm and i stared at him until he let go he gave a halfsmile still a hard case always i said there had been two dates between us mistake it made working together more awkward and he couldnt cope with me being a female version of him he had this old southern idea of what a lady should be a lady should not carry a gun and spend most of her time covered in blood and corpses i had two words for that attitude yeah those are the words there was a large fish tank smashed against one wall it had held guinea pigs or rats or rabbits all it held now were bright splashes of blood and bits of fur vampires dont eat meat but if you put small animals in a glass container then throw it against the wall you get diced small animals there wasnt enough left to scoop up with a spoon there was a head near the glass mess probably male judging from the short hair and style i didnt go any closer to check i didnt want to see the face id been brave tonight i had nothing left to prove the body was in one piece barely it looked like the vampire had shoved both hands into the chest grabbed a handful of ribs and pulled the chest was nearly torn in two but a band of pink muscle tissue and intestine held it together the heads got fangs zerbrowski said its the vampire counsellor i said what happened i shrugged at a guess the counsellor was leaning over the vamp when it rose it killed him quick and messy whyd it kill the vampire counsellor dolph asked i shrugged it was more animal than human dolph it woke up in a strange place with a strange vampire leaning over it it reacted like any trapped animal and protected itself why couldnt the counsellor control it thats what he was here for the only person who can control an animalistic vampire is the master who made it the counsellor wasnt powerful enough to control it now what john asked hed put up his gun i still hadnt i felt better with it out for some reason now i go make my third animation appointment of the evening just like that i looked up at him ready to be angry at somebody what do you want me to do john fall into a screaming fit that wouldnt bring back the dead and it would annoy the hell out of me he sighed if you only matched your packaging i put my gun back in the shoulder holster smiled at him and said fuck you yeah those are the words i had washed most of the blood off my face and hands in the bathroom at the morgue the bloodstained coveralls were in my trunk i was clean and presentable or as presentable as i was going to get tonight bert had said to meet the new guy at my third appointment for the night oakglen cemetery ten oclock the theory was that the new man already raised two zombies and would just watch me raise the third one fine with me it was before i pulled into oakglen cemetery late dammit itd make a great impression on the new animator not to mention my client mrs doughal was a recent widow like five days recent her dearly departed husband had left no will hed always meant to get around to it but you know how it is just kept putting it off i was to raise mr doughal in front of two lawyers two witnesses the doughals three grown children and a partridge in a pear tree theyd made a ruling just last month that the newly dead a week or less could be raised and verbally order a will it would save the doughals half their inheritance minus lawyer fees of course there was a line of cars pulled over to the side of the narrow gravel road the tires were playing hell with the grass but if you didnt park off to one side nobody could use the road of course how many people needed to use a cemetery road at at night animators voodoo priests potsmoking teenagers necrophiliacs satanists you had to be a member of a legitimate religion and have a permit to worship in a cemetery after dark or be an animator we didnt need a permit mainly because we didnt have a reputation for human sacrifice a few bad apples have really given voodooists a bad name being christian i sort of frown on satanism i mean they are after all the bad guys right as soon as my foot hit the road i felt it magic someone was trying to raise the dead and they were very near at hand the new guy had already raised two zombies could he do a third charles and jamison could only do two a night where had bert found someone this powerful on such short notice i walked past five cars not counting my own there were nearly a dozen people pressed around the grave the women were in skirtsuits the men all wore ties it was amazing how many people dressed up to come to the graveyard the only reason most people come to the graveyard is for a funeral a lot of clients dress for one semiformal basic black it was a mans voice leading the mourners in rising calls of andrew doughal arise come to us andrew doughal come to us the magic built on the air until it pressed against me like a weight it was hard to get a full breath his magic rode the air and it was strong but uncertain i could feel his hesitation like a touch of cold air he would be powerful but he was young his magic tasted untried undisciplined if he wasnt under twentyone id eat my hat thats how bert had found him he was a baby a powerful baby and he was raising his third zombie of the night hot damn i stayed in the shadows under the tall trees he was short maybe an inch or two taller than me which made him fivefour at best he wore a white dress shirt and dark slacks blood had dried on the shirt in nearly black stains id have to teach him how to dress as manny had taught me animating is still on an informal apprenticeship there are no college courses to teach you how to raise the dead he was very earnest as he stood there calling andrew doughal from the grave the crowd of lawyers and relatives huddled at the foot of the grave there was no family member inside the blood circle with the new animator normally you put a family member behind the tombstone so he or she could control the zombie this way only the animator could control it but it wasnt an oversight it was the law the dead could be raised to request and dictate a will but only if the animator or some neutral party had control of it the mound of flowers shuddered and a pale hand shot upward grabbing at the air two hands the top of a head the zombie spilled from the grave like it was being pulled by strings the new animator stumbled he fell to his knees in the soft dirt and dying flowers the magic stuttered wavering hed bitten off one zombie more than he could finish the dead man was still struggling from the grave still trying to get its legs free but there was no one controlling it lawrence kirkland had raised the zombie but he couldnt control it the zombie would be on its own with no one to make it mind uncontrolled zombies give animators a bad name one of the lawyers was saying are you all right lawrence kirkland nodded his head but he was too exhausted to speak did he even now realize what hed done i didnt think so he wasnt scared enough i walked up to the huddled group ms blake we missed you the lawyer said your associate seems to be ill i gave them my best professional smile see nothing wrong a zombie isnt about to go amuck trust me i walked to the edge of the blood circle i could feel it like a wind pushing me back the circle was shut and i was on the outside i couldnt get in unless lawrence asked me in he was on all fours hands lost in the flowers of the grave his head hung down as if he was too tired to raise it he probably was lawrence i said softly lawrence kirkland he turned his head in slow motion even in the dark i could see the exhaustion in his pale eyes his arms were trembling god help us i leaned in close so the audience couldnt hear what i said wed try to keep the illusion that this was just business as usual as long as i could if we were lucky the zombie would just wander away if we werent lucky it would hurt someone the dead are usually pretty forgiving of the living but not always if andrew doughal hated one of his relatives it would be a long night lawrence you have to break the circle and let me in i said he just stared at me eyes dull no glimmer of understanding shit break the circle lawrence now the zombie was free to its knees its white dress shirt gleamed against the darkness of the burial suit uncomfortable for all eternity doughal looked pretty good for the walking dead he was pale with thick grey hair the skin was wavy pale but there were no signs of rot the kid had done a good job for the third zombie of the night now if only i could control it we were home free lawrence break the circle please he said something too low for me to hear i leaned as close as the blood would let me get and said what larry names larry i smiled it was too ridiculous he was worried about me calling him lawrence instead of larry with a rogue zombie climbing out of the dirt maybe hed snapped under the pressure naw open the circle larry i said he crawled forward nearly falling face first into the flowers he scraped his hand across the line of blood the magic snapped the circle of power was gone just like that now it was just me wheres your knife he tried to look back over his shoulder but couldnt manage it i saw the blade gleam in the moonlight on the other side of the grave just rest i said ill take care of it he collapsed into a little ball hugging his arms around himself as if he was cold i let him go for now the first order of business had to be the zombie the knife was lying beside the gutted chicken hed used to call the zombie i grabbed the knife and faced the zombie over the grave andrew doughal was leaning against his own tombstone trying to orient himself its hard on a person being dead it takes a few minutes to wake up the dead brain cells the mind doesnt quite believe that it should work but it will eventually i pushed back the sleeve of my leather jacket and took a deep breath it was the only way but i didnt have to like it i drew the blade across my wrist a thin dark line appeared the skin split and blood trickled out nearly black in the moonlight the pain was sharp stinging small wounds always felt worse than big ones at first the wound was small and wouldnt leave a scar short of slitting my wrist or someone elses i couldnt remake the blood circle it was too late in the ceremony to get another chicken and start over i had to salvage this ceremony or the zombie would be free with no boss zombies without bosses tended to eat people the zombie was still sitting on its tombstone it stared at nothing with empty eyes if larry had been strong enough andrew doughal might have been able to talk to reason on his own now he was just a corpse waiting for orders or a stray thought i climbed onto the mound of gladioluses chrysanthemums carnations the perfume of flowers mixed with the stale smell of the corpse i stood kneedeep in dying flowers and waved my bleeding wrist in front of the zombies face the pale eyes followed my hand flat and dead as dayold fish andrew doughal was not home but something was something that smelled blood and knew its worth i know that zombies dont have souls in fact i can only raise the dead after three days it takes that long for the soul to leave incidentally the same amount of time it takes for vampires to rise fancy that but if it isnt the soul reanimating the corpse then what is it magic my magic or larrys maybe but there was something in the corpse if the soul was gone something filled the void in an animation that worked magic filled it now now i didnt know i wasnt even sure i wanted to know what did it matter as long as i pulled the fat out of the fire yeah maybe if i kept repeating that id even believe it i offered the corpse my bleeding wrist the thing hesitated for a second if it refused i was out of options the zombie stared at me i dropped the knife and squeezed the skin around the wound blood welled out thick and viscous the zombie snatched at my hand its pale hands were cold and strong its head bowed over the wound mouth sucking it fed at my wrist jaws working convulsively swallowing as hard and as fast as it could i was going to have the worlds worst hickey but at least it hurt i tried to draw my hand away but the zombie just sucked harder it didnt want to let go great larry can you stand i asked softly we were still trying to pretend that nothing had gone wrong the zombie had accepted blood i controlled it now if i could get it to let go larry looked up at me in slow motion sure he said he got to his feet using the burial mound for support when he was standing he asked what now good question help me get it loose i tried to pull my wrist free but the thing hung on for dear life larry wrapped his arms around the corpse and pulled it didnt help try the head i said he tried pulling back on the corpses hair but zombies dont feel pain larry pried a finger along the corpses mouth breaking the suction with a little pop larry looked like he was going to be sick poor him it was my arm he wiped his finger on his dress slacks as if he had touched something slimy i wasnt sympathetic the knife wound was already red it would be a hell of a bruise tomorrow the zombie stood on top of its grave staring at me there was life in the eyes someone was home the trick was was it the right someone are you andrew doughal i asked he licked his lips and said i am it was a rough voice a voice for ordering people about i wasnt impressed it was my blood that gave him the voice the dead really are mute really do forget who and what they are until they taste fresh blood homer was right makes you wonder what else was true in the iliad i put pressure on the knife wound with my other hand and stepped back off the grave hell answer your questions now i said but keep them simple hes been mostly dead all day the lawyers didnt smile i guess i didnt blame them i waved them forward they hung back squeamish lawyers surely not mrs doughal poked her lawyer in the arm get on with it this is costing a fortune i started to say we dont charge by the minute but for all i knew bert had arranged for the longer the corpse was up the more expensive it was that actually was a good idea andrew doughal was fine tonight he answered questions in his cultured articulate voice if you ignored the way his skin glistened in the moonlight he looked alive but give it a few days or weeks hed rot they all rotted if bert had figured out a way to make clients put the dead back in their graves before pieces started to fall off so much the better there were few things as sad as the family bringing dear old mom back to the cemetery with expensive perfume covering up the smell of decay the worst was the client who had bathed her husband before bringing him back she had to bring most of his flesh in a plastic garbage sack the meat had just slid off the bone in the warm water larry moved back stumbling over a flowerpot i caught him and he fell against me still unsteady he smiled thanks for everything he stared at me our faces inches apart a trickle of sweat oozed down his face in the cold october night you got a coat in my car get it and put it on youll catch your death sweating in this cold his smile flashed into a grin anything you say boss his eyes were bigger than they should have been a lot of white showing you pulled me back from the edge i wont forget gratitude is great kid but go get your coat you cant work if youre home sick with the flu larry nodded and started slowly towards the cars he was still unsteady but he was moving the flow of blood had almost stopped on my wrist i wondered if i had a bandaid in my car big enough to cover it i shrugged and started to follow larry towards the cars the lawyers deep courtroom voices filled the october dark words echoing against the trees who the hell were they trying to impress the corpse didnt care larry and i sat on the cool autumn grass watching the lawyers draw up the will theyre so serious he said its their job to be serious i said being a lawyer means you cant have a sense of humor absolutely i said he grinned his short curly hair was a red so bright it was nearly orange his eyes were blue and soft as a spring sky id seen both hair and eyes in the dome light from our cars back in the dark he looked greyeyed and brownhaired id hate to have to give a witness description of someone i only saw in the dark larry kirkland had that milkpale complexion of some redheads a thick sprinkling of golden freckles completed the look he looked like an overgrown howdy doody puppet i mean that in a cute way being short really short for a man i was sure he wouldnt like being called cute it was one of my least favorite endearments i think if all short people could vote the word cute would be stricken from the english language i know it would get my vote how long have you been an animator i asked he glanced at the luminous dial of his watch about eight hours i stared at him this is your first job anywhere he nodded didnt mr vaughn tell you about me bert just said hed hired another animator named lawrence kirkland im in my senior year at washington university and this is my semester of job coop how old are you twenty why youre not even legal i said so i cant drink or go in porno theaters no big loss unless the job takes us to places like that he looked at me and leaned in does the job take us to porno theaters his face was neutrally pleasant and i couldnt tell if he was teasing or not i gambled that he was kidding twenty is fine i shook my head you dont look like twentys fine he said its not your age that bothers me i said but something bothers you i wasnt sure how to put it into words but there was something pleasant and humorous in his face it was a face that laughed more often than it cried he looked bright and clean as a new penny and i didnt want that to change i didnt want to be the one who forced him to get down in the dirt and roll have you ever lost someone close to you family i mean the humor slipped away from his face he looked like a solemn little boy youre serious deadly i said he shook his head i dont understand just answer the question have you ever lost someone close to you he shook his head ive even got all my grandparents have you ever seen violence up close and personal i got into fights in high school why he grinned they thought short meant weak i had to smile and you showed them different hell no they beat the crap out of me for four years he smiled you ever win a fight sometimes he said but the winnings not the important part i said he looked very steadily at me eyes serious no its not there was a moment of nearly perfect understanding between us a shared history of being the smallest kid in class years of being the last picked for sports being the automatic victim for bullies being short can make you mean i was sure that we understood each other but being female i had to verbalize it men do a lot of this mindreading shit but sometimes youre wrong i needed to know the important part is taking the beating and not giving up i said he nodded takes a beating and keeps on ticking now that id spoiled our first moment of perfect understanding by making us both verbalize i was happy other than school fights youve never seen violence i go to rock concerts i shook my head not the same you got a point to make he asked you should never have tried to raise a third zombie i did it didnt i he sounded defensive but i pressed on when i have a point to make i may not be graceful but im relentless you raised and lost control of it if i hadnt come along the zombie would have broken free and hurt someone its just a zombie they dont attack people i stared at him trying to see if he was kidding he wasnt shit you really dont know do you know what i covered my face with my hands and counted to ten slowly it wasnt larry i was mad at it was bert but larry was so convenient for yelling id have to wait until tomorrow to yell at bert but larry was right here how lucky the zombie had broken free of your control larry if i hadnt come along and fed it blood it would have found blood on its own do you understand i dont think so i sighed the zombie would have attacked someone taken a bite out of someone zombies attacking humans is just superstition ghost stories is that what theyre teaching in college now i asked yes ill loan you some back copies of the animator trust me larry zombies do attack people ive seen people killed by them youre just trying to scare me he said scared would be better than stupid i raised it what do you want from me he looked completely baffled i want you to understand what nearly happened here tonight i want you to understand that what we do isnt a game its not parlor tricks its real and it can be dangerous all right he said hed given in too easily he didnt really believe he was humoring me but there are some things you cant tell someone he or she has to learn some things in person i wished i could wrap larry up in cellophane and keep him on a shelf all safe and secure and untouched but life didnt work that way if he stayed in this business long enough the new would wear off but you cant tell someone whos reached twenty and never been touched by death they dont believe in the boogeyman at twenty id believed in everything i suddenly felt old larry pulled a pack of cigarettes out of his coat pocket please tell me you dont smoke i said he looked up at me eyes sort of wide and startled you dont smoke no you dont like people to smoke around you he made it a question no i said look i feel pretty awful right now i need the cigarette okay need it yeah need it he had one slender white cigarette between two fingers of his right hand the pack had disappeared back into his pocket a disposable lighter had appeared he looked at me very steadily his hands were shaking just a bit shit hed raised three zombies on his first night out and i was going to be talking to bert about the wisdom of sending larry out on his own besides we were outside go ahead thanks he lit the cigarette and drew a deep breath of nicotine and tar smoke curled out of his mouth and nose like pale ghosts feel better already he said i shrugged just so you dont smoke in the car with me no problem he said the tip of his cigarette pulsed orange in the dark as he sucked on it he looked past me letting smoke curl from his lips as he said were being paged i turned and sure enough the lawyers were waving at us i felt like a janitor being called in to clean up the messy necessities i stood up and larry followed me you sure you feel well enough for this i asked i couldnt raise a dead ant but i think im up to watching you do it there were bruises under his eyes and the skin was too tight around his mouth but if he wanted to play macho man who was i to stop him great lets do it i got salt out of my trunk it was perfectly legal to carry zombieraising supplies i suppose the machete that i used for beheading chickens could be used as a weapon but the rest of the stuff was considered harmless shows you what the legal system knows about zombies andrew doughal had recovered himself he still looked a little waxy but his face was serious concerned alive he smoothed a hand down the stylish lapel of his suit coat he looked down at me not just because he was taller but because he was good at looking down some people have a real talent for being condescending do you know whats happening mr doughal i asked the zombie he looked down his narrow patrician nose i am going home with my wife i sighed i hated it when zombies didnt realize they were dead they acted so human mr doughal do you know why youre in a cemetery whats happening one of the lawyers asked hes forgotten that hes dead i said softly the zombie stared at me perfectly arrogant he must have been a real pain in the ass when he was alive but even assholes are piteous once in a while i dont know what you are babbling about the zombie said you obviously are suffering from some delusion can you explain why you are here in a cemetery i asked i dont have to explain anything to you do you remember how you got to the cemetery we we drove of course the first hint of unease wavered through his voice youre guessing mr doughal you dont really remember driving to the cemetery do you i i he looked at his wife his grown children but they were walking to their cars no one even looked back he was dead no getting around that but most families didnt just walk away they might be horrified or saddened or even sickened but they were never neutral the doughals had gotten the will signed and they were leaving they had their inheritance let good ol dad crawl back into his grave he called emily she hesitated stiffening but one of her sons grabbed her arm and hurried her toward the cars was he embarrassed or scared i want to go home he yelled after them the arrogance had leaked away and all that was left was that sickening fear the desperate need not to believe he felt so alive how could he possibly be dead his wife halfturned andrew im sorry her grown children hustled her into the nearest car you would have thought they were the getaway drivers for a bank robbery they peeled out so fast the lawyers and secretaries left as fast as was decent everybody had what theyd come for they were done with the corpse the trouble was that the corpse was staring after them like a child who was left in the dark why couldnt he have stayed an arrogant sob why are they leaving me he asked you died mr doughal nearly a week ago no its not true larry moved up beside me you really are dead mr doughal i raised you from the dead myself he stared from one to the other of us he was beginning to run out of excuses i dont feel dead trust us mr doughal you are dead i said will it hurt a lot of zombies asked that will it hurt to go back into the grave no mr doughal it doesnt hurt i promise he took a deep shaking breath and nodded im dead really dead yes then put me back please he had rallied and found his dignity it was nightmarish when the zombie refused to believe you could still lay them to rest but the clients had to hold them down on the grave while they screamed id only had that happen twice but i remembered each time as if it had happened last night some things dont dim with time i threw salt against his chest it sounded like sleet hitting a roof with salt i bind you to your grave i had the stillbloody knife in my hand i wiped the gelling blood across his lips he didnt jerk away he believed with blood and steel i bind you to your grave andrew doughal be at peace and walk no more the zombie laid full length on the mound of flowers the flowers seemed to flow over him like quicksand and just like that he was swallowed back into the grave we stood there a minute in the empty graveyard the only sounds were the wind sighing high up in the trees and the melancholy song of the years last crickets in charlottes web the crickets sang summer is over and gone over and gone over and gone summer is dying dying the first hard frost and the crickets would be dying they were like chicken little who told everyone the sky was falling except in this case the crickets were right the crickets stopped suddenly like someone had turned a switch i held my breath straining to hear there was nothing but the wind and yet my shoulders were so tight they hurt larry he turned innocent eyes to me what there three trees to our left a mans figure was silhouetted against the moonlight i caught movement out of the corner of my eye on the right side more than one the darkness felt alive with eyes more than two i used larrys body to shield me from the eyes drawing my gun holding it along my leg so it wouldnt be obvious larrys eyes widened jesus whats wrong his voice was a hoarse whisper he didnt give us away good for him i started herding him towards the cars slowly just your friendly neighborhood animators finished with their nights work and going home to a welldeserved rest there are people out here after us after me more likely i said why i shook my head no time for explanations when i say run run like hell for the cars how do you know they mean to hurt us his eyes were flashing a lot of white he saw them now too shadows moving closer people out in the dark how do you know they dont mean to hurt us i asked good point he said his breathing was fast and shallow we were maybe twenty feet from the cars run i said what his voice sounded startled i grabbed his arm and dragged him into a run for the cars i pointed the gun at the ground still hoping whoever it was wouldnt be prepared for a gun larry was running on his own puffing a little from fear smoking and maybe he didnt run four miles every other day a man stepped in front of the cars he brought up a large revolver the browning was already moving it fired before my aim was steady the muzzle flashed brilliant in the dark the man jumped not used to being shot at his shot whined into the darkness to our left he froze for the seconds it took me to aim and fire again then he crumpled to the ground and didnt get up again shit larry breathed it like a sigh a voice yelled shes got a gun wheres martin she shot him i guess martin was the one with the gun he still wasnt moving i didnt know if i killed him or not i wasnt sure i cared as long as he didnt get up and shoot at us again my car was closer i shoved car keys into larrys hands open the door open the passenger side door then start the car do you understand me he nodded freckles standing out in the pale circle of his face i had to trust that he wouldnt panic and take off without me he wouldnt do it out of malice just fear figures were converging from all directions there had to be a dozen or more the sound of running feet whispering on grass came over the wind larry stepped over the body i kicked a away from the limp hand the gun slid out of sight under the car if i hadnt been pressed for time id have checked his pulse i always like to know if ive killed someone makes the police report go so much smoother larry had the car door open and was leaning over to unlock the passenger side door i aimed at one of the running figures and pulled the trigger the figure stumbled fell and started screaming the others hesitated they werent used to being shot at poor babies i slid into the car and yelled drive drive drive larry peeled out in a spray of gravel the car fishtailed headlights swaying crazily dont wrap us around a tree larry his eyes flicked to me sorry the car slowed from stomachturning speed to grabthedoorhandleandholdon speed we were staying between the trees that was something the headlights bounced off trees tombstones flashed white the car skidded around a curve gravel spitting a man stood framed in the middle of the road jeremy ruebens of humans first stood pale and shining in the lights he stood in the middle of a flat stretch of road if we could make the turn beyond him wed be out on the highway and safe the car was slowing down what are you doing i asked i cant just hit him larry said the hell you cant i cant his voice wasnt outraged it was scared hes just playing chicken with us larry hell move are you sure a little boys voice asking if there really was a monster in the closet im sure now floor it and get us out of here he pressed down on the accelerator the car jumped forward rushing toward the small straight figure of jeremy ruebens hes not moving larry said hell move i said are you sure trust me his eyes flicked to me then back to the road you better be right he whispered i believed ruebens would move honest but even if he wasnt bluffing the only way out was either past him or through him it was ruebenss choice the headlights bathed him in glaring white light his small dark features glared at us he wasnt moving he isnt moving larry said hell move i said shit larry said i couldnt have agreed more the headlights roared up onto jeremy ruebens and he threw himself to one side there was the sound of brushing cloth as his coat slid along the cars side close damn close larry picked up speed and swung us around the last corner and into the last straight stretch we spilled out onto the highway in a shower of gravel and spinning tires but we were out of the cemetery wed made it thank you god larrys hands were white on the steering wheel you can ease down now i said were safe he swallowed hard enough for me to hear it then nodded the car started gradually approaching the speed limit his face was beaded with sweat that had nothing to do with the cool october evening you all right i dont know his voice sounded sort of hollow shock you did good back there i thought i was going to run over him i thought i was going to kill him with the car he thought so too or he wouldnt have moved i said he looked at me what if he hadnt moved he did move but what if he hadnt then we would have gone over him and wed still be on the highway safe you would have let me run him down wouldnt you survival is the name of the game larry if you cant deal with that find another business to be in animators dont get shot at those were members of humans first a rightwing fanatic group that hates anything to do with the supernatural so i was leaving out about the personal visit from jeremy ruebens what the kid didnt know might not hurt him i stared at his pale face he looked holloweyed hed met the dragon a little dragon as dragons go but once youve seen violence youre never the same again the first time you have to decide live or die us or them it changes you forever no going back i stared at larrys shocked face and wished it could have been different i wished i could have kept him shining new and hopeful but as my grandmother blake used to say if wishes were horses wed all ride larry had had his first taste of my world the only question was would he want a second dose or would he run run or go stay or fight ageold questions i wasnt sure which way i wanted larry to choose he might live longer if he got the hell away from me but then again maybe he wouldnt heads they win tails you lose what about my car larry asked i shrugged youve got insurance right yes but since they couldnt trash us they may decide to trash your car he looked at me as if he wasnt sure whether i was kidding i wasnt there was a bicycle in front of us suddenly out of the dark a childs pale face flashed in the headlights watch out larrys eyes flicked back to the road in time to see the kids wide startled eyes the brakes squealed and the child vanished from the narrow arch of lights there was a crunch and a bump before the car skidded to a stop larry was breathing heavy i wasnt breathing at all the cemetery was just on our right we were too close to stop but but shit it was a kid i stared out the back window the bicycle was a crumpled mess the child lay in a very still heap god please dont let him be dead i didnt think humans first had enough imagination to have a child in reserve as bait if it was a trap it was a good one because i couldnt leave the tiny figure crumpled by the road larry was gripping the steering wheel so hard his arms shook if i thought hed been pale before id been wrong he looked like a sick ghost is he hurt his voice squeezed out deep and rough with something like tears it wasnt hurt hed wanted to say he just couldnt bring himself to use the big d word not yet not if he could help it stay in the car i said larry didnt answer he just sat there staring at his hands he wouldnt look at me but dammit this wasnt my fault the fact that hed lost his cherry tonight was not my fault so why did it feel like it was i got out of the car browning ready in case the crazies decided to chase us onto the road they could have gotten the and be coming to shoot us the child hadnt moved i was just too far away to see the chest rise and fall yeah that was it i was maybe a yard away please be alive the child lay sprawled on its stomach one arm trapped underneath probably broken i scanned the dark cemetery as i knelt by the child no rightwing crazies came swarming out of the darkness the child was dressed in the proverbial little boys outfit of striped shirt shorts and tiny running shoes who had sent him out dressed for summer on this cold night his mother had some woman dressed him loved him sent him out to die his curly brown hair was silken babyfine the skin of his neck was cool to the touch shock it was too soon to be cold from death i waited for the big pulse in his neck but nothing happened dead please god please his head raised up and a soft sound came out of his mouth alive thank you god he tried to roll over but fell back against the road he cried out larry was out of the car coming towards us is he all right hes alive i said the boy was determined to roll over so i grabbed his shoulders and helped i tried to keep his right arm in against his body i had a glimpse of huge brown eyes round baby face and in his right hand was a knife bigger than he was he whispered tell him to come help move me tiny little fangs showed between baby lips the knife pressed against my stomach over the sport bag the point slid underneath the leather jacket to touch the shirt underneath i had one of those frozen moments when time stretches out in slowmo nightmare i had all the time in the world to decide whether to betray larry or die never give anyone to the monsters its a rule i opened my mouth and screamed run the vampire didnt stab me he just froze he wanted me alive thats why the knife and not fangs i stood up and the vampire just stared up at me he didnt have a backup plan great the car stood open doors spilling light out into the darkness the headlights made a wide theatrical swash larry was just standing there frozen undecided i yelled get in the car he moved towards the open car door a woman was standing in the glare of the headlights she was dressed in a long white coat open over the cream and tan of a very nice pants suit she opened her mouth and snarled into the light fangs glistening i was running screaming behind you larry stared at me his gaze went past me his eyes widened i could hear the patter of little feet behind me terror spread across larrys face was this the first vampire hed ever seen i drew my gun but was still running you cant hit shit when youre running i had a vampire in front and behind coin toss the female vampire bounded onto the hood of the car and propelled herself in a long graceful leap that carried her into larry and sent them tumbling across the road i couldnt shoot her without risking larry i whirled at the last second and put the gun pointblank into the childvampires face his eyes widened i squeezed the trigger something hit me from behind the shot went wild and i was on the road flat on my stomach with something bigger than a bread box on top of me the air was knocked out of me but i turned trying to point the gun back at the thing on my back if i didnt do something now i might never have to worry about breathing again the boy came up on me knife flashing downward the gun was turning but too slowly i would have screamed if id had air the knife buried into the sleeve of my jacket i felt the blade bite into the road underneath my arm was pinned i squeezed the trigger and the shot went harmlessly off into the dark i twisted my neck to try to see who or what was straddling me it was a what in the red glow of the rear car lights his face was all flat high cheekbones with narrow almost slanted eyes and long straight hair if hed been any more ethnic hed have been carved in stone surrounded by snakes and aztec gods he reached over me and encircled my right hand the one that was pinned the one that was still holding the gun he pressed the bones of my hand into the metal his voice was deep and soft drop the gun or ill crush your hand he squeezed until i gasped larry screamed high and mournful screaming was for when you didnt have anything better to do i scraped my left sleeve against the road baring my watch and the charm bracelet the three tiny crosses glinted in the moonlight the vampire hissed but didnt let go of my gun hand i dragged the bracelet across his hand a sharp smell of burning flesh then he used his free hand to drag at my left sleeve holding onto just the sleeve he held my left hand back so i couldnt touch him with the crosses if hed been the new dead just the sight of the crosses would have sent him screaming but he wasnt just old dead he was ancient it was going to take more than blessed crosses to get him off my back larry screamed again i screamed too because i couldnt do anything else except hold onto the gun and make him crush my hand not productive they didnt want me dead but hurt hurt was okay he could crush my hand into bloody pulp i gave up my gun screaming tugging at the knife that held my arm pinned trying to jerk my left sleeve free of his hand so i could plunge the crosses into his flesh a shot exploded above our heads we all froze and stared back at the cemetery jeremy ruebens and company had recovered their gun and were shooting at us did they think we were in cahoots with the monsters did they care who they shot a woman screamed alejandro help me the scream was from behind us the vampire on my back was suddenly gone i didnt know why and i didnt care i was left with the childmonster looming over me staring at me with large dark eyes doesnt it hurt he asked it was such an unexpected question that i answered it no he looked disappointed he squatted down beside me hands on his small thighs i meant to cut you so i could lick the blood his voice was still a little boys voice would always be a little boys voice but the knowledge in his eyes beat down on my skin like heat he was older than jeanclaude much older a bullet smashed into the rear light of my car just above the boys head he turned towards the fanatics with a very unchildlike snarl i tried to pull the knife out of the road but it was imbedded i couldnt budge it the boy crawled into the darkness vanishing with a backwash of wind he was going for the fanatics god help them i looked back over my shoulder larry was on the ground with a woman with long waving brown hair on top of him the man whod been on top of me alejandro and another woman were struggling with the vampire on larry she wanted to kill him and they were trying to stop her it seemed like a good plan to me another bullet whined towards us it didnt come close a halfstrangled scream and then no more gunshots had the boy gotten him was larry hurt and what the hell could i do to help him and me the vampires seemed to have their hands full whatever i was going to do now was the time i tried unzipping the leather jacket lefthanded but it stuck halfway down great i bit the side of the jacket using my teeth in place of the trapped hand unzipped now what i pulled the sleeve off my left hand with my teeth then put the sleeve under my hip and wiggled out of it slipping my right hand free of the pinned sleeve was the easy part alejandro picked up the brownhaired woman and threw her over the car she sailed into the darkness but i didnt hear her hit the ground maybe she could fly if she could i didnt want to know larry was nearly lost to sight behind a curtain of pale hair the second female was bending over him like a prince about to bestow the magic kiss alejandro got a handful of that long long hair and jerked her to her feet he flung her into the side of the car she staggered but didnt go down snapping at him like a dog on a leash i went wide around them holding the crosses out in front like every old movie youve ever seen except id never seen a vampire hunter with a charm bracelet larry was on his hands and knees swaying ever so slightly his voice was high nearly hysterical he just kept repeating im bleeding im bleeding i touched his arm and he jumped like id bit him his eyes flashed white blood was welling down his neck black in the moonlight shed bit him jesus help us shed bit him the pale female was still fighting to get to larry cant you smell the blood it was a plea control yourself or ill do it for you alejandros voice was a low scream the anger in his voice cut and sliced the pale woman went very still im all right now her voice held fear id never heard one vampire be scared to death of another let them fight it out i had better things to do like figuring out how to get us past the remaining vampires and into the car alejandro had the female shoved against the car with one hand my gun was in his left hand i unsnapped the anklet with its matching crosses you cant sneak up on a vampire even the new dead are jumpier than a longtailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs since i had no chance of sneaking up on him i tried the direct approach she bit him you son of a bitch she bit him i pulled the back of his shirt as if to get his attention i dropped the crosses down his back he screamed i brushed the bracelet crosses across his hand he dropped the gun i caught it a tongue of blue flame licked up his back he clawed and scrambled but he couldnt reach the crosses burn baby burn he whirled shrieking his open hand caught me on the side of the head i was airborne i slammed backfirst into the road i tried to take as much of the impact as i could with my arms but my head rocked back slamming into the road the world swam with black spots when my vision cleared i was staring up into a pale face long yellowwhite hair the color of corn silk traced over my cheek as the vampire knelt to feed i still had the browning in my right hand i pulled the trigger her body jerked backwards like someone had shoved her she fell back onto the road blood pouring out of a hole in her stomach that was nothing compared to the wound in her back i hoped id shattered her spine i staggered to my feet the male vampire alejandro tore off his shirt the crosses fell to the road in a little pool of molten blue fire his back was burned black with blisters here and there to add color he whirled on me and i shot him once in the chest the shot was rushed and he didnt go down larry grabbed the vampires ankle still alejandro kept coming dragging larry across the blacktop like a child he grabbed larrys arm jerking him to his feet larry threw a chain over the vampires head the heavy silver cross burst into flame alejandro screamed i yelled get in the car now larry slid into the drivers seat and kept sliding until he was in the passenger seat he slammed the passenger side door shut and locked it for what good it would do the vampire tore the chain and threw the cross end over end into the roadside trees the cross winked out of sight like a falling star i slid into the car slamming the door and locking it i clicked the safety on the browning and shoved it between my legs the vampire alejandro was huddled around his pain too hurt to give chase right that second goodie i shoved the car in gear and gunned it the car fishtailed i slowed to the speed of light and the car straightened out on the road we poured down the dark tunnel in a circle of flickering light and tree shadows and down at the end of our tunnel was a figure in white with long brown hair spilling in the wind it was the vampire that had jumped larry she was just standing there in the middle of the road just standing there we were about to find out if vampires played chicken i was about to take my own advice i put the gas pedal to the floorboards the car lurched forward the vampire just stood there while we barreled down at her at the last second i realized she wasnt going to move and i didnt have time to we were about to test my theory about cars and vampiric flesh wheres a silver car when you need one the headlights flashed on the vampire like a spotlight i had an image of pale face brown hair fangs stretched wide we hit her going sixty the car shuddered she rolled in painful slow motion up over the hood and yet it was happening too fast for me to do anything she hit the windshield with a sharp crackling sound metal screamed the windshield crumbled into a mass of spiderweb cracks i was suddenly trying to see through the wrong end of a smashed prism the safety glass had done its job it hadnt shattered and cut us to ribbons it had just cracked all to hell and i couldnt see to drive i stamped down on the brakes an arm shot through the glass raining glittering shards down on larry he screamed the hand closed on his shirt pulling him into the broken teeth of the windshield i turned the wheel to the left as hard as i could the car spun out and all i could do was let off the gas not touch the brake and ride larry had a death grip on the door arm and the headrest he was screaming fighting not to be pulled through the jagged glass i said a quick prayer and let go of the wheel the car spun helplessly i shoved a cross against the hand it smoked and bubbled the hand let go of larry and vanished through the hole in the crumbled glass i grabbed at the steering wheel but it was too little too late the car careened off the road into the ditch metal screamed as something under the car broke something large i was slammed into the drivers side door larry was suddenly on top of me then we were both tumbling to the other side then it was over the silence was startling it was as if id gone deaf there was a great roaring whiteness in my ears someone said thank god and it was me the passenger side door peeled open like the shell of a nut i scrambled back away from the opening larry was left stranded and staring he was jerked out of the car i slid into the front floorboard aiming where larry had vanished i was staring up at larrys body with a dark hand clamped so tight on his throat i didnt know if he could breathe i stared down the barrel of my gun at the dark face of the vampire alejandro his face was unreadable as he said i will tear his throat out ill blow your head off i said a hand came fishing through the broken windshield back off or you lose that pretty face he will die first the vampire said but the hand vanished back through the hole there was the sound of some other language in the vampires english emotion gave him an accent larrys eyes were too wide showing too much white he was breathing shallow and too fast hed hyperventilate if he lived that long decide the vampire said his voice was flat empty of everything larrys terrorfilled eyes were eloquent enough for both of them i hit the safety on the gun and handed it buttfirst to his outstretched hand it was a mistake i knew that but i also knew i couldnt sit here and watch larrys throat be ripped out there are some things that are more important than physical survival you gotta be able to look at yourself in the mirror i gave up my gun for the same reason id stopped for the child there was no choice i was one of the good guys good guys were selfsacrificing it was a rule somewhere larrys face was a bloody mask no single cut seemed to be serious but nothing bleeds like a shallow scalp wound safety glass was not designed to be vampireproof maybe i could write in and suggest it blood trickled over alejandros hand still gripping larrys throat the vampire had stuffed my gun in the back of his pants he handled the gun like he knew how to use one pity some vampires were technophobes it gave you an edge sometimes larrys blood flowed over the vampires hand sticky and warm like barely solid jello the vampire didnt react to the blood iron selfcontrol i stared into his nearly black eyes and felt the pull of centuries like monstrous wings unfolding in his eyes the world swam the inside of my head was sinking expanding i reached out to touch something anything to keep from falling a hand gripped mine the skin was cool and smooth i jerked back falling against the car dont touch me dont ever touch me the vampire stood uncertainly larrys throat gripped in one bloodstreaked hand holding his other hand out towards me it was a very human gesture larrys eyes were bugging out youre choking him i said sorry the vampire said he released him larry fell to his knees gasping his first breath was a hissing scream for air i wanted to ask larry how he was but i didnt my job was to get us out of here alive if possible besides i had an idea how larry felt hurt no need to ask stupid questions well maybe one stupid question what do you want i asked alejandro looked at me and i fought the urge to look at his face while i talked to him it was hard i ended up staring at the hole my bullet had made in the side of his chest it was a very small hole and had already stopped bleeding was he healing that fast shit i stared at the wound as hard as i could to fight the urge for eye contact its hard to be tough when youre staring at someones chest but id had years of practice before jeanclaude decided to share his gift with me practice makes well you know the vampire hadnt answered me so i asked again voice steady and low i didnt sound like someone who was afraid bully for me what do you want i felt the vampire look at me almost as if hed run a finger down my body i shivered and couldnt stop larry crawled to me head hanging dripping blood as he moved i knelt beside him and before i could stop myself the stupid question popped out are you all right his eyes raised to me through a mask of blood he finally said nothing a few stitches wouldnt cure he was trying to make a joke i wanted to hug him and promise the worst was over never make promises you cant keep the vampire didnt exactly move but something brought my attention back to him he stood kneedeep in autumn weeds my eyes were on a level with his belt buckle which made him about my height short for a man a white anglosaxon twentiethcentury man the belt buckle glinted gold and was carved into a blocky stylized human figure the carving like the vampires face was straight out of an aztec calendar the urge to look upward and meet his eyes crawled over my skin my chin had actually risen an inch or so before i realized what i was doing shit the vamp was messing with my mind and i couldnt feel it even now knowing he had to be doing something to me i couldnt sense it i was blind and deaf just like every other tourist well maybe not every tourist i hadnt been munched on yet which probably meant they wanted something more than just blood id be dead otherwise and so would larry of course i was still wearing blessed crosses what could this creature do once i was stripped of crosses i did not want to find out we were alive it meant they wanted something that we couldnt give them dead but what what in the hell do you want his hand came into view he was offering his hand to help me stand i stood without help putting myself a little in front of larry tell me who your master is girl and i wont hurt you who else will then i asked clever but i swear you will leave here in safety if you give me the name first of all i dont have a master im not even sure i have an equal i fought the urge to glance at his face see if he got the joke jeanclaude would have gotten it you stand before me making jokes his voice sounded surprised nearly outraged good i think i dont have a master i said master vampires can smell truth or lies if you truly believe that you are deluding yourself you bear two master signs give me the name and i will destroy him for you i will free you of this problem i hesitated he was older than jeanclaude a lot older he might be able to kill the master of the city of course that would leave this master vampire in control of the city he and his three helpers four vampires one less than were killing people but i was willing to bet there was a fifth vamp around here somewhere you couldnt have that many rogue master vampires running around one mediumsize city any master that was slaughtering civilians would be a bad thing to have in charge of all the vampires in the area just call it a feeling i shook my head i cant you want free of him do you not very much let me free you ms blake let me help you like you helped the man and woman you murdered i did not murder them he said his voice sounded very reasonable his eyes were powerful enough to drown in but the voice wasnt as good there was no magic to the voice jeanclaudes was better or yasmeens for that matter nice to know that not every talent came equally with time ancient wasnt everything so you didnt strike the fatal blow so what your flunkies do your will not their own youd be surprised how much free will we have stop it i said what sounding so damn reasonable there was laughter in his voice you would rather i rant and rave yes actually but i didnt say it out loud i wont give you the name now what there was a rush of wind at my back i tried to turn to face the wind the woman in white rushed at me fangs straining hands clawing spattered with other peoples blood the vampire smashed into me we fell backwards into the weeds with her on top she darted towards my neck like a snake i shoved my left wrist into her face one cross brushed her lips a flash of light the stench of burning flesh and the vampire was gone screaming into the darkness i had never seen any vampire move that fast had it been mindmagic had she tricked me that badly even with a blessed cross how many overfivehundredyearold vamps can you have in one pack two i hoped any more than that and theyd have us outnumbered i scrambled to my feet the master vampire was on his hands and knees beside the remains of my car larry was nowhere in sight a flutter of panic clawed at my chest then i realized larry had crawled underneath the car so the vampire couldnt make him a hostage again when all else fails hide it works for rabbits the vampires blistered back was bent at a painful angle as he tried to pull larry out from under the car i will pull this arm out of its socket if you do not come here you sound like youve got a kitten under the bed i said alejandro whirled around he flinched like it hurt great i felt something move behind me i didnt argue with the sensation say it was nerves i turned crosses ready two vampires behind me one was the palehaired female i guess the shot had missed her spine pity the other vampire could have been her male twin they both hissed and cowered from the crosses nice to see someone was bothered the master came at me from the back but i heard him either the burn was making him clumsy or the crosses were helping me i stood halfway between the three vampires crosses sort of pointed at both groups the blonds peered over their arms but the crosses had them well and truly scared the master never hesitated he came in a rushing burst of speed i backpedaled tried to keep the crosses between us but he grabbed my left forearm with the crosses dangling inches from his flesh he held on i pulled getting as much distance from him as i could then hit him in the solar plexus with everything i had he made an umph sound then flicked his hand at my face i rocked back and tasted blood hed barely touched me but hed proven his point if i wanted to exchange blows hed beat the crap out of me i hit him in the throat he gagged and looked surprised beaten to snot was still a hell of a lot better than being bitten id rather be dead than have pointy teeth his fist closed over my right fist squeezing just enough to let me feel his strength he was still trying to warn me off rather than hurt me bully for him he raised both his arms drawing me closer into his body i didnt want closer but there didnt seem to be a hell of a lot i could do about it unless of course vampires had testicles the throat shot had hurt i glanced at his face almost close enough to kiss i leaned into him getting as much room as i could he just kept drawing me closer his own momentum helped my knee hit him hard and i ground it up and into him it was not a glancing blow he crumpled forward but didnt let go of my hands i wasnt loose but it was a start and id answered an ageold question vampires did have balls he jerked my hands behind my back pinning me between his arms and his body his body felt wooden stiff and unyielding as stone it had been warm and soft and hurtable only a second before what had happened take the things off her wrist he said he wasnt talking to me i tried to crane my head around to see what was coming up behind me i couldnt see anything the two pale vampires were still huddled in the face of the naked crosses something touched my wrist i jerked but he held me still if you struggle he will cut you i turned my head as far back as i could and was staring into the round eyes of the boy vampire hed recovered his knife and was using it to poke at the bracelet the master vampires hands squeezed my arms until i thought theyd pop from the pressure like shaken soda pop i must have made some sound because he said i did not mean to hurt you tonight his mouth was pressed against my ear lost in my hair this was your choice the bracelet broke with a small snap i felt it fall away into the weeds the master vampire drew a deep breath as if it were easier to breathe now he was only an inch or two taller than i was but he held both my wrists in one small hand fingers squeezing to make the grip tight it hurt and i fought not to make small helpless noises he stroked his free hand through my hair then grabbed a handful and pulled my head backwards so he could see my eyes his eyes were solid absolute black the whites had drowned i will have his name anita one way or another i spit in his face he screamed tightening his grip on my wrists until i cried out i could have made this pleasant but now i think i want you to hurt look into my eyes mortal and despair taste of my eyes and there will be no secrets between us his voice dropped to the barest of whispers perhaps i will drink your mind like others drink blood and leave nothing behind but your mindless husk i stared into the darkness that was his eyes and felt myself fall forward impossibly forward and down down into a blackness that was pure and total and had never known light i was staring up into a face i didnt know the face was holding a bloody handkerchief to its forehead short hair pale eyes freckles hi larry i said my voice sounded distant and strange i couldnt remember why it was still dark larrys face had been cleaned up a little but the wound was still bleeding i couldnt have been out that long out where had i been out to all i could remember was eyes black eyes i sat up too fast larry caught my arm or i would have fallen where are the vampires he finished for me i leaned into his arm and whispered yeah there were people all around us in the dark huddled in little whispering groups the lights of a police car strobed the darkness two uniforms were standing quietly next to the car talking with a man whose name wouldnt come to me karl i said what larry asked karl inger the tall man talking to the police larry nodded thats right a small dark man knelt beside us jeremy ruebens of humans first who last i knew had been shooting at us what the hell was going on jeremy smiled at me it looked genuine what makes you my friend all of a sudden his smile broadened we saved you i pushed away from larry to sit on my own a moment of dizziness and i was fine yeah right talk to me larry he glanced at jeremy ruebens then back to me they saved us how they threw holy water on the one who bit me he touched his throat with his free hand an unconscious gesture but he noticed me watching is she going to have control over me did she enter your mind at the same time as she bit you i dont know he said how can you tell i opened my mouth to explain then closed it how to explain the unexplainable if alejandro the master vampire had bitten me at the same time he rolled my mind id be under his power now alejandro thats what the other vampires called the master i shook my head but the world swam in black waves and i had to swallow hard not to vomit what had he done to me id had mind games played on me before but id never had a reaction like this theres an ambulance coming larry said i dont need one youve been unconscious for over an hour ms blake ruebens said we had the police call an ambulance when we couldnt wake you ruebens was close enough for me to reach out and touch him he looked friendly positively radiant like a bride on her big day why was i suddenly his favorite person so they threw holy water on the vamp that bit you what then i asked larry they drove the rest of them off with crosses and charms charms ruebens pulled out a chain with two miniature metalfaced books hanging on it both books would have fit in the palm of my hand with room to spare they arent charms larry theyre tiny jewish holy books i thought a star of david the star doesnt work because its a racial symbol not really a religious symbol so its like miniature bibles i raised my eyebrows the torah contains the old testament so yeah its like miniature bibles would the bible work for us christians i dont know probably ive just never been attacked by vampires while carrying a bible that was probably my fault in fact when was the last time id read the bible was i becoming a sunday christian id worry about my soul later after my body felt a little better cancel the ambulance im fine you are not fine ruebens said he reached out as if to touch me i looked at him he stopped in midmotion let us help you ms blake we share common enemies the police were walking towards us over the dark grass karl inger was coming too talking softly to the police as they moved do the police know you were shooting at us first something passed over ruebenss face they dont know do they we saved you ms blake from a fate worse than death i was wrong to try and hurt you you raise the dead but if you are truly enemies with the vampires then we are allies the enemy of my enemy is my friend huh he nodded the police were almost here almost within earshot all right but you ever point a gun at me again and ill forget you saved me it will never happen again ms blake you have my word i wanted to say something disparaging but the police were there theyd hear i wasnt going to tell on ruebens and humans first so i had to save my smart alec comebacks for later use knowing ruebens id get another chance i lied to the police about what humans first had done and i lied about what alejandro had wanted from me it was just another of those mindless attacks that had happened twice already later to dolph and zerbrowski id tell the truth but right now i just didnt feel like explaining the entire mess to strangers i wasnt even sure dolph would get the whole story like the fact that i was almost assuredly jeanclaudes human servant nope no need to mention that larrys car was a latemodel mazda the vampires had kept humans first so busy they hadnt had time to trash the car lucky for us since my car was totaled oh id have to go through the insurance company and let them tell me the car was totaled but there was something large broken underneath the car fluids darker than blood were leaking out the front end looked like wed hit an elephant i knew totaled when i saw it wed spent the last several hours at the emergency room the ambulance attendants insisted i see a doctor and larry needed three small stitches in his forehead his orangey hair fell forward and hid the wound his first scar the first of many if he stayed in this business and hung around me youve been on the job what fourteen hours what do you think so far i asked he glanced at me sideways then back to the road he smiled but it didnt look funny i dont know do you want to be an animator when you graduate i thought i did he said honesty a rare talent not sure now not really i let it rest there my instinct was to talk him out of it to tell him to go into some sane normal business but i knew that raising the dead wasnt just a job choice if your talent was strong enough you had to raise the dead or risk the power coming out at odd moments does the term roadkill mean anything to you it meant something to my stepmother judith of course she wasnt pleased with my job she thought it was gruesome what could i say she was right there are other job choices for a preternatural biology degree what a zoo exterminator teacher i said park ranger naturalist field biologist researcher and which of those jobs can make you this kind of money he asked is money the only reason you want to be an animator i was disappointed i want to do something to help people what better than using my specialized skills to rid the world of dangerous undead i stared at him all i could see was his profile in the darkened car face underlit from the dashboard you want to be a vampire executioner not an animator i didnt try to keep the surprise out of my voice my ultimate goal yes why why do you do it i shook my head answer the question larry i want to help people then be a policeman they need people on the force who know preternatural creatures i thought i did pretty good tonight you did then whats wrong i tried to think how to phrase it in fifty convincing words or less what happened tonight was awful but it gets worse olives coming up which way do i turn left the car took the exit and slid into the turning lane we sat at the light with the turn signal blinking in the dark you dont know what youre getting into i said then tell me he said ill do better than that ill show you whats that supposed to mean turn right at the third light we rolled into the parking lot first building on the right larry slid into the only open space he could find my parking space my poor little nova wouldnt be coming back to it i took off my jacket in the darkness of the car hit the overhead light i said he did as he was told he was better at following orders than i was which since hed be following my orders was fine i showed him the scars on my arms the crossshaped burn is from human servants who thought it was funny the mound of scar tissue at the bend of my arm is where a vampire tore my arm to pieces physical therapist says its a miracle that i got full use of my arm back fourteen stitches from a human servant and thats just my arms theres more his face looked pale and strange in the dome light a vampire shoved the broken end of a stake in my back he winced and my collarbone was broken at the same time my arm got chewed up youre trying to scare me you bet i said i wont be scared off tonight should have scared him off without my showing him my scars but it hadnt dammit hed stick if he didnt get killed first all right youre staying for the rest of the semester great but promise me you wont go hunting vampires without me but mr burke he helps execute vampires but he doesnt hunt them alone whats the difference between an execution and a hunt an execution just means a body that needs staking or a vampire thats all nice and chained up waiting for the final stroke then whats a hunt he asked when i go back out after the vampires that nearly killed us tonight thats a hunt and you dont trust mr burke to teach me to hunt i dont trust mr burke to keep you alive larrys eyes widened i dont mean hed deliberately hurt you i mean i dont trust anybody but me with your life you think itll come down to that it damn near did he was quiet for a handful of minutes he stared down at his hands that were smoothing back and forth over the steering wheel i promise not to go vampire hunting with anybody but you he stared at me blue blue eyes studying my face not even mr rodriguez mr vaughn said he taught you manny did teach me but he doesnt hunt vampires anymore why not i met his trueblue eyes and said his wifes too afraid and hes got four kids you and mr burke arent married and dont have kids thats right neither do i he said i had to smile had i ever been this eager naw no one likes a smart alec larry he grinned and it made him look about thirteen jesus why wasnt he running for cover after tonight why wasnt i no answers at least none that made sense why did i do it because i was good at it came the answer maybe larry could be good at it too maybe or maybe hed just get dead i got out of the car and leaned back in the open door go straight home and if you dont have an extra cross buy one tomorrow okay he said i shut the door on his solemn earnest face i walked up the stairs and didnt look back i didnt watch him drive away still alive still eager after his first brush with the monsters i was only four years older than he was four years it felt like centuries i had never been that green my mothers death when i was eight saw to that it takes the edge off the shiny brightness to lose a parent early i was still going to try to talk larry out of being a vampire executioner but if all else failed id work with him there are only two kinds of vampire hunters good ones and dead ones maybe i could make larry one of the good ones it beat the hell out of the alternative it was friday morning it had been a long week of course when hadnt it been a long week this year i had told bert to hire more help he hired larry why didnt that make me happy because larry was just another victim waiting for the right monster please keep him safe god please id had about as many innocents die on me as i thought i could handle the hallway had that middleofthenight feel to it the only sounds were the hush of the heating vents the muffled sound of my nike airs on the carpeting it was too late for my dayliving neighbors to stay up and too early for them to get up two hours before dawn you get privacy i opened my brandnew burglarproof lock and stepped into the darkness of my apartment i hit the lights and flooded the white walls carpet couch and chair with bright light no matter how good your night vision is everyone likes light were creatures of the daylight no matter what we do for a living i threw my jacket on the kitchen counter it was too dirty to toss on the white couch i had mud and bits of weed plastered all over me but very little blood the night had turned out all right i was slipping out of the shoulder holster when i felt it the air currents had moved as if something had moved through them just like that i knew i wasnt alone my hand was on the gun butt when edwards voice came out of the darkness of my bedroom dont anita i hesitated fingers touching the gun and if i do ill shoot you you know ill do it his voice was that soft sure predatory sound id seen him use flamethrowers when his voice sounded like that smooth and calm as the road to hell i eased away from my gun edward would shoot me if i forced him to better not to force it not yet not yet i clasped my hands on top of my head without waiting for him to tell me maybe id get brownie points for being a cooperative prisoner naw edward stepped out of the darkness like a blond ghost he was dressed all in black except for his short hair and pale face his blackgloved hands held a beretta mm pointed very steadily at my chest new gun i asked the ghost of a smile curled his lips yes like it berettas a nice gun but you know me a browning fan he said i smiled at him just two ol buddies talking shop he pressed the gun barrel against my body while he took the browning from me lean and spread it i leaned on the back of the couch while he patted me down there was nothing to find but edward didnt know that he was never careless that was one of the reasons he was still alive that and the fact that he was very very good you said you couldnt pick my lock i said i brought better tools he said so its not burglarproof it would be to most people but not to you he stared at me his eyes as empty and dead as winters sky i am not most people i had to smile you can say that again he frowned at me give me the masters name and we dont have to do this the gun never wavered my browning stuck out of the front of his belt i hoped hed remembered the safety or maybe i didnt i opened my mouth closed it and just looked at him i couldnt give jeanclaude over to edward i was the executioner but the vampires called edward death hed earned the name i thought youd be following me tonight i went home after watching you raise the zombie guess i should have stayed around who bloodied your mouth im not going to tell you a bloody thing you know that everyone breaks anita everyone even you that ghost of a smile was back again even me someone got the better of death tell tell the smile widened some other time nice to know therell be another time i said im not here to kill you just to frighten or torture me into revealing the masters name right right he said voice soft and low i was hoping youd say wrong he almost shrugged give me the master of the city anita and ill go away you know i cant do that i know you have to or its going to be a very long night then its going to be a long night because im not going to give you shit you wont be bullied he said nope he shook his head turn around lean your waist up against the couch and put your hands behind your back why just do it so you can tie my hands do it now i dont think so the frown was back do you want me to shoot you no but im not going to just stand here while you tie me up either the tying up doesnt hurt its what comes after that im worried about you knew what id do if you didnt help me then do it i said youre not cooperating so sorry anita i just dont believe in helping people who are going to torture me though i dont see any bamboo slivers how can you possibly torture someone without bamboo slivers stop it he sounded angry stop what i widened my eyes and tried to look innocent and harmless me and kermit the frog edward laughed a soft chuckle that rolled and expanded until he squatted on the floor gun loose in his hands staring up at me his eyes were shiny how can i torture you when you keep making me laugh you cant that was the plan he shook his head no it wasnt you were just being a smartass youre always a smartass nice of you to notice he held up his hand no more please ill make you laugh until you beg for mercy just tell me the damn name please anita help me the laughter drained from his eyes like the sun slipping out of the sky i watched the humor the humanity slip away until his eyes were as cold and empty as a dolls dont make me hurt you he said i think i was edwards only friend but that wouldnt stop him from hurting me edward had one rule do whatever it takes to get the job done if i forced him to torture me he would but he didnt want to now that youve asked nicely try the first question again i said his eyes narrowed then he said who hit you in the mouth a master vampire i said softly tell me what happened it was too much like an order for my taste but he did have both the guns i told him everything that had happened all about alejandro alejandro who felt so old inside my head it made my bones ache i added one tiny lie lost in all that truth i told him alejandro was master of the city one of my better ideas heh you really dont know where his daytime resting place is do you i shook my head id give it to you if i had it why this change of heart he tried to kill me tonight all bets are off i dont believe that it was too good a lie to waste so i tried salvaging it hes also gone rogue its him and his flunkies that have been killing innocent citizens edward smirked at the innocent but he let it go an altruistic motive that i believe if you werent such a damn bleeding heart youd be dangerous i kill my share edward his empty blue eyes stared at me then he nodded slowly true he handed me back my gun butt first a tight clenched ball in my stomach unrolled i could breathe deep long sighs of relief if i find out where this alejandro stays you want in on it i thought about that for a minute did i want to go after five rogue vampires two of them over five hundred years old i did not did i want to send even edward after them alone no i did not which meant yeah i want a piece of them edward smiled broad and shining i love my work i smiled back me too jeanclaude lay in the middle of a white canopied bed his skin was only slightly less white than the sheets he was dressed in a nightshirt lace fell down the low collar forming a lace window around his chest lace flowed from the sleeves nearly hiding his hands it should have looked feminine but jeanclaude made it utterly masculine how could any man wear a white lace gown and not look silly of course he wasnt a man that must be it his black hair curled in the lace collar touchable i shook my head not even in my dreams i was dressed in something long and silky it was a shade of blue almost as dark as his eyes my arms looked very white against it jeanclaude got to his knees and reached his hand out to me an invitation i shook my head it is only a dream ma petite will you not come to me even here its never just a dream with you it always means more his hand fell to the sheets fingertips caressing the cloth what are you trying to do to me jeanclaude he looked very steadily at me seduce you of course of course silly me the phone beside the bed rang it was one of those white princess phones with lots of gold on it there hadnt been a telephone a second before it rang again and the dream fell to shreds i came awake grabbing for the phone hello hey did i wake you irving griswold asked i blinked at the phone yeah what time is it its ten oclock i know better than to call early what do you want irving grouchy i got in late can we skip the sarcasm i your trueblue reporter friend will forgive you that grumpy hello if you answer a few questions questions i sat up hugging the phone to me what are you talking about is it true that humans first saved you last night as theyre claiming claiming can you talk in complete sentences irving the morning news had jeremy ruebens on it channel five he claimed that he and humans first saved your life last night saved you from the master vampire of the city oh he did not may i quote you i thought about that for a minute no i need a quote for the paper im trying to give a chance for a rebuttal a rebuttal hey i was an english major that explains so much can you give me your side of the story or not i thought about that for a minute irving was a friend and a good reporter if ruebens was already on the morning news with the story i needed to get my side out can you give me fifteen minutes to make coffee and get dressed for an exclusive you bet talk to you then i hung up and went straight for the coffeemaker i was wearing jogging socks jeans and the oversized tshirt id slept in when irving called back i had a steaming cup of coffee on the bedside table beside the phone cinnamon hazelnut coffee from v js tea and spice shop over on olive mornings didnt get much better than this okay spill it he said gee irving no foreplay get to it blake ive got a deadline i told him everything i had to admit that humans first had saved my cookies darn i cant confirm that the vampire they ran off was the master of the city hey i know jeanclaude is the master i interviewed him remember i remember i know this indian guy was not jeanclaude but humans first doesnt know that a double exclusive wowee no dont say that alejandro isnt the master why not id clear it with jeanclaude first if i were you he cleared his throat yeah not a bad idea he sounded nervous is jeanclaude giving you trouble no why do you ask for a reporter you lie badly jeanclaude and i got business just between us it doesnt concern the executioner fine just watch your back okay im flattered that youre worried about me anita but trust me i can handle it i didnt argue with that i must have been in a good mood anything you say irving he let it go so i did too no one could handle jeanclaude but it wasnt my business irving had been the one hot for the interview so there were strings attached not a big surprise and not my business really thisll be on the front page of the morning paper ill check with jeanclaude about whether to mention this new vamp isnt the master id really appreciate it if you could hold off on that why he sounded suspicious maybe it wouldnt be such a bad idea for humans first to believe alejandro is the master why so they dont kill jeanclaude i said oh he said yeah i said ill bear that in mind he said you do that gotta go deadline calls okay irving talk to you later bye anita thanks he hung up i sipped the stillsteaming coffee slowly the first cup of the day should never be rushed if i could get humans first to believe the same lie edward bought then no one would be hunting jeanclaude theyd be hunting alejandro the master that was slaughtering humans put the police on the case and we had the rogue vamps outnumbered yeah i liked it the trick was would everyone buy it never know until you try i had finished a pot of coffee and managed to get dressed when the phone rang again one of those mornings yeah i said ms blake the voice sounded very uncertain speaking this is karl inger sorry if i sounded abrupt whats up mr inger you said youd speak to me again if we had a better plan i have a better plan he said for killing the master of the city i made it a question yes i took a deep breath and let it out slow away from the phone didnt want him to think i was heavy breathing at him mr inger please hear me out we saved your life last night that must be worth something he had me there whats your plan mr inger id rather tell you in person im not going to my office for some hours yet could i come to your home no it was automatic you dont bring business home not when i can help it i said suspicious of you always i said can we meet somewhere else theres someone i want you to meet who and why the name wont mean anything to you try me mr oliver first name i dont know it okay then why should i meet him he has a good plan for killing the master of the city what no i think it will be better if mr oliver explains it in person hes much more persuasive than i am youre doing okay i said then youll meet me sure why not thats wonderful do you know where arnold is yes theres a pay fishing lake just outside of arnold on tesson ferry road do you know it i had an impression that i had driven by it on the way to two murders all roads led to arnold i can find it how soon can you meet me there he asked an hour great ill be waiting is this mr oliver going to be at the lake no ill drive you from there why all the secrecy not secrecy he said his voice dropped embarrassed im just not very good at giving directions itll be easier if i just take you i can follow you in my car why ms blake i dont think you entirely trust me i dont entirely trust anybody mr inger nothing personal not even people who save your life not even he let that drop probably for the best and said ill meet you at the lake in an hour sure thank you for coming ms blake i owe you youve made sure im aware of that you sound defensive ms blake i did not mean to offend you i sighed im not offended mr inger i just dont like owing people visiting mr oliver today will clear the slate between us i promise that ill hold you to that inger ill meet you in an hour he said ill be there i said we hung up damn id forgotten i hadnt gotten to eat yet today if id remembered id have said two hours now id have to literally grab something on the way i hated eating in the car but heh whats a little mess between friends or even between people whove saved your life why did it bother me so much that i owed inger because he was a rightwing fruitcake a zealot i didnt like doing business with zealots and i certainly didnt like owing my life to one ah well id meet him then wed be square he had said so why didnt i believe it chipaway lake was about half an acre of manmade water and thin raised manmade bank there was a little shed that sold bait and food it was surrounded by a flat gravel parking lot a latemodel car sat near the road with a sign that read for sale a pay fishing lake and a used car lot combined how clever an expanse of grass spread out to the right of the parking lot a small ramshackle shed and what looked like the remains of some large industrial barbecue a fringe of woods edged the grass rising higher into a wooded hill the meramec river edged the left side of the lake it seemed funny to have freeflowing water so close to the manmade lake there were only three cars in the parking lot this cool autumn afternoon beside a shiny burgundy chrysler le baron stood inger a handful of fishermen had bundled up and put poles in the water fishing must be good to get people out in the cold i parked beside ingers car he strode towards me smiling hand out like a real estate salesman who was happy id come to see the property whatever he was selling i didnt want i was almost sure of that ms blake so glad you came he clasped my hand with both of his hearty goodnatured insincere what do you want mr inger his smile faded around the edges i dont know what you mean ms blake yes you do no i really dont i stared into his puzzled face maybe i spent too much time with slimeballs after a while you forget that not everyone in the world is a slimeball it just saves so much time to assume the worst im sorry mr inger i ive been spending too much time looking for criminals it makes you cynical he still looked puzzled never mind mr inger just take me to see this oliver mr oliver he said sure shall we take my car he motioned towards his car ill follow you in mine you dont trust me he looked hurt i guess most people arent used to being suspected of wrongdoing before theyve done anything wrong the law says innocent until proven guilty but the truth is if you see enough pain and death its guilty until proven innocent all right you drive he looked very pleased heartwarming besides i was carrying two knives three crosses and a gun innocent or guilty i was prepared i didnt expect to need the weaponry with mr oliver but later i might need it later it was time to go armed to the teeth ready for bear or dragon or vampire inger drove down old highway to east rock creek rock creek was a narrow winding road barely wide enough for two cars to pass inger drove slow enough for the curves but fast enough so you didnt get bored there were farmhouses that had stood for years and new houses in subdivisions where the earth was raw and red as a wound inger turned into one of those new subdivisions it was full of large expensivelooking houses very modern thin spindly trees were tied to stakes along the gravel road the pitiful trees trembled in the autumn wind a few surprised leaves still clinging to the spiderthin limbs this area had been a forest before they bulldozed it why do developers destroy all the mature trees then plant new trees that wont look good for decades we pulled up in front of a fake log cabin that was bigger than any real cabin had ever been too much glass the yard naked dirt the color of rust the white gravel that made up the driveway had to have been brought in from miles away all the native gravel was as red as the dirt inger started to go around the car to open my door i think i opened my own door inger seemed a little lost but hed get over it id never seen the sense in perfectly healthy people not opening their own doors especially car doors where the man had to walk all the way around the car and the woman just waited like a a lump inger led the way up the porch steps it was a nice porch wide enough to sit on come summer evenings right now it was all bare wood and a huge picture window with closed drapes in a barnred design with wagon wheels drawn all over it very rustic he knocked on the carved wooden door a pane of leaded glass decorated the center of the door high up and sparkling more for decoration than for seeing through he didnt wait for the door to be opened but used a key and walked in he didnt seem to expect an answer so why knock the house was in a thick twilight of really nice drapes all closed against the syrupheavy sunlight the polished wood floors were utterly bare the mantel of the heavy fireplace was naked the fireplace cold the place smelled new and unused like new toys on christmas inger never hesitated i followed his broad back into the wooden hallway he didnt look behind to see if i was keeping up apparently when id decided not to let him open my door for me he seemed to have decided that no further courtesy was necessary fine with me there were doors at widely spaced intervals along the hallway inger knocked at the third door on the left a voice said enter inger opened the door and went inside he held the door for me standing very straight by the door it wasnt courtesy he stood like a soldier at attention who was in the room to make inger toe the line one way to find out i went into the room there was a bank of windows to the north with heavy drapes pulled across them a thin line of sunlight cut across the room bisecting a large clean desk a man sat in a large chair behind the desk he was a small man almost a midget or a dwarf i wanted to say dwarf but he didnt have the jaw or the shortened arms he looked well formed under his tailored suit he had almost no chin and a sloping forehead which drew attention to the wide nose and the prominent eyebrow ridge there was something familiar about his face as if id seen it somewhere else before yet i knew id never met a person who looked just like him it was a very singular face i was staring at him i was embarrassed and didnt like it i met his eyes they were perfectly brown and smiling his dark hair was cut one hair at a time expensive and blowdried he sat in his chair behind the clean polished desk and smiled at me mr oliver this is anita blake inger said still standing stiffly by the door he got out of his chair and came around the desk to offer me his small wellformed hand he was four feet tall not an inch more his handshake was firm and much stronger than he looked a brief squeeze and i could feel the strength in his small frame he didnt look musclebound but that easy strength was there in his face hand stance he was small but he didnt think it was a defect i liked that i felt the same way he gave a closelipped smile and sat back down in his big chair inger brought a chair from the corner and put it facing the desk i took the chair inger remained standing by the nowclosed door he was definitely at attention he respected the man in the chair i was willing to like him that was a first for me im more likely to instantly mistrust than like someone i realized that i was smiling i felt warm and comfortable facing him like he was a favorite and trusted uncle i frowned at him what the hell was happening to me whats going on i said he smiled his eyes sparkling warmly at me whatever do you mean ms blake his voice was soft low rich like cream in coffee you could almost taste it a comforting warmth to your ears i only knew one other voice that could do similar things i stared at the thin band of sunlight only inches from olivers arm it was broad daylight he couldnt be could he i stared at his very alive face there was no trace of that otherness that vampires gave off and yet his voice this warm cosy feeling none of it was natural id never liked and trusted anyone instantly i wasnt about to start now youre good i said very good whatever do you mean ms blake you could have cuddled into the warm fuzziness of his voice like a favorite blanket stop it he looked quizzically at me as if confused the act was perfect and i realized why it wasnt an act id been around ancient vampires but never one that had been able to pass for human not like this you could have taken him anywhere and no one would have known well almost no one believe me ms blake im not trying to do anything i swallowed hard was that true was he so damn powerful that the mind tricks and the voice were automatic no if jeanclaude could control it this thing could too cut the mind tricks and curb the voice okay if you want to talk business talk but cut the games his smile widened still not enough to show fangs after a few hundred years you must get really good at smiling like that he laughed then it was wonderful like warm water falling from a great height you could have jumped into it and bathed and felt good stop it stop it fangs flashed as he finished chuckling at me it isnt the vampire marks that allowed you to see through my as you call them games it is natural talent isnt it i nodded most animators have it but not to the degree you do ms blake you have power too it crawls along my skin you are a necromancer i started to deny it but stopped lying to something like this was useless he was older than anything id ever dreamed of older than any nightmare id ever had but he didnt make my bones ache he felt good better than jeanclaude better than anything i could be a necromancer i choose not to be no ms blake the dead respond to you all the dead even i feel the pull you mean i have a sort of power over vampires too if you could learn to harness your talents ms blake yes you have a certain power over all the dead in their many guises i wanted to ask how to do that but stopped myself a master vampire wasnt likely to help me gain power over his followers youre taunting me i assure you ms blake that i am very serious it is your potential power that has drawn the master of the city to you he wants to control that emerging power for fear it will be turned against him how do you know that i can taste him through the marks he has laid upon you i just stared at him he could taste jeanclaude shit what do you want from me very direct i like that human lives are too short to waste in trivialities was that a threat staring into his smiling face i couldnt tell his eyes were still sparkling and i was still feeling very warm and fuzzy towards him eye contact i knew better than that i stared at the top of his desk and felt better or worse i could be scared now inger said you had a plan for taking out the master of the city what is it i spoke staring at his desk my skin crawled with the desire to look up to meet his eyes to let the warmth and comfort wash over me make all the decisions easy i shook my head stay out of my mind or this interview is over he laughed again warm and real it raised goose bumps on my arms you really are good i havent met a human in centuries that rivaled you a necromancer do you realize how rare that talent is really i didnt but i said yes lies ms blake to me please dont bother were not here to talk about me either state your plan or im leaving i am the plan ms blake you can feel my powers the ebb and flow of more centuries than your little master has ever dreamed of i am older than time itself that i didnt believe but i let it go he was old enough i wasnt going to argue with him not if i could help it give me your master and i will free you of his marks i glanced up then quickly down he was still smiling at me but the smile didnt look real anymore it was an act like everything else it was just a very good act if you can taste my master in the marks cant you just find him yourself i can taste his power judge how worthy a foe he would be but not his name and not where he lies that is hidden his voice was very serious now not trying to trick me or at least i didnt think it was maybe that was a trick too what do you want from me his name and his daytime resting place i dont know the daytime resting place i was glad it was the truth because he would smell a lie then his name give me his name why should i because i wish to be master of the city ms blake why so many questions is it not enough that i would free you from his power i shook my head no why should you care about what happens to the other vampires i dont but before i hand you the power to control every vampire in the immediate area id like to know what you intend to do with all that power he laughed again this time it was just a laugh he was trying you are the most stubborn human i have met in a very long time i like stubborn people they get things done answer my question i think it is wrong to have vampires as legal citizens i wish to put things back as they were why should you want vampires to be hunted again they are too powerful to be allowed to spread unchecked they will take over the human race much quicker through legislation and voting rights than they ever could through violence i remembered the church of eternal life the fastestgrowing denomination in the country say youre right how would you stop it by forbidding the vampires to vote or take part in any legislation there are other master vampires in town you mean malcolm the head of the church of eternal life yes i have observed him he will not be able to continue his oneman crusade to make vampires legitimate i shall forbid it and dismantle his church surely you see the church as the larger danger as i do i did but i hated agreeing with an ancient master vampire it seemed wrong somehow st louis is a hotbed of political activity and entrepreneurial vampires they must be stopped we are predators ms blake nothing we do can change that we must go back to being hunted or the human race is doomed surely you see that i did see that i believed that why would you care if the human race is doomed youre not part of it anymore as the oldest living vampire it is my duty to keep us in check ms blake these new rights are getting out of hand and must be stopped we are too powerful to be allowed such freedom humans have their right to be human in the olden days only the strongest smartest or luckiest vampires survived the human vampire hunters weeded out the stupid the careless the violent without that checkandbalance system i fear what will happen in a few decades i agreed wholeheartedly it was sorta scary i agreed with the oldest living thing id ever met he was right could i give him jeanclaude should i give him jeanclaude i agree with you mr oliver but i cant just give him up just like that i dont know why really but i cant loyalty i admire that think upon it ms blake but do not take too long i need to put my plan into action as soon as possible i nodded i understand i ill give you an answer within a couple of days how do i reach you inger will give you a card with a number on it you may safely speak to him as to me i turned and looked at inger still standing at attention beside the door youre his human servant arent you i have that honor i shook my head i need to leave now do not feel badly that you could not recognize inger as my human servant it is not a mark which shows otherwise how could they be our human ears and eyes and hands if everyone knew they were ours he had a point he had a lot of points i stood up he stood up too he offered me his hand im sorry but i know that touching makes the mind games easier the hand dropped back to his side i do not need to touch you to play mind games ms blake the voice was wonderful shining and bright as christmas morning my throat was tight and the warmth of tears filled my eyes shit shit shit shit i backed for the door and inger opened it for me they were just going to let me leave he wasnt going to mindrape me and get the name he was really going to let me walk away that did more to prove him a good guy than anything else because he could have squeezed my mind dry but he let me go inger closed the door behind us slowly reverently how old is he i asked you couldnt tell i shook my head how old inger smiled i am over seven hundred years old mr oliver was ancient when i met him hes older than a thousand years why do you say that ive met a vampire that was a little over a thousand she was scary but she didnt have that kind of power he smiled if you wish to know his true age then you must ask him yourself i stared up at ingers smiling face for a minute i remembered where id seen a face like olivers id had one anthropology class in college thered been a drawing that looked just like oliver it had been a reconstruction of a homo erectus skull which made oliver about a million years old my god i said whats wrong ms blake i shook my head he cant be that old how old is that i didnt want to say it out loud as if that would make it real a million years how powerful would a vampire grow in a million years a woman walked up the hallway towards us coming from deeper in the house she swayed on bare feet toenails painted a bright scarlet that matched her fingernails the belted dress she wore matched the nail polish her legs were long and pale but it was that kind of paleness that promised to tan if it ever got enough sunlight her hair fell past her waist thick and absolute black her makeup was perfect her lips scarlet she smiled at me fangs showed below her lips but she wasnt a vampire i didnt know what the hell she was but i knew what she wasnt i glanced at inger he didnt look happy shouldnt we be going i said yes he said he backed towards the front door and i backed behind him neither of us took our eyes off the fanged beauty slinking down the hall towards us she moved in a liquid run that was almost too fast to follow lycanthropes could move like that but that wasnt what she was either she was around inger and coming for me i gave up being cool and sort of ran backwards towards the front door but she was too fast for me too fast for any human she grabbed my right forearm she looked puzzled she could feel the knife sheath on my arm she didnt seem to know what it was bully for me what are you my voice was steady not afraid heap big vampire slayer yeah right she opened her mouth wider tongue caressing the fangs the fangs were longer than a vampires shed never be able to close her mouth around them where do the fangs go when you close your mouth i said she blinked at me the smile slipping away from her face she ran her tongue over them then they folded back into the roof of her mouth retractable fangs cool i said her face was very solemn im glad you enjoyed the show but theres so much more to see the fangs unfolded again she widened her jaws almost a yawn flashing the fangs nicely in the dim beams of sunlight that got around the drapes mr oliver will not like you threatening her inger said he grows weak sentimental her fingers dug into my arm stronger than she should have been she was holding my right arm so i couldnt go for the gun the knives were out for similar reasons maybe i should wear more guns she hissed at me a violent explosion of air that no human throat ever made the tongue that flicked out was forked sweet jesus what are you she laughed but it didnt sound right now maybe the split tongue her pupils had narrowed to slits her irises turned a golden yellow while i watched i tugged on my arm but her fingers were like steel i dropped to the floor she lowered my arm but didnt let go i leaned back on my left side drew my legs up under me and kicked her right kneecap with everything i had the leg crumpled she screamed and fell to the floor but she let my arm go something was happening to her legs they seemed to be growing together the skin spreading id never seen anything like it and i didnt want to now melanie what are you doing the voice was behind us oliver stood in the hallway just short of the brighter light of the living room his voice was the sound of rocks falling trees breaking a storm that was just words but seemed to cut and slash the thing on the floor cringed from the voice her lower body was becoming serpentine a snake of some kind jesus shes a lamia i said softly i backed away putting the outside door to my back hand on the door knob i thought they were extinct she is the last one oliver said i keep her with me because i fear what she would do if left to her own desires your creature that you can call what is it i asked he sighed and i felt the years of sadness in that one sound a regret too deep for words snakes i can call snakes i nodded my head sure i opened the door and backed out onto the sunny porch no one tried to stop me the door shut behind me and after a few minutes inger came out he was stiff with anger we most humbly apologize for her she is an animal oliver needs to keep her on a tighter leash he tries i nodded i knew about trying doing your best but anything that could control a lamia could play mind games with me all day and i might never know it how much of my trust and good wishes was real and how much of it was manufactured by oliver ill drive you back please and away we went id met my first lamia and perhaps the oldest living creature in the world a redfuckingletter day the phone was ringing as i unlocked the apartment door i shoved the door open with my shoulder and ran for the phone i got it on the fifth ring and nearly yelled hello anita ronnie made it a question yeah its me you sound out of breath i had to run for the phone whats up i remembered where i knew cal rupert from it took me a minute to remember who she was talking about the first vampire victim id forgotten just for a moment that there was a murder investigation going on i was a little ashamed of that talk to me ronnie i was doing some work for a local law firm last year one of the lawyers specialized in drawing up dying wills i know that rupert had a dying will thats how i could stake him without waiting for an order of execution but did you also know that reba baker had a dying will with the same lawyer whos reba baker it may be the female victim my stomach tightened a clue a real live clue what makes you think so reba baker was young blond and missed an appointment she doesnt answer her phone they called her at work and she hasnt been in for two days the length of time shed have been dead i said exactly call sergeant rudolf storr tell him what you just told me use my name to get to him you dont want to check it out ourselves not on your life this is police business theyre good at it let em earn their paychecks shucks youre no fun ronnie call dolph give it to the police ive met the vampires that are killing these people we dont want to make ourselves targets you what i sighed id forgotten that ronnie didnt know i told her the shortest version that would make any sense ill fill you in on everything saturday morning when we work out you going to be all right so far so good watch your back okay always you too i never seem to have as many people after my back as you do be thankful i said i am she hung up we had a clue maybe a pattern except for the attack on me i didnt fit any pattern theyd come after me to get jeanclaude everybody wanted jeanclaudes job the trouble was you couldnt abdicate you could only die i liked what oliver had had to say i agreed with him but could i sacrifice jeanclaude on the altar of good sense dammit i just didnt know berts office was small and painted pale blue he thought it was soothing to the clients i thought it was cold but that fit bert too he was six feet tall with the broad shoulders and build of an excollege football player his stomach was moving a little south with too much food and not enough exercise but he carried it well in his sevenhundreddollar suits for that kind of money the suits should have carried the taj mahal he was tanned greyeyed with a buzz haircut that was nearly white not age his natural hair color i was sitting across from his desk in work clothes a red skirt matching jacket and a blouse that was so close to scarlet id had to put on a little makeup so that my face didnt seem ghostly the jacket was tailored so that my shoulder holster didnt show larry sat in the chair beside me in a blue suit white shirt and blueonblue tie the skin around his stitches had blossomed into a multicolored bruise across his forehead his short red hair couldnt hide it it looked like someone had hit him in the head with a baseball bat you could have gotten him killed bert i said he wasnt in any danger until you showed up the vampires wanted you not him he was right and i didnt like it he tried to raise a third zombie berts cold little eyes lit up you can do three in a night larry had the grace to look embarrassed almost bert frowned whats almost mean it means he raised it but lost control of it if i hadnt been there to fix things wed have had a rampaging zombie on our hands he leaned forward hands folded on his desk small eyes very serious is this true larry im afraid so mr vaughn that could have been very serious larry you understand that serious i said it would have been a bloody disaster the zombie could have eaten one of our clients now anita no reason to frighten the boy i stood up yes there is bert frowned at me if you hadnt been late he wouldnt have tried to raise the last zombie no bert you are not making this all my fault you sent him out on his first night alone alone bert and he handled himself well bert said i fought the urge to scream because it wouldnt help bert hes a twentyyearold college student this is a freaking seminar for him if you get him killed its gonna look sorta bad may i say something larry asked i said no bert said certainly im a big boy i can take care of myself i wanted to argue that but looking into his trueblue eyes i couldnt say it he was twenty i remembered twenty id known everything at twenty it took me another year to realize i knew nothing i was still hoping to learn something before i hit thirty but i wasnt holding my breath how old were you when you started working for me bert said what how old were you twentyone id just graduated college when will you turn twentyone larry bert asked march see anita hes just a few months younger hes the same age you were that was different why bert said i couldnt put it into words larry still had all his grandparents hed never seen death and violence up close and personal i had he was an innocent and i hadnt been innocent for years but how to explain that to bert without hurting larrys feelings no twentyyearold man likes to hear that a woman knows more about the world than he does some cultural fables die hard you sent me out with manny not alone he was supposed to go out with you but you had police business to handle thats not fair bert and you know it he shrugged if youd been doing your job he wouldnt have been alone thereve been two murders what am i supposed to do say sorry folks ive got to babysit a new animator sorry about the murders nobody has to babysit me larry said we both ignored him you have a full time job here with animators inc weve had this argument before bert too many times he said youre my boss bert do what you think best dont tempt me hey guys larry said im getting the feeling that youre using me for an excuse to fight dont get carried away okay we both glared at him he didnt back down just stared at us point for him if you dont like the way i do my job bert fire me but stop yanking my chain bert stood up slowly like a leviathan rising from the waves anita the phone rang we all stared at it for a minute bert finally picked it up and growled yeah what is it he listened for a minute then glared at me its for you his voice was incredibly mild as he said it detective sergeant storr police business berts face was smiling butter wouldnt have melted in his mouth i held out my hand for the phone without another word he handed me the receiver he was still smiling his tiny grey eyes warm and sparkling it was a bad sign hi dolph whats up were at the lawyers office that your friend veronica sims gave us nice that she called you first and not us she called you second didnt she yeah what have you found out i didnt bother to keep my voice down if youre careful one side of a conversation isnt very enlightening reba baker is the dead woman they identified her from morgue photos pleasant way to end the work week i said dolph ignored that both victims were clients with dying wills if they died by vampire bite they wanted to be staked then cremated sounds like a pattern to me i said but how did the vampires find out that they had dying wills is this a trick question dolph someone told them i know that he said he sounded disgusted i was missing something what do you want from me dolph ive questioned everyone and id swear they were all telling the truth could someone have been giving the information and not remember you mean could the vampire have played mind games so that the traitor wouldnt know afterwards yeah he said sure i said could you tell which one the vampire got to if you were here i glanced at my bosss face if i missed another night during our busiest season he might fire me there were days when i didnt think id care this wasnt one of them look for memory losses hours or even entire nights anything else if someone has been feeding info to the vampires they may not remember it but a good hypnotist will be able to raise the memory the lawyer is screaming about rights and warrants weve only got a warrant for the files not for their minds ask him if he wants to be responsible for tonights murder victim one of his own clients she the lawyers a woman he said how embarrassing and how sexist of me ask her if shes willing to explain to her clients family why she obstructed your investigation the clients wont know unless we let it out he said thats true i said why that would be blackmail ms blake isnt it though i said you had to be a cop in a past life he said youre too devious not to be thanks for the compliment any hypnotists youd recommend alvin thormund wait a sec and ill get his number for you i got out my thin business card holder i tried to only keep cards i wanted to refer to from time to time wed used alvin for several cases of vampire victims with amnesia i gave dolph the number thanks anita let me know what you find out i might be able to identify the vampire involved you want to be there when we put them under i glanced at bert his face was still relaxed pleasant bert at his most dangerous i dont think so just make a recording of the session if i need to ill listen to it later later may mean another body he said your boss giving you trouble again yeah i said you want me to talk to him dolph asked i dont think so he being a real bastard about it the usual okay ill call this thormund and record the sessions ill let you know if we find out anything beep me you got it he hung up i didnt bother to say goodbye dolph never did i handed the phone back to bert he hung it up still staring at me with his pleasant threatening eyes you have to go out for the police tonight no how did we merit this honor cut the sarcasm bert i turned to larry you ready to go kid how old are you he asked bert grinned what difference does it make i asked just answer the question okay i shrugged twentyfour youre only four years older than me dont call me kid i had to smile deal but we better be going we have dead to raise money to make i glanced at bert he was leaning back in his chair bluntfingered hands clasped over his belly he was grinning i wanted to wipe the grin off his face with a fist i resisted the urge who says i have no selfcontrol it was an hour before dawn when all the whos down in whoville were asnooze in their beds without care sorry wrong book if i get to stay awake until dawn i get just a tad slaphappy id been up all night teaching larry how to be a good lawabiding animator i wasnt sure bert would appreciate the last but i knew i would the cemetery was small a family plot with pretensions a narrow twolane road rounded a hill and suddenly there it was a swathe of gravel beside the road you had seconds to decide to turn in that this was it tombstones climbed up the hill the angle was so steep it looked like the coffins should have slid downhill we stood in the dark with a canopy of trees whispering overhead the woods were thick on either side of the road the little plot was just a narrow space beside the road but it was well cared for there were stillliving family members to see to the upkeep i didnt even want to imagine how they mowed the hillside maybe a ropeandpulley system to make sure the mower didnt roll over and add another corpse our last clients of the night had just driven away back to civilization id raised five zombies larry had raised one yeah he could have raised two but we just ran out of darkness it doesnt take that long to raise a zombie at least for me but theres travel time included in four years id only had two zombies in the same cemetery on the same night most of the time you were driving like a maniac to make all the appointments my poor car had been towed to a service station but the insurance people hadnt seen it yet it would take days or weeks for them to tell me it was totaled there hadnt been time to rent a car for the night so larry was driving hed have been with me even if id had the car i was the one bitching about not having enough help so i got to train him it was only fair i guessed the wind rushed through the trees dry leaves scurried across the road the night was full of small hurried noises rushing rushing towards what all hallows eve you could feel halloween on the air i love nights like this larry said i glanced over at him we were both standing with our hands in our pockets staring out into the darkness enjoying the evening we were also both covered in dried chicken blood just a nice normal night my beeper went off the highpitched beep sounded very wrong in the quiet windswept night i hit the button mercifully the noise stopped the little light flashed a phone number at me i didnt recognize the number i hoped it wasnt dolph because an unfamiliar number this late at night or early in the morning meant another murder another body come on we gotta get to a phone who is it im not sure i started down the hill he followed me and asked who do you think it is maybe the police the murders youre working on i glanced back at him and rammed my knee into a tombstone i stood there for a few seconds holding my breath while the pain ran through me shiiit i said softly and with feeling are you all right larry touched my arm i drew away from his hand and he let his hand drop i wasnt much into casual touching im fine truth was it still hurt but what the hell i needed to get to a phone and the pain would get better the more i walked on it honest i stared carefully ahead to avoid other hard objects what do you know about the murders just that youre helping the police on a preternatural crime and that its taking you away from your animating jobs bert told you that mr vaughn yes we were at the car look larry if youre going to work for animators inc youve got to drop all this mr and ms stuff we arent your professors were coworkers he smiled a flash of white in the dark all right ms anita thats better now lets go find a phone we drove into chesterfield on the theory that as the closest town it would have the closest phone we ended up at a bank of pay phones in the parking lot of a closed service station the station glowed softly in the dark but a halogen streetlight beamed over the pay phones turning night into day insects and moths danced around the light the swift flitting shapes of bats swam in and out of the light eating the insects i dialed the number while larry waited in the car give him a point for discretion the phone rang twice then a voice said anita is that you it was irving griswold reporter and friend irving what in blazes are you doing paging me at this hour jeanclaude wants to see you tonight now his voice sounded rushed and uncertain why are you delivering the message i was afraid i wasnt going to like the answer im a werewolf he said whats that got to do with anything you didnt know he sounded surprised know what i was getting angry i hate twenty questions jeanclaudes animal is a wolf that explained stephen the werewolf and the black woman why werent you there the other night irving did he let you off your leash thats not fair he was right it wasnt im sorry irving im just feeling guilty because i introduced the two of you i wanted to interview the master of the city i got my interview was it worth the price i said no comment thats my line he laughed can you come to the circus of the damned jeanclaude has some information on the master vampire that jumped you alejandro thats the one well be there as soon as we can but its going to be damn close to dawn before we can get to the riverfront whos we a new animator im breaking in hes driving i hesitated tell jeanclaude no rough stuff tonight tell him yourself coward yes maam see you as soon as you can get here bye bye irving i held the buzzing receiver for a few seconds then hung up irving was jeanclaudes creature jeanclaude could call wolves the way mr oliver called snakes the way nikolaos had called rats and wererats they were all monsters it was just a choice of flavors i slid back into the car you wanted more experience with vampires right i buckled the seat belt of course larry said well youre going to get it tonight what do you mean ill explain while you drive we dont have much time before dawn larry threw the car in gear and peeled out of the parking lot he looked eager in the dim glow of the dashboard eager and very very young the circus of the damned had closed down for the night or would that be morning it was still dark but there was a wash of lightness to the east as we parked in front of the warehouse an hour earlier and there wouldnt have been a parking place even close to the circus but the tourists leave as the vampires fold down for the night i glanced at larry his face was smeared with dried blood so was mine it hadnt occurred to me until just now to find some place to clean up first i glanced up at the eastern sky and shook my head there was no time dawn was coming the toothed clowns still glowed and twirled atop the marquee but it was a tired dance or maybe i was the one who was tired follow my lead in here larry never forget that they are monsters no matter how human they look they arent dont take off your cross dont let them touch you and dont stare directly into their eyes i know that from class i had two semesters of vampire studies i shook my head class is nothing larry this is the real thing reading about it doesnt prepare you for it we had guest speakers some of them were vampires i sighed and let it go hed have to learn on his own like everybody else did like i had the big doors were locked i knocked the door opened a moment later irving stood there he wasnt smiling he looked like a chubby cherub with soft curling hair in a fringe over his ears and a big bald spot in the middle round wireframed glasses perched on a round little nose his eyes widened a little as we stepped inside the blood looked like what it was in the light what have you been doing tonight he asked raising the dead i said this the new animator larry kirkland irving griswold hes a reporter so everything you say can be used against you hey blake ive never quoted you when you said not to give me that i nodded given hes waiting for you downstairs irving said downstairs i said it is almost dawn he needs to be underground ah sure i said but my stomach clenched tight the last time id gone downstairs at the circus it had been to kill nikolaos there had been a lot of killing that morning a lot of blood some of it mine irving led the way through the silent midway someone had hit the switch and the lights were dull the fronts of the games had been shut and locked down covers thrown over the stuffed animals the scent of corn dogs and cotton candy hung on the air like aromatic ghosts but the smells were dim and tired we passed the haunted house with its lifesize witch on top standing silent and staring with bulging eyes she was green and had a wart on her nose id never met a witch that looked anything but normal they certainly werent green and warts could always be surgically removed the glass house was next the darkened ferris wheel towered over everything i feel like one who treads alone some banquet hall deserted whose lights are fled whose garlands dead and all but he departed i said irving glanced back to me thomas moore oft in the stilly night i smiled i couldnt remember the title to save myself ill just have to agree with you double major journalism and english literature i bet that last comes in handy as a reporter i said hey i slip a little culture in when i can he sounded offended but i knew he was pretending it made me feel better to have irving joking with me it was nice and normal i needed all the nice i could get tonight it was an hour until dawn what harm could jeanclaude do in an hour better not to ask the door in the wall was heavy and wooden with a sign reading authorized personnel only beyond this point for once i wished i wasnt authorized the little room beyond was just a small storage room with a bare light bulb hanging from the ceiling a second door led down the stairs the stairs were almost wide enough for the three of us to walk abreast but not quite irving walked ahead of us as if we still needed leading there was nowhere to go but down prophetic that there was a sharp bend to the stairs there was a brush of cloth the sensation of movement i had my gun out and ready no thought necessary just lots and lots of practice you wont need that irving said says you i thought the master was a friend of yours larry said vampires dont have friends how about junior high science teachers richard zeeman walked around the corner he was wearing a forestgreen sweater with a lighter green and brown forest woven into it the sweater hung down nearly to his knees on me it would have been a dress the sleeves were pushed back over his forearms jeans and the same pair of white nikes completed the outfit jeanclaude sent me up to wait for you why i asked he shrugged he seems nervous i didnt ask questions smart man i said lets keep moving irving said you sound nervous too irving he calls and i obey anita im his animal i reached out to touch irvings arm but he moved away i thought i could play human but hes shown me that im an animal just an animal dont let him do that to you i said he stared at me his eyes filled with tears i cant stop him we better get moving its almost dawn richard said i glared at him for saying it he shrugged itll be better if we dont keep the master waiting you know that i did know that i nodded youre right i dont have any right to get mad at you thanks i shook my head lets do it you can put the gun up he said i stared at the browning i liked having it out for security it beat the hell out of a teddy bear i put the gun away i could always get it out again later at the end of the stairs there was one last doorsmaller rounded with a heavy iron lock irving took out a huge black key and slipped it into the door the lock gave a welloiled click and he pushed it forward irving was trusted with the key to below the stairs how deep was he in and could i get him out wait a minute i said everyone turned to me i was the center of attention great i dont want larry to meet the master or even know who he is anita larry started no larry ive been attacked twice for the information it is definitely on a needtoknow basis you dont need to know i dont need you to protect me he said listen to her irving said she told me to stay away from the master i said i could handle myself i was wrong real wrong larry crossed his arms over his chest a stubborn set to his bloodstained cheeks i can take care of myself irving richard i want a promise on this the less he knows the safer hell be they both nodded doesnt anyone care what i think larry asked no i said dammit im not a child you two can fight later irving said the masters waiting larry started to say something i raised my hand lesson number one never keep a nervous master vampire waiting larry opened his mouth to argue then stopped okay well argue later i wasnt looking forward to later but arguing with larry over whether i was being overprotective beat the hell out of what lay beyond the door i knew that larry didnt but he was about to learn and there wasnt a damn thing i could do to stop it the ceiling stretched upward into the darkness huge drapes of silky material fell in white and black forming cloth walls minimalist chairs in black and silver formed a small conversation group a glass and dark wood coffee table took up the center of the room a black vase with a bouquet of white lilies was the only decoration the room looked halffinished as if it needed paintings hung on the walls but how do you hang paintings on cloth walls i was sure jeanclaude would figure it out eventually i knew the rest of the room was a huge cavernous warehouse made of stone but the only thing left of that was the high ceiling there was even black carpeting on the floor soft and cushioned jeanclaude sat in one of the black chairs he was slumped in the chair ankles crossed hands clasped across his stomach his white shirt was plain just a simple dress shirt except for the fact that the front sides were sheer the line of buttons cuffs and collar was solid but the chest was laid bare through a film of gauze his crossshaped burn was brown and clear against the pale skin marguerite sat at his feet head laid on his knee like an obedient dog her blond hair and pale pink pants suit seemed out of place in the blackandwhite room youve redecorated i said a few comforts jeanclaude said im ready to meet the master of the city i said his eyes widened a question forming on his face i dont want my new coworker to meet the master it seems to be dangerous information right now jeanclaude never moved he just stared at me one hand absently rubbing marguerites hair where was yasmeen in a coffin somewhere tucked safely away from the coming dawn i will take you alone to meet the master he said at last his voice was neutral but i could detect a hint of laughter underneath the words it wasnt the first time jeanclaude had found me funny and it probably wouldnt be the last he stood in one graceful movement leaving marguerite kneeling beside the empty chair she looked displeased i smiled at her and she glared at me baiting marguerite was childish but it made me feel better everyone needs a hobby jeanclaude swept the curtains aside to show darkness i realized then that there was discreet electric light in the room indirect lighting set in the walls themselves there was nothing but the flicker of torches beyond the curtains it was like that one piece of cloth held back the modern world with all its comforts beyond lay stone and fire and secrets best whispered in the dark anita larry called after me he looked uncertain maybe even scared but i was taking the most dangerous thing in the room with me hed be safe with irving and richard i didnt think marguerite was a danger without yasmeen to hold her leash stay here larry please ill be back as soon as i can be careful he said i smiled always he grinned yeah sure jeanclaude motioned me through and i went following the sweep of his pale hand the curtain fell behind us cutting off the light darkness closed around us like a fist torches sparked against the far wall but couldnt touch the swelling dark jeanclaude led the way into the dark we wouldnt want your coworker to overhear us his voice whispered in the dark growing like a wind to beat against the curtains my heart hammered against my rib cage how the hell did he do that save the dramatics for someone you can impress brave words ma petite but i taste your heartbeat in my mouth the last word breathed over my skin as if his lips had passed just over the nape of my neck goosebumps marched down my arms if you want to play games until after dawn thats fine with me but irving told me that you had information on the master vampire that attacked me do you or was it a lie i have never lied to you ma petite oh come on partial truths are not the same thing as lies i guess that depends on where youre sitting i said he acknowledged that with a nod shall we sit against the far wall out of hearing range sure he knelt in the thin circle of a torchs light the light was for my benefit and i appreciated it but no sense telling him that i sat across from him back to the wall so what do you know about alejandro he was staring at me a peculiar look on his face what i asked tell me everything that happened last night ma petite everything about alejandro it was too much like an order for my tastes but there was something in his eyes his face uneasiness almost fear which was silly what did jeanclaude have to fear from alejandro what indeed i told him everything i remembered his face went carefully blank beautiful and unreal like a painting the colors were still there but the life the movement had fled he put one finger between his lips and slowly slid it out of sight the finger came glistening back to the light he extended that wet finger towards me i scooted away from him what are you trying to do wash the blood off of your cheek nothing more i dont think so he sighed the barest of sounds but it slithered over my skin like air you make everything so difficult glad you noticed i need to touch you ma petite i believe alejandro has done something to you what he shook his head something impossible no riddles jeanclaude i believe he has marked you i stared at him what do you mean marked you anita blake marked you with the first mark just as i have i shook my head thats not possible two vampires cant have the same human servant exactly he said he moved towards me let me test the theory ma petite please what does testing the theory mean he said something soft and harsh in french id never heard him curse before it is after dawn and i am tired your questions will make something simple last all bloody day there was real anger in his voice but under that was tiredness and that thread of fear the fear scared me he was supposed to be some untouchable monster monsters werent afraid of other monsters i sighed was it better to just get it over with like a shot maybe all right in the interest of time but give me some idea of what to expect you know i dont like surprises i must touch you to search first for my marks then for his you should not have fallen so easily into his eyes that should not have happened get it over with i said is my touch so repulsive that you must prepare yourself as for pain since that was almost exactly what i was doing i wasnt sure what to say just do it jeanclaude before i change my mind he slid his finger between his lips again do you have to do it that way ma petite please i squirmed against the cool stone wall all right no more interruptions good he knelt in front of me his fingertip traced my right cheek leaving a line of wetness down my skin the dried blood was gritty under his touch he leaned into me as if he was going to kiss me i put my hands on his chest to keep him from touching me his skin was hard and smooth under the gauze of his shirt i jerked away and hit my head against the wall dammit he smiled his eyes glinted blue in the torchlight trust me he moved in lips hovering over my mouth i wont hurt you the words whispered into my mouth a soft push of air yeah right i said but the words came out soft and uncertain his lips brushed mine then pressed gently against my mouth the kiss moved from my lips to my cheek his lips were soft as silk gentle as marigold petals hot as the noonday sun they worked down my skin until his mouth hovered over the pulse in my neck jeanclaude alejandro was alive when the aztec empire was just a dream he whispered it against my skin he was there to greet the spaniards and watch the aztecs fall he has survived when others have died or gone mad his tongue flicked out hot and wet stop it i pushed against him his heart beat against my hands i pushed my hands upward to his throat the big pulse in his throat fluttered against my skin i placed a thumb over the smoothness of one of his eyelids move it or lose it i said my voice was breathy with panic and something worse desire the feel of his body against me under my hands his lips touching mesome hidden part of me wanted it wanted him so i lusted after the master so what nothing new his eyeball trembled under my thumb and i wondered if i could do it could i blank out one of those midnightblue orbs could i blind him his lips moved against my skin teeth brushed my skin the hard brush of fangs rubbed against my throat and the answer was suddenly yes i tensed to press inward and he was gone like a dream or a nightmare he stood in front of me looking down his eyes all dark no white showing his lips had drawn back from his teeth to expose glistening fangs his skin was marblewhite and seemed to glow from inside and still he was beautiful alejandro has given you the first mark ma petite we share you i do not know how but we do two more marks and you are mine three more and you are his would it not be better to be mine he knelt in front of me again but was careful not to touch me you desire me as a woman desires a man is that not better than some stranger taking you by force you didnt ask my permission for the first two marks they werent by choice i am asking permission now let me share with you the third mark no you would rather serve alejandro im not going to serve anyone i said this is a war anita you cannot be neutral why not he stood up and paced a tight circle dont you understand the killings are a challenge to my authority and his marking you is another challenge he will take you from me if he can i dont belong to you or to him what i have tried to get you to believe to accept he will shove down your throat so im in the middle of an undead turf war because of your marks he blinked opened his mouth then closed it finally yes i stood up thanks a lot i walked past him if you have any more info on alejandro send me a letter this will not go away just because you wish it to i stopped in front of the curtain hell i knew that ive wished hard enough for you to leave me alone you would miss me if i were not here dont flatter yourself and do not lie to yourself ma petite i would give you a partnership he will give you slavery if you really believed this partnership crap you wouldnt have forced the first two marks on me you would have asked for all i know the third mark cant be given without my cooperation i stared at him thats it isnt it you need my help or something for the third mark its different from the first two you son of a bitch the third mark without your help would be like rape to making love you would hate me for all eternity if i took you by force i turned my back on him and grabbed the curtain you got that right alejandro will not care if you hate him he wants only to hurt me he will not ask your permission he will simply take you i can take care of myself like you took care last night alejandro had rolled me under and over and i hadnt even known it what protection did i have against something like that i shook my head and jerked back the curtain the light was so bright i was blind i stood in the glare waiting for my eyes to adjust the cool darkness blew against my back the light was hot and intrusive after the darkness but anything was better than whispers in the night blinded by the light or blinded by darkness id take light every time larry was lying on the floor head cradled in yasmeens lap she held his wrists marguerite had pinned his body under her own she was licking the blood off his face with long lingering strokes of her tongue richard lay in a crumpled heap blood running down his face there was something on the floor it writhed and moved grey fur flowed over it like water a hand reached skyward then shrank like a dying flower bones glistening shoving upward through the flesh the fingers shrank flesh rolling over the nubs of raw flesh all that raw meat and no blood the bones slid in and out with wet sucking noises drops of clear fluid spattered the black rug but no blood i drew the browning and moved so i could point it somewhere between yasmeen and the thing on the floor i had my back to the curtain but moved away from it too easy for something to reach through let him go now we havent hurt him yasmeen said marguerite leaned into larrys body one hand cupped his groin massaging anita his eyes were wide skin pale freckles stood out like ink spots i fired a shot inches from yasmeens head the sound was sharp and echoed yasmeen snarled at me i can rip his throat out before you squeeze that trigger again i aimed for marguerites head right over one blue eye you kill him i kill marguerite you willing to make the trade yasmeen what are you doing jeanclaude came in at my back my eyes flicked to him then back to marguerite jeanclaude wasnt the danger not now the thing on the floor rose on four shaky legs and shook itself like a dog after a bath it was a huge wolf thick greybrown fur covered the animal fluffy and dry as if the wolf had been freshly washed and blow dried liquid formed a thick puddle on the carpet bits of clothing were scattered around the wolf had emerged from the mess newly formed reborn a pair of round wireframed glasses sat on the glass and black coffee table neatly folded irving the wolf gave a small halfgrowl halfbark was that a yes i had always known that irving was a werewolf but seeing it was something else entirely until just that moment i hadnt really believed not really staring into the wolfs pale brown eyes i believed marguerite lay on the ground behind larry now her arms wrapped around his chest legs wrapping his waist most of her was hidden behind him shielded i had spent too much time gazing at irving i couldnt shoot marguerite without risking larry yasmeen was kneeling beside them one hand gripping a handful of larrys hair i will snap his neck you will not harm him yasmeen jeanclaude said he stood beside the coffee table the wolf moved up beside him growling softly his fingers brushed the top of the wolfs head call off your dogs jeanclaude or this one dies she stretched larrys throat into one straining pale line to emphasize her point the bandaid that had been hiding his vampire bite had been removed marguerites tongue flicked out touching the straining flesh i was betting that i could shoot marguerite in the forehead while she licked larrys neck but yasmeen could and might break his neck i couldnt take the chance do something jeanclaude i said youre the master of the city shes supposed to take your orders yes jeanclaude order me whats going on here jeanclaude i asked she is testing me why yasmeen wants to be master of the city but she isnt strong enough i was strong enough to keep you and your servant from hearing this ones screams richard called your name and you heard nothing because i kept you from it richard stood just behind jeanclaude blood was smeared from the corner of his mouth there was a small cut on his right cheek that trickled blood down his face i tried to stop her you did not try hard enough jeanclaude said argue amongst yourselves later i said right now we have a problem yasmeen laughed the sound wriggled down my spine like someone had spilled a can of worms i shuddered and decided then and there that id shoot yasmeen first wed find out if a master vampire was really faster than a speeding bullet she released larry with a laugh and stood marguerite still clung to him he got to his hands and knees with the woman riding him like a horse arms and legs still clamped around him she was laughing kissing his neck i kicked her in the face as hard as i could she slid off larry and lay dazed on the floor yasmeen started forward and i fired at heir chest jeanclaude hit my arm and the shot went wide i need her alive anita i jerked away from him shes crazy but he needs my assistance to combat the other masters yasmeen said shell betray you if she can i said but i still need her if you cant control yasmeen then how in the hell are you going to fight alejandro i dont know he said is that what you wanted to hear i do not know larry was still huddled by our feet can you get up he looked up at me eyes shiny with unshed tears he used one of the chairs to brace himself and almost fell i grabbed his arm gun still in my right hand come on larry were getting out of here sounds great to me his voice was incredibly breathless straining not to cry we worked our way towards the door me helping larry walk gun still out pointed vaguely at everything in the room go with them richard see them safely to their car and do not fail me again like you did today richard ignored the threat and walked around us to hold the door open we walked through without turning our backs on the vampires or the werewolf when the door closed i let out a breath i hadnt even known i was holding i can walk now larry said i let go of his arm he put a hand against the wall but otherwise seemed okay the first slow tear trailed down his cheek get me out of here i put my gun up it wouldnt help now richard and i both pretended not to notice larrys tears they were very quiet if you hadnt been looking directly at him you wouldnt have known he was crying i tried to think of something to say anything but what could i say he had seen the monsters and they had scared the shit out of him they scared the shit out of me they scared the shit out of everybody now larry knew that maybe it was worth the pain maybe not earlymorning light lay heavy and golden on the street outside the air was cool and misty you couldnt see the river from here but you could feel it that sense of water on the air that made every breath fresher cleaner larry got out his car keys you okay to drive i asked he nodded the tears had dried in thin tracks down his face he hadnt bothered to wipe them away he wasnt crying anymore he was as grimfaced as you could be and still look like an overgrown howdy doody he opened his door and got in sliding across to unlock the passenger side richard stood there the cool wind blew his hair across his face he ran fingers through it to keep it from his face the gesture was achingly familiar phillip had always been doing that richard smiled at me and it wasnt phillips smile it was bright and open and there was nothing hidden in his brown eyes blood had started to dry at the corner of his mouth and on his cheek get out while you still can richard out from what theres going to be an undead war you dont want to be caught in the middle i dont think jeanclaude would let me walk away he said he wasnt smiling when he said it i couldnt decide whether he was handsomer smiling or solemn humans dont do too well in the middle of the monsters richard get out if you can youre human i shrugged some people would argue that not me he reached out to touch me i stood my ground and didnt move away his fingertips brushed the side of my face warm and very alive see you at three oclock this afternoon unless youre going to be too tired i shook my head and his hand dropped away from my face wouldnt miss it i said he smiled again his hair blew in a tangle across his face i kept the front of my own hair cut short enough so that it stayed out of my eyes most of the time layering was a wonderful thing i opened the passenger side door ill see you this afternoon ill bring your costume with me what am i going to be dressed as a civil war bride he said does that mean a hoop skirt probably i frowned and what are you going to be a confederate officer you get to wear pants i said i dont think the dress would fit me i sighed its not that im not grateful richard but hoop skirts arent your style not hardly my offer was grubbies and all the mud we could crawl in the party was your idea id get out of it if i could it might be worth all the trouble just to see you dressed up i get the feeling its a rarity larry leaned across the seat and said can we get a move on i need a cigarette and some sleep ill be right there i turned back to richard but suddenly didnt know what to say see you later he nodded later i got in the car and larry pulled away before i got my seat belt fastened whats the rush i want to get as far away from this place as i can i looked at him he still looked pale you all right no im not all right he looked at me blue eyes bright with anger how can you be so casual after what just happened you were calm after last night you got bitten last night but that was different he said that woman sucked on the bite she his hands clenched the steering wheel so tightly his hands shook you were hurt worse last night what makes this tougher last night was violent but it wasnt perverted the vampires last night wanted something the name of the master the ones tonight didnt want anything they were just being cruel i offered yes cruel theyre vampires larry they arent human they dont have the same rules she would have killed me tonight on a whim yes she would have i said how can you bear to be around them i shrugged its my job and my job too it doesnt have to be larry just refuse to work on vampire cases most of the rest of the animators do he shook his head no i wont give up why not i asked he didnt say anything for a minute he pulled onto headed south how could you talk about a date this afternoon after what just happened you have to have a life larry if you let this business eat you alive youll never make it i studied his face and you never answered my question what question why wont you give up the idea of being a vampire executioner larry hesitated concentrating on driving he suddenly seemed very interested in passing cars we drove under a railroad bridge warehouses on either side many of the windows were broken or missing rust dripped down the bridge overpass nice section of town he said youre avoiding the question why i dont want to talk about it i asked about your family you said they were all alive what about friends you lose a friend to the vamps he glanced at me why ask that i know the signs larry youre determined to kill the monsters because youve got a grudge dont you he hunched his shoulders and stared straight ahead the muscles in his jaws clenched and unclenched talk to me larry i said the town i come from is small fifteen hundred people while i was away at college my freshman year twelve people were murdered by a pack of vampires i didnt know them any of them really i knew them to say hi to but that was it go on he glanced at me i went to the funerals over christmas break all those coffins all those families my dad was a doctor but he couldnt help them nobody could help them i remember the case i said elbert wisconsin three years ago right yes how did you know twelve people is a lot for a single vampire kill it made the papers brett colby was the vampire hunter they got for the job i never met him but my parents told me about him they made him sound like a cowboy riding into town to take down the bad guys he found and killed five vampires he helped the town when nobody else could if you just want to help people larry be a social worker or a doctor im an animator ive got a builtin resistance to vampires i think god meant for me to hunt them geez louise larry dont go on a holy crusade youll end up dead you can teach me i shook my head larry this isnt personal it cant be personal if you let your emotions get in the way youll either get killed or go stark raving mad ill learn anita i stared at his profile he looked so stubborn larry i stopped what could i say what brought any of us into this business maybe his reasons were as good as my own maybe better it wasnt just love of killing like with edward and heaven knew i needed help there were getting to be too many vampires for just little ol me all right ill teach you but you do what i say when i say it no arguments anything you say boss he grinned at me briefly then turned back to the road he looked determined and relieved and young but we were all young once it passes like innocence and a sense of fair play the only thing left in the end is a good instinct for survival could i teach larry that could i teach him how to survive please god let me teach him and dont let him die on me larry dropped me off in front of my apartment building at it was way past my bedtime i got my gym bag out of the back seat didnt want to leave my animating equipment behind i locked and shut the door then leaned in the passenger side door ill see you tonight at five oclock back here larry youre designated driver until i get a new car he nodded if im late getting home dont let bert send you out alone okay he looked at me then his face was full of some deep thought that i couldnt read you think i cant handle myself i knew he couldnt handle himself but i didnt say that out loud its only your second night on the job give yourself and me a break ill teach you how to hunt vampires but our primary job is raising the dead try to remember that he nodded larry if you have bad dreams dont worry i have them too sometimes sure he said he put the car in gear and i had to close the door guess he didnt want to talk anymore nothing wed seen yet would give me nightmares but i wanted larry to be prepared if mere words could prepare anyone for what we do a family was loading up a grey van with coolers and a picnic hamper the man smiled i dont think well get many more days like this i think youre right it was that pleasant small talk that you use with people whose names you dont know but whose faces you keep seeing we were neighbors so we said hello and goodbye to each other but nothing else that was the way i liked it when i came home i didnt want someone coming over to borrow a cup of sugar the only exception i made was mrs pringle and she understood my need for privacy the apartment was warm and quiet inside i locked the door and leaned against it home ah i tossed the leather jacket on the back of the couch and smelled perfume it was flowery and delicate with a powdery undertaste that only the really expensive ones have it wasnt my brand i pulled the browning and put my back to the door a man stepped around the corner from the dining room area he was tall thin with black hair cut short in front long in back the latest style he just stood there leaning against the wall arms crossed over his chest smiling at me a second man came up from behind the couch shorter more muscular blond smiling he sat on the couch hands where i could see them nobody had any weapons or none that i could see who the hell are you a tall black man came out of the bedroom he had a neat mustache and dark sunglasses hid his eyes the lamia stepped out beside him she was in human form in the same red dress as yesterday she wore scarlet high heels today but nothing else had changed weve been waiting for you ms blake who are the men my harem i dont understand they belong to me she trailed red nails down the black mans hand hard enough to leave a thin line of blood he just smiled what do you want mr oliver wants to see you he sent us to fetch you i know where the house is i can drive there on my own oh no weve had to move she said swaying into the room some nasty bounty hunter tried to kill oliver yesterday what bounty hunter had it been edward she waved a hand we were never formally introduced oliver wouldnt let me kill him so he escaped and we had to move it sounded reasonable but where is he now well take you to him weve got a car waiting outside why didnt inger come for me she shrugged oliver gives orders and i follow them a look passed over her lovely facehatred how long has he been your master too long she said i stared at them all gun still out but not pointed at anyone they hadnt offered to hurt me so why didnt i want to put the gun up because id seen what the lamia changed into and it had scared me why does oliver need to see me so soon he wants your answer i havent decided yet whether to give him the master of the city all i know is that i was told to bring you if i dont hell be angry i dont want to be punished ms blake please come with us how do you punish a lamia only one way to find out how does he punish you the lamia stared at me that is a very personal question i didnt mean it to be forget it she swayed towards me shall we go she had stopped just in front of me close enough to touch i was beginning to feel silly with the gun out so i put it up nobody was threatening me a novel approach normally i still would have offered to follow them in my car but my car was dead so if i wanted to meet oliver i had to go with them i wanted to meet oliver i wasnt willing to give him jeanclaude but i was willing to give him alejandro or at least enlist his aid against alejandro i also wanted to know if it was edward who had tried to kill him there werent that many of us in the business who else could it be all right lets go i said i got my leather jacket from the couch and opened the door i motioned them all out the door the men went without a word the lamia last i locked the door behind us they waited politely out in the hall for me the lamia took the tall black mans arm she smiled boys one of you offer the lady your arm blondie and blackhair turned to look at me blackhair smiled i hadnt been with this many smiling people since i bought my last used car they both offered me their arms like in some late movie sorry guys i dont need an escort ive trained them to be gentlemen ms blake take advantage of it there are precious few gentlemen around these days i couldnt argue with that but i also didnt need help down the stairs i appreciate it but im fine as you like ms blake she turned to the two men you two are to take special care of ms blake she turned back to me a woman should always have more than one man i fought the urge to shrug anything you say she gave a brilliant smile and strutted down the hall on her mans arm the two men sort of fell in beside me the lamia spoke back over her shoulder ronald here is my special beau i dont share him sorry i had to smile thats fine im not greedy she laughed a highpitched delighted sound with an edge of giggle to it not greedy oh thats very good ms blake or may i call you anita anitas fine then you must call me melanie sure i said i followed her and ronald down the hall blondie and smiley hovered on either side of me lest i trip and stub my toe wed never get down the stairs without one of us falling i turned to blondie i believe i will take your arm i smiled back at smiley could we have a little room here he frowned but he stepped back i slipped my left hand through blondies waiting arm his forearm swelled under my hand i couldnt tell if he was flexing or was just that musclebound but we all made it down the stairs safely with lonely smiley bringing up the rear the lamia and ronald were waiting by a large black lincoln continental ronald held the door for the lamia then slid into the drivers seat smiley rushed forward to open the door for me how had i known he would usually i complain about things like that but the whole thing was too strange if the worst thing that happened to me today was having overzealous men open doors for me id be doing fine blondie slid into the seat next to me sliding me to the middle of the seat the other one had run around and was getting in the other side i was going to end up sandwiched between them no big surprise the lamia named melanie turned around in her seat propping her chin on her arm feel free to make out on the way theyre both very good i stared into her cheerful eyes she seemed to be serious smiley put his arm across the back of the seat brushing my shoulders blondie tried to take my hand but i eluded him he settled for touching my knee not an improvement im really not into public sex i said i moved blondies hand back to his own lap smileys hand slid around my shoulder i moved up in the seat away from both of them call them off i said boys shes not interested the men scooted back from me as close to their sides of the car as they could get their legs still gently touched mine but at least nothing else was touching thank you i said if you change your mind during the drive just tell them they love taking orders dont you boys the two men nodded smiling my werent we a happy little bunch i dont think ill change my mind the lamia shrugged as you like anita but the boys will be sorely disappointed if you dont at least give them a goodbye kiss this was getting weird cancel that weirder i never kiss on the first date she laughed oh i like it dont we boys all three men made appreciative sounds i had the feeling theyd have sat up and begged if shed told them to arf arf gag me with a spoon we drove south on steep grassy ditches and small trees lined the road identical houses sat up on the hills fences separating the small yards from the next small yard tall trees took up many yards twoseventy was the major highway that ran through st louis but there was almost always a feeling of green nature open spaces the gentle roll of the land was never completely lost we took west heading towards st charles the land opened up on either side to long flat fields corn stretched tall and golden ready to be harvested behind the field was a modern glass building that advertised pianos and an indoor golf range an abandoned sams wholesale and a usedcar lot led up to the blanchette bridge the left side of the road was crisscrossed by waterfilled dikes to keep the land from flooding industry had moved in with tall glass buildings an omni hotel complete with fountain was nearest the road a stand of woods that still flooded too often to be torn down and turned into buildings bordered the lefthand side of the road until the trees met the missouri river trees continued on the other bank as we entered st charles st charles didnt flood so there were apartment buildings strip malls a deluxe pet supermarket a movie theater drug emporium old country buffet and applebys the land vanished behind billboards and red roof inns it was hard to remember that the missouri river was just behind you and this had once been forest hard to see the land for the buildings sitting in the warm car with only the sound of wheels on pavement and the murmur of voices from the front seat i realized how tired i was even stuck between the two men i was ready for a nap i yawned how much farther i asked the lamia turned in her seat bored i havent been to sleep yet i just want to know how much longer the ride is going to take so sorry to inconvenience you she said it isnt much farther is it ronald he shook his head he hadnt said a word since id met him could he talk exactly where are we going they didnt seem to want to answer the question but maybe if i phrased it differently about fortyfive minutes outside of st peters near wentzville i asked she nodded an hour to get there and nearly two hours back which would make it around when i got home two hours of sleep great we left st charles behind and the land reappearedfields on either side behind welltended barbedwire fences cattle grazed on the low rolling hills the only sign of civilization was a gas station close to the highway there was a large house set far back from the road with a perfect expanse of grass stretching to the road horses moved gracefully over the grass i kept waiting for us to pull into one of the gracious estates but we passed them all by we finally turned onto a narrow road with a street sign that was so rusted and bent that i couldnt read it the road was narrow and instant rustic ditches crowded in on either side grass weeds the years last goldenrod grew headhigh and gave the road a wild look a field of beans gone dry and yellow waited to be harvested narrow gravel driveways appeared out of the weeds with rusted mailboxes that showed that there were houses but most of the houses were just glimpses through the trees barn swallows dipped and dived over the road the pavement ended abruptly spilling the car onto gravel gravel pinged and clattered under the car wooded hills crowded the gravel road there was still an occasional house but they were getting few and far between where were we going the gravel ended and the road was only bare reddish dirt with large reddish rocks studded in it deep ruts swallowed the cars tires the car bounced and fought its way down the dirt it was their car if they wanted to ruin it driving over wagon tracks that was their business finally even the dirt road ended in a rough circle of rock some of the rocks were nearly as big as the car the car stopped i was relieved that there were some things even ronald wouldnt drive a car over the lamia turned around to face me she was smiling positively beaming she was too damn cheerful something was wrong nobody was this cheery unless they wanted something something big what did the lamia want what did oliver want she got out of the car the men followed her like welltrained dogs i hesitated but id come this far might as well see what oliver wanted i could always say no the lamia took ronalds arm again in high heels on the rocky ground it was a sensible precaution i in my little nikes didnt need help blondie and smiley offered an arm apiece i ignored them enough of this playacting i was tired and didnt like being dragged to the edge of the world even jeanclaude had never dragged me to some forsaken backwoods area he was a city boy of course oliver had struck me as a city boy too shows that you cant judge a vampire by one meeting the rocky ground led up to a hillside more boulders had crashed down the side of the hill to lie in crumbled broken heaps ronald actually picked melanie up and carried her over the worst of the ground i stopped the men before they could offer i can make it myself thanks anyway they looked disappointed the blond said melanie has told us to look after you if you trip and fall in the rocks shell be unhappy with us the brunette nodded ill be fine boys really i went ahead of them not waiting to see what theyd do the ground was treacherous with small rocks i scrambled over a rock bigger than i was the men were right behind me hands extended ready to catch me if i fell id never even had a date who was this paranoid someone cursed and i turned to see the brunette sprawled on the ground i had to smile i didnt wait for them to catch up id had enough nursemaiding and the thought of getting no sleep today had put me in a bad mood our biggest night of the year and i was going to be wasted oliver better have something important to say around a tall pile of rubble was a slash of black opening a cave ronald carried the lamia inside without waiting for me a cave oliver had moved to a cave somehow it didnt fit my picture of him in his modern sunlit study light hovered at the entrance to the cave but a few feet in the darkness was thick i waited at the edge of the light unsure what to do my two caretakers came in behind me they pulled small penlights out of their pockets the beams seemed pitifully small against the darkness blondie took the lead smiley brought up the rear i walked in the middle of their thin strings of light a faint pool followed my feet and kept me from tripping over stray bits of rock but most of the tunnel was smooth and perfect a thin trickle of water took up the center of the floor working its patient way through the stone i stared up at the ceiling lost in darkness all this had been done by water impressive the air was cool and moist against my face i was glad i had the leather jacket on itd never get warm here but itd never get really cold either thats why our ancestors lived in caves yearround temperature control a wide passage branched to the left the deep sound of water gurgled and bumped in the darkness a lot of water blondie ran his light over a stream that filled most of the left passage it was black and looked deep and cold i didnt bring my wading boots i said we follow the main passage smiley said dont tease her the mistress will not like it his face looked very serious in the halflight the blond shrugged then moved his light straight ahead the trickle of water spread in a thin fan pattern on the rock but there was still plenty of dry rock on either side i wasnt going to have to get my feet wet yet we took the lefthand side of the wall i touched it to keep my balance and jerked away the walls were slimy with water and melting minerals smiley laughed at me i guess laughing was allowed i glanced back at him frowning then put my hand back on the wall it wasnt that icky it had just surprised me id touched worse the sound of water thundering from a great height filled the darkness there was a waterfall up ahead i didnt need my eyes to tell me that how tall do you think the waterfall is blondie asked the thundering filled the darkness surrounded us i shrugged ten twenty feet maybe more he shone his light on a trickle of water that fell about five inches the tiny waterfall was what fed the thin stream the cave magnifies the sound and makes it sound like thunder he said neat trick i said a wide shelf of rock led in a series of tiny waterfalls up to a wide base of stone the lamia sat on the edge of the shelf highheeled feet dangling over the edge maybe a rise of eight feet but the ceiling soared overhead into blackness that was what made the water echo ronald stood at her back like a good bodyguard hands clasped in front of him there was a wide opening near them that led farther into the cave towards the source of the little stream blondie climbed up and offered me a hand wheres oliver just ahead the lamia said there was an edge of laughter to her voice as if there was some joke i wasnt getting it was probably going to be at my expense i ignored blondies hand and made it up to the shelf by myself my hands were covered with a thin coat of pale brown mud and water a perfect recipe for slime i fought the urge to wipe them on my jeans and knelt by the small pool of water that fed the waterfalls the water was icecold but i washed my hands in it and felt better i dried them on my jeans the lamia sat with her men grouped around her as if they were posing for a family photo they were waiting on someone oliver where was he wheres oliver im afraid he wont be coming the voice came from ahead of me farther into the cave i stepped back but couldnt go far without stepping off the edge the two flashlights turned on the opening like tiny spotlights alejandro stepped into the thin beam of lights you wont be meeting oliver tonight ms blake i went for my gun before anything else could happen the lights went out and i was left in the absolute dark with a master vampire a lamia and three hostile men not one of my better days i dropped to my knees gun ready close to my body the darkness was thick as velvet i couldnt see my hand in front of my face i closed my eyes trying to concentrate on hearing there the scrape of shoes on stone the movement of air as someone moved closer to me i had thirteen silver bullets we were about to find out if silver would hurt a lamia alejandro had already taken a silver bullet in the chest and didnt look much the worse for it i was in very deep shit the footsteps were almost on top of me i could feel the body close to me i opened my eyes it was like looking inside a ball of ebonite utterly black but i could feel someone standing over me i raised the gun to gut or lower chest level and fired still on my knees the flashes were like lightning in the darkness blueflame lightning smiley fell backwards in the flash of light i heard him fall over the edge then nothing nothing but darkness hands grabbed my forearms and i hadnt heard a thing it was alejandro i screamed as he dragged me to my feet your little gun cannot hurt me he said his voice was soft and close he hadnt taken my gun away he wasnt afraid of it he should have been i have offered melanie her freedom once oliver and the citys master are dead i offer you eternal life eternal youth and you may live you did give me the first mark tonight i will give you the second he said his voice was soft and ordinary compared to jeanclaudes but the intimacy of the dark and his hands on me made the words more than they should have been and if i dont want to be your human servant then i will take you anyway anita your loss will damage the master it will lose him followers confidence oh yes anita i will have you join with me willingly and it will be pleasure fight me and it will be agony i used his voice to aim the gun at his throat if i could sever his spine a thousand years and more old or not he might die might please god i fired the bullet took him in the throat he jerked backwards but didnt let go of my arms two more bullets into his throat one into his jaw and he threw me away from him shrieking i ended on my back in the icecold water a flashlight cut through the dark blondie stood there a perfect target i fired at it and the light went out but there was no scream id rushed the shot and missed damn i couldnt climb down the rock in the dark id fall and break a leg so the only way left was deeper into the cave if i could get there alejandro was still screaming wordless ragefilled the screams echoed and bounced on the rock walls until i was deaf as well as blind i scrambled through the water putting a wall at my back if i couldnt hear them maybe they couldnt hear me get that gun away from her the lamia said she had moved and seemed to be beside the wounded vampire i waited in the dark for some clue that they were coming for me there was a rush of cool air against my face it wasnt them moving was i that close to the opening that led deeper into the cave could i just slip away in the dark not knowing if there were pits or water deep enough to drown in didnt sound like a good idea maybe i could just kill them all here fat chance through the echoes of alejandros shrieks was another sound a highpitched hissing like that of a giant snake the lamia was shapechanging i had to get away before she finished water splashed almost on top of me i looked up and there was nothing to see just the solid blackness i couldnt feel anything but the water splashed again i pointed up and fired the flash of light revealed ronalds face the dark glasses were gone his eyes were yellow with slitted pupils i saw all that in the lightning flash of the gun i fired twice more into that sliteyed face he screamed and fangs showed below his teeth god what was he whatever ronald was he fell backwards i heard him hit the water in a splash that was much too loud for the shallow pool i didnt hear him move after he fell was he dead alejandros screams had stopped was he dead too was he creeping closer was he even now almost on top of me i held the gun out in front of me and tried to feel something anything in the darkness something heavy dragged across the rock my stomach clenched tight the lamia shit that was it i eased my shoulder around the corner into the opening i crept along on knees and one hand i didnt want to run if i didnt have to id brain myself on a stalactite or drop into some bottomless pit alright maybe not bottomless but if i fell thirty feet or so it wouldnt have to be bottomless dead is dead icy water soaked through my jeans and shoes the rock was slick under my hand i crawled as fast as i could hand searching for some dropoff some danger that my eyes couldnt see the heavy sliding sound filled the blackness it was the lamia shed already changed would her scales be quicker over the slick rocks or would i be quicker i wanted to get up and run run as far and as fast as i could my shoulders tightened with the need to get away a loud splash announced shed entered the water she could move faster than i could crawl i was betting on that and if i ran and fell or knocked myself silly well better to have tried than to be caught crawling in the cold like a mouse i scrambled to my feet and started to run i kept my left hand out in front of me to protect my face but the rest i left to chance i couldnt see shit i was running full out blind as a bat my stomach tight with anticipation of some pit opening up under my feet the sounds of sliding scales was getting farther away i was outrunning her great a piece of rock slammed into my right shoulder the impact spun me into the other wall my arm was numb from shoulder to fingertips id dropped the gun three bullets left but that had been better than nothing i leaned into the wall cradling my arm waiting for the feeling to return wondering if i could find my gun in the dark wondering if i had time a light bobbed towards me down the tunnel blondie was coming risking himself if id had my gun but i didnt have my gun i could have broken my arm ramming into that ledge the feeling was coming back in a painful wash of prickles and a throbbing ache where the rock had hit me i needed a flashlight what if i hid and got blondies light i had two knives as far as i knew blondie wasnt armed it had possibilities the light was going slowly sweeping from side to side i had time maybe i got to my feet and felt for the rock that had nearly taken my arm off it was a shelf with an opening behind it cool air blew against my face it was a small tunnel it was shoulder level to me which made it about face level for blondie perfect i placed my hands palm down and pushed up my right arm protested but it was doable i crawled into the tunnel hands out in front searching for stalactites or more rock shelves nothing but small empty space if id been much bigger i wouldnt have fit at all hurray for being petite i got out the knife for my left hand the right was still trembling i was better righthanded like most righthanded people but i practiced lefthanded tooever since a vampire broke my right arm and using my left had been the only thing that saved me nothing like near death to get you to practice i crouched on my knees in the tunnel knife gripped using my right hand for balance i would only get one chance at this i had no illusions about my chances against an athletic man who outweighed me by at least a hundred pounds if the first rush didnt work hed beat me to a pulp or give me to the lamia id rather be beaten i waited in the dark with my knife and prepared to slit someones throat not pretty when you think of it that way but necessary wasnt it he was almost here the thin penlight looked bright after the darkness if he shone the light in the direction of my hiding place before he got beside it i was sunk or if he passed close to the lefthand side of the tunnel and not under me stop it the light was almost underneath me i heard his feet wade through the water coming closer he was hugging the righthand side of the wall just like i wanted him to his pale hair came into sight nearly even with my knees i moved forward and he turned his mouth made a little o of surprise then the blade plunged into the side of his neck fangs flicked from behind his teeth the blade snicked on his spine i grabbed his long hair in my right hand bowing his neck and tore the knife out the front of his throat blood splashed outward in a surprised shower the knife and my left hand were slick with it he fell to the tunnel floor with a loud splash i scrambled off the ledge and landed beside his body the light had rolled into the water still glowing i fished it out lying almost under blondies hand was the browning it was wet but that didnt matter you could shoot most modern guns underwater and they worked fine that was one of the things that made terrorism so easy blood turned the stream dark i shone the light back down the tunnel the lamia was framed in the small light her long black hair spilled over her pale upper body her breasts were high and prominent with deep nearly reddish nipples from the waist down she was ivorywhite with zigzags of pale gold the long belly scales were white speckled with black she reared on that long hard tail and flicked her forked tongue at me alejandro stood up behind her covered in blood but walking moving i wanted to shout why dont you die but it wouldnt help maybe nothing would help the lamia pushed onward down the tunnel the gun had killed her men with their fangs ronald with his snake eyes i hadnt tried it on her yet what did i have to lose i kept the light on her pale chest and raised the gun i am immortal your little bullets will not harm me come a little closer and lets test the theory i said she slid towards me arms moving as if in time with legs her whole body moved with the muscular thrusts of the tail it looked curiously natural alejandro stayed leaning against the wall he was hurt yippee i let her get within ten feet close enough to hit her far enough away to run like hell if it didnt work the first bullet took her just above the left breast she staggered it hit her but the hole closed like water smooth and unblemished she smiled i raised the gun just a little and fired just above the bridge of her perfect nose again she staggered but the hole didnt even bleed it just healed normal bullets had about as much effect on vampires i put the gun in the shoulder holster turned and ran a wide crack led off from the main tunnel id have to take off my jacket to squeeze through the last thing i wanted was to get stuck with the lamia able to work her way through to me i stayed with the main tunnel the tunnel was smooth and straight as far as i could see shelves projected out at angles some with water trickling out of them but crawling on my belly with a snake after me wasnt my idea of a good time i could run faster than she could move snakes even giant snakes just werent that fast as long as i didnt hit a dead end id be fine god i wished i believed that the stream was ankledeep now the water was so cold i had trouble feeling my feet running helped concentrating on my body moving running trying not to fall trying not to think about what was behind me the real trick would be was there another way out if i couldnt kill them and couldnt get past them and there was only one way out i was going to lose i kept running i did four miles three times a week plus a little extra i could keep running besides what choice did i have the water was filling the passageway and growing deeper i was kneedeep in water it was slowing me down could she move faster in water than i could i didnt know i just didnt know a rush of air blew against my back i turned and there was nothing there the air was warm and smelled faintly of flowers was it the lamia did she have other ways of catching me besides just chasing no lamias could perform illusions only on men that was their power i wasnt male so i was safe the wind touched my face gently warm and fragrant with a rich green smell like freshly dug roots what was happening anita i whirled but there was no one there the circle of light showed only tunnel and water there was no sound but the lapping of water yet the warm wind blew against my cheek and the smell of flowers was growing stronger suddenly i knew what it was i remembered being chased up the stairs by a wind that couldnt have been there the glow of blue fire like freefloating eyes the second mark it had been different no smell of flowers but i knew that was it alejandro didnt have to touch me to give me the mark no more than jeanclaude had i slipped on the slick stones and fell neckdeep in water i scrambled to my feet thighdeep in water my jeans were soaked and heavy i sloshed forward trying to run but the water was too deep for running itd be quicker to swim i dove into the water flashlight grasped in one hand the leather jacket dragged at me slowed me down i stood up and stripped it off and let it float with the current i hated to lose the jacket but if i survived i could buy more i was glad i was wearing a longsleeved shirt and not a sweater it was too damn cold to strip down anymore it was faster swimming the warm wind tickled down my face hot after the chill of the water i dont know what made me look behind me just a feeling two pinpoints of blackness were floating towards me in the air if blackness could burn then thats what it was black flame coming for me on the warm flowerscented breeze a rock wall loomed ahead the stream ran under it i held onto the wall and found there was maybe an inch of air space between the water and the roof of the tunnel it looked like a good way to drown i treaded water and shone the flashlight around the passage there a narrow shelf of rock to climb out on and blessed be another tunnel a dry one i pulled myself up on the shelf but the wind hit me like a warm hand it felt good and safe and it was a lie i turned and the black flames hovered over me like demonic fireflies anita accept it go to hell i pressed my back to the wall surrounded by the warm tropical wind please dont do this but it was a whisper the flames descended slowly i hit at them the flames passed through my hands like ghosts the smell of flowers was almost chokingly sweet the flames passed into my eyes and for an instant i could see the world through bits of colored flame and a blackness that was a kind of light then nothing my vision was my own the warm breeze died slowly away the scent of flowers clung to me like some expensive perfume there was the sound of something large moving in the dark i brought the flashlight up slowly into the darkskinned face of a nightmare straight black hair was cut short and smooth around a thin face golden eyes with pupils like slits stared at me unblinking immobile his slender upper body dragged his useless lower body closer to me from the waist down he was all translucent skin you could still see his legs and genitals but they were all blending together to form a rough snakelike shape where do little lamias come from when there are no male lamias i stared at what had once been a human being and screamed he opened his mouth and fangs flicked into sight he hissed and spit dribbled down his chin there was nothing human left in those slitted eyes the lamia was more human than he was but if i was changing into a snake maybe id be crazy too maybe crazy was a blessing i drew the browning and fired pointblank into his mouth he jerked back shrieking but no blood no dying dammit there was a scream from farther away echoing towards us raju the lamia was screaming for her mate or warning him anita dont hurt him this from alejandro at least he had to yell he couldnt whisper in my mind anymore the thing pulled itself towards me mouth gaping fangs straining tell him not to hurt me i yelled back the browning was safely in its holster and i was out of bullets anyway flashlight in one hand knife in the other i waited if they got here in time to call him off fine i didnt have much faith in silver knives if silver bullets didnt harm him but i wasnt going down without a fight his hands were bloody from dragging his body over the rocks i never thought id see anything that was worse than being changed into a vampire but there it was crawling towards me it was between me and the dry tunnel but it was moving agonizingly slowly i pressed my back to the wall and got to my feet heitmoved faster definitely after me i ran past it but a hand closed on my ankle yanked me to the ground the creature grabbed my legs and started to pull me towards it i sat up and plunged the knife into its shoulder it screamed blood spilling down its arm the knife stuck in the bone and the monster jerked it out of my hand then it reared back and struck my calf fangs sinking in i screamed and drew the second knife it raised its face blood trickling down its mouth heavy yellow drops clinging to its fangs i plunged the blade into one golden eye the creature shrieked drowning us in echoes it rolled onto its back lower body thrashing hands clawing i rolled with it and pushed the knife in with everything i had i felt the tip of the knife scrape on its skull the monster continued to thrash and fight but it was as hurt as i could make it i left the knife in its eye but jerked the one free of its shoulder raju no i flashed the light on the lamia her pale upper body gleamed wet in the light alejandro was beside her he looked nearly healed id never seen a vampire that could heal that fast i will kill you for their deaths the lamia said no the girl is mine she has killed my mate she must die i will give her the third mark tonight she will be my servant that is revenge enough no she screamed i was waiting for the poison to start working but so far the bite just hurt no burning no nothing i stared at the dry tunnel but theyd just follow me and i couldnt kill them not like this not today but thered be other days i slipped back into the stream there was still only an inch of air space risk drowning or stay and either be killed by a lamia or enslaved by a vampire choices choices i slipped into the tunnel mouth pressed near the wet roof i could breathe i might survive the day miracles do happen small waves began to slosh through the tunnel a wave washed over my face and i swallowed water i treaded water as gently as i could it was my movements that were making the waves i was going to drown myself i stayed very still until the water calmed then took a deep breath hyperventilating to expand the lungs and take in as much air as i could i dunked under the water and kicked it was too narrow for anything but a scissor kick my chest was tight throat aching with the need to breathe i surfaced and kissed rock there wasnt even an inch of air water splashed into my nose and i coughed swallowing more water i pressed as close to the ceiling as i could taking small shallow breaths then under again kicking kicking for all i was worth if the tunnel filled completely before i was through it i was going to die what if the tunnel didnt end what if it was all water i panicked kicking furiously flashlight bouncing crazily off the walls hovering in the water like a prayer please god please dont let me die here like this my chest burned throat bursting with the need to breathe the light was dimming and i realized it was my eyes that were losing the light i was going to pass out and drown i pushed for the surface and my hands touched empty air i took a gasping breath that hurt all the way down there was a rocky shore and one bright line of sunlight there was a hole up in the wall the sunlight formed a misty haze in the air i crawled onto the rock coughing and relearning how to breathe i still had the flashlight and knife in my hands i didnt remember holding onto them the rock was covered in a thin sheet of grey mud i crawled through it towards the rockslide that had opened the hole in the wall if i could make it through the tunnel maybe they could too i didnt wait to feel better i put the knife back in its sheath slid the flashlight in my pocket and started crawling i was covered in mud hands scraped raw but i was at the opening it was a thin crack but through it i could see trees and a hill god it looked good something surfaced behind me i turned alejandro rose from the water into the sunlight his skin burst into flame and he shrieked diving into the water away from the burning sun burn you son of bitch burn the lamia surfaced i slipped into the crack and stuck i pulled with my hands and pushed with my feet but the mud slid and i couldnt get through i will kill you i wrenched my back and put everything i had into wriggling free of that damn hole the rock scraped along my back and i knew i was bleeding i fell out onto the hill and rolled until a tree stopped me the lamia came to the crack sunlight didnt hurt her she struggled to get through tearing at the rock but her ample chest wasnt going to fit her snake body might be narrowable but the human part wasnt but just in case i got to my feet and started down the hill it was steep enough that i had to walk from tree to tree trying not to fall down the hill the whoosh of cars was just ahead a road a busy one by the sound of it i started to run letting the momentum of the hill take me faster and faster towards the sounds of cars i could glimpse the road through the trees i stumbled out onto the edge of the road covered in grey mud slimy wet to the bone shivering in the autumn air id never felt better two cars wheezed by ignoring my waving arms maybe it was the gun in the shoulder holster a green mazda pulled up and stopped the driver leaned across and opened the passenger side door hop in it was edward i stared into his blue eyes and his face was as blank and unreadable as a cats and just as selfsatisfied i didnt give a damn i slid into the seat and locked the door behind me where to he asked home you dont need a hospital i shook my head you were following me again he smiled i lost you in the woods city boy i said his smile widened no namecalling you look like you flunked your girl scout exam i started to say something then stopped he was right and i was too tired to argue i was sitting on the edge of my bathtub in nothing but a large beach towel i had showered and shampooed and washed the mud and blood down the drain except for the blood that was still seeping out of the deep scrape on my back edward held a smaller towel to the cut putting pressure on it when the bleeding stops ill bandage it up for you he said thanks i seem to always be patching you up i glanced over my shoulder at him and winced ive returned the favor he smiled true the cuts on my hands had already been bandaged i looked like a tan version of the mummys hand he touched the fang marks on my calf gently this worries me me too theres no discoloration he looked up at me no pain none it wasnt a full lamia maybe it wasnt that poisonous besides you think anywhere in st louis is going to have lamia antivenom theyve been listed extinct for over two hundred years edward palpated the wound i cant feel any swelling its been over an hour edward if poison was going to kick in it would have by now yeah he stared at the bite just keep an eye on it i didnt know you cared i said his face was blank empty it would be a lot less interesting world without you in it the voice was flat unemotional it was like he wasnt there at all yet it was a compliment from edward it was a huge compliment gee whiz edward contain your excitement he gave a small smile that left his eyes blue and distant as winter skies we were friends of a sort good friends but i would never really understand him there was too much of edward that you couldnt touch or even see i used to believe that if it came to it hed kill me if it were necessary now i wasnt sure how could you be friends with someone who you suspected might kill you another mystery of life the bleedings stopped he said he smeared antiseptic on the wound then started taping bandages in place the doorbell rang what time is it i asked three oclock shit what is it i have a date coming over you have a date i frowned at him its not that big a deal edward was grinning like the proverbial cat he stood up youre all fixed up ill go let him in edward be nice me nice all right just dont shoot him i think i can manage that edward walked out of the bathroom to let richard in what would richard think being met at the door by another man edward certainly wasnt going to help matters hed probably offer him a seat without explaining who he was i wasnt even sure i could explain that this is my friend the assassin nope a fellow vampire slayer maybe the bedroom door was closed so i could get dressed in privacy i tried to put on a bra and found that my back hurt a lot no bra that limited what i could wear unless i wanted to give richard more of a looksee than i had planned on i also wanted to keep an eye on the bite wound so pants were out most of the time i slept in oversize tshirts and slipping on a pair of jeans was my idea of a robe but i did own one real robe it was comfortable a nice solid black silky to the touch and absolutely not seethrough a black silk teddy went with it but i decided that was a little friendlier than i wanted to be besides the teddy wasnt comfortable lingerie seldom is i pulled the robe out of the back of my closet and slipped it on it was smooth and wonderful next to my skin i crossed the front so the bordered edge was high up on my chest and tied the black belt tight in place didnt want any slippage i listened at the door for a second and heard nothing no talking no moving around nothing i opened the door and walked out richard was sitting on the couch with an armful of costumes hung over the back edward was making coffee in the kitchen like he owned the place richard turned at my entrance his eyes widened just a little the hair still damp from the shower and the slinky robewhat was he thinking nice robe edward said it was a present from an overly optimistic date i like it richard said no smart remarks or you can just leave his eyes flicked to edward did i interrupt something hes a coworker nothing more i frowned at edward daring him to say anything he smiled and poured coffee for all three of us lets sit at the table i said i dont drink coffee on a white couch edward sat the mugs on the small table he leaned against the cabinets leaving the two chairs for us richard left his coat on the couch and sat down across from me he was wearing a bluishgreen sweater with darker blue designs worked across the chest the color brought out the perfect brown of his eyes his cheekbones seemed higher a small bandaid marred his right cheek his hair had gentle auburn highlights wondrous what the right color can do for a person the fact that i looked great in black had not escaped my notice from the look on richards face he was noticing but his eyes kept slipping back to edward edward and i were out hunting down the vampires that have been doing the killings his eyes widened did you find out anything i looked at edward he shrugged it was my call richard hung around with jeanclaude was he jeanclaudes creature i didnt think so but then again caution is always better if i was wrong id apologize later if i was right id be disappointed in richard but glad i hadnt told lets just say we lost today youre alive edward said he had a point did you almost die today richards voice was outraged what could i say its been a rough day he glanced at edward then back to me how bad was it i motioned my bandaged hands at him scrapes and cuts nothing much edward hid a smile in his coffee mug tell me the truth anita richard said i dont owe you any explanations my voice sounded just a tad defensive richard stared down at his hands then looked up at me there was a look in his eyes that made my throat tight youre right you dont owe me anything i found an explanation slipping out of my mouth you might say i went caving without you what do you mean i ended up going through a waterfilled tunnel to escape the bad guys how waterfilled all the way to the top you could have drowned he touched my hand with his fingertips i sipped coffee and moved my hand away from his but i could feel where he had touched me like a lingering smell but i didnt drown thats not the point he said yes i said it is if youre going to date me you have to get used to the way i work he nodded youre right youre right his voice was soft it just caught me off guard you nearly died today and youre sitting there drinking coffee like its ordinary for me it is richard if you cant deal with that maybe we shouldnt even try i caught edwards expression what are you grinning at your suave and debonair way with men if youre not going to be helpful then leave he put his mug down on the counter ill leave you two lovebirds alone edward i said im going i walked him to the door thanks again for being there even if you were following me he pulled out a plain white business card with a phone number done in black on it that was all no name no logo but what would have been appropriate a bloody dagger or maybe a smoking gun if you need me call this number edward had never given me a number before he was like the phantomthere when he wanted to be or not there as he chose a number could be traced he was trusting me a lot with the number maybe he wouldnt kill me thank you edward one bit of advice people in our line of work dont make good significant others i know that whats he do for a living hes a junior high science teacher i said edward just shook his head good luck with that parting shot he left i slipped the business card into the robe pocket and went back to richard he was a science teacher but he also hung out with the monsters hed seen it get messy and it hadnt fazed him much could he handle it could i one date and i was already borrowing trouble that might never come up we might dislike each other after only one evening together id had it happen before i stared at the back of richards head and wondered if the curls could be as soft as they looked instant lust embarrassing but not that uncommon all right it was uncommon for me a sharp pain ran up my leg the leg that the lamiathing had bitten please no i leaned against the counter divider richard was watching me puzzled i swept the robe aside the leg was swelling and turning purplish how had i not noticed it did i mention i got bitten by a lamia today youre joking he said i shook my head i think youre going to have to take me to the hospital he stood up and saw my leg god sit down i was starting to sweat it wasnt hot in the apartment richard helped me to the couch anita lamias have been extinct for two hundred years no ones going to have any antivenom i stared at him i guess were not going to get that date no dammit i wont sit here and watch you die lycanthropes cant be poisoned you mean you want to rush me to stephen and let him bite me something like that id rather die something flickered through his eyes something i couldnt read pain maybe you mean that yes a rush of nausea flowed over me like a wave im going to be sick i tried to get up and go for the bathroom but collapsed on the white carpet and vomited blood red and bright and fresh i was bleeding to death inside richards hand was cool on my forehead his arm around my waist i vomited until i was empty and exhausted richard lifted me to the couch there was a narrow tunnel of light edged by darkness the darkness was eating the light and i couldnt stop it i could feel myself begin to float away it didnt hurt i wasnt even scared the last thing i heard was richards voice i wont let you die it was a nice thought the dream began i was sitting in the middle of a huge canopied bed the drapes were heavy blue velvet the color of midnight skies the velvet bedspread was soft under my hands i was wearing a long white gown with lace at the collar and sleeves id never owned anything like it no one had in this century the walls were blue and gold wallpaper a huge fireplace blazed sending shadows dancing around the room jeanclaude stood in the corner of the room bathed in orange and black shadows he was wearing the same shirt id last seen him in the one with the peekaboo front he walked towards me fireshadows shining in his hair on his face glittering in his eyes why dont you ever dress me in anything normal in these dreams he hesitated you dont like the gown hell no he gave a slight smile you always did have a way with words ma petite stop calling me that dammit as you like anita there was something in the way he said my name that i didnt like at all what are you up to jeanclaude he stood beside the bed and unbuttoned the first button of his shirt what are you doing another button and another then he was pulling the shirt out of his pants and letting it slide to the floor his bare chest was only a little less white than my gown his nipples were pale and hard the strand of dark hair that started low on his belly and disappeared into his pants fascinated me he crawled up on the bed i backed away clutching the white gown to me like some heroine in a bad victorian novel i dont seduce this easy i can taste your lust on the back of my tongue anita you want to know what my skin feels like next to your naked body i scrambled off the bed leave me the fuck alone i mean it its just a dream cant you even let yourself lust in a dream its never just a dream with you he was suddenly standing in front of me i hadnt seen him move his arms locked behind my back and we were on the floor in front of the fire fireshadows danced on the naked skin of his shoulders his skin was fragile smooth and unblemishedso soft i wanted to touch it forever he was on top of me his weight pressing against me pushing me into the floor i could feel the line of his body molded against mine one kiss and ill let you up i stared into his midnightblue eyes from inches away i couldnt talk i turned my face away so i wouldnt have to look into the perfection of his face one kiss my word he whispered i turned back to him your word isnt worth shit his face leaned over mine lips almost touching one kiss his lips were soft gentle he kissed my cheek lips brushing down the line of my cheek touching my neck his hair brushed my face i thought that all curly hair was coarse but his was baby fine silken soft one kiss he whispered against the skin of my throat tongue tasting the pulse in my neck stop it you want it stop it now he grabbed a handful of hair forcing my neck backwards his lips had thinned back exposing fangs his eyes were drowning blue without any white at all no i will have you ma petite even if it is to save your life his head came downward striking like a snake i woke up staring at a ceiling i didnt recognize black and white drapes were suspended from the ceiling in a soft fan the bed was black satin with too many pillows thrown all over the place the pillows were all black or white i was wearing a black gown with spaghetti straps it felt like a real silk and fit me perfectly the floor was ankledeep white carpet a black lacquer vanity and chest of drawers were placed at far corners of the room i sat up and could see myself in the mirror my neck was smooth no bite marks just a dream just a dream but i knew better the bedroom had the unmistakable touch of jeanclaude i had been dying of poison how had i gotten here was i underneath the circus of the damned or somewhere else altogether my right wrist hurt there was a white swathe of bandages around my wrist i didnt remember hurting it in the cave i stared at myself in the vanity mirror in the black negligee my skin was white my hair long and black as the gown i laughed i matched the decor i matched the damn decor a door opened behind a white curtain i got a glimpse of stone walls behind the drapes he was wearing nothing but the silky bottoms of mens pajamas he padded towards me on bare feet his bare chest looked like it had in my dream except for the crossshaped scar it hadnt been there in the dream it marred the marble perfection of him made him seem more real somehow hell i said definitely hell what ma petite i was wondering where i was if youre here it has to be hell he smiled he looked entirely too satisfied like a snake that had been wellfed how did i get here richard brought you so i really was poisoned that wasnt part of the dream he sat on the far edge of the bed as far away from me as he could get and still sit down there were no other places to sit im afraid the poison was very real not that im complaining but why arent i dead he hugged his knees to his chest a strangely vulnerable gesture i saved you explain that you know i shook my head say it the third mark i dont have any bite marks but your wrist is cut and bandaged you bastard i saved your life you drank my blood while i was unconscious he gave the slightest nod you son of a bitch the door opened again and it was richard you bastard how could you give me to him she doesnt seem very grateful to us richard you said youd rather die than be a lycanthrope id rather die than be a vampire he didnt bite you youre not going to be a vampire ill be his slave for eternity great choice its only the third mark anita you arent his servant yet thats not the point i stared at him dont you understand id rather you let me die than have done this it is hardly a fate worse than death jeanclaude said you were bleeding from your nose and eyes you were bleeding to death in my arms richard took a few steps towards the bed then stopped i couldnt just let you die his hands reached outward in a helpless gesture i stood up in the silky gown and stared at them both maybe richard didnt know any better but you knew how i felt jeanclaude you dont have any excuses perhaps i could not stand to watch you die either have you thought of that i shook my head what does the third mark mean what extra powers does it give you over me i can whisper in your mind outside of dreams now and you have gained power as well ma petite you are very hard to kill now poison wont work at all i kept shaking my head i dont want to hear it i wont forgive you for this jeanclaude i did not think you would he said he seemed wistful i need clothes and a ride home ive got to work tonight anita youve almost died twice today how can you can it richard i need to go to work tonight i need something thats mine and not his you invasive bastard find her some clothes and take her home richard she needs time to adjust to this new change i stared at jeanclaude still huddled on the corner of the bed he looked adorable and if id had a gun id have shot him on the spot fear was a hard cold lump in my gut he meant to make me his servant whether i liked it or not i could scream and protest and hed ignore it come near me again jeanclaude for any reason and ill kill you three marks bind us now it would harm you too i laughed and it was bitter do you really think i give a damn he stared at me face calm unreadable lovely no he turned his back on us both and said take her home richard though i do not envy you the ride there he glanced back with a smile she can be quite vocal when shes angry i wanted to spit at him but that wouldnt have been enough i couldnt kill him not right then and there so i let it go grace under pressure i followed richard out the door and didnt look back i didnt want to see his perfect profile in the vanity mirror vampires werent supposed to have reflections or souls he had one did he have the other did it matter no i decided it didnt matter at all i was going to give jeanclaude to oliver i was going to give the city to mr oliver i was going to set the master of the city up for assassination one more mark and id be his forever no way id see him dead first even if it meant i died with him no one forced me into anything not even eternity i ended up wearing one of those dresses with the waist that hit you about at the hips the fact that the dress was about three sizes too big didnt help matters the shoes fit even if they were high heels it was better than going barefoot richard turned up the heat in the car because id refused his coat we were fighting and we hadnt even had one date that was a record even for me youre alive he said for the seventieth time but at what price i believe that all life is precious dont you dont go all philosophical on me richard you handed me over to the monsters and they used me dont you understand that jeanclaude has been looking for an excuse to do this to me he saved your life that seemed to be the extent of his argument but he didnt do it to save my life he did it because he wants me as his slave a human servant isnt a slave its almost the opposite hell have almost no power over you but hell be able to talk inside my head invade my dreams i shook my head dont let him sucker you youre being unreasonable he said that was it im the one with my wrist slit open where the master of the city fed he drank my blood richard i know there was something about the way he said it you watched you sick son of a bitch no it wasnt like that how was it i sat with my arms crossed over my stomach glaring at him so that was the hold jeanclaude had on him richard was a voyeur i wanted to make sure he only did enough to save your life what else could he have done he drank my blood dammit richard concentrated on the road suddenly not looking at me he could have raped you i was bleeding from my eyes and nose you said doesnt sound very romantic to me all the blood it seemed to excite him i stared at him youre serious he nodded i sat there feeling cold down to my toes what made you think he was going to rape me you woke up on a black bedspread the first one was white he laid you on it and started to strip down he took your robe off there was blood everywhere he smeared his face in it tasted it another vampire handed him a small gold knife there were more vamps there it was like a ritual the audience seemed to be important he slit your wrist and drank at it but his hands he was touching your breasts i told him that i had brought you so you could live not so he could rape you that must have gone over real big richard was very quiet all of a sudden what he shook his head tell me richard i mean it jeanclaude looked up with blood all over his face and said i have not waited this long to take what i want her to give freely it is a temptation then he looked down at you and there was something in his face anita it was scary as hell he really believes youll come around that youll love him vampires dont love are you sure i glanced at him then away i stared at the window at the daylight that was just now beginning to fade vampires dont love they cant how do you know that jeanclaude does not love me maybe he does as much as he can i shook my head he bathed in my blood he slit my wrist that isnt my idea of love maybe its his then its too damn weird for me fine but admit that he may love you as much as hes able no it scares you to think that he loves you doesnt it i stared out the window as hard as i could i didnt want to be talking about this i wanted to undo this whole damn day or is it something else that youre afraid of i dont know what youre talking about yes you do he sounded so sure of himself he didnt know me well enough to be that certain say it out loud anita say it just once and it wont seem so scary i dont have anything to say youre telling me that no part of you wants him not a piece of you might love him back i dont love him that much im sure of but you are persistent i said yes he said all right im attracted to him is that what you wanted to hear how attracted thats none of your damn business jeanclaude warned me to stay away from you i just want to know if im really interfering if youre attracted to him maybe i should stay out of it hes a monster richard youve seen him i cant love a monster if he was human hes an egotistical controlling bastard but if he was human i sighed if he was human we might work something out but even alive jeanclaude can be such an sob i dont think it would work but youre not even going to try because hes a monster hes dead richard a walking corpse it doesnt matter how pretty he is or how compelling hes still dead i dont date corpses a girls got to have some standards so no corpses he said no corpses what about lycanthropes why you thinking of fixing me up with your friend just curious about where you draw the line lycanthropy is a disease the persons already survived a vicious attack itd be like blaming the rape victim you ever date a shapeshifter its never come up what else wouldnt you date things that were never human to begin with i guess i really havent thought about it why the interest he shook his head just curious why arent i still pissed at you maybe because youre glad to be alive no matter what the cost he pulled into the parking lot of my apartment building larrys car was idling in my parking space maybe i am glad to be alive but ill let you know about the cost when i find out what it really is you dont believe jeanclaude i wouldnt believe jeanclaude if he told me moonlight was silver richard smiled sorry about the date maybe we can try again sometime id like that he said i opened the door and stood shivering in the cool air whatever happens richard thanks for watching out for me i hesitated then said and whatever hold jeanclaudes got on you break it get away from him hell get you killed he just nodded good advice which youre not going to take i said i would if i could anita please believe that what does he have on you richard he shook his head he ordered me not to tell you he ordered you not to date me too he shrugged you better get going youre going to be late for work i smiled besides im freezing my butt off he smiled you do have a way with words i spend too much time hanging around with cops he put the car in gear have a safe night at work ill do my best he nodded i closed the door richard didnt seem to want to talk about what jeanclaude had on him well no rule said we had to play honesty on the first date besides he was right i was going to be late for work i tapped on larrys window ive got to change then ill be right back down who was that dropping you off a date i left it at that it was a much easier explanation than the truth besides it was almost true this is the only night of the year that bert allows us to wear black to work he thinks the color is too harsh for normal business hours i had black jeans and a halloween sweater with huge grinning jack o lanterns in a stomachhigh line i topped it off with a black zipper sweatshirt and black nikes even my shoulder holster and the browning matched i had my backup gun in an inner pants holster i also had two extra clips in my sport bag i had replaced the knife id had to leave in the cave there was a derringer in my jacket pocket and two extra knives one down the spine the other in an ankle holster dont laugh i left the shotgun home if jeanclaude found out id betrayed him hed kill me would i know when he died would i feel it something told me that i would i took the card that karl inger had given me and called the number if it had to be done it best be done quickly hello is this karl inger yes it is who is this its anita blake i need to speak with oliver have you decided to give us the master of the city yes if youll hold for a moment ill fetch mr oliver he laid the receiver down i heard him walking away until there was nothing but silence on the phone better than muzak footsteps coming back then hello ms blake so good of you to call i swallowed and it hurt the master of the city is jeanclaude i had discounted him he isnt very powerful he hides his powers trust me hes a lot more than he seems why the change of heart ms blake he gave me the third mark i want free of him ms blake to be bound thrice to a vampire and then have that vampire die can be quite a shock to the system it could kill you i want free of him mr oliver even if you die he said even if i die i would have liked to have met you under different circumstances anita blake you are a remarkable person no ive just seen too much i wont let him have me i will not fail you ms blake i will see him dead if i didnt believe that i wouldnt have told you i appreciate your confidence one other thing you should know the lamia tried to betray you today shes in league with another master named alejandro really his voice sounded amused what did he offer her her freedom yes that would tempt melanie i keep her on such a short rein shes been trying to breed did you know that what do you mean i told him about the men especially the last one that had been nearly changed he was quiet for a moment i have been most inattentive i will deal with melanie and alejandro fine id appreciate a call tomorrow to let me know how things went to be sure hes dead oliver said yes i said youll get a call from karl or myself but first where can we find jeanclaude the circus of the damned how appropriate thats all i can tell you thank you ms blake and happy halloween i had to laugh its going to be a hell of a night he chuckled softly indeed goodbye ms blake the phone went dead in my hand i stared at the phone id had to do it had to so why did my stomach feel tight why did i have the urge to call jeanclaude and warn him was it the marks or was richard right did i love jeanclaude in some strange twisted way god help me i hoped not it was full dark on all hallows eve larry and i had made two appointments hed raised one and id raised the other he had one more to go and i had three a nice normal night what larry was wearing was not normal bert had encouraged us to wear something fitting for the holiday id chosen the sweater larry had chosen a costume he was wearing blue denim overalls a white dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up a straw hat and work boots when asked hed said im huck finn dont i fit the part with his red hair and freckles he did fit the part there was blood on the shirt now but it was halloween there were a lot of people out with fake blood on them we fit right in tonight my beeper went off i checked the number and it was dolph damn who is it larry asked the police weve got to find a phone he glanced at the dashboard clock were ahead of schedule how about the mcdonalds just off the highway great i prayed that it wasnt another murder i needed a nice normal night at the back of my head like a bit of remembered song two sentences kept playing jeanclaude is going to die tonight you set him up it seemed wrong to kill him from a safe distance to not look him in the eyes and pull the trigger myself to not give him a chance to kill me first fair play and all that fuck fair play it was him or me wasnt it larry parked in the mcdonalds lot im gonna get a coke while you call in you want something i shook my head you all right sure im just hoping its not another murder jesus i hadnt thought of that we got out of the car larry went into the dining room i stayed in the little entrance area with the pay phone dolph picked up on the third ring sergeant storr its anita whats up we finally broke the paralegal that was feeding information to the vampires great i thought it might be another murder not tonight the vamps got more important business whats that supposed to mean hes planning on getting every vampire in the city to slaughter humans for halloween he cant only the master of the city could do that and then only if he was incredibly powerful thats what i thought could be the vampires crazy i had a thought an awful thought you got a description of the vampire vampires he said read it to me i heard paper rustling then short dark very polite saw one other vampire twice with the boss vamp he was medium height indian or mexican longish black hair i clutched the phone so tight my hand trembled did the vampire say why he was going to slaughter humans wanted to discredit legalized vampirism now isnt that a weird motive for a vampire yeah i said dolph this could happen what are you saying if this master vampire could kill the master of the city and take over before dawn he might pull it off what can we do i hesitated almost telling him to protect jeanclaude but it wasnt a matter for the police they had to worry about laws and police brutality there was no way to take something like oliver alive whatever was going to happen tonight had to be permanent talk to me anita ive gotta go dolph you know something tell me i hung up i also turned off my beeper i dialed circus of the damned a pleasantvoiced woman answered circus of the damned where all your nightmares come true i need to speak to jeanclaude its an emergency hes busy right now may i take a message i swallowed hard tried not to yell this is anita blake jeanclaudes human servant tell him to get his ass to the phone now i people are going to die if i dont talk to him okay okay she put me on hold with a butchered version of high flying by tom petty larry came out with his coke whats up i shook my head i fought the urge to jump up and down but that wouldnt get jeanclaude to the phone any sooner i stood very still hugging one arm across my stomach what had i done please dont let it be too late ma petite thank god what has happened just listen theres a master vampire on his way to the circus i gave him your name and your resting place his name is mr oliver and hes older than anything hes older than alejandro in fact i think hes alejandros master its all been a plan to get me to betray the city to him and i fell for it he was quiet so long that i asked did you hear me you really meant to kill me i told you i would but now you warn me why oliver wants control of the city so he can send all the vampires out to slaughter humans he wants it back to the old days when vampires were hunted he said legalized vampirism was spreading too fast i agree but i didnt know what he meant to do so to save your precious humans you will betray oliver now it isnt like that dammit jeanclaude concentrate on the important thing here theyre on their way they may be there already youve got to protect yourself to keep the humans safe to keep your vampires safe too do you really want them under olivers control no i will take steps ma petite we will at least give him a fight he hung up larry was staring at me with wide eyes what the hell is happening anita not now larry i fished edwards card out of my bag i didnt have another quarter do you have a quarter sure he handed it to me without any more questions good man i dialed the number please be there please be there he answered on the seventh ring edward its anita whats happened how would you like to take on two master vampires older than nikolaos i heard him swallow i always have so much fun when youre around where should we meet the circus of the damned you got an extra shotgun not with me shit meet me out front asap the shits going to really hit the fan tonight edward sounds like a great way to spend halloween see you there bye and thanks for inviting me he meant it edward had started out as a normal assassin but humans had been too easy so he went for vamps and shapeshifters he hadnt met anything he couldnt kill and what was life without a little challenge i looked at larry i need to borrow your car youre not going anywhere without me ive heard just your side of the conversations and im not getting left out i started to argue but there wasnt time okay lets do it he grinned he was pleased he didnt know what was going to happen tonight what we were up against i did and i wasnt happy at all i stood just inside the door of the circus staring at the wave of costumes and glittering humanity id never seen the place so crowded edward stood beside me in a long black cloak with a deathshead mask death dressed up as death funny huh he also had a flamethrower strapped to his back an uzi pistol and heaven knew how many other weapons secreted about his person larry looked pale but determined he had my derringer in his pocket he knew nothing about guns the derringer was an emergency measure only but he wouldnt stay in the car next week if we were still alive id take him out to the shooting range a woman in a bird costume passed us in a scent of feathers and perfume i had to look twice to make sure that it was just a costume tonight was the night when all shapeshifters could be out and people would just say neat costume it was halloween night at the circus of the damned anything was possible a slender black woman stepped up to us wearing nothing but a bikini and an elaborate mask she had to step close to me to be heard over the murmur of the crowd jeanclaude sent me to bring you who are you rashida i shook my head rashida had her arm torn off two days ago i stared at the perfect flesh of her arm you cant be her she raised her mask so i could see her face then smiled we heal fast i had known lycanthropes healed fast but not that fast not that much damage live and learn we followed her swaying hips into the crowd i grabbed hold of larrys hand with my left hand stay right with me tonight he nodded i threaded through the crowd holding his hand like a child or a lover i couldnt stand the thought of him getting hurt no that wasnt true i couldnt stand the thought of him getting killed death was the big boogeyman tonight edward followed at our heels silent as his namesake trusting that hed get to kill something soon rashida led us towards the big striped circus tent back to jeanclaudes office i supposed a man in a straw hat and striped coat said sorry the shows sold out its me perry these are the ones the masters been waiting for she hiked her thumb in our direction the man drew aside the tent flap and motioned us through there was a line of sweat on his upper lip it was warm but i had the feeling it wasnt that kind of sweat what was happening inside the tent it couldnt be too bad if they were letting the crowd in to watch could it the lights were bright and hot i started to sweat under the sweatshirt but if i took it off people would stare at my gun i hated that circular curtains had been rigged to the ceiling creating two curtainedoff areas in the large circus ring spotlights surrounded the two hidden areas the curtains were like prisms with every step we took the colors changed and flowed over the cloth i wasnt sure if it was the cloth or some trick of the lights whatever it was a nifty effect rashida stopped just short of the rail that kept the crowd back jeanclaude wanted everybody to be in costume but were out of time she pulled at my sweater lose the jacket and itll have to do i pulled my sweater out of her hand what are you talking about costumes youre holding up the show drop the jacket and come on she did a long lazy leap over the railing and strode barefoot and beautiful across the white floor she looked back at us motioning for us to follow i stayed where i was i wasnt going anywhere until somebody explained things larry and edward waited with me the audience near us was staring intently waiting for us to do something interesting we stood there rashida disappeared into one of the curtained circles anita i turned but larry was staring at the ring did you say something he shook his head anita i glanced at edward but it hadnt been his voice i whispered jeanclaude yes ma petite it is i where are you behind the curtain where rashida went i shook my head his voice had resonance a slight echo but otherwise it was as normal as his voice ever got i could probably talk to him without moving my lips but if so i didnt want to know i whispered whats going on mr oliver and i have a gentlemans agreement i dont understand who are you talking to edward asked i shook my head ill explain later come into my circle anita and i will explain everything to you at the same time i explain it to our audience what have you done i have done the best i could to spare lives ma petite but some will die tonight but it will be in the circle with only the soldiers called to task no innocents will die tonight whoever wins we have given our words youre going to fight it out in the ring like a show it was the best i could do on such short notice if you had warned me days ago perhaps something else could have been arranged i ignored that besides i was feeling guilty i took off the sweatshirt and laid it across the railing there were gasps from the people near enough to see my gun the fights going to take place out in the ring in front of the audience edward said yep i dont get it larry said i want you to stay here larry no way i took a deep breath and let it out slowly larry you dont have any weapons you dont know how to use a gun youre just cannon fodder until you get some training stay here he shook his head i touched his arm please larry maybe it was the please or the look in my eyeswhatever he nodded i could breathe a little easier whatever happened tonight larry wouldnt die because id brought him into it it wouldnt be my fault i climbed over the railing and dropped to the ring edward followed me with a swish of black cape i glanced back once larry stood gripping the rail there was something forlorn about him standing there alone but he was safe that was what counted i touched the shimmering curtain and it was the lights the cloth was white up close i lifted it to one side and entered edward at my back there was a multilayered dais complete with throne in the center of the circle rashida stood with stephen near the foot of the dais i recognized richards hair and his naked chest before he lifted the mask off his face it was a white mask with a blue star on one cheek he was wearing glittering blue harem pants with a matching vest and shoes everyone was in costume but me i was hoping you wouldnt make it in time richard said what and miss the halloween blowout of all time whos that with you stephen asked death i said edward bowed trust you to bring death to the ball ma petite i looked up the dais to the very top jeanclaude stood in front of the throne he was finally wearing what his shirts hinted at but this was the real thing the real french courtier i didnt know what to call half of the costume the coat was black with tasteful silver here and there a short halfcloak was worn over one shoulder only the pants were billowy and tucked into calfhigh boots lace edged the foldover tops of the boots a wide white collar lay at his throat lace spilled out of the coat sleeves it was topped off by a wide almost floppy hat with a curving arch of black and white feathers the costumed throng moved to either side clearing the stairs up to the throne for me i somehow didnt want to go there were sounds outside the curtains heavy things being moved around more scenery and props being moved up i glanced at edward he was staring at the crowd eyes taking in everything hunting for victims or for familiar faces everyone was in costume but very few people were actually wearing masks yasmeen and marguerite stood about halfway up the stairs yasmeen was in a scarlet sari all veils and sequins her dark face looked very natural in the red silk marguerite was in a long dress with puffed sleeves and a wide lace collar the dress was of some dark blue cloth it was simple unadorned her blond hair was in complicated curls with one large mass over each ear and a small bun atop her head hers like jeanclaudes looked less like a costume and more like antique clothing i walked up the stairs towards them yasmeen dropped her veils enough to expose the crossshaped scar id given her someone will pay you back for this tonight not you personally i asked not yet you dont care who wins do you she smiled i am loyal to jeanclaude of course like hell as loyal as you were ma petite she drew out each syllable biting each sound off i left her to laugh at my back i guess i wasnt the one to complain about loyalties there were a pair of wolves sitting at jeanclaudes feet they stared at me with strange pale eyes there was nothing human in the gaze real wolves where had he gotten real wolves i stood two steps down from him and his pet wolves his face was unreadable empty and perfect you look like something out of the three musketeers i said accurate ma petite is it your original century he smiled a smile that could have meant anything or nothing whats going to happen tonight jeanclaude come stand beside me where my human servant belongs he extended a pale hand i ignored the hand and stepped up hed talked inside my head it was getting silly to argue arguing didnt make it not true one of the wolves growled low in its chest i hesitated they will not harm you they are my creatures like me i thought jeanclaude put his hand down towards the wolf it cringed and licked his hand i stepped carefully around the wolf but it ignored me all its attention on jeanclaude it was sorry it had growled at me it would do anything to make up for it it groveled like a dog i stood at his right side a little behind the wolf i had picked out a lovely costume for you if it was anything that would have matched yours i wouldnt have worn it he laughed soft and low the sound tugged at something low in my gut stay here by the throne with the wolves while i make my speech we really are going to fight in front of the crowd he stood of course this is the circus of the damned and tonight is halloween we will show them a spectacle the likes of which they have never seen this is crazy probably but it keeps oliver from bringing the building down around us could he do that that and much more ma petite if we had not agreed to limit our use of such powers could you bring the building down he smiled and for once gave me a straight answer no but oliver does not know that i had to smile he draped himself over the throne one leg thrown over a chair arm he tucked his hat low until all i could see was his mouth i still cannot believe that you betrayed me anita you gave me no choice you would really see me dead rather than have the fourth mark yep he whispered showtime anita the lights suddenly went off there were screams from the audience as it sat in the sudden dark the curtain pulled back on either side i was suddenly on the edge of the spotlight the light shone like a star in the dark jeanclaude and his wolves were bathed in a soft light i had to agree that my pumpkin sweater didnt exactly fit the motif jeanclaude stood in one boneless movement he swept his hat off and gave a low sweeping bow ladies and gentlemen tonight you will witness a great battle he began to move slowly down the steps the spotlight moved with him he kept the hat off using it for emphasis in his hand the battle for the soul of this city he stopped and the light spread wider to include two blond vampires the two women were dressed as s flappers one in blue the other in red the women flashed fangs and there were gasps from the audience tonight you will see vampires werewolves gods devils he filled each word with something when he said vampires there was a ruffling at your neck werewolves slashed from the dark and there were screams gods breathed along the skin devils were a hot wind that scalded your face gasps and stifled screams filled the dark some of what you see tonight will be real some illusion which is which will be for you to decide illusion echoed in the mind like a vision through glass repeating over and over the last sound died away with a whisper that sounded like a different word altogether real the voice whispered the monsters of this city fight for control of it this halloween if we win then all goes peaceful as before if our enemies win a second spotlight picked out the top of a second dais there was no throne oliver stood at the top with the lamia in full serpent glory oliver was dressed in a baggy white jump suit with large polka dots on it his face was white with a sad smile drawn on it one heavily lined eye dropped a sparkling tear a tiny pointed hat with a bright blue pompom topped his head a clown he had chosen to be a clown it wasnt what i had pictured him in but the lamia was impressive with her striped coils curled around him her naked breasts caressed by his gloved hand if our enemies win then tomorrow night will see a bloodbath such as no city in the world has ever seen they will feed upon the flesh and blood of this city until it is drained dry and lifeless he had stopped about halfway down now he began to come back up the stairs we fight for your lives your very souls pray that we win dear humans pray very very hard he sat in the throne one of the wolves put a paw on his leg he stroked its head absently death comes to all humans oliver said the spotlight died on jeanclaude leaving oliver as the only light in the darkness symbolism at its best you will all die someday in some small accident or long disease pain and agony await you the audience rustled uneasily in their seats are you protecting me from his voice i asked the marks are jeanclaude said what is the audience feeling a sharp pain over the heart age slowing their bodies the quick horror of some remembered accident gasps screams cries filled the dark as olivers words sought out each person and made them feel their mortality it was obscene something that had seen a million years was reminding mere humans how very fragile life was if you must die would it not be better to die in our glorious embrace the lamia crawled around the dais to show herself to all the audience she could take you oh so sweetly soft gentle into that dark night we make death a celebration a joyful passing no lingering doubts you will want her hands upon you in the end she will show you joys that few mortals ever dream of is death such a high price to pay when you will die anyway wouldnt it be better to die with our lips upon your skin than by times slowly ticking clock there were a few cries of yes please stop him i said this is his moment ma petite i cannot stop him i offer you all your darkest dreams come true in our arms my friends come to us now the darkness rustled with movement the lights came up and there were people coming out of the seats people climbing over the railing people coming to embrace death they all froze in the light they stared around like sleepers waking from a dream some looked embarrassed but one man close to the rail looked near tears as if some bright vision had been ripped away he collapsed to his knees shoulders shaking he was sobbing what had he seen in olivers words what had he felt in the air god save us from it with the lights i could see what they had moved in while we waited behind the curtains it looked like a marble altar with steps leading up to it it sat between the two daises waiting for what i turned to ask jeanclaude but something was happening rashida walked away from the dais putting herself close to the railing and the people stephen wearing what looked like a thong bathing suit stalked to the other side of the ring his nearly naked body was just as smooth and flawless as rashidas we heal fast shed said ladies and gentlemen we will give you a few moments to recover yourselves from the first magic of the evening then we will show you some of our secrets the crowd settled back into their seats an usher helped the crying man back to his seat a hush fell over the people i had never heard so large a crowd be so silent you could have dropped a pin vampires are able to call animals to their aid my animal is the wolf he walked around the top of the dais displaying the wolves i stood there in the spotlight and wasnt sure what to do i wasnt on display i was just visible but i can also call the wolfs human cousin the werewolf he made a wide sweeping gesture with his arm music began soft and low at first then rising in a shimmering crescendo stephen fell to his knees i turned and rashida was on the ground as well they were going to change right here in front of the crowd id never seen a shapeshifter shift before i had to admit a certain curiosity stephen was on all fours his bare back was bowed with pain his long yellow hair trailed on the ground the skin on his back rippled like water his spine standing like a ridge in the middle he stretched out his hands as if he were bowing face pressed to the ground bones broke through his hands he groaned things moved under his skin like crawling animals his spine bowed upward as if rising like a tent all on its own fur started to flow out of the skin on his back spreading impossibly fast like a timelapse photo bones and some heavy clear liquid poured out of his skin shapes strained and ripped through his skin muscles writhed like snakes heavy wet sounds came as bone shifted in and out of flesh it was as if the wolfs shape was punching its way out of the mans body fur flowed fast and faster the color of dark honey the fur hid some of the changes and i was glad something between a howl and a scream tore from his throat finally there was that same manwolf form as the night we fought the giant cobra the wolfman threw his muzzle skyward and howled the sound raised the hairs on my body a second howl echoed from the other side i whirled and there was a second wolfman form but this one was as black as pitch rashida the audience applauded wildly stamping and shouting the werewolves crept back to the dais they crouched at the bottom one on each side i have nothing so showy to offer you the lights were back on oliver the snake is my creature the lamia twined around him hissing loud enough to carry to the audience she flicked a forked tongue to lick his whitecoated ear he motioned to the foot of the dais two blackcloaked figures stood on either side hoods hiding their faces these are my creatures but let us keep them for a surprise he looked across at us let it begin the lights went out again i fought the urge to reach for jeanclaude in the thick dark whats happening the battle begins he said how we have not planned the rest of the evening anita it will be like every battle chaotic violent bloody the lights came up gradually until the tent was bathed in a dim glow like dusk or twilight it begins jeanclaude whispered the lamia flowed down the steps and each side ran for the other it wasnt a battle it was a freeforall more like a bar brawl than a war the cloaked things ran forward i had a glimpse of something vaguely snakelike but not a spatter of machinegun fire and the thing staggered back edward i started down the steps gun in hand jeanclaude never moved arent you coming down the real battle will happen up here ma petite do what you can but in the end it will come down to olivers power and mine hes a million years old you cant beat him i know we stared at each other for a moment im sorry i said so am i ma petite anita so am i i ran down the steps to join the fight the snakething had collapsed bisected by the machinegun fire edward was standing back to back with richard who had a revolver in his hands he was shooting it into one of the cloaked things and wasnt even slowing it down i sighted down my arm and fired at the cloaked head the thing stumbled and turned towards me the hood fell backwards revealing a cobras head the size of a horses from the neck down it was a woman but from the neck up neither my shot nor richards had made a dent the thing came up the steps towards me i didnt know what it was or how to stop it happy halloween the thing rushed towards me i dropped the browning and had one of the knives halfway out when it hit me i was on the steps with the thing on top of me it reared back to strike i got the knife free it plunged its fangs into my shoulder i screamed and shoved the knife into its body the knife went in but no blood no pain it gnawed on my shoulder pumping poison in and the knife did nothing i screamed again jeanclaudes voice sounded in my head poison cannot harm you now it hurt like hell but i wasnt going to die from it i plunged the knife into its throat screaming not knowing what else to do it gagged blood ran down my hand i hit it again and it reared back blood on its fangs it gave a frantic hiss and pushed itself off me but i understood now the weak spot was where the snake part met human flesh i groped for the browning lefthanded my right shoulder was torn up i squeezed and watched blood spurt from the things neck it turned and ran and i let it go i lay on the steps holding my right arm against my body i didnt think anything was broken but it hurt like hell it wasnt even bleeding as badly as it should have been i glanced up at jeanclaude he was standing motionless but something moved like a shimmer of heat oliver was just as motionless on his dais that was the real battle the dying down here didnt mean much except to the people who were going to die i cradled my arm against my stomach and walked down the steps towards edward and richard by the time i was at the bottom of the steps the arm felt better good enough to change the gun to my right hand i stared at the bite wound and damned if it wasnt healing the third mark i was healing like a shapeshifter are you all right richard asked i seem to be edward was staring at me you should be dying explanations later i said the cobra thing lay at the foot of the dais its head bisected by machinegun fire edward caught on quick there was a scream high and piercing alejandro had yasmeen twisted around in his arms one arm behind her back his other arm pinning her shoulders to his chest it was marguerite who had screamed she was struggling in karl ingers arms she was outmatched apparently so was yasmeen alejandro tore into her throat she screamed he snapped her spine with his teeth blood splattering his face she sagged in his arms movement and his hand came out through the other side of her chest the heart crushed to a bloody pulp marguerite shrieked over and over again karl let her go but she didnt seem to notice she scratched fingernails down her cheeks until blood ran she collapsed to her knees still clawing at her face jesus i said stop her karl stared across at me i raised the browning but he ducked behind olivers dais i went towards marguerite alejandro stepped between us do you want to help her yes let me lay the last two marks upon you and i will get out of your way i shook my head the city for one crazy human servant i dont think so anita down i dropped flat to the floor and edward shot a jet of flame over my head i could feel the wash of heat bubbling overhead alejandro shrieked i raised my eyes only enough to see him burning he motioned outward with one burning hand and i felt something wash over me back towards edward i rolled over and edward was on his back struggling to his feet the nozzle of the flamethrower was pointed this way again i dropped without being told alejandro motioned and the flame peeled backwards flowing towards edward he rolled frantically to put out the flames on his cloak he threw the burning deathshead mask onto the ground the flamethrowers tank was on fire richard helped him struggle out of it and they ran i hugged the ground hands over my head the explosion shook the ground when i looked up tiny burning pieces were raining down but that was all richard and edward were peering around the other side of the dais alejandro stood there with his clothes charred his skin blistered he began walking towards me i scrambled to my feet pointing my gun at him of course the gun hadnt done a whole lot of good before i backed up until i bumped the steps i started shooting the bullets went in he even bled but he didnt stop the gun clicked on empty i turned and ran something hit me in the back slamming me to the ground alejandro was suddenly on my back one hand in my hair bending my neck backwards put down the machine gun or ill break her neck shoot him i screamed but edward threw the machine gun on the floor dammit he got out a pistol and took careful aim alejandros body jerked then he laughed you cant kill me with silver bullets he put a knee in my back to hold me down then a knife flashed in his hand no richard said he wont kill her ill slit her throat if you interfere but if you leave us alone i wont harm her edward kill him a vampire jumped edward riding him to the ground richard tried to pull her off him but a tiny vampire leaped on his back it was the woman and the little boy from that first night now that your friends are busy we will finish our business no the knife just nicked the surface sharp painful but such a little cut he leaned over me it wont hurt i promise i screamed his lips touched the cut locked on it sucking he was wrong it did hurt then the smell of flowers surrounded me i was drowning in perfume i couldnt see the world was warm and sweetscented when i could see again think again i was lying on my back staring up at the tent roof arms drew me upward cradled me alejandro held me close hed cut a line of blood on his chest just above the nipple drink i put my hands flat against him fighting him his hand squeezed the back of my neck forcing me closer to the wound no i drew the other knife and plunged it into his chest searching for the heart he grunted and grabbed my hand squeezed until i dropped the knife silver is not the way i am past silver he pushed my face towards the wound and i couldnt fight him i just wasnt strong enough he could have crushed my skull in one hand but all he did was press my face to the cut on his chest i struggled but he kept my mouth pressed to the wound the blood was salty sweet vaguely metallic it was only blood anita jeanclaude screamed my name i wasnt sure if it was aloud or in my head blood of my blood flesh of my flesh the two shall be as one one flesh one blood one soul somewhere deep inside me something broke i could feel it a wave of liquid warmth rushed up and over me my skin danced with it my fingertips tingled my spine spasmed and i jerked upright strong arms caught me held me rocked me a hand smoothed my hair from my face i opened my eyes to see alejandro i wasnt afraid of him anymore i was calm and floating anita it was edward i turned towards the sound slowly edward what did he do to you i tried to think how to explain it but my mind wouldnt bring up the words i sat up pushing gently away from alejandro there was a pile of dead vampires around edwards feet maybe silver didnt hurt alejandro but it had hurt his people we will make more alejandro said can you not read this in my mind and i could now that i thought about it but it wasnt like telepathy not words iknew he was thinking about the power id just given him he felt no regret about the vampires that had died the crowd screamed alejandro looked up i followed his gaze jeanclaude was on his knees blood pouring down his side alejandro envied oliver the ability to draw blood from a distance when i became alejandros servant jeanclaude had been weakened oliver had him that had been the plan all along alejandro held me close and i didnt try to stop him he whispered against my cheek you are a necromancer anita you have power over the dead that is why jeanclaude wanted you as his servant oliver thinks to control you through controlling me but i know that you are a necromancer even as a servant you have free will you do not have to obey as the others do as a human servant you are yourself a weapon you can strike one of us and draw blood what are you saying they have arranged that the loser be stretched over the altar and staked by you what jeanclaude as affirmation of his power oliver as a gesture to show how well he controlled what once belonged to jeanclaude there was a gasp from the crowd oliver was levitating ever so slowly he floated to the ground then he raised his arms and jeanclaude floated upward shit i said jeanclaude hung nearly unconscious in empty shining air oliver laid him gently on the ground and fresh blood splattered the white floor karl inger came into sight he picked jeanclaude up under the arms where was everybody i looked around for some help the black werewolf was torn apart parts still twitching i didnt think even a lycanthrope could heal the mess the blond werewolf wasnt much better but stephen was dragging himself towards the altar with one leg completely ripped away he was trying karl laid jeanclaude on the marble altar blood began to seep down the side he held him lightly at the shoulder jeanclaude could bench press a car how could karl hold him down he shares olivers strength quit doing that i said what answering questions i havent asked yet he smiled it saves so much time oliver picked up a white polished stake and a padded hammer he held them out towards me its time alejandro tried to help me stand but i pushed him away fourth mark or no fourth mark i could stand on my own richard screamed no he ran past us towards the altar it all seemed to happen in slow motion he jumped at oliver and the little man grabbed him by the throat and tore his windpipe out richard i was running but it was too late he lay bleeding on the ground still trying to breathe when he didnt have anything to breathe with i knelt by him tried to stop the flow of blood his eyes were wide and panicfilled edward was with me theres nothing you can do nothing any of us can do no anita he pulled me away from richard its too late i was crying and hadnt known it come anita destroy your old master as you wanted me to oliver was holding the hammer and stake out towards me i shook my head alejandro helped me stand i reached for edward but it was too late edward couldnt help no one could help me there was no way to take back the fourth mark or heal richard or save jeanclaude but at least i wouldnt put the stake through jeanclaude that i could stop that i would not do alejandro was leading me towards the altar marguerite had crawled to one side of the dais she was kneeling rocking gently back and fourth her face was a bloody mask shed clawed her eyes out oliver held the stake and mallet out to me with his whitegloved hands still wet with richards blood i shook my head you will take it you will do as i say his little clown face was frowning at me fuck you i said alejandro you control her now she is my servant master yes oliver held the stake out towards me then have her finish him i cannot force her master alejandro smiled as he said it why not she is a necromancer i told you she would have free will i will not have my grand gesture spoiled by one stubborn woman he tried to roll my mind i felt him rush over me like a wind inside my head but it rolled off and away i was a full human servant vampire tricks didnt work on me not even olivers i laughed and he slapped me i tasted fresh blood in my mouth he stood beside me and i could feel him tremble he was so angry i was ruining his moment alejandro was pleased i could feel his pleasure like a warm hand in my stomach finish him or i promise you ill beat you to a bloody pulp you dont die easily now i can hurt you worse than you can imagine and youll heal but it will still hurt just as badly do you understand me i stared down at jeanclaude he was staring at me his dark blue eyes were as lovely as ever i wont do it i said you still care about him after all he has done to you i nodded do him now or i will kill him slowly i will pick pieces of flesh from his bones but never kill him as long as his heart and head are intact he wont die no matter what i do to him i looked at jeanclaude i couldnt stand by and let oliver torture him not if i could help it wasnt a clean death better wasnt it i took the stake from oliver ill do it oliver smiled youve made a wise decision jeanclaude would thank you if he could i stared down at jeanclaude stake in one hand i touched his chest just over the burn scar my hand came away smeared with blood do it now oliver said i turned to oliver reaching my left hand out for the hammer as he handed it to me i shoved the ash stake through his chest karl screamed blood poured out of olivers mouth he seemed frozen as if he couldnt move with the stake in his heart but he wasnt dead not yet my fingers tore into the meat of his throat and pulled pulled great gobbets of flesh until i saw spine glistening and wet i wrapped my hand around his spine and jerked it free his head lolled to one side held by a few strips of meat i jerked his head clear and tossed it across the ring karl inger was lying beside the altar i knelt by him and tried to find a pulse but there wasnt one olivers death had killed him too alejandro came to stand by me youve done it anita i knew you could kill him i knew you could i stared up at him now you kill jeanclaude and we rule the city together yes i shoved upward before i could think about it before he could read my mind i shoved my hands into his chest ribs cracked and scraped my skin i grabbed his beating heart and crushed it i couldnt breathe my chest was tight and it hurt i pulled his heart out of the hole he fell eyes wide and surprised i fell with him i was gasping for air couldnt breathe couldnt breathe i lay on top of my master and felt my heart beating for both of us he wouldnt die i laid my fingers against his throat and started to dig i put my hands around his throat and squeezed i felt my hands dig into flesh but the pain was overwhelming i was choking on blood our blood my hands went numb i couldnt tell if i was still squeezing or not i couldnt feel anything except the pain then even that slipped away and i was falling falling into a darkness that had never known light and never would i woke up staring into an offwhite ceiling i blinked at the ceiling for a minute sunlight lay in warm squares across the blanket there were metal rails on the bed an iv dripped to my arm a hospitalthen i wasnt dead surprise surprise there were flowers and a bunch of shiny balloons on a small bedside table i lay there a moment enjoying the fact that i wasnt dead the door opened and all i could see was a huge bunch of flowers then the flowers lowered and it was richard i think i stopped breathing i could feel all the blood rushing through my skin there was a soft roaring in my head no i wasnt going to faint i never fainted i finally managed to say youre dead his smile faded im not dead i saw oliver tear out your throat i could see it in front of me like an overlay in my mind i saw him gasping dying i found i could sit up i braced myself and the iv needle moved under my skin the tape pulling it was real nothing else seemed real he raised a hand towards his throat then stopped himself he swallowed hard enough for me to hear it you saw oliver tear out my throat but it didnt kill me i stared at him there was no bandage on his cheek the circle cut had healed no human being could survive that i said softly i know he looked incredibly sad as he said it panic filled my throat until i could barely breathe what are you im a lycanthrope i shook my head i know what a lycanthrope feels like moves like you arent one yes i am i kept shaking my head no he came to stand beside the bed he held the flowers awkwardly as if he didnt know what to do with them im next in line to be pack leader i can pass for human anita im good at it you lied to me he shook his head i didnt want to then why did you jeanclaude ordered me not to tell you why he shrugged i think because he knew youd hate it you dont forgive deceit he knows that would jeanclaude deliberately try to ruin a potential relationship between richard and me yep you asked what hold jeanclaude had on me that was it my pack leader loaned me to jeanclaude on the condition that no one find out what i was why are you a special case they wont let lycanthropes teach kids or anybody else for that matter youre a werewolf isnt that better than being dead i stared up at him his eyes were still the same perfect brown his hair fell forward around his face i wanted to ask him to sit down to let me run my fingers through his hair to keep it from that wonderful face yeah its better than being dead he let out a breath as if hed been holding it he smiled and held the flowers out to me i took them because i didnt know what else to do they were red carnations with enough babys breath to form a white mist over the red the carnations smelled like sweet cloves richard was a werewolf next in line for pack leader he could pass for human i stared up at him i held out my hand to him he took it and his hand was warm and solid and alive now that weve established why youre not dead why arent i dead edward did cpr on you until the ambulances came the doctors dont know what caused your heart to stop but theres no permanent damage what did you tell the police about all the bodies what bodies come off it richard by the time the ambulance got there there were no extra bodies the audience saw it all but what was real and what was illusion the police got a hundred different versions from the audience theyre suspicious but they cant prove anything the circus has been shut down until the authorities can be sure its safe safe i laughed he shrugged as safe as it ever was i slipped my hand out of richards grasp using both hands to smell the flowers again is jeanclaude alive yes a great sense of relief washed over me i didnt want him dead i didnt want jeanclaude dead shit hes still master of the city then and im still bound to him no richard said jeanclaude told me to tell you youre free alejandros marks sort of canceled his out you cant serve two masters he said free i was free i stared at richard it cant be that easy richard laughed you call this easy i looked up i had to smile all right it wasnt easy but i didnt think anything short of death would get jeanclaude off my back are you happy the marks are gone i started to say of course then stopped myself there was something very serious in richards face he knew what it was to be offered power to be one with the monsters it could be horrible and wonderful finally i said yes really i nodded you dont seem too enthused he said i know i should be jumping for joy or something but i just feel empty youve been through a lot the last few days youre entitled to be a little numb why wasnt i happier to be rid of jeanclaude why wasnt i relieved to be no ones human servant because id miss him stupid ridiculous true when something gets too hard to think about think about something else so now everyone knows youre a werewolf no you were hospitalized and youve already healed i think theyll guess jeanclaude had me hidden away until i healed this is my first day up and around how long have i been out a week youre joking you were in a coma for three days the doctors still dont know what made you start breathing on your own i had come that close to the great beyond i couldnt remember any tunnel of light or soothing voices i felt cheated i dont remember you were unconscious youre not supposed to remember sit down before i get a crick looking up at you he pulled up a chair and sat down by the bed smiling at me it was a nice smile so youre a werewolf he nodded how did it happen he stared down at the floor then up his face looked so solemn i was sorry id asked i was expecting some great tale of a savage attack survived i got a bad batch of lycanthropy serum you what you heard me he seemed embarrassed you got a bad shot yes my smile got wider and wider its not funny he said i shook my head not at all i knew my eyes were shiny and it was all i could do not to laugh out loud youve got to admit its nicely ironic he sighed youre going to hurt yourself go ahead and laugh i did i laughed until it hurt and richard joined in laughter is contagious too a dozen white roses came later that day with a note from jeanclaude the note read you are free of me if you choose but i hope you want to see me as much as i want to see you it is your choice jeanclaude i stared at the flowers for a long time i finally had a nurse give them to someone else or throw them away or whatever the hell she wanted to do with them i just wanted them out of my sight so i was still attracted to jeanclaude i might even in some dark corner love him a little it didnt matter loving the monsters always ends badly for the human its a rule that brought me to richard he was one of the monsters but he was alive that was an improvement over jeanclaude and was he any less human than i was zombie queen vampire slayer necromancer who was i to complain i dont know where they put all the body parts but no police ever came asking whether id saved the city or not it was still murder legally oliver had done nothing to deserve death i got out of the hospital and went back to work larry stayed on hes learning how to hunt vampires god save him the lamia was truly immortal which i guess means lamias cant have been extinct they just must always have been rare jeanclaude got the lamia a green card and gave her a job at the circus of the damned i dont know if hes letting her breed or not i havent been near the circus since i got out of the hospital richard and i finally had that first date we went for something fairly traditional dinner and a movie were going caving next week he promised no underwater tunnels his lips are the softest ive ever kissed so he gets furry once a month no ones perfect jeanclaude hasnt given up he keeps sending me gifts i keep refusing them i have to keep saying no until he gives up or until hell freezes over whichever comes first most women complain that there are no single straight men left id just like to meet one whos human
