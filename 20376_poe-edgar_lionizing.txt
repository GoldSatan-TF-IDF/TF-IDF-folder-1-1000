lionizing by edgar allan poe all people went upon their ten toes in wild wondernment bishop halls satires i amthat is to say i was a great man but i am neither the author of junius nor the man in the mask for my name i believe is robert jones and i was born somewhere in the city of fumfudge the first action of my life was the taking hold of my nose with both hands my mother saw this and called me a geniusmy father wept for joy and presented me with a treatise on nosology this i mastered before i was breeched i now began to feel my way in the science and soon came to understand that provided a man had a nose sufficiently conspicuous he might by merely following it arrive at a lionship but my attention was not confined to theories alone every morning i gave my proboscis a couple of pulls and swallowed a half dozen of drams when i came of age my father asked me one day if i would step with him into his study my son he said when we were seated what is the chief end of your existence my father i answered it is the study of nosology and what robert he inquired is nosology sir i said it is the science of noses and can you tell me he demanded what is the meaning of a nose a nose my father i replied greatly softened has been variously defined by about a thousand different authors here i pulled out my watch it is now noon or thereaboutswe shall have time enough to get through with them all before midnight to commence then the nose according to bartholinus is that protuberancethat bumpthat excresencethat will do robert interrupted the old gentleman i am thunderstruck at the
