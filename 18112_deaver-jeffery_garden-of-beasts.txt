jeffery deaver garden of beasts copyright by jeffery deaver to the memories of hans and sophie scholl brother and sister executed in for antinazi protests journalist carl von ossietzky awarded the nobel peace prize in while imprisoned in oranienburg camp and wilhelm kruzfeld a berlin police officer who refused to let a mob destroy a synagogue during the nazisponsored antijewish riots known as the night of broken glass four people who looked at evil and said no berlin was full of whispers they told of illegal midnight arrests of prisoners tortured in the sa barracks they were drowned by the loud angry voices of the government contradicting through its thousand mouths christopher isherwood berlinstories i the button man monday july chapter one as soon as he stepped into the dim apartment he knew he was dead he wiped sweat off his palm looking around the place which was quiet as a morgue except for the faint sounds of hells kitchen traffic late at night and the ripple of the greasy shade when the swiveling monkey ward fan turned its hot breath toward the window the whole scene was off out of kilter malone was supposed to be here smoked on booze sleeping off a binge but he wasnt no bottles of corn anywhere not even the smell of bourbon the punks only drink and it looked like he hadnt been around for a while the new york sun on the table was two days old it sat next to a cold ashtray and a glass with a blue halo of dried milk halfway up the side he clicked the light on well there was a side door like hed noted yesterday from the hallway looking over the place but it was nailed shut and the window that let onto the fire escape brother sealed nice and tight with chicken wire he hadnt been able to see from the alley the other window was open but was also forty feet above cobblestones no way out and where was malone paul schumann wondered malone was on the lam malone was drinking beer in jersey malone was a statue on a concrete base underneath a red hook pier didnt matter whateverd happened to the boozehound paul realized the punk had been nothing more than bait and the wire that hed be here tonight was pure bunk in the hallway outside a scuffle of feet a clink of metal out of kilter paul set his pistol on the rooms one table took out his handkerchief and mopped his face the searing air from the deadly midwest heat wave had made its way to new york but a man cant walk around without a jacket when hes carrying a colt in his back waistband and so paul was condemned to wear a suit it was his singlebutton singlebreasted gray linen the whitecotton collarattached shirt was drenched another shuffle from outside in the hallway where theyd be getting ready for him a whisper another clink paul thought about looking out the window but was afraid hed get shot in the face he wanted an open casket at his wake and he didnt know any morticians good enough to fix bullet or birdshot damage who was gunning for him it wasnt luciano of course the man whod hired him to touch off malone it wasnt meyer lansky either they were dangerous yeah but not snakes pauld always done topnotch work for them never leaving a bit of evidence that could link them to the touchoff besides if either of them wanted paul gone they wouldnt need to set him up with a bum job hed simply be gone so whod snagged him if it was obanion or rothstein from williamsburg or valenti from bay ridge well hed be dead in a few minutes if it was dapper tom dewey the death would take a bit longer whatever time was involved to convict him and get him into the electric chair up in sing sing more voices in the hall more clicks metal seating against metal but looking at it one way he reflected wryly everything was silk so far he was still alive and thirsty as hell he walked to the kelvinator and opened it three bottles of milk two of them curdled and a box of kraft cheese and one of sunsweet tenderized peaches several royal crown colas he found an opener and removed the cap from a bottle of the soft drink from somewhere he heard a radio it was playing stormy weather sitting down at the table again he noticed himself in the dusty mirror on the wall above a chipped enamel washbasin his pale blue eyes werent as alarmed as they ought to be he supposed his face though was weary he was a large man over six feet and weighing more than two hundred pounds his hair was from his mothers side reddish brown his fair complexion from his fathers german ancestors the skin was a bit marred not from pox but from knuckles in his younger days and everlast gloves more recently concrete and canvas too sipping the soda pop spicier than cocacola he liked it paul considered his situation if it was obanion or rothstein or valenti well none of them gave a good goddamn about malone a crazy riveter from the shipyards turned punk mobster whod killed a beat cops wife and done so in a pretty unpleasant way hed threatened more of the same to any law that gave him trouble every boss in the area from the bronx to jersey was shocked at what hed done so even if one of them wanted to touch off paul why not wait until after hed knocked off malone which meant it was probably dewey the idea of being stuck in the caboose till he was executed depressed him yet truth be told in his heart paul wasnt too torn up about getting nabbed like when he was a kid and would jump impulsively into fights against two or three kids bigger than he was sooner or later hed eventually pick the wrong punks and end up with a broken bone hed known the same thing about his present career that ultimately a dewey or an obanion would bring him down thinking of one of his fathers favorite expressions on the best day on the worst day the sun finally sets the round man would snap his colorful suspenders and add cheer up tomorrows a whole new horse race he jumped when the phone rang paul looked at the black bakelite for a long moment on the seventh ring or the eighth he answered yeah paul a crisp young voice said no neighborhood slur you know who it is im up the hall in another apartment therere six of us here another half dozen on the street twelve paul felt an odd calm nothing he could do about twelve theyd get him one way or the other he sipped more of the royal crown he was so damn thirsty the fan wasnt doing anything but moving the heat from one side of the room to the other he asked you working for the boys from brooklyn or the west side just curious listen to me paul heres what youre going to do you only have two guns on you right the colt and that little twentytwo the others are back in your apartment paul laughed thats right youre going to unload them and lock the slide of the colt open then walk to the window thats not sealed and pitch them out then youre going to take your jacket off drop it on the floor open the door and stand in the middle of the room with your hands up in the air stretch em way up high youll shoot me he said youre living on borrowed time anyway paul but if you do what i say you might stay alive a little longer the caller hung up he dropped the hand piece into the cradle he sat motionless for a moment recalling a very pleasant night a few weeks ago marion and he had gone to coney island for miniature golf and hot dogs and beer to beat the heat laughing shed dragged him to a fortune teller at the amusement park the fake gypsy had read his cards and told him a lot of things the woman had missed this particular event though which youd think shouldve showed up somewhere in the reading if she was worth her salt marion hed never told her what he did for a living only that he owned a gym and he did business occasionally with some guys who had questionable pasts but hed never told her more he realized suddenly that hed been looking forward to some kind of future with her she was a dimeadance girl at a club on the west side studying fashion design during the day shed be working now she usually went till or am how would she find out what happened to him if it was dewey hed probably be able to call her if it was the boys from williamsburg no call nothing the phone began ringing again paul ignored it he slipped the clip from his big gun and unchambered the round that was in the receiver then he emptied the cartridges out of the revolver he walked to the window and tossed the pistols out one at a time he didnt hear them land finishing the soda pop he took his jacket off dropped it on the floor he started for the door but paused he went back to the kelvinator and got another royal crown he drank it down then he wiped his face again opened the front door stepped back and lifted his arms the phone stopped ringing thiss called the room said the grayhaired man in a pressed white uniform taking a seat on a small couch you were never here he added with a cheerful confidence that meant there was no debate he added and you never heard about it it was pm theyd brought paul here directly from malones it was a private town house on the upper east side though most of the rooms on the ground floor contained desks and telephones and teletype machines like in an office only in the parlor were there divans and armchairs on the walls here were pictures of new and old navy ships a globe sat in the corner fdr looked down at him from a spot above a marble mantel the room was wonderfully cold a private house that had airconditioning imagine still handcuffed paul had been deposited in a comfortable leather armchair the two younger men whod escorted him out of malones apartment also in white uniforms sat beside him and slightly behind the one whod spoken to him on the phone was named andrew avery a man with rosy cheeks and deliberate sharp eyes eyes of a boxer though paul knew hed never been in a fistfight in his life the other was vincent manielli dark with a voice that told paul theyd probably grown up in the same section of brooklyn manielli and avery didnt look much older than the stickball kids in front of pauls building but they were of all things lieutenants in the navy when paul had been in france the lieutenants hed served under had been grown men their pistols were in holsters but the leather flaps were undone and they kept their hands near their weapons the older officer sitting across from him on the couch was pretty high up a naval commander if the gingerbread on his uniform was the same as itd been twenty years ago the door opened and an attractive woman in a white navy uniform entered the name on her blouse was ruth willets she handed him a file everythings in there thank you yeoman as she left without glancing at paul the officer opened the file extracted two pieces of thin paper read them carefully when he finished he looked up im james gordon office of naval intelligence they call me bull this is your headquarters paul asked the room the commander ignored him and glanced at the other two you introduced yourselves yet yes sir there was no trouble none sir avery was doing the talking take his cuffs off avery did so while manielli stood with his hand near his gun edgily eyeing pauls gnarled knuckles manielli had fighters hands too averys were pink as a drygoods clerks the door swung open again and another man walked inside he was in his sixties but as lean and tall as that young actor marion and paul had seen in a couple of films jimmy stewart paul frowned he knew the face from articles in the times and the herald tribune senator the man responded but to gordon you said he was smart i didnt know he was wellinformed as if he wasnt happy about being recognized the senator looked paul up and down sat and lit a stubby cigar a moment later yet another man entered about the same age as the senator wearing a white linen suit that was savagely wrinkled the body it encased was large and soft he carried a walking stick he glanced once at paul then without a word to anyone he retreated to the corner he too looked familiar but paul couldnt place him now gordon continued heres the situation paul we know youve worked for luciano we know youve worked for lansky a couple of the others and we know what you do for them yeah whats that youre a button man paul manielli said brightly as if hed been looking forward to saying it gordon said last march jimmy coughlin saw you he frowned what do you people say you dont say kill paul thinking some of us people say chill off paul himself used touch off it was the phrase that sergeant alvin york used to describe killing enemy soldiers during the war it made paul feel less like a punk to use the term that a war hero did but of course paul schumann didnt share any of this at the moment gordon continued jimmy saw you kill arch dimici on march thirteenth in a warehouse on the hudson paul had staked out the place for four hours before dimici showed up hed been positive the man was alone jimmy mustve been sleeping one off behind some crates when paul arrived now from what they tell me jimmy isnt the most reliable witness but weve got some hard evidence a few revenue boys picked him up for sell ing hooch and he made a deal to rat on you seems hed picked up a shell casing at the scene and was keeping it for insurance no printsre on it youre too smart for that but hoover s people ran a test on your colt the scratches from the extractorre the same hoover the fbi was involved and theyd already tested the gun hed pitched it out of malones window less than an hour ago paul rocked his upper and lower teeth against each other he was furious with himself hed searched for a half hour to find that damn casing at the dimici job and had finally concluded itd fallen through the cracks in the floor into the hudson so we made inquiries and heard you were being paid five hundred dollars to gordon hesitated touch off eliminate malone tonight like hell i was paul said laughing you got yourself some bum wire i just went to visit him where is he by the way gordon paused mr malone will no longer be a threat to the constabulary or the citizens of new york city sounds like somebody owes you five cnotes bull gordon didnt laugh youre in dutch paul and you cant beat the rap so heres what were offering like they say in those usedstudebaker ads thiss a onetimeonly offer take it or leave it we dont negotiate the senator finally spoke tom dewey wants you as bad as he wants the rest of the scum on his list the special prosecutor was on a divine mission to clean up organized crime in new york crime boss lucky luciano the italian five families in the city and the jewish syndicate of meyer lansky were his main targets dewey was dogged and smart and he was winning conviction after conviction but hes agreed to give us first dibs on you forget it im not a stool pigeon gordon said were not asking you to be one thats not what this is about then what do you want me to do a pause for a moment the senator nodded toward gordon who said youre a button man paul what do you think we want you to kill somebody chapter two he held gordons eyes for a moment then he looked at the pictures of the ships on the wall the room it had a military feel to it like an officers club paul had liked his time in the army hed felt at home there had friends had a purpose that was a good time for him a simple time before he came back home and life got complicated when life gets complicated bad things can happen youre being square with me oh you bet with manielli squinting out a warning to move slowly paul reached into his pocket and took out a pack of chesterfields he lit one go on gordon said youve got that gym over on ninth avenue not much of a place is it he asked this of avery you been there paul asked avery said not so swank manielli laughed real dive id say the commander continued but you used to be a printer before you got into this line of work you liked the printing business paul cautiously paul said yeah were you good at it yeah i was good whats that got to do with the price of tea in china howd you like to make your whole past go away start over be a printer again we can fix it so nobody can prosecute you for anything youve done in the past and the senator added well cough up some bucks too five thousand you can get a new life five thousand paul blinked it took most joes two years to earn that kind of money he asked how can you clean up my record the senator laughed you know that new game monopoly you ever play it my nephews have it i never played the senator continued sometimes when you roll the dice you end up in prison but theres this card that says get out of jail free well well give you one for real thats all you need to know you want me to kill somebody thats queer deweyd never agree to it the senator said the special prosecutor hasnt been informed about why we want you after a pause he asked who siegel of all the current mobsters bugsy siegel was the most dangerous psychotic really paul had seen the bloody results of the mans brutality his tantrums were legendary now paul gordon said disdain on his face itd be illegal for you to kill a us citizen wed never ask you to do anything like that then i dont get the angle the senator said this is more like a wartime situation you were a soldier a glance at avery who recited first infantry division first american army aef st mihiel meuseargonne you did some serious fighting got yourself some medals for marksmanship in the field did some handtohand too right paul shrugged the fat man in the wrinkled white suit sat silently in his corner hands clasped on the gold handle of his walking stick paul held his eye for a minute then turned back to the commander whatre the odds ill survive long enough to use my getoutofjail card reasonable the commander said not great but reasonable paul was a friend of the sports journalist and writer damon runyon theyd drink together some in the dives near broadway go to fights and ball games a couple of years ago runyon had invited paul to a party after the new york opening of his movie little miss marker which paul thought was a pretty good flick at the party afterward where he got a kick out of meeting shirley temple hed asked runyon to autograph a book the writer had inscribed it to my pal paul remember all of life is six to five against avery said how bout we just say your chancesre a lot better than if you go to sing sing after a moment paul asked why me youve got dozens of button men in new york d be willing to do it for that kind of scratch ah but youre different paul youre not a twobit punk youre good hoover and dewey say youve killed seventeen men paul scoffed bum wire i keep saying in fact the number was thirteen what weve heard about you is that you check everything two three times before the job you make sure your gunsre in perfect shape you read up about your victims you look over their places ahead of time you find their schedule and you make sure they stick to it you know when theyll be alone when they make phone calls where they eat the senator added and youre smart like i was saying we need smart for this smart manielli said we been to your place paul you got books damn you got a lot of books youre even in the book of the month club theyre not smart books not all of em but they are books avery pointed out and im betting a lot of people in your business dont read much or cant read manielli said and laughed at his own joke paul looked over at the man in the wrinkled white suit whore you you dont need to worry gordon began im asking him listen the senator grumbled were calling the shots my friend but the fat man waved his hand and then replied to paul you know the comics little orphan annie the girl without the pupils in her eyes yeah sure well think of me as daddy warbucks whats that mean but he just laughed and turned to the senator keep pitching your case i like him the railthin politician said to paul most important you dont kill anybody innocent gordon added jimmy coughlin told us you said one time that you only kill other killers whatd you say that you only correct gods mistakes thats what we need gods mistakes the senator repeated smiling in lip but not in spirit well who is it gordon looked at the senator who deflected the question you have relatives in germany still nobody close my family came over here a long time ago the senator asked what do you know about the nazis adolf hitlers running the country sounds like nobodys really crazy about it there was this big rally against him at madison square garden in march two three years ago traffic was a swell mess ill tell you i missed the first three rounds of a fight up in the bronx got under my skin thats about it did you know paul the senator said slowly that hitlers planning another war that brought him up short our sourcesve been giving us information from germany since hitler came to power in thirtythree last year our man in berlin got his hands on a draft of this letter it was written by one of their senior men general beck the commander handed him a typed sheet it was in german paul read it the author of the letter called for a slow but steady rearmament of the german armed forces to protect and expand what paul translated as living area the nation had to be ready for war in a few years frowning he put the sheet down and theyre going ahead with this last year gordon said hitler started a draft and since then hes building up the troops to even higher levels than that letter recommends then four months ago german troops took over the rhineland the demilitarized zone bordering france i read about that theyre building submarines at helgoland andre taking back control of the wilhelm canal to move warships from the north sea to the baltic the man running the finances over there has a new title hes head of the war economy and spain their civil war hitlers sending troops and equipment supposedly to help franco actually hes using the war to train his soldiers you want me you want a button man to kill hitler lord no the senator said hitlers just a crank funny in the head he wants the country to rearm but he doesnt have a clue how to do it and this man youre talking about does oh you bet he does the senator offered his names reinhard ernst he was a colonel during the war but hes civilian now titles a mouthful plenipotentiary for domestic stability but thats hooey hes the brains behind rearmament hes got his finger in everything financing with schacht army with blomberg navy with raeder air force with göring munitions with krupp what about the treaty versailles they cant have an army i thought not a big one same with the navy and no air force at all the senator said but our man tells us that soldiers and sailorsre popping up all over germany like wine at cana s wedding so cant the allies just stop them i mean we won the war nobody in europe s doing a thing the french couldve stopped hitler cold last march at the rhineland but they didnt the brits all they did was scold a dog thatd pissed on the carpet after a moment paul asked and whatve we done to stop them gordons subtle glance was one of deference the senator shrugged in america all we want is peace the isolationistsre running the show they dont want to be involved in european politics men want jobs and mothers dont want to lose their sons in flanders fields again and the president wants to get elected again this november paul said feeling fdrs eyes peering down on him from above the ornate mantelpiece awkward silence for a moment gordon laughed the senator did not paul stubbed out his cigarette okay sure its making sense now if i get caught theres nothing to lead them back to you or to him a nod toward roosevelt s picture hell im just a crazy civilian not a soldier like these kids here a glance at the two junior officers avery smiled manielli did too but his was a very different smile the senator said thats right paul thats exactly right and i speak german we heard youre fluent pauls grandfather was proud of his country of ancestry as was pauls father who insisted the children study german and speak their native language in the house he recalled absurd moments when his mother would shout in gaelic and his father in german when they fought paul had also worked in his grandfathers plant setting type and proofreading germanlanguage printing jobs during the summers when he was in high school how would it work im not saying yes im just curious how would it work theres a ship taking the olympic team families and press over to germany it leaves day after tomorrow youd be on it the olympic team weve decided its the best way therell be thousands of foreigners in town berlin ll be packed their army and policell have their hands full avery said you wont have anything to do with the olympics officially the games dont start till august first the olympic committee only knows youre a writer a sports journalist gordon added thats your cover but basically you just play dumb and make yourself invisible go to the olympic village with everybody else and spend a day or two there then slip into the city a hotels no good the nazis monitor all the guests and record passports our mans getting a room in a private boardinghouse for you like any craftsman certain questions about the job slipped into his mind would i use my name yes youll be yourself but well also get you an escape passport with your picture but a different name issued by some other country the senator said you look russian youre big and solid he nodded sure youll be the man from russia i dont speak russian nobody there does either besides youll probably never need the passport its just to get you out of the country in an emergency and paul added quickly to make sure nobody traces me to you if i dont make it out right the senators hesitation followed by a glance at gordon said he was on the money paul continued whom i supposed to be working for all the papersll have stringers there theyd know i wasnt a reporter we thought of that youll be writing freelance stories and trying to sell em to some of the sports rags when you get back paul asked whos your man over there gordon said no names just now i dont need a name do you trust him and why the senator said hes been living there for a couple of years and getting us quality information he served under me in the war i know him personally whats his cover there businessman facilitator that sort of thing works for himself gordon continued hell get you a weapon and whatever you need to know about your target i dont have a real passport in my name i mean we know paul well get you one can i have my guns back no gordon said and that was the end of the matter so thats our general plan my friend and i should tell you if youre thinking of hopping a freight and laying low in some hooverville out west paul sure as hell had been but he frowned and shook his head well these fine young menll be sticking to you like limpets until the ship docks in hamburg and if you should get the same hankering to slip out of berlin our contacts going to be keeping an eye on you if you disappear he calls us and we call the nazis to tell them an escaped american killers at large in berlin and well give them your name and picture gordon held his eye if you think we were good at tracking you down paul you aint seen nothing like the nazis and from what we hear they dont bother with trials and writs of execution now we clear on that as a bell good the commander glanced at avery now tell him what happens after he finishes the job the lieutenant said well have a plane and a crew waiting in holland theres an old aerodrome outside of berlin after youve finished well fly you out from there fly me out paul asked intrigued flying fascinated him when he was nine he broke his arm the first of more times than he wanted to count when he built a glider and launched himself off the roof of his fathers printing plant crashlanding on the filthy cobblestones two stories below thats right paul gordon said avery offered you like airplanes dont you youve got all those airplane magazines in your apartment books too and pictures of planes some models too you make those yourself paul felt embarrassed it made him angry that theyd found his toys you a pilot the senator asked never even been in a plane before then he shook his head i dont know this whole thing was absolutely nuts silence filled the room it was broken by the man in the wrinkled white suit i was a colonel in the war too just like reinhard ernst and i was at argonne woods just like you paul nodded you know the total of what how many we lost paul remembered a sea of bodies american french and german the wounded were in some ways more horrible they cried and wailed and moaned and called for their mothers and fathers and you never forgot that sound ever the older man said in a reverent voice the aef lost more than twentyfive thousand almost a hundred wounded half the boys under my command died in a month we advanced seven miles against the enemy every day of my life ive thought about those numbers half my soldiers seven miles and meuseargonne was our most spectacular victory in the war i do not want that to happen again paul regarded him who are you he asked again the senator stirred and began to speak but the other man replied im cyrus clayborn yeah that was it brother the old guy was the head of continental telephone and telegraph a real honesttogod millionaire even now in the shadow of the depression the man continued daddy warbucks like i was saying im the banker for lets say projects like this its usually better for the money not to come out of public troughs im too old to fight for my country but i do what i can that satisfy your itch boy yeah it does good clayborn looked him over well ive got one more thing to say the money they mentioned before the amount paul nodded double it paul felt his skin crackle ten thousand dollars he couldnt imagine it gordons head slowly turned toward the senator this paul understood wasnt part of the script would you give me cash not a check for some reason the senator and clayborn laughed hard at this whatever you want sure the industrialist said the senator pulled a phone closer to him and tapped the hand piece so whats it going to be son we get on the horn to dewey or not the rasp of a match broke the silence as gordon lit a cigarette think about it paul were giving you the chance to erase the past start all over again what kind of button man gets that kind of deal ii the city of whispers friday july chapter three finally the man could do what hed come here for it was six in the morning and the ship in whose pungent thirdclass corridor he now stood the ss manhattan was nosing toward hamburg harbor ten days after leaving new york the vessel was literally the flagship of the united states lines the first in the companys fleet constructed exclusively for passengers it was huge over two football fields in length but this voyage had been especially crowded typical transatlantic crossings found the ship carrying six hundred or so passengers and a crew of five hundred on this trip though nearly four hundred olympic athletes managers and coaches and another passengers mostly family friends the press and members of the aoc filled the three classes of accommodations the number of passengers and the unusual requirements of the athletes and reporters on board the manhattan had made life hectic for the diligent polite crew but particularly so for this round bald man whose name was albert heinsler certainly his job as a porter meant long and strenuous hours but the most arduous aspect of his day was due to his true role on board the ship one that not a single soul here knew anything about heinsler called himself an aman which is how the nazi intelligence service referred to their trusted operatives in germany their agenten in fact this reclusive thirtyfouryearold bachelor was merely a member of the germanamerican bund a group of ragtag prohitler americans loosely allied with the christian front in their stand against jews communists and negroes heinsler didnt hate america but he could never forget the terrible days as a teenager when his family had been driven to poverty during the war because of antigerman prejudice he himself had been relentlessly taunted heinie heinie heinie the hun and beaten up countless times in school yards and alleys no he didnt hate his country but he loved nazi germany with all his heart and was enraptured with the messiah adolf hitler hed make any sacrifice for the man prison or even death if necessary heinsler had hardly believed his good fortune when the commanding stormtrooper at the new jersey headquarters of the bund had noted the loyal comrades past employment as a bookkeeper on board some passenger liners and had arranged to get him a job on the manhattan the brownuniformed commandant had met him on the boardwalk at atlantic city and explained that while the nazis were magnanimously welcoming people from around the world they were worried about security breaches that the influx of athletes and visitors might allow heinslers duty was to be the nazis clandestine representative on this ship he wouldnt be doing his past job though keeping ledgers it was important that he be free to roam the ship without suspicion hed be a porter why this was the thrill of his life he immediately quit his job working in the back room of a certified public accountant on lower broadway he spent the next few days until the ship sailed being his typically obsessed self preparing for his mission as he worked through the night to study diagrams of the ship practice his role as a porter brush up on his german and learn a variation of morse code called continental code which was used when telegraphing messages to and within europe once the ship left port he kept to himself observed and listened and was the perfect aman but when the manhattan was at sea hed been unable to communicate with germany the signal of his portable wireless was too weak the ship itself had a powerful radiogram system of course as well as shortand longwave wireless but he could hardly transmit his message those ways a crew radio operator would be involved and it was vital that nobody heard or saw what he had to say heinsler now glanced out the porthole at the gray strip of germany yes he believed he was close enough to shore to transmit he stepped into his minuscule cabin and retrieved the allocchio bacchini wirelesstelegraph set from under his cot then he started toward the stairs that would take him to the highest deck where he hoped the puny signal would make it to shore as he walked down the narrow corridor he mentally reviewed his message once again one thing he regretted was that although he wanted to include his name and affiliation he couldnt do so even though hitler pri vately admired what the germanamerican bund was doing the group was so rabidly and loudly antisemitic that the führer had been forced to publicly disavow it heinslers words would be ignored if he included any reference to the american group and this particular message could most certainly not be ignored for the obersturmführerss hamburg i am a devoted national socialist have overheard that a man with a russian connection intends to cause some damage at high levels in berlin in the next few days have not learned his identity yet but will continue to look into this matter and hope to send that information soon he was alive when he sparred there was no feeling like this dancing in the snug leather shoes muscles warm skin both cool from sweat and hot from blood the dynamo hum of your body in constant motion the pain too paul schumann believed you could learn a lot from pain that really was the whole point of it after all but mostly he liked sparring because like boxing itself success or failure rested solely on his own broad and slightly scarred shoulders and was due to his deft feet and powerful hands and his mind in boxing its only you against the other guy no teammates if you get beat its because hes better than you plain and simple and the credits yours if you win because you did the jump rope you laid off the booze and cigarettes you thought for hours and hours and hours about how to get under his guard about what his weaknesses were theres luck at ebbets field and yankee stadium but theres no luck in the boxing ring he was now dancing over the ring that had been set up on the main deck of the manhattan the whole ship had been turned into a floating gymnasium for training one of the olympic boxers had seen him working out at the punching bag last night and asked if he wanted to do some sparring this morning before the ship docked paul had immediately agreed he now dodged a few left jabs and connected with his signature right drawing a surprised blink from his opponent then paul took a hard blow to the gut before getting his guard up again he was a little stiff at first he hadnt been in a ring for a while but hed had this smart young sports doctor on board a fellow named joel koslow look him over and tell him he could go headtohead with a boxer half his age id keep it to two or three rounds though the doc had added with a smile these youngstersre strong they pack a wallop which was sure true but paul didnt mind the harder the workout the better in fact because like the shadowboxing and jump rope hed done every day on board this session was helping him stay in shape for what lay ahead in berlin paul sparred two or three times a week he was in some demand as a sparring partner even though he was fortyone because he was a walking lesson book of boxing techniques hed spar anywhere in brooklyn gyms in outdoor rings at coney island even in serious venues damon runyon was one of the founders of the twentieth century sporting club along with the legendary promoter mike jacobs and a few other newspapermen and hed gotten paul into new yorks hippodrome itself to work out once or twice hed actually gone glove to glove with some of the greats hed spar at his own gym too in the little building near the west side docks yeah avery its not so swank but the dingy musty place was a sanctuary as far as paul was concerned and sorry williams who lived in the back room always kept the place neat and had ice towels and beer handy the kid now feinted but paul knew immediately where the jab was coming from and blocked it then laid a solid blow on the chest he missed the next block though and felt the leather take him solidly on the jaw he danced out of the mans reach before the followthrough connected and they circled once more as they moved over the canvas paul noted that the boy was strong and fast but he couldnt detach himself from his opponent hed get overwhelmed with a lust to win well you needed desire of course but more important was calmly observing how the other guy moved looking for clues as to what he was going to do next this detachment was absolutely vital in being a great boxer and it was vital for a button man too he called it touching the ice several years ago sitting in hanrahans gin mill on fortyeighth street paul was nursing a painful shiner courtesy of beavo wayne who couldnt hit a midsection to save his soul but lord above could he open eyebrows as paul pressed a piece of cheap beefsteak to his face a huge negro pushed through the door making the daily delivery of ice most icemen used tongs and carried the blocks on their back but this guy carried it in his hands no gloves even paul watched him walk behind the bar and set the block in the trough hey pauld asked him you chip me off some of that the man looked at the purple blotch around pauls eye and laughed he pulled an ice pick out of a holster and chipped off a piece which paul wrapped in a napkin and held to his face he slid a dime to the deliveryman who said thanks fo that let me ask paul said how come you can carry that ice doesnt it hurt oh look here he held up his large hands the palms were scar tissue as smooth and pale as the parchment paper that pauls father had used when printing fancy invitations the negro explained ice can burn you too juss like fire like leavin a scar i been touchin ice fo so long i aint got no feelin left touching the ice that phrase stuck with paul it was he realized exactly what happened when he was on a job theres ice within all of us he believed we can choose to grip it or not now in this improbable gymnasium thousands of miles from home paul felt some of this same numbness as he lost himself in the choreography of the sparring match leather met leather and leather met skin and even in the cool air of dawn at sea these two men sweated hard as they circled looking for weaknesses sensing strengths sometimes connecting sometimes not but always vigilant theres no luck in the boxing ring albert heinsler perched beside a smokestack on one of the high decks of the manhattan and hooked the battery to the wireless set he took out the tiny blackandbrown telegraph key and mounted it to the top of the unit he was slightly troubled to be using an italian transmitter he thought mussolini treated the führer with disrespect but this was mere sentiment he knew that the allocchio bacchini was one of the best portable transmitters in the world as the tubes warmed up he tried the key dot dash dot dash his compulsive nature had driven him to practice for hours on end hed timed himself just before the ship sailed he could send a message of this length in under two minutes staring at the nearing shore heinsler inhaled deeply it felt good to be up here on the higher deck while he hadnt been condemned to his cabin retching and moaning like hundreds of the passengers and even some crew he hated the claustrophobia of being below his past career as shipboard bookkeeper had had more status than the job of porter and hed had a larger cabin on a high deck but no matter the honor of helping his surrogate country outweighed any discomfort finally a light glowed on the face plate of the radio unit he bent forward adjusted two of the dials and slipped his finger onto the tiny bakelite key he began transmitting the message which he translated into german as he keyed dot dot dash dot dot dot dash dot dash dot dash dash dash dash dot dot dot dot dot dash dot für ober he got no further than this heinsler gasped as a hand grabbed his collar from behind and pulled him backward off balance he cried out and fell to the smooth oak deck no no dont hurt me he started to rise to his feet but the large grimfaced man wearing a boxing outfit drew back a huge fist and shook his head dont move heinsler sank back to the deck shivering heinie heinie heinie the hun the boxer reached forward and ripped the battery wires off the unit downstairs he said gathering up the transmitter now and he yanked the aman to his feet whatre you up to go to hell the balding man said though with a quavering voice that belied his words they were in pauls cabin the transmitter battery and the contents of the mans pockets were strewn on the narrow cot paul repeated his question adding an ominous growl this time tell me a pounding on the cabin door paul stepped forward cocked his fist and opened the door vince manielli pushed inside i got your message what the hell is he fell silent staring at their prisoner paul handed him the wallet albert heinsler germanamerican bund oh christ not the bund he had that a nod at the wireless telegraph he was spying on us i dont know but he was just about to transmit something howd you tip to him call it a hunch paul didnt tell manielli that while he trusted gordon and his boys up to a point he didnt know how careless they might be at this sort of game they couldve been leaving behind a trail of clues a mile wide notes about the ship careless words about malone or another touchoff even references to paul himself he hadnt thought there was much of a risk from the nazis he was more concerned that word might get to some of his old enemies in brooklyn or jersey that he was on the ship and he wanted to be prepared so hed dipped into his own pocket just after theyd left port and slipped a senior mate a cnote asking him to find out about any crew members who were strangers to the regular crew kept to themselves were asking unusual questions any passengers too who seemed suspicious a hundred dollars buys a hell of a lot of detective work but throughout the voyage the mate had heard of nothing until this morning when hed interrupted pauls sparring match with the olympian to tell him that some of the crew had been talking about this porter heinsler he was always skulking around never spent time with fellow crew members and weirdest of all would start spouting hooey about the nazis and hitler at the drop of a hat alarmed paul tracked down heinsler and found him on the top deck hunched over his radio did he send anything manielli now asked not this morning i came up the stairs behind him and saw him setting the radio up he didnt have time to send more than a few letters but he mightve been transmitting all week manielli glanced down at the radio probably not with that the range is only a few miles what does he know ask him paul said so fella whats your game the bald man remained silent paul leaned forward spill heinsler gave an eerie smile he turned to manielli i heard you talking i know what youre up to but theyll stop you who put you up to this the bund heinsler scoffed nobody put me up to anything he was no longer cringing he said with breathless devotion im loyal to the new germany i love the führer and id do anything for him and the party and people like you oh can it manielli muttered what do you mean you heard us heinsler didnt answer he smiled smugly and looked out the porthole paul said he heard you and avery what were you saying the lieutenant looked down at the floor i dont know we went over the plan a couple of times just talking it through i dont remember exactly brother not in your cabin paul snapped you shouldve been up on deck where you could see if anybody was around i didnt think anybodyd be listening the lieutenant said defensively a trail of clues a mile wide whatre you going to do with him ill talk to avery theres a brig on board i guess well stow him there until we figure something out could we get him to the consulate in hamburg maybe i dont know but he fell silent frowning whats that smell paul too frowned a sudden bittersweet scent filled the cabin no heinsler was falling back on the pillow eyes rolling up in his sockets bits of white foam filling the corner of his mouth his body was convulsing horribly the scent was of almond cyanide manielli whispered he ran to the porthole and opened it wide paul took a pillowcase and carefully wiped the mans mouth fished inside for the capsule but he pulled out only a few shards of glass it had shattered completely he was dead by the time paul turned back from the basin with a glass of water to wash the poison out of his mouth he killed himself manielli whispered manically staring with wide eyes just right there he killed himself paul thought angrily and there goes a chance to find out anything more the lieutenant stared at the body shaken thiss a jam all right oh brother go tell avery but manielli seemed paralyzed paul took him firmly by the arm vince tell avery you listening to me what oh sure andy ill tell him yeah the lieutenant stepped outside a few dumbbells from the gymnasium tied to the waist would be heavy enough to sink the body in the ocean but the porthole here was only eight inches across and the manhattan s corridors were now filling with passengers getting ready to disembark there was no way to get him out through the interior of the ship theyd have to wait paul tucked the body under the blankets and turned its head aside as if heinsler were asleep then washed his own hands carefully in the tiny basin to make sure all the traces of poison were off ten minutes later there was a knock on the door and paul let manielli back inside andys contacting gordon its midnight in dc but hell track him down he couldnt stop staring at the body finally the lieutenant asked paul youre packed ready to go will be after i change he glanced down at his athletic shirt and shorts do that then go up top andy said we dont want things to look bum you disappearing and this guy too then his supervisor cant find him well meet you on the port side main deck in a half hour with a last glance toward heinslers body paul picked up his suitcase and shaving kit and headed down to the shower room after washing and shaving he dressed in a white shirt and gray flannel slacks forgoing his shortbrimmed brown stetson three or four landlubbers had already lost their straw boaters or trilbies overboard ten minutes later he was strolling along the solid oak decks in the pale early morning light paul stopped leaned on the rail and smoked a chesterfield he thought about the man whod just killed himself hed never understood that suicide the look in the mans eyes gave a clue paul supposed that fanatics shine heinsler reminded him of something hed read recently and after a moment he recalled the people suckered in by the revivalist minister in elmer gantry that popular sinclair lewis book i love the führer and id do anything for him and the party sure it was nuts that a man would just take his own life like that but what was more unsettling was what it told paul about the gray strip of land he was now gazing at how many people there had this same deadly passion people like dutch schultz and siegel were dangerous but you could understand them what this man had done that look in his eyes the breathless devotion well they were nuts way out of kilter pauld never been up against anyone like that his thoughts were interrupted as he looked to his side and noticed a wellbuilt young negro walking toward him he wore a thin blue olympic team jacket and shorts revealing powerful legs they nodded greetings excuse me sir the man said softly how you doing there fine paul answered yourself love the morning air lot cleaner than in cleveland or new york they looked over the water saw you sparring earlier you pro an old man like me just do it for the exercise im jesse oh yes sir i know who you are paul said the buckeye bullet from ohio state they shook hands paul introduced himself despite the shock of what had happened in his cabin he couldnt stop grinning i saw the newsreels of the western conference meet last year ann arbor you beat three world records and tied another one right mustve seen that film a dozen times but ill bet youre tired of hearing people tell you that i dont mind it one bit no sir jesse owens said just im always surprised people keep up so close with what i do just running and jumping havent seen much of you on the trip paul ive been around paul said evasively he wondered if owens knew something about whatd happened to heinsler had he overheard them or seen paul grab the man on the top deck by the smokestack but he decided the athlete wouldve been more troubled if that had been the case it seemed he had something else in mind paul nodded toward the deck behind them this is the biggest damn gym ive ever seen you like it im glad for the chance to train but a track shouldnt move and it definitely shouldnt rock up and down like we were doing a few days ago give me dirt or cinders any day paul said so thats our boxer i was up against thats right nice fellow i spoke to him some hes good paul said without much enthusiasm seems to be the runner said it was clear he too knew boxing wasnt the strong suit of the american team but owens wasnt inclined to criticize a fellow athlete paul had heard that the negro was among the most genial of the americans hed come in second in the mostpopularathleteonboard contest last night after glenn cunningham id offer you a ciggie owens laughed not for me ive pretty much given up offering butts and hits from my flask you folksre too damn healthy another laugh then silence for a moment as the solid negro looked out to sea say paul i got a question you here officially officially with the committee i mean maybe like a guard me why do you say that you sort of seemed like a well soldier or something and then the way you were fighting you knew what you were doing i was in the war thats probably what you noticed maybe then owens added course that was twenty years ago and those two fellows ive seen you talking with theyre navy we heard em talking to one of the crew brother another trail of clues those two guys just bumped into em on board im bumming a ride with you folks doing some stories about sports boxing in berlin the games im a writer oh sure owens nodded slowly he seemed to debate for a moment well if youre a reporter you still might know something bout what i was going to ask you just wondering if you heard anything about those two fellows he nodded at some men on the deck nearby running in tandem passing the relay baton they were lightning fast whore they paul asked sam stoller and marty glickman theyre good runners some of the best weve got but i heard a rumor they might not run wondered if you knew anything about that nope nothing you mean some qualification problem injury i mean because theyre jewish paul shook his head he recalled there was a controversy about hitler not liking jews there was some protest and talk about moving the olympics some people even wanted the us team to boycott the games damon runyon had been all hot under the collar about the country even participating but why would the american committee pull some athletes because they were jewish thatd be a bum deal doesnt seem right by a long shot no sir anyway i was just thinking maybe youd heard something sorry cant help you friend paul said they were joined by another negro ralph metcalfe introduced himself paul knew about him too hed won medals in the los angeles olympics in owens noticed vince manielli looking down at them from an upper deck the lieutenant nodded and started for the stairs here comes your buddy that you just met on board owens had a sly grin on his face not completely convinced that pauld been on the level the negros eyes looked forward at the growing strip of land imagine that were almost in germany never thought id be traveling like this life can be a pretty amazing thing dont you think that it can paul agreed the runners said goodbye and jogged off was that owens manielli asked walking up and leaning against the railing he turned his back to the wind and rolled a cigarette yep paul pulled a chesterfield out of a pack lit it in cupped hands and offered the matches to the lieutenant he too lit up nice man though a little too sharp paul thought damn that man can run whatd he say we were just shooting the breeze in a whisper whats the situation with our friend down below averys handling it manielli said ambiguously hes in the radio room be here in a minute a plane flew overhead low they watched it for several minutes in silence the kid still seemed shaken by the suicide not in the same way paul was though because the death told him something troubling about the people he was going up against no the sailor was upset because hed just seen death up close and for the first time it was pretty clear paul knew there were two kinds of punks they both talked loud and they both blustered and they both had strong arms and big fists but one kind would leap for the chance to give knuckle and take it touching the ice and the other wouldnt it was the second category that vince manielli fell into he was really just a good boy from the neighborhood he liked to sling out words like button man and knock off to show he knew what they meant but he was as far from pauls world though as marion was marion the good girl who flirted with bad but like the mob boss lucky luciano had once told him flirting aint fucking manielli seemed to be waiting for paul to comment on the dead sap heinsler something about the guy deserving to die or that he was nuts in the head people always wanted to hear that about somebody who died that it was their own fault or they deserved it or it was inevitable but death is never symmetrical and tidy and the button man had nothing to say a thick silence filled the space between them and a moment later andrew avery joined them he was carrying a folder of papers and an old battered leather briefcase he looked around there was no one within earshot pull up a chair paul found a heavy wooden white deck chair and carried it over to the sailors he didnt need to carry it in one hand wouldve been easier in two but he liked seeing maniellis blink when he hefted the furniture and swung it over without a grunt paul sat down heres the wire the lieutenant whispered the commanders not so worried about this heinsler guy the allocchio bacchinis a small wireless its made for fieldwork and airplanes short range and even if he got a message off berlin probably wouldnt pay it much attention the bunds an embarrassment to them but gordon said its up to you if you want out thats okay but no getoutofjail card paul said no card avery said this deal just keeps getting sweeter and sweeter the button man gave a sour laugh youre still in im in yeah a nod toward the deck below whatll happen to the body after everybody disembarks some marines from the hamburg consulatell come on board and take care of it then avery leaned forward and said in a low voice okay heres whats going to happen about your mission paul after we dock you get off and vince and ill take care of the situation with heinsler then were going on to amsterdam you stay with the team therell be a brief ceremony in hamburg and then everybody takes the train to berlin the athletesll have another ceremony tonight but you go straight to the olympic village and stay out of sight tomorrow morning take a bus to the tiergarten thats the central park of berlin he handed the briefcase to paul take this with you what is it its part of your cover press pass paper pencils a lot of background about the games and the city a guide to the olympic village articles clippings sports statistics the sort of stuff a writerd have you dont need to look at it now but paul opened the case and spent some minutes looking carefully going through the contents the pass avery assured him was authentic and he could spot nothing suspicious about the other materials you dont trust anybody do you manielli asked thinking itd be fun to sock the punk once really hard paul clicked the briefcase closed and looked up what about my other passport the russian one our manll give that to you there hes got a forger whos an expert with european documents now tomorrow make sure you have the satchel with you its how hell recognize you he unfurled a colorful map of berlin and traced a route get off here and go this way make your way to a café called the bierhaus avery looked at paul who was staring at the map you can take it with you you dont have to memorize it but paul shook his head maps tell people where youve been or where youre going and looking at one on the street draws everybodys attention to you if youre lost better just to ask directions that way only one person knows youre a stranger not a whole crowd avery lifted an eyebrow and even manielli couldnt find anything to razz him about on this point near the café theres an alley dresden alley itll have a name in germany the alleys have names some of them do its a shortcut doesnt matter where to at noon walk into it and stop like youre lost our manll come up to you hes the guy the senator was telling you about reginald morgan reggie describe him short mustache darkish hair hell be speaking german hell strike up a conversation at some point you ask whats the best tram to take to get to alexanderplatz and hell say the number one thirtyeight tram then hell pause and correct himself and say no the two fiftyfour is better youll know its him because those arent real tram numbers you look like thiss funny manielli added its right out of dashiell hammett the continental op this aint a game no it wasnt and he didnt think the passwords were funny but it was unsettling all this intrigue stuff and he knew why because it meant he was relying on other people paul schumann hated to do that all right alexanderplatz trams one thirtyeight two fiftyfour what if he flubs the tram story its not him im getting to that if something seems fishy what you do is you dont hit him you dont make a scene just smile and walk away as casually as you can and go to this address avery gave him a slip of paper with a street name and number on it paul memorized it and handed the paper back the lieutenant gave him a key which he pocketed theres an old palace just south of brandenburg gate it was going to be the new us embassy but there was a bad fire about five years ago and theyre still repairing it the diplomats havent moved in so the french germans and british dont bother to snoop around the place but weve got a couple of rooms there we use from time to time theres a wireless in the storeroom next to the kitchen you can radio us in amsterdam and well place a call to commander gordon he and the senatorll decide what to do next but if everythings silk morganll take care of you get you into the boardinghouse find you a weapon and get all the information you need on the the man youre going to visit we people say touchoff and remember manielli was pleased to announce you dont show up in dresden alley tomorrow or you give morgan the slip later he calls us and we make sure the police come down on you like a ton of bricks paul said nothing and let the boy have his bluster he could tell manielli was embarrassed about his reaction to heinslers suicide and he needed to jerk some leash but in fact there was no possibility that paul was going to lam off bull gordon was right button men never got a second chance like he was being given and a pile of dough that would let him make the most of it then the men fell silent there was nothing more to say sounds filled the damp pungent air around them the wind the shusssh of the waves the baritone grind of the manhattan s engines a blend of tones that he found oddly comforting despite heinslers suicide and the arduous mission that lay ahead finally the sailors went below paul rose lit another cigarette and leaned against the railing once more as the huge ship eased into the harbor in hamburg his thoughts wholly focused on colonel reinhard ernst a man whose ultimate importance to paul schumann had little to do with his potential threat to peace in europe and to so many innocent lives but could be found in the fact that he was the last person that the button man would ever kill several hours after the manhattan docked and the athletes and their entourage had disembarked a young crewman from the ship exited german passport control and began wandering through the streets of hamburg he wouldnt have much time ashore being so junior he had a leave of only six hours but hed spent all his life on american soil and was bound and determined to enjoy his first visit to a foreign country the scrubbed rosycheeked assistant kitchen mate supposed there were probably some swell museums in town maybe some allright churches too he had his kodak with him and was planning to ask locals to take some snapshots of him in front of them for his ma and pa bitte das foto hed been rehearsing not to mention beer halls and taverns and who knew what else he might find for diversion in an exotic port city but before he could sample some local culture he had an errand to complete hed been concerned that this chore would eat into his precious time ashore but as it turned out he was wrong only a few minutes after leaving the customs hall he found exactly what he was looking for the mate walked up to a middleaged man in a green uniform and a blackandgreen hat he tried out his german bitte ja mein herr squinting the mate blundered on bitte du bist ein polizist uhm or a soldat the officer smiled and said in english yes yes i am a policeman and i was a soldier what can i help you for nodding down the street the kitchen mate said i found this on the ground he handed the man a white envelope isnt that the word for important he pointed to the letters on the front bedeutend i wanted to make sure it got turned in staring at the front of the envelope the policeman didnt respond for a moment then he said yes yes important the other words written on the front were für obersturmführerss hamburg the mate had no idea what this meant but it seemed to trouble the policeman where was this falling the policeman asked it was on the sidewalk there good you are thanked the officer continued to look at the sealed envelope he turned it over in his hand you were seeing perhaps who dropped it nope just saw it there and thought id be a good samaritan ach yes samaritan well i better scram the american said so long danke the policeman said absently as he headed back toward one of the more intriguing tourist sites hed passed the young man was wondering what exactly the envelope contained and why the man hed met on the manhattan the porter al heinsler had asked him last night to deliver it to a local policeman or soldier after the ship docked the fellow was a little nuts everybody agreed the way everything in his cabin was perfectly ordered and clean nothing out of line his clothes pressed all the time the way he kept to himself the way he got all weteyed talking about germany sure what is it the mate had asked there was a passenger on board who seemed a little fishy im letting the germans know about him im going to try to send a wireless message but sometimes they dont go through i want to make sure the authorities get it whos the passenger oh hold up i know that fat guy in the checkered suit the one who passed out drunk at the captains table no it was somebody else why not go to the sergeantatarms on board its a german matter oh and you cant deliver it heinsler had folded his pudgy hands together in a creepy way and shook his head i dont know how busy ill be i heard you had leave its real important the germans get it well i guess sure heinsler had added in a soft voice one other thing itd be better to say you found the letter otherwise they might take you into the station and question you that could take hours it could use up all your shore leave the young mate had felt a little uneasy at this intrigue heinsler had picked up on that and added quickly heres a twenty jesus mary and joseph the man had thought and told the porter you just bought yourself a special delivery now as he walked away from the policeman and headed back toward the waterfront he wondered absently what had happened to heinsler the young man hadnt seen him since last night but thoughts about the porter vanished quickly as the mate approached the venue hed spotted the one that seemed like a perfect choice for his first taste of german culture he was however disappointed to find that rosas hot kitten club the enticing name conveniently spelled in english was permanently closed just like every other such attraction on the waterfront so the mate thought with a sigh looks like itll be churches and museums after all chapter four he awoke to the sound of a hazel grouse fluttering into the sky from the gooseberry bushes just outside the bedroom window of his home in suburban charlottenburg he awoke to the smell of magnolia he awoke to the touch of the infamous berlin wind which according to young men and old housewives was infused with an alkaline dust that aroused earthy desires whether it was the magic air or being a man of a certain age reinhard ernst found himself picturing his attractive brunette wife of twentyeight years gertrud he rolled over to face her and he found himself looking at the empty indentation in their down bed he could not help but smile he was forever exhausted in the evenings after working sixteenhour days and she always rose early because it was her nature lately they had rarely even shared so much as a word or two in bed he now heard from downstairs the clatter of activity in the kitchen the time was a m ernst had had just over four hours of sleep ernst stretched lifting his damaged arm as far as he could massaging it and feeling the triangular piece of metal lodged near the shoulder there was a familiarity and curiously a comfort about the shrapnel ernst believed in embracing the past and he appreciated all the emblems of years gone by even those that had nearly taken his limb and his life he climbed from the bed and pulled off his nightshirt since frieda would be in the house by now ernst tugged on beige jodhpurs and forgoing a shirt stepped into the study next to the bedroom the fiftysixyearold colonel had a round head covered with cropped gray hair creases circled his mouth his small nose was roman and his eyes set close together making him seem both predatory and savvy these features had earned him the nickname caesar from his men in the war during the summer he and his grandson rudy would often exercise together in the morning rolling the medicine ball and lifting indian clubs doing pressups and running in place on wednesdays and fridays though the boy had holidaychildschool which began early so ernst was relegated to solo exercise which was a disappointment to him he began his fifteen minutes of arm pressups and knee bends halfway through he heard opa breathing hard ernst paused and looked into the hallway good morning rudy look what ive drawn the sevenyearold dressed in his uniform held up a picture ernst didnt have his glasses on and he couldnt make out the design clearly but the boy said its an eagle yes of course it is i can tell and its flying through a lightning storm quite a brave eagle youve drawn are you coming to breakfast yes tell your grandmother ill be down in ten minutes did you eat an egg today the boy said yes i did excellent eggs are good for you tomorrow ill draw a hawk the slight blond boy turned and ran back down the stairs ernst returned to his exercising thinking about the dozens of matters that needed attending to today he finished his regimen and bathed his body with cold water wiping away both sweat and alkaline dust as he was drying the telephone buzzed his hands paused in these days no matter how high one was in the national socialist government a telephone call at an odd hour was a matter of concern reinie gertrud called someone has telephoned for you he pulled on his shirt and not bothering with stockings or shoes walked down the stairs he took the receiver from his wife yes this is ernst colonel he recognized the voice of one of hitlers secretaries miss lauer good morning and to you i am asked to tell you that your presence is required by the leader at the chancellory immediately if you have any other plans im asked to tell you to alter them please tell chancellor hitler that i will leave at once in his office that is correct who else will be attending there was a moments hesitation then she said thats all the information i have colonel hail hitler hail hitler he hung up and stared at the phone his hand on the receiver opa you have no shoes on rudy had come up beside ernst still clutching his drawing he laughed looking at his grandfathers bare feet i know rudy i must finish dressing he looked for a long moment at the telephone what is it opa something is wrong nothing rudy mutti says your breakfast is getting cold you ate all your egg did you yes opa good fellow tell your grandmother and your mutti that ill be downstairs in a few moments but tell them to begin their breakfast without me ernst started up the stairs to shave observing that his desire for his wife and his hunger for the breakfast awaiting him had both vanished completely forty minutes later reinhard ernst was walking through the corridors of the state chancellory building on wilhelm street at voss street in central berlin dodging construction workers the building was old parts of it dated to the eighteenth century and had been the home of german leaders since bismarck hitler would fly into tirades occasionally about the shabbiness of the structure and since the new chancellory was not close to being finished was constantly ordering renovations to the old one but construction and architecture were of no interest to ernst at the moment the one thought in his mind was this what will the consequences of my mistake be how bad was my miscalculation he lifted his arm and gave a perfunctory hail hitler to a guard who had enthusiastically saluted the plenipotentiary for domestic stability a title as heavy and embarrassing to wear as a wet threadbare coat ernst continued down the corridor his face emotionless revealing nothing of the turbulent thoughts about the crime he had committed and what was that crime the infraction of not sharing all with the leader this would be a minor matter in other countries perhaps but here it could be a capital offense yet sometimes you couldnt share all if you did give hitler all the details of an idea his mind might snag on its most insignificant aspect and that would be the end of it shot dead with one word never mind that you had no personal gain at stake and were thinking only of the good of the fatherland but if you didnt tell him ach that could be far worse in his paranoia he might decide that you were withholding information for a reason and then the great piercing eye of the partys security mechanism would turn toward you and your loved ones sometimes with deadly consequences as reinhard ernst was convinced had now occurred given the mysterious and peremptory summons to an early unscheduled meeting the third empire was order and structure and regularity personified anything out of the ordinary was cause for alarm ach he should have told the man something about the waltham study when ernst had first conceived it this past march yet the leader defense minister von blomberg and ernst himself had been so occupied with retaking the rhineland that the study had paled beside the monumental risk of reclaiming a portion of their country stolen away by the allies at versailles and truth be told much of the study was based on academic work that hitler would find suspect if not inflammatory ernst simply hadnt wanted to bring the matter up and now he was going to pay for that oversight he announced himself to hitlers secretary and was admitted ernst walked inside the large anteoffice and found himself standing before adolf hitler leader chancellor and president of the third empire and ultimate commander of the armed forces thinking as he often did if charisma energy and canniness are the prime ingredients of power then here is the most powerful man in the world wearing a brown uniform and glossy black knee boots hitler was bending over a desk leafing through papers my leader ernst said nodding respectfully and offering a gentle heel tap a throwback to the days of the second empire which had ended eighteen years before with germanys surrender and the flight of kaiser wilhelm to holland though giving the party salute with hail hitler or hail victory was expected from citizens the formality was rarely seen among the higher echelon of officials except from the drippier sycophants colonel hitler glanced up at ernst with his pale blue eyes beneath drooping lids eyes that for some reason left the impression that the man was considering a dozen things at once his mood was forever unreadable hitler found the document he sought and turned and walked into his large but modestly decorated office please join us ernst followed his still soldiers face gave no reaction but his heart sank when he saw who else was present sweating and massive hermann göring lounged on a couch that creaked under his weight claiming he was always in pain the roundfaced man was continually adjusting himself in ways that made one want to cringe his excessive cologne filled the room the air minister nodded a greeting to ernst who reciprocated another man sat in an ornate chair sipping coffee his legs crossed like a womans the clubfooted scarecrow paul joseph goebbels the state propaganda minister ernst didnt doubt his skill he was largely responsible for the partys early vital foothold in berlin and prussia still ernst despised the man who couldnt stop gazing at the leader with adoring eyes and smugly dishing up damning gossip about prominent jews and socis one moment then dropping the names of famous german actors and actresses from ufa studios the next ernst said good morning to him and then sat recalling a recent joke that had made the rounds describe the ideal aryan why hes as blond as hitler as slim as göring and as tall as goebbels hitler offered the document to puffyeyed göring who read it nodded and then put it into his sumptuous leather folder without comment the leader sat and poured himself chocolate he lifted an eyebrow toward goebbels meaning he should continue with whatever he had been discussing and ernst realized his fate regarding the waltham study would have to remain in limbo for sometime longer as i was saying my leader many of the visitors to the olympics will be interested in entertainment we have cafés and theater we have museums parks movie theaters they can see our babelsberg films they can see greta garbo and jean harlow and charles laughton and mickey mouse the impatient tone in hitlers voice told ernst he knew exactly what kind of entertainment goebbels had meant there followed an excruciatingly long and edgy debate about letting legal prostitutes licensed control girls out on the streets again hitler was against this idea at first but goebbels had thought through the matter and argued persuasively the leader relented eventually on the condition that there be no more than seven thousand women throughout the metropolitan area similarly the penal code provision banning homosexuality article would be relaxed temporarily rumors abounded about hitlers own preferences from incest to boys to animals to human waste ernst had come to believe though that the man simply had no interest in sex the only lover he desired was the nation of germany finally goebbels continued suavely there is the matter of public display i am thinking that perhaps we might permit womens skirts to be shortened somewhat as the head of germanys third empire and his adjutant debated in centimeters the degree to which berlin women might be allowed to conform to world fashion the worm of ill ease continued to eat away at ernsts heart why hadnt he at least mentioned the name of the waltham study some months ago he could have sent a letter to the leader with a glancing reference to it one had to be savvy about such things nowadays the debate continued then the leader said firmly skirts may be raised five centimeters that settles it but we will not approve makeup yes my leader a moment of silence as hitlers eyes settled in the corner of the room as they often did he then glanced sharply at ernst colonel yes sir hitler rose and walked to his desk he lifted a piece of paper and walked slowly back to the others göring and goebbels kept their eyes on ernst though each believed he had the special ear of the leader deep within him was the fear that the grace was temporary or more frightening illusory and at any moment he would be sitting here like ernst a tethered badger though probably without the quiet aplomb of the colonel the leader wiped his mustache an important matter of course my leader however i may help ernst held the mans eyes and answered in a steady voice it involves our air force ernst glanced at göring ruddy cheeks framing a faux smile a daring ace in the war though dismissed by baron von richthofen himself for repeatedly attacking civilians he was presently both air minister and commander in chief of the german air force the latter currently being his favorite among the dozen titles he held it was on the subject of the german air force that göring and ernst met most frequently and clashed the most passionately hitler handed the document to ernst you read english some this is a letter from mr charles lindbergh himself hitler said proudly he will be attending the olympics as our special guest really this was exciting information both smiling göring and goebbels leaned forward and rapped on the table in front of them signifying approval of this news ernst took the letter in his right hand the back of which like his shoulder was shrapnel scarred lindbergh ernst had avidly followed the story of the mans transatlantic flight but hed been far more moved by the terrible account of the death of the aviators son ernst knew the horror of losing a child the accidental explosion on a ships magazine that had taken mark was tragic wrenching yes but at least ernsts son had been at the helm of a combat ship and had lived to see his own boy rudy born to lose an infant to the hands of a criminal that was appalling ernst scanned the document and was able to make out the cordial words which expressed an interest in seeing germanys recent developments in aviation the leader continued this is why i have asked for you colonel some people think that it would be of strategic value to show the world our increasing strength in the air i am inclined to feel this way myself what do you think about a small air show in honor of mr lindbergh in which we demonstrate our new monoplane ernst was greatly relieved that the summons had not been about the waltham study but the relief lasted only a moment his concerns rose once again as he considered what he was being asked and the answer he had to give the some people hitler was referring to was of course hermann göring the monoplane sir ah the me by messerschmitt was a superb killing machine a fighter with a speed of three hundred miles per hour there were other monowing fighters in the world but this was the fastest more important though the me was of allmetal construction which ernst had long advocated because it allowed easy mass production and field repair and maintenance large numbers of the planes were necessary to support the devastating bombing missions that ernst planned as precursors for any land invasion by the third empires army he cocked his head as if considering the question though hed made his decision the instant hed heard it i would be against that idea my leader why hitlers eyes flared a sign that a tantrum might follow possibly accompanied by what was nearly as bad an endless ranting monologue about military history or politics are we not allowed to protect ourselves are we ashamed to let the world know that we reject the thirdclass role the allies keep trying to push us into careful now ernst thought careful as a surgeon removing a tumor im not thinking of the backstabbers treaty of ernst answered filling his voice with contempt for the versailles accord i am thinking of how wise it might be to let others know about this aircraft its constructed in a way that those familiar with aviation would spot as unique they could deduce that it is being mass produced lindbergh could easily recognize this he himself designed his spirit of st louis i believe avoiding eye contact with ernst göring predictably said we must begin to let our enemies know our strength perhaps ernst said slowly a possibility would be to display one of the prototypes of the oneohnine at the olympics they were constructed more by hand than our production models and have no armament mounted and theyre equipped with british rollsroyce engines the world could then see our technological achievement yet be disarmed by the fact that we are using our former enemys motors which would suggest that any offensive use is far from our thoughts hitler said there is something to your point reinhard yes we will not put on an air show and we will display the prototype good that is decided thank you for coming colonel my leader bathed in relief ernst rose he was nearly to the door when göring said casually oh reinhard a matter occurs to me i believe a file of yours was misdirected to my office ernst turned back to examine the smiling moonish face the eyes however seethed from ernsts victory in the fighter debate he wanted revenge göring squinted i believe it had to do with what was it the waltham study yes god in heaven hitler was paying no attention he unfurled an architectural drawing and studied it closely misdirected ernst asked filched by one of görings spies was the true meaning of this word thank you mr minister he said lightly ill have someone pick it up immediately good day to but the deflection of course was ineffectual göring continued you were fortunate that the file was delivered to me imagine what some people mightve thought to see jew writing with your name on it hitler looked up what is this sweating prodigiously as always göring wiped his face and replied the waltham study that colonel ernst has commissioned hitler shook his head and the minister persisted oh i assumed our leader knew about it tell me hitler demanded göring said i know nothing about it i only received mistakenly as i say several reports written by those jew mind doctors one by that austrian freud someone named weiss others i cant recall he added with a twist of his lips those psychologists in the hierarchy of hitlers hatred jews came first communists second and intellectuals third psychologists were particularly disparaged since they rejected racial science the belief that race determined behavior a cornerstone of national socialist thought is this true reinhard ernst said casually as part of my job i read many documents on aggression and conflict thats what these writings deal with youve never mentioned this to me and with his characteristic instinct for sniffing out the merest hint of conspiracy hitler asked quickly defense minister von blomberg is he familiar with this study of yours no theres nothing to report at this time as the name suggests its merely a study being conducted through waltham military college to gather information thats all nothing may come of it ashamed to be playing this game he added putting some of goebbelss sycophantic shine in his eyes but it is possible that the results will show us ways in which to create a much stronger more efficient army to achieve the glorious goals youve established for our fatherland ernst could not tell if this bootlicking had any effect hitler rose and paced he walked to an elaborate model of the olympic stadium grounds and stared at it for a long moment ernst could feel his heartbeat thudding all the way to his teeth the leader turned and shouted i wish to see my architect immediately yes sir his aide said and hurried to the anteoffice a moment later a man entered the room though it was not albert speer but blackuniformed heinrich himmler whose weak chin diminutive physique and round blackrimmed glasses nearly made you forget that he was the absolute ruler of the ss gestapo and every other police force in the country himmler gave his typical stiff salute and turned his adoring bluegray eyes toward hitler who responded with his own standard greeting a limp overtheshoulder flap the ss leader glanced around the room and concluded that he could share whatever news had brought him here hitler gestured absently toward the coffee and chocolate service himmler shook his head usually in utter control aside from the fawning looks sent the leaders way the police chief today had an edginess about him ernst observed i have a security matter to report an ss commander in hamburg received a letter this morning dated today it was addressed to him by title but not name it claimed that some russian was going to cause some damage in berlin in the next few days at high levels it said written by whom he described himself as a loyal national socialist but gave no name it was found in the street we dont know any more about its origin revealing perfectly white even teeth the man gave a wince like a child disappointing his parent he removed his glasses wiped the lenses and replaced them whoever sent it said that he was continuing to investigate and would send the mans identity when he learned it but we never heard anything further finding the note in the street suggests the sender was intercepted and perhaps killed we might never learn more hitler asked the language german yes my leader damage what sort of damage we dont know ach the bolsheviks would love to disrupt our games hitlers face was a mask of fury göring asked you think its legitimate himmler replied it may be nothing but tens of thousands of foreigners are passing through hamburg these days its possible someone learned of a plot and didnt want to get involved so he wrote an anonymous note i would urge everyone here to exercise particular caution i will contact military commanders too and the other ministers ive told all our security forces to look into the matter his voice raw with anger hitler raged do what you must everything there will be no taint on our games and unnervingly a fraction of a second later his voice was calm and his blue eyes bright he leaned forward to refill his cup with chocolate and place two zwieback biscuits on the saucer please now you may all leave thank you i need to consider some building matters he called to the aide in the doorway where is speer he will be here momentarily my leader the men walked to the door ernsts heart had resumed its normal slow beat what had just happened was typical of the way the inner circle of the national socialist government worked intrigue which could have disastrous results simply vanished like crumbs swept over the door stoop as for görings plotting well he colonel hitlers voice called ernst stopped immediately and looked back the leader was staring at the mockup of the stadium examining the newly constructed train station he said you will prepare a report on this waltham study of yours in detail i will receive it on monday yes of course my leader at the door göring held his arm out palm upward letting ernst exit first i will see that you receive those misdirected documents reinhard and i do hope you and gertrud will attend my olympic party thank you mr minister i will make a point of being there friday evening misty and warm fragrant with the scent of cut grass overturned earth and sweet fresh paint paul schumann strolled by himself through the olympic village a half hour west of berlin hed arrived not long before after the complicated journey from hamburg it had been an exhausting day yes but invigorating too and he was stoked by the excitement of being in a foreign land his ancestral home and the anticipation of his mission he had shown his press pass and been admitted to the american portion of the village dozens of buildings housing fifty or sixty people each hed left his suitcase and satchel in one of the small guestrooms in the back where hed stay for a few nights and was now walking through the spotless grounds as he looked around the village he was amused paul schumann was used to a lot rougher venues for sports his own gym for instance which hadnt been painted in five years and smelled of sweat and rotten leather and beer no matter how energetically sorry williams scrubbed and mopped the village was however just what the name suggested a quaint town all its own set in a birch forest the place was beautifully laid out in sweeping arcs of low immaculate buildings with a lake and curved paths and trails for running and walking training fields and even its own sports arena according to the guidebook andrew avery had included in his satchel the village had a customs office stores pressroom a post office and bank gas station sporting goods store souvenir stands food shops and travel office the athletes were presently at the welcoming ceremony which hed been urged to attend by jesse owens ralph metcalfe and the young boxer hed sparred with but now that he was in the locale of the touchoff he needed to lay low hed begged off saying he had to get some work done for interviews the next morning hed eaten in the dining hall had one of the best steaks of his life and after a coffee and a chesterfield was now finishing his walk through the village the only thing troubling to him considering the reason he was in the country was that each nations dorm complex was assigned a german soldier a liaison officer in the us facility this was a stern young brownhaired man in a gray uniform that seemed unbearably uncomfortable in the heat paul stayed as clear of him as possible the contact here reginald morgan had warned avery that paul should be wary of anyone in uniform he used only the back door to his dorm and made sure the guard never got a close look at him as he strolled along the swept sidewalk he saw one of the american track athletes with a young woman and baby several team members had brought wives and other relatives with them this put paul in mind of the conversation with his brother last week just before the manhattan had sailed paul had distanced himself from his brother and sister and their families for the past decade he didnt want to visit the violence and danger tainting his own life on theirs his sister lived in chicago and he got there rarely but he did see hank sometimes he lived on long island and ran the printing plant that was the descendant of their grandfathers he was a solid husband and father who didnt know for sure what his brother did for a living except that he associated with tough guys and criminals although paul hadnt shared any personal information with bull gordon or the others in the room the main reason hed decided to agree to come to germany for this job was that wiping his record clean and getting all that scratch might let him reconnect with the family which hed dreamed about doing for years hed had a shot of whisky then another and finally picked up the phone and called his brother at home after ten minutes of nervous small talk about the heat wave and the yankees and hanks two boys paul had taken the plunge and asked if hank might be interested in having a partner at schumann printing he quickly reassured im not having anything to do with my old crowd anymore then he added that he could bring into the business legit dough one hundred percent mother of pearl hank said and theyd both laughed at the expression a favorite of their fathers theres one problem hank added gravely paul understood that the man was about to say no thinking of his brothers shady career but the elder schumann added well have to buy a new sign theres not enough room for schumann brothers printing on the one i got the ice broken they talked about the plan some more paul was surprised that hank sounded almost tearfully touched at this overture family was key to hank and he couldnt understand pauls distance in the past ten years tall beautiful marion paul had decided would like that life too oh she played at being bad but it was an act and paul knew enough to give her only a small taste of the seamy life hed introduced her to damon runyon served her beer in a bottle at the gym taken her to the bar in hells kitchen where owney madden used to charm ladies with his british accent and show off his pearlhandled pistols but he knew that like a lot of renegade college girls marion would get tired of the tough life if she actually had to live it dimedancing would wear thin as well and shed want something more stable being the wife of a welloff printer would be aces hank had said he was going to talk to his lawyer and have a partnership agreement drawn up for paul to sign as soon as he got back from his business trip now returning to his room at the dorm paul noticed three boys in shorts brown shirts and black ties wearing brown militarystyle hats hed seen dozens of such youngsters here assisting the teams the trio marched toward a tall pole at the top of which flew the nazi flag paul had seen the banner in newsreels and in the papers but the images had always been in black and white even now at dusk the flags crimson was striking brilliant as fresh blood one boy noticed him watching and asked in german you are an athlete sir yet youre not at the ceremony we are hosting paul thought it better not to give away his linguistic skills even to boy scouts so he said in english sorry i dont speak german so well the boy switched to pauls language you are an athlete no im a journalist you are english or american american ach the cheerful youngster said in a thick accent welcome to berlin mein herr thank you the second boy noted pauls gaze and said you are liking our partys flag it is would you say impressing yes yeah it is the stars and stripes was somehow softer this flag sort of punched you the first boy said please each parts is having a meaning an important meaning do you know what are those no tell me paul looked up at the banner happy to explain he said enthusiastically red that is socialism the white is no doubt for nationalism and the black the hooked cross you would say swastika he looked at paul with a raised eyebrow and said nothing more yes paul said go on what does that mean the boy glanced at his companions then back to paul with a curious smile he said ach surely you know to his friends he said in german i will lower the flag now smiling he repeated to paul surely you know and frowning in concentration he brought the flag down as the other two extended their hands in one of those stiffarmed salutes you saw everywhere as paul walked toward the dorm the boys broke into a song which they sang with uneven energetic voices he heard snatches of it rising and falling on the hot air as he strolled away hold high the banner close the ranks the sa marches on with firm steps give way give way to the brown battalions as the stormtroopers clear the land the trumpet callsits final blast for battle we stand ready soon all streets will see hitlers flag and our slavery will be over paul looked back to see them fold the flag reverently and march off with it he slipped through the back entrance of his dorm and returned to his room where he washed cleaned his teeth then stripped and dropped onto his bed he stared at the ceiling for a long time waiting for sleep as he thought about heinsler the man whod killed himself that morning on the ship making such a passionate foolish sacrifice thinking too of reinhard ernst and finally as he began to doze thinking of the boy in the brown uniform seeing his mysterious smile hearing his voice over and over surely you know surely you know iii görings hat saturday july chapter five the streets of berlin were immaculate and the people pleasant many nodding as he walked past carting the beatup old briefcase paul schumann was walking north through the tiergarten it was late morning on saturday and he was on his way to meet reggie morgan the park was beautiful filled with dense trees walkways and lakes gardens in new yorks central park you were forever aware of the city around you the skyscrapers were visible everywhere but berlin was a low city very few tall buildings here cloud catchers he overheard a woman say to a young child on the bus on his walk through the park with its black trees and thick vegetation he lost any sense that he was in the city at all it reminded paul of the dense woods in upstate new york where his grandfather had taken him hunting every summer until the old mans failing health had prevented them from making the trips an uneasiness crept over him this was a familiar feeling the heightened senses at the beginning of a job when he was looking over the touchoffs office or apartment following him learning what he could about the man instinctively he paused from time to time and would glance casually behind him as if orienting himself no one seemed to be following but he couldnt tell for sure the forest was very dim in places and someone might easily have been eyeing him several scruffy men looked his way suspiciously and then slipped into the trees or bushes probably hoboes or bums but he took no chances and changed direction a number of times to throw off anyone who might be tailing him he crossed the murky spree river and found spener street then continued north away from the park noting that curiously the homes were in vastly different states of repair some were grand while right next door might be others that were abandoned and derelict he passed one in which brown weeds filled the front yard at one point the house had clearly been very luxurious now most of the windows were broken and someone young punks he assumed had splashed yellow paint on it a sign announced that a sale of the contents would be taking place on saturday tax problems maybe paul thought what had happened to the family where had they gone hard times he sensed changed circumstances the sun finally sets he found the restaurant easily he saw the sign but didnt even notice the word bierhaus to him it was beer house he was already thinking in german his upbringing and the hours of typesetting at his grandfathers plant made the translations automatic he looked over the place a half dozen lunchers sat on the patio men and women solitary for the most part lost in their food or newspapers nothing out of kilter that he could see paul crossed the street to the passageway avery had told him about dresden alley he walked into the dark cool canyon the time was a few minutes before noon a moment later he heard footsteps then a heavyset man in a brown suit and waistcoat strode up behind him working a toothpick in his teeth good day the man said cheerfully in german he glanced at the brown leather briefcase paul nodded he was the way averyd described morgan though he was heavier than paul had expected this is a good shortcut dont you think i use it often it certainly is paul glanced at him maybe you can help me whats the best tram to take to get to alexander plaza but the man frowned the tram do you mean from here paul grew more alert yes to alexander plaza why would you take the tram the underground is much faster okay paul thought hes the wrong one get away now just walk slowly thank you thats most helpful good day to you but pauls eyes must have revealed something the mans hand strayed to his side a gesture paul knew well and he thought pistol goddamn them for sending him out here without his colt pauls fists clenched and he started forward but for a fat man his adversary was surprisingly quick and leapt back out of pauls reach deftly pulling a black pistol from his belt paul could only turn and flee he sprinted around a corner into a short offshoot of the alley he stopped fast it was a dead end a scrape of shoe behind him and he felt the mans weapon against his back level with his heart dont move the man announced in guttural german drop the bag he dropped the briefcase on the cobblestones feeling the gun leave his back and touch his head just below the sweatband of his hat father he thought not to the deity but to his own parent gone from this earth twelve years he closed his eyes the sun finally sets the shot was abrupt it echoed briefly off the walls of the alley and then was smothered by the brick cringing paul felt the muzzle of the gun press harder into his skull and then the weapon fell away he heard it clatter on the cobblestones he stepped away fast crouching and turned to see the man whod been about to kill him crumpling to the ground his eyes were open but glazed a bullet had struck him in the side of the head blood spattered the ground and brick wall he looked up and saw another man in a charcoalgray flannel suit approaching him instinct took over and paul swept up the dead mans pistol it was an automatic of some sort with a toggle on the top a luger he believed aiming at the mans chest paul squinted he recognized the fellow from the beer house hed been sitting on the patio lost in his newspaper paul had assumed he held a pistol a large automatic of some kind but it wasnt pointed at paul he was still aiming at the man on the ground dont move paul said in german drop the gun the man didnt drop it but convinced the man hed shot wasnt a threat slipped his own weapon into his pocket he looked up and down dresden alley shhhh he whispered then cocked his head to listen he slowly approached schumann he asked paul said nothing he kept the luger aimed at the stranger who crouched in front of the shot man my watch the words were in german a faint accent what my watch thats all im reaching for he pulled out his pocket watch opened it and held the crystal in front of the mans nose and mouth there was no condensation of breath he put the timepiece away youre schumann the man repeated nodding at the briefcase on the ground im reggie morgan he too fit the description avery had given him dark hair and mustache though he was much thinner than the dead man paul looked up and down the alley no one the exchange would seem absurd with a dead body in front of them but paul asked whats the best tram to take to get to alexander plaza morgan replied quickly the number one thirtyeight tram no actually the two fiftyfour is better paul glanced at the body so then whos he lets find out he bent over the corpse and began to rifle through the dead mans pockets ill keep watch paul said good paul stepped away then he turned back and touched the luger to the back of morgans head dont move the man froze whats this in english paul said give me your passport paul took the booklet which confirmed that he was reginald morgan still as he handed it back he kept the pistol where it was describe the senator to me in english just easy on the trigger you dont mind the man said in a voice that placed his roots somewhere in new england okay the senator hes sixtytwo years old got white hair a nose with more veins than he ought to have thanks to the scotch and hes thin as a rail even though he eats a whole tbone at delmonicos when hes in new york and at ernies in detroit whats he smoke nothing the last time i saw him last year because of the wife but he told me he was going to start again and what he used to smoke were dominican cigars that smelled like burning firestones give me a break pal i dont want to die cause some old man took up a bad habit again paul put the gun away sorry morgan resumed his examination of the corpse unfazed by pauls test id rather work with a cautious man who insults me than a careless one who doesnt well both live longer he dug through the pockets of the dead man any visitors yet paul glanced up and down dresden alley nothing he was aware that morgan was staring in chagrin at something hed found in the dead mans pockets he sighed okay brother heres a problem what the man held up an officiallooking card on the top was a stamp of an eagle and below it in a circle a swastika the letters sa appeared on the top what does that mean it means my friend that youve been in town for less than a day and already weve managed to kill a stormtrooper chapter six a what paul schumann asked morgan sighed sturmabteilung stormtrooper or brownshirt sort of the partys own army think of them as hitlers thugs he shook his head and its worse for us hes not in uniform that means hes a brown elite one of their senior people how did he find out about me im not sure he did not you specifically he was in a phone booth checking up on everybody on the street i didnt see him paul said angry with himself for missing the surveillance everything was too damn out of kilter here he didnt know what to look for and what to ignore morgan continued as soon as you started into the alley he came after you id say he just took it on himself to see what you were up to a stranger in the neighborhood the brownshirts have their fiefdoms this mustve been his morgan frowned but still its unusual for them to be so vigilant the question is why is a senior sa man looking into ordinary citizens they leave that to their underlings maybe some alert has gone out he gazed at the corpse in any event this is a problem if the brownshirts find out one of their own has been killed they wont stop searching until they find the murderer oh and they will search there are tens of thousands of them in the city like roaches the initial shock of the shooting had worn off pauls instincts were returning he walked from the culdesac to the main portion of dresden alley it was still empty the windows were dark no doors were open he held up a finger to morgan and returned to the mouth of the alley then looked around the corner toward the beer house none of the few people on the street seemed to have heard the shot he returned and told morgan that everything seemed clear then he said the casing the what the shell casing from your pistol they looked over the ground and paul spotted the small yellow tube he picked it up with his handkerchief rubbed it clean just in case morgans prints were on it and dropped it down a drainpipe he heard it rattle for a moment until there was a splash morgan nodded they said you were good not good enough to keep from getting nabbed back in the united states thanks to a little bit of brass just like that one morgan opened a wellworn pocketknife well cut the labels out of his clothes take all his effects then get away from here as fast as possible before they find him and who is they paul asked a hollow laugh from morgans lips in germany now they is everybody would a stormtrooper wear a tattoo maybe of that swastika or the letters sa yes its possible look for any on his arms and chest and if i find one morgan asked frowning what can we do about it paul nodded at the knife youre joking but pauls face revealed that no he wasnt i cant do that morgan whispered i will then if its important hes not identified we have to paul knelt on the cobblestones and opened the mans jacket and shirt he could understand morgans queasiness but being a button man was a job like any other you gave it one hundred percent or you found a new line of work and a single small tattoo could mean the difference between living and dying but no flaying was required as it turned out the mans body was free of markings a sudden shout both men froze morgan looked up the alley his hand went to his pistol again paul too gripped the weapon hed taken from the stormtrooper the voice called again then silence except for the traffic a moment later though paul could detect an eerie siren rising and falling growing closer you should leave morgan said urgently ill finish with him he thought for a moment meet me in fortyfive minutes theres a restaurant called the summer garden on rosenthaler street northwest of alexander plaza i have a contact whos got information about ernst ill have him meet us there go back to the street in front of the beer hall you should be able to get a taxi there trams and buses often have police on them stick to taxis or walk when you can look straight ahead and dont make eye contact with anyone the summer garden paul repeated picking up the briefcase and brushing dust and grime off the leather he dropped the stormtroopers pistol inside from now on lets stick to german less suspicious good idea morgan said in the local tongue you speak well better than i expected but soften your g s it will make you sound more like a berliner another shout the siren grew closer oh schumann if im not there in an hour the radio that bull gordon told you about in the embassy building theyre working on paul nodded call in and tell them that you need new instructions a grim laugh and you may as well give them the news that im dead now get out of here keep your eyes forward look casual and whatever happens dont run dont run why because there are far too many people in this country who will chase you simply because you are running now hurry morgan turned back to his task with the quick precision of a tailor the dusty pitted black car pulled onto the sidewalk near the alleyway where three schupo officers stood wearing spotless green uniforms with bright orange collar tabs and tall greenandblack shako hats a middleaged mustachioed man in a threepiece offwhite linen suit climbed out of the passenger side of the vehicle which rose several inches relieved of his considerable weight he placed his panama hat on his thinning saltandpepper hair which was swept back and tapped the smoldering tobacco from his meerschaum pipe the engine stuttered coughed and finally went silent pocketing the yellowing pipe inspector willi kohl glanced at their vehicle with some exasperation the top ss and gestapo investigators had mercedes and bmws but kripo inspectors even senior ones like kohl were relegated to auto union cars and of the four interlocking rings representing the combined companies audi horch wanderer and dkw it was naturally a twoyearold model of the most modest of those lines that had been made available to kohl while his car ran to be generous on petrol it was telling that the initials dkw stood for the words steampowered vehicle konrad janssen smoothshaven and hatless like so many of todays young inspector candidates emerged from the drivers seat and buttoned his doublebreasted green silk suit jacket he took a briefcase and the leica case from the trunk patting his pocket to make sure he had his notebook and evidence envelopes kohl wandered toward the schupos hail hitler inspector the older of the trio said a familiarity in his voice kohl didnt recognize him and wondered if theyd met before this the schupo city patrolmen might assist inspectors occasionally but they were not technically under the command of the kripo kohl had little regular contact with any of them kohl lifted his arm in a semblance of a party salute wheres the body through there sir the man said dresden alley the other officers stood at half attention they were cautious schupo officers were very talented at traffic offenses and catching pickpockets and holding back crowds when hitler rode down the broad avenue of under the lindens but murder today called for discernment on their part a killing by a robber would require them to protect the scene carefully a murder by the stormtroopers or the ss meant they should disappear as quickly as they could and forget what theyd seen kohl said to the older schupo tell me what you know yes sir thats not much im afraid a call came into the tiergarten precinct and i came immediately here i was the first to arrive who called kohl walked into the alley then looked back at the other officers and impatiently gestured for them to follow she gave no name a woman she heard a shot from around here the time she called around noon sir you arrived when i left as soon as my commander alerted me and you arrived when kohl repeated perhaps twenty minutes past noon perhaps thirty he gestured down a narrow offshoot that ended in a culdesac lying on his back on the cobblestones was a man in his forties overweight the wound in the side of his head was clearly the cause of death and hed bled profusely his clothes were disheveled and his pockets turned out there was no doubt hed been killed here the blood pattern made this conclusion obvious the inspector said to the two younger schupos please see if you can find witnesses particularly anyone at the mouths of this alley and in these buildings here he nodded to the two surrounding brick structures noting though that they were windowless and that café we passed the beer house it was called yes sir the men walked off sharply did you search him no the senior schupo said then added only to verify that he was not jewish of course then you did search him i simply opened his trousers which i refastened as you can see kohl wondered whether whoever had decided that the deaths of circumcised men were to be given low priority had considered that sometimes the procedure was performed for medical reasons even presumably on the most aryan of babies kohl searched the pockets and found no identification nothing at all in fact curious you took nothing from him there were no documents no personal effects no sir breathing heavily as he knelt the inspector examined the body carefully and found the mans hands to be soft free of calluses he spoke half to himself half to konrad janssen with these hands trimmed nails and hair and residue of talcum on his skin he doesnt work labor i see ink on his fingers but not much which suggests hes not in the printing trade besides the patterns suggest the ink comes from handwriting probably ledgers and correspondence hes not a journalist for he would have traces of pencil lead on his hands and i can see none kohl knew this because hed investigated the deaths of a dozen reporters just after the national socialists came to power not one of the cases had been closed not one was being actively investigated businessman professional civil servant government nothing under his nails either sir kohl nodded then probed the mans legs an intellectual man most likely as i said but his legs are very muscular and look at those excessively worn shoes ach they make my own feet burn just to glance at them my guess is that he is a walker and a hiker the inspector grunted as he rose with some effort out for a stroll after an early lunch yes very likely there is a toothpick which might be his kohl retrieved and smelled it garlic he bent down and smelled the same scent near the victims mouth too yes i believe so he dropped the toothpick into one of his small brown paper envelopes and sealed it the young officer continued so a robbery victim certainly a possibility kohl said slowly but i think not a robber taking everything that the man had on him and there arent any gunpowder burn patterns on the neck or ear that means the bullet was fired from some distance a robber would have been closer and confronted him facetoface this man was shot from behind and the side a lick of the stubby pencil tip and kohl recorded these observations in his crinkled notebook yes yes im sure there are robbers who would lie in wait and shoot a victim then rob him but that doesnt fit what we know about most thieves does it the wound also suggested that the killer had not been the gestapo ss or stormtroopers the bullet in such cases usually was fired from pointblank range into the front of the brain or the back what was he doing in the alley the inspector candidate mused looking around as if the answer were lying on the ground that question doesnt interest us yet janssen this is a popular shortcut between spener street and calvin street his purpose may have been illicit but well have to learn that from evidence other than his route kohl examined the head wound again then walked to the wall of the alley on which a considerable amount of blood was spattered ah the inspector was delighted to find the bullet sitting where the cobblestones met the brick wall he picked it up carefully with a tissue it was only slightly dented he recognized immediately that it was a mm slug this meant it most likely came from an automatic pistol which would have ejected the spent brass cartridge he said to the third schupo please officer look over the ground there every centimeter look for a brass shell casing yes sir pulling his magnifying monocle from his waistcoat pocket and squinting through it kohl examined the projectile the bullet is in very good shape thats encouraging well see what the lands and grooves tell us back at the alex theyre quite sharp so the killer has a new gun janssen offered then qualified his comment or an old gun that has rarely been fired very good janssen those were to be my very next words kohl put the slug in another brown envelope and sealed this one too writing more notes janssen again looked over the corpse if he wasnt robbed sir then why are they turned out he asked his pockets i am referring to oh i didnt mean he wasnt robbed i simply am not sure that robbery was the primary motive ah there open the jacket again janssen pulled open the garment see the threads where right here kohl pointed yes sir the label has been cut out is that true of all his garments identification the young man said nodding as he looked at the trousers and shirt the killer doesnt want us to know whom he has killed markings in the shoes janssen took them off and examined them none sir kohl glanced at them and then felt the deceaseds jacket the suit is made of ersatz fabric the inspector had nearly made the mistake of using the phrase hitler fabric a reference to fake cloth made of fibers from trees a popular joke if you have a tear in your suit water and expose it to sunlight the cloth will grow back the leader had announced plans to make the country independent of foreign imports elastic margarine gasoline motor oil rubber cloth all were being made from alternative materials found in germany the problem of course was the same with substitutes everywhere they simply werent very good and people sometimes referred to them disparagingly as hitler goods but it was never wise to use the term in public one could be reported for uttering it the import of the discovery was that the man was probably german most foreigners in the country nowadays had their own currency to convert which meant their buying power was quite strong and none would willingly purchase cheap clothing like this but why would the killer wish to keep his victims identity secret the ersatz clothing suggested there was nothing particularly important about him but then kohl reflected many senior people in the national socialist party were poorly paid and even those who had decent salaries often wore substitute clothing out of loyalty to the leader could the victims job within the party or the government have been the motive for his death interesting kohl said rising stiffly the killer shoots a man in a crowded part of the city he knows someone might hear the report of the gun and yet he risks detection to slice the labels out of his clothing this makes me all the more intrigued to learn who this unfortunate gentleman is take his fingerprints janssen it will be forever if we wait for the coroner to do so yes sir the young officer opened his briefcase and removed the equipment he started to work kohl gazed at the cobblestones i have been saying killer singular janssen but of course there could have been a dozen but i can see nothing of the choreography of this event on the ground in more open crime scenes the infamously gritty berlin wind conveniently spread telltale dust on the ground but not in this sheltered alley sir inspector the schupo officer called i can find no casings here i have scoured the entire area this fact troubled kohl and janssen caught his bosss expression because the inspector explained he not only cut the labels from his victim he took the time to find the shell casing so he is a professional as i say janssen when making deductions never state your conclusions as if they are certainties when you do that your mind instinctively closes out other possibilities say rather that our suspect may have a high degree of diligence and attention to detail perhaps a professional criminal perhaps not it could also be that a rat or bird made off with the shiny object or a schoolboy picked it up and fled at the terrifying sight of a dead man or even that the killer is a poor man who wishes to reuse the brass of course inspector janssen said nodding as if memorizing kohls words in the short time theyd worked together the inspector had learned two things about janssen that the young man was incapable of irony and that he was a remarkably fast learner the latter quality was a godsend to the impatient inspector regarding the former though he wished the boy joked more frequently policing is a profession badly in need of humor janssen finished taking the fingerprints which hed done expertly now dust the cobblestones around him and take photographs of any prints you find the killer mightve been clever enough to take the labels but not so smart to avoid touching the ground when he did so after five minutes of spreading the fine powder around the body janssen said i believe there are some here sir look yes theyre good record them after he photographed the prints the young man stood back and took additional pictures of the corpse and the scene the inspector walked slowly around the body he pulled his magnifying monocle from his vests watch pocket again and placed around his neck its green cord braided for him as a christmas present by young hanna he examined a spot on the cobblestones near the body flakes of leather it seems he looked at them carefully old and dry brown too stiff to be from gloves maybe shoes or a belt or old satchel or suitcase that either the killer or victim was carrying he scooped these flakes up and placed them in another brown envelope then moistened the gum and sealed it we have a witness sir one of the younger schupo officers called though hes not very cooperative witness excellent kohl followed the man back toward the mouth of the alley there another schupo officer was prodding forward a man in his forties kohl estimated he was dressed in workers clothes his left eye was glass and his right arm dangled uselessly at his side one of the four million who survived the war but were left with bodies forever changed by the unfathomable experience the schupo officer pushed him toward kohl that will do officer the inspector said sternly thank you turning to the witness he asked now your card the man handed over his id kohl glanced at it he forgot everything on the document the instant he returned it but even a cursory examination of papers by a police officer made witnesses extremely cooperative though not in all cases i wish to be helpful but as i told the officer sir i didnt actually see much of anything he fell silent yes yes tell me what you actually did see an impatient gesture from kohls thick hand yes inspector i was scrubbing the basement stairs at number fortyeight there he pointed out of the alley to a town house as you can see i was below the level of the sidewalk i heard what i took to be a backfire kohl grunted since no one but an idiot assumed backfires they assumed bullets i thought nothing of it and continued scrubbing he proved this by pointing to his damp shirt and trousers then ten minutes later i heard a whistle whistle a police whistle no sir i mean as someone would make through his teeth it was quite loud i glanced up and saw a man walk out of the alley the whistle was to hail a taxi it stopped in front of my building and i heard the man ask the driver to take him to the summer garden restaurant whistling kohl reflected this was unusual one whistled for dogs and horses but to summon a taxi this way would demean the driver in germany all professions and trades were worthy of equal respect did this suggest that the suspect was a foreigner or merely rude he jotted the observation into his notebook the number of the taxi kohl had to ask of course but received the expected response oh i have no idea sir summer garden this was a common name which one i believe i heard rosenthaler street kohl nodded excited to find such a good lead this early in an investigation quickly what did the man look like i was below the stairs sir as i said i saw only his back as he hailed the car he was a large man more than two meters tall broad but not fat he had an accent though what kind from a different region of germany or a different country similar to someone from the south if anything but i have a brother near munich and it sounded different still outside the country perhaps many foreigners here now with the olympics i dont know sir ive spent all my life in berlin and ive only been out of the fatherland once he nodded toward his useless arm did he have a leather satchel yes i believe so to janssen kohl said the likely source of the leather flakes he turned back and you didnt see his face no sir as i say kohls voice lowered if i were to tell you that i wont take your name so you would not be further involved could you perhaps remember better what he looked like honestly sir i did not see his face age the man shook his head all i know is that he was a big man and was wearing a light suit i cant say the color im afraid oh and on his head was a hat like air minister göring wears what kind is that kohl asked with a narrow brim brown ah something helpful kohl looked the janitor up and down very well you may go now hail hitler the man said with pathetic enthusiasm and offered a powerful salute perhaps in compensation for the fact he needed to use his left arm for the gesture the inspector offered a distracted hail and returned to the body they quickly collected their equipment lets hurry to the summer garden they started back to the car willi kohl winced glancing down at his feet even wearing overpriced leather shoes stuffed with the softest of lambs wool did little to help his distraught toes and arches cobblestones were particularly brutal he was suddenly aware of janssen at his side slowing gestapo the young man whispered dismayed kohl looked up and saw peter krauss in a shabby brown suit and matching felt trilby hat approach two of his assistants younger men about janssens age held back oh not now the suspect might be at the restaurant this very moment not suspecting that hed been detected krauss walked toward the two kripo inspectors leisurely propaganda minister goebbels was always sending out party photographers to stage pictures of model aryans and their families to use in his publications peter krauss could easily have been a subject for a hundred such pictures he was a tall slim blond man a former colleague of kohls krauss had been invited to join the gestapo because of his experience in the old department a of the kripo which investigated political crimes just after the national socialists came to power the department was spun off and became the gestapo krauss was like many prussian germans nordic with some slav blood in his veins but office gossip had it that hed been invited to leave the kripo for the job on prince albrecht street only after changing his first name from pietr which sniffed of the slavic kohl had heard krauss was a methodical investigator though they had never worked together kohl had always refused to handle political crimes and now the kripo was forbidden to krauss said willi good afternoon hail what brings you here peter janssen nodded and the gestapo investigator did the same he said to kohl i received a phone call from our boss did he mean heinrich himmler himself kohl wondered it was possible one month ago the ss leader had consolidated every police force in germany under his own control and had created the sipo the plainclothed division which included the gestapo the kripo and the notorious sd which was the sss intelligence division himmler had just been named state chief of police a rather modest description kohl had thought at the time of the announcement for the most powerful law enforcer on earth krauss continued hes been instructed by the leader to keep our city blemishfree during the olympics were to look into all serious crimes near the stadium olympic village and city center and make sure the perpetrators are swiftly caught and here a murder within shouting distance of the tiergarten krauss clicked his tongue in dismay kohl glanced obviously at his watch desperate to get to the summer garden im afraid i have to leave peter examining the body closely crouching down the gestapo man said unfortunately with all the foreign reporters in town so difficult to control them to monitor them yes yes but we need to make sure this is solved before they learn of the death krauss rose and walked in a slow circle around the dead man who is he do we know not yet his id is missing tell me peter this wouldnt have anything to do with an ss or sa matter would it not that i know of krauss replied frowning why on the way here janssen and i noticed many more patrols random stops to check papers yet weve heard no word about an operation ach thats nothing the gestapo inspector said waving his hand dismissively a minor security matter nothing the kripo need worry about kohl looked again at his pocket watch well i really must go peter the gestapo officer rose to his feet was he robbed everythings missing from his pockets kohl said impatiently krauss stared at the body for a long moment and all kohl could think of was the suspect sitting at the summer garden halfway through a meal of schnitzel or wurst i must be getting back kohl said one moment krauss continued to study the body finally without looking up he said it would make sense if the killer was a foreigner a foreigner well janssen spoke quickly eyebrows rising in his youthful face but kohl shot him a sharp look and he fell silent whats that krauss asked him the inspector candidate made a fast recovery im curious why you think it would make sense the deserted alley missing identification a coldblooded shooting when youve been in this business for a time you get a feel for the perpetrators in murders such as this inspector candidate a murder such as what kohl could not resist asking a man shot to death in a berlin alley was hardly sui generis these days but krauss didnt respond a roma or pole very likely violent people to be sure and with motives galore to murder innocent germans or the killer might be czech from the east of course not the sudetenland theyre known for shooting people from behind kohl nearly added as are the stormtroopers but he merely said then we can hope that the perpetrator turns out to be a slav krauss gave no reaction to the reference to his own ethnic origins another look at the corpse i will make inquiries about this willi i will have my people make contact with the amen in the area kohl said i am encouraged by the thought of using national socialist informants theyre very good at it and there are so many of them indeed bless him janssen too looked impatiently at his watch grimaced and said were very late for that meeting sir yes yes we are kohl started back up the alley but he paused and called to krauss one question yes willi what kind of hat does air minister göring wear you are asking krauss frowned göring what kind of hat oh i have no idea he replied looking momentarily stricken as if this were knowledge that every good gestapo officer should be versed in why no matter hail hitler hail as they hurried back to the dkw kohl said breathlessly give the film to one of the schupo officers and have him rush it to headquarters i want the pictures immediately yes sir the young man diverted his course and handed the film to an officer gave him the instructions then caught up with kohl who called to a schupo when the coroners men get here tell them that i want the autopsy report as soon as possible i want to know about diseases our friend here might have had the clap and consumption in particular and how advanced and the contents of his stomach tattoos broken bones surgical scars as well yes sir remember to tell them its urgent so busy was the coroner these days that it might take eight or ten hours for the body even to be picked up the autopsy could take several days kohl winced in pain as he hurried to the dkw the lambs wool in his shoes had shifted whats the fastest route to the summer garden never mind well figure it out he looked around there he shouted pointing to a newsstand go buy every newspaper they have yes sir but why willi kohl dropped into the drivers seat and pushed the ignition button his voice was breathless but still managed to convey his impatience because we need a picture of göring in a hat why else chapter seven standing on the street corner holding a limp berlin journal paul studied the summer garden café women who drank their coffees with gloved hands men who would down their beers in large gulps and tap their mustaches with pressed linen napkins to lift away the foam people enjoying the afternoon sun smoking paul schumann remained perfectly still looking looking looking out of kilter just like setting type plucking the metal letters from a california job case and assembling words and sentences mind your p s and q s his father would call constantly those particular letters easy to confuse because the piece of type was the exact reverse of the printed letter he was now looking over the summer garden just as carefully hed missed the stormtrooper watching him from the phone booth outside dresden alley an inexcusable mistake for a button man he wasnt going to let that happen again after a few minutes he sensed no immediate danger but he reflected how could he tell maybe the people he was watching were nothing more than they seemed normal joes eating meals and going about their errands on a hot lazy saturday afternoon with no interest in anyone else on the street but maybe they were as suspicious and murderously loyal to the nazis as the man on the manhattan heinsler i love the führer he tossed the paper into a bin then crossed the street and entered the restaurant please he said to the captain a table for three anywhere anywhere the harried man said paul took a table inside a casual glance around him no one paid any attention to him or appeared to a waiter sailed past you wish to order a beer for now which beer he started to name brands paul had never heard of he said the first a large the waiter walked toward the bar and returned a moment later with a tall pilsner glass paul drank thirstily but found he disliked the taste it was almost sweet fruity he pushed it aside and lit a cigarette having shaken the chesterfield out of the pack below the tabletop so no one could see the american label he glanced up to see reginald morgan strolling casually into the restaurant looking around he noticed paul and walked up to him saying in german my friend so good to see you again they shook hands and he sat down across the table morgans face was damp and he wiped it with his handkerchief his eyes were troubled it was close the schupo pulled up just as i got away anyone see you i dont think so i left by the far end of the alley is it safe to stay here paul asked looking around should we leave no it would be more suspicious at this time of day to arrive at a restaurant then leave quickly without eating not like new york berliners wont be rushed when it comes to meals offices close down for two hours so people can have a proper lunch of course they also eat two breakfasts he patted his stomach now you can see why i was happy to be posted here looking around casually morgan said here he pushed a thick book toward paul see i remembered to return it the german words on the cover were mein kampf which paul translated as my struggle hitlers name was on it hed written a book paul wondered thank you but there was no hurry paul stubbed out the cigarette in the ashtray but when it was cool slipped it into his pocket ever careful not to leave traces that might place him somewhere morgan leaned forward smiling as if whispering a bawdy joke inside the books a hundred marks and the address of the place youll be staying a boardinghouse its near lützow plaza south of the tiergarten i wrote down directions too is it on the ground floor the apartment i dont know i didnt ask youre thinking of escape routes specifically he was thinking of malones bingenest with its sealed doors and windows and a welcoming party of armed sailors thats right well have a look at it maybe you can swap if theres a problem the landlady seems agreeable her name is käthe richter is she a nazi morgan said softly dont use that word here it will give you away nazi is bavarian slang for simpleton the proper abbreviation is nazo but you dont hear that much either say national socialist some people use the initials nsdap or you can refer to the party and say it reverently regarding miss richter she doesnt seem to have any sympathies one way or the other nodding at the beer morgan asked you dont care for that piss water morgan laughed its wheat beer children drink it why did you order it there were a thousand kinds id never heard of any of them ill order for us when the waiter arrived he said please bring us two pschorr ales and sausage and bread with cabbage and pickled cucumbers butter if you have any today yes sir he took away pauls glass morgan continued in the book theres also a russian passport with your picture in it and some rubles about a hundred dollars worth in an emergency make your way to the swiss border the germansll be happy to get another russian out of their country and theyll let you pass they wont take the rubles because they wont be allowed to spend them the swiss wont care that youre a bolshevik and will be delighted to let you in to spend the money go to zurich and get a message to the us embassy gordon will get you out now after dresden alley we must be extremely careful like i said something is clearly going on in town there are far more patrols on the street than usual stormtroopers which is not particularly odd they have nothing to do with their time but march and patrol but ss and gestapo too they are ss did you see the two out on the patio in the black uniforms yes they were originally hitlers guard detail now theyre another private army mostly they wear black but some of the uniforms are gray the gestapo is the secret police force plainclothes theyre small in number but very dangerous their jurisdiction is political crimes mostly but in germany now anything can be a political crime you spit on the sidewalk its an offense to the honor of the leader so off you go to moabit prison or a concentration camp the pschorr beers and food arrived and paul drank down half of the brew at once it was earthy and rich now thats good you like it after i got here i realized i could never drink american beer again to be able to brew beer it takes years of learning its as respected as a university degree berlin is the brewing capital of europe but they make the best in munich down in bavaria paul ate hungrily but beer and food were not the first things on his mind we have to move fast he whispered in his profession every hour you were near the site of the touchoff increased the risk of getting caught i need information and i need a weapon morgan nodded my contact should be here any minute he has details about the man youre here to visit then this afternoon well go to a pawnshop the owner has a good rifle for you rifle paul frowned morgan was troubled you cant shoot a rifle yes i can shoot one i was infantry but i always work up close close thats easier for you its not a question of easy its more efficient well believe me paul it may be possible though very difficult to get close enough to your target to kill him with a pistol but there are so many brownshirts and ss and gestapo hovering about that youd without doubt be caught and i guarantee that your death would be lengthy and unpleasant but theres another reason to use a rifle he has to be killed in public why paul asked the senator said that everybody in the german government and the party knows how crucial ernst is to rearming its important to make certain that whoever replaces him knows theyll be in danger too if they take up where he left off if ernst dies in private hitler would cover it up claim hed been killed in an accident or died of some illness then ill do it in public paul said with a rifle but ill need to sightin the gun get a feel for it find a good killing field examine it ahead of time see what the breezes are like the light the routes to and from the place of course youre the expert whatever you want paul finished his meal after what happened in the alley i need to go to ground i want to get my things from the olympic village and move to the boardinghouse as soon as possible is the room ready now morgan told him that it was paul sipped more beer then pulled hitlers book toward him rested it in his lap flipped through it found the passport money and address he took out the slip of paper on which was jotted the information on the boardinghouse dropping the book in his briefcase he memorized the address and directions casually wiped the note in beer spilled on the table and kneaded it in his strong hands until it was a wad of pulp he slipped this into his pocket with the cigarette butts for later disposal morgan lifted an eyebrow they told me you were good paul nodded toward his satchel whispering my struggle hitlers book what exactly is it somebody called it a collection of grammatical errors its supposedly hitlers philosophy but basically its impenetrable nonsense but you might want to keep it morgan smiled berlin is a city of shortages and at the moment toilet tissue is hard to find a brief laugh then paul asked this man were about to meet why can we trust him in germany now trust is a curious thing the risk is so grave and so prevalent that its not enough to trust someone just because they believe in your cause in my contacts case his brother was a union organizer murdered by stormtroopers so he sympathizes with us but i am not willing to risk my life on that alone so i have paid him a great deal of money there is an expression here whose bread i eat is whose song i sing well max eats a great deal of my bread and hes in the precarious position of having already sold me some very helpful and for him compromising material this is a perfect example of how trust works here you must either bribe someone or threaten him and i prefer to do both simultaneously the door opened and morgan squinted in recognition ah thats he he whispered a thin man in workers coveralls entered the restaurant a small rucksack slung over his shoulder he looked around blinking to acclimate his vision to the dimness morgan waved his hand and the man joined them he was clearly nervous eyes darting from paul to the other patrons to the waiters to the shadows in the corridors that led to the lavatory and the kitchen then back to paul they is everybody in germany now he sat at the table first with his back to the door then switched seats so that he could see the rest of the restaurant good afternoon morgan said hail hitler hail paul replied my friend here has asked that he be called max he has done work for the man youve come to see around his house he delivers goods there and knows the housekeeper and gardener he lives in the same town charlottenburg west of here max declined food or beer and had only coffee into which he poured sugar that left a dusty scum on the surface he stirred vigorously i need to know everything you can tell me about him paul whispered yes yes i will but he fell silent and looked around again he wore his suspicion like the lotion that plastered down his thinning hair paul found the uneasiness irritating not to mention dangerous max opened the rucksack and offered a dark green folder to paul sitting back so no one could see the contents he opened it and found himself looking at a half dozen wrinkled photographs they depicted a man in a business suit which was tailored the clothing of a meticulous conscientious man he was in his fifties and had a round head and short gray or white hair he wore wirerimmed glasses paul asked these are definitely of him what about doubles he doesnt use doubles the man took a sip of coffee with shaking hands and looked around the restaurant again paul finished studying them he was going to tell max to keep the photos and destroy them when he got home but the man seemed too nervous and the american imagined him panicking and leaving them on the tram or subway he slipped the folder into his satchel next to hitlers book hed dispose of them later now paul said leaning forward tell me about him everything you know max relayed what he knew about reinhard ernst the colonel retained the discipline and air of a military man though hed been out of the service for some years he would rise early and work long long hours six or seven days a week he exercised regularly and was an expert shot he often carried a small automatic pistol his office was on wilhelm street in the chancellory building and he drove himself to and from the office rarely accompanied by a guard his car was an openair mercedes paul was considering what the man had said this chancellory hes there every day usually yes though sometimes he travels to shipyards or recently to krupps works whos krupp his companies make munitions and armor at the chancellory where would he park i dont know sir ive never been there can you find out where hell be in the next few days when he might go to the office yes ill try a pause i dont know if maxs voice faded what paul asked i know some things about his personal life too about his wife daughterinlaw his grandson do you want to know that side of his life or would you rather not touching the ice no paul said in a whisper tell me everything they drove down rosenthaler street as quickly as the tiny engine could carry them toward the summer garden restaurant konrad janssen asked his boss sir a question yes inspector krauss was hoping to find that a foreigner was the killer and we have evidence that the suspect is one why didnt you tell him that evidence that suggests that he might be one and not very strongly merely that he might have had an accent and that he whistled for a taxi yes sir but shouldnt we have mentioned it we could use the gestapos resources heavyset kohl was breathing hard and sweating furiously in the heat he liked the summer because the family could enjoy the tiergarten and luna park or drive to wannsee or the havel river for picnics but for climate he was an autumn person at heart he wiped his forehead and replied no janssen we should not have mentioned it nor should we have sought the gestapos help and this is why first since the consolidation last month the gestapo and ss are doing whatever they can to strip the kripo of its independence we must retain as much as we can and that means we need to do our job alone and second and much much more important the gestapos resources are often simply arresting anyone who seems in the least guilty of anything and sometimes arresting those who are clearly innocent but whose arrests might be convenient kripo headquarters contained six hundred holding cells whose purpose had once been like those in police stations everywhere to detain criminal arrestees until they were released or tried presently these cells filled to overflowing held those accused of vague political crimes and were overseen by stormtroopers brutal young men in brown uniforms and white armbands the cells were merely temporary stops on the way to a concentration camp or gestapo headquarters on prince albrecht street sometimes to the cemetery kohl continued no janssen were craftsmen practicing the refined art of police work not saxon farmers armed with sickles to mow down dozens of citizens in the pursuit of a single guilty man yes sir never forget that he shook his head ach how much harder it is to do our job in this moral quicksand around us as he pulled the car to the curb he glanced at his assistant janssen you could have me arrested you know and sent to oranienburg for a year for saying what i just did i wouldnt say anything sir kohl killed the ignition they climbed out then trotted quickly up the broad sidewalk toward the summer garden as they got closer willi kohl detected the scent of wellmarinated sauerbraten for which this place was known his stomach growled janssen was carrying a copy of the national socialist newspaper the peoples observer which featured göring prominently on the front page wearing a jaunty hat of a cut that wasnt common in berlin thinking of these particular accessories kohl glanced at his assistant the inspector candidates fair face was growing red from the july sun did todays young people not realize that hats had been created for a purpose as they approached the restaurant kohl motioned janssen to slow they paused beside a lamppost and studied the summer garden there were not many diners remaining at this hour two ss officers were paying and leaving which was just as well since for the reasons hed just explained to janssen he preferred to say nothing about the case the only men remaining were a middleaged fellow in lederhosen and a pensioner kohl noted the thick curtains protecting them from surveillance from inside he nodded to janssen and they stepped onto the deck the inspector asking each diner if hed seen a large man in a brown hat enter the restaurant the pensioner nodded a big man indeed detective i didnt look clearly but i believe he walked inside about twenty minutes ago hes still there he hasnt come out not that i saw janssen stiffened like a beagle on a scent sir shall we call the orpo these were the uniformed order police housed in barracks ready as the name suggested to keep order by use of rifles machine pistols and truncheons but kohl thought again of the mayhem that could erupt if they were summoned especially against an armed suspect in a restaurant filled with patrons no i think we wont janssen well be more subtle you go around the back of the restaurant and wait at the door if anyone comes out whether in a hat or not detain him remember our suspect is armed now move surreptitiously yes sir the young man stopped at the alley and with an extremely unsurreptitious wave turned the corner and vanished kohl casually started forward and paused as if perusing the posted menu then he moved closer feeling uneasiness feeling too the weight of his revolver in his pocket until the national socialists came to power few kripo detectives carried weapons but several years ago when then interior minister göring had expanded the many police forces in the country hed ordered every policeman to carry a weapon and to the shock of kohl and his colleagues in the kripo to use them liberally hed actually issued an edict saying that a policeman would be reprimanded for failing to shoot a suspect but not for shooting someone who turned out to be innocent willi kohl hadnt fired a weapon since yet picturing the shattered skull of the victim in dresden alley he now was pleased that he had the gun with him kohl adjusted his jacket made sure he could grab the gun quickly if he needed to and took a deep breath he pushed through the doorway and froze like a statue panicked the interior of the summer garden was quite dark and his eyes were used to the brilliant sunlight outside he was momentarily blinded foolish he thought angrily to himself he should have considered this here he stood with kripo written all over him a clear target for an armed suspect he stepped further inside and closed the door behind him in his cottony vision people moved throughout the restaurant some men he believed were standing someone was moving toward him kohl stepped back alarmed his hand went toward the pocket containing his revolver sir a table sit where you like he squinted and slowly his vision began returning sir the waiter repeated no he said im looking for someone finally the inspector was able to see normally again the restaurant contained only a dozen patrons none was a large man with a brown hat and light suit he started into the kitchen sir you cant kohl displayed his identification card to the waiter yes sir the man said timidly kohl walked through the stupefyingly hot kitchen and to the back door he opened it janssen no one came through the door sir the inspector candidate joined his boss and they returned to the dining room kohl motioned the waiter over to them sir what is your name johann well johann have you seen a man in here within the past twenty minutes wearing a hat like this kohl nodded at janssen who displayed the picture of göring why yes i have he and his companions just left moments ago it seemed rather suspicious they left by the side door he pointed to the empty table kohl sighed with disgust it was one of the two tables next to the windows yes the curtain was thick but he noted a tiny gap at the side their suspect had undoubtedly seen them canvassing the patrons on the patio come janssen kohl and the inspector candidate rushed out the side door and through an anemic garden typical of the tens of thousands throughout the city berliners loved growing flowers and plants but land was at such a premium that they were forced to use any scraps of dirt they could find for their gardens there was only one route out of the patch it led to rosenthaler street they trotted to it and looked up and down the congested street no sign of their suspect kohl was furious had he not been distracted by krauss they would likely have had more of a chance to intercept the large man in the hat but mostly he was angry with himself for his carelessness on the patio a moment earlier in our haste he muttered to janssen weve burnt the crust but perhaps we can salvage some of the remaining loaf he turned and stalked back toward the front door of the summer garden paul morgan and the skinny nervous man known as max stood fifty feet up rosenthaler street in a small cluster of linden trees they were watching the man in the white suit and his younger associate in the garden beside the restaurant looking up and down the street then they returned to the front door they couldnt be after us morgan said impossible they were looking for someone paul said they came out the side door a minute after we did thats not a coincidence in a shaky voice max asked you think they were gestapo or kripo whats kripo paul asked criminal police plainclothes detectives they were some sort of police paul announced there was no doubt hed suspected it from the moment hed seen the two men approach the summer garden hed taken the window table specifically to keep an eye on the street and sure enough hed noticed the men a heavyset one in a panama hat and a slimmer younger one in a green suit asking diners on the patio questions then the younger one had stepped away probably to cover the back door and the whitesuited cop had walked to the posted menu examining it for far longer than one normally would paul had stood suddenly tossed down money paper bills only on which fingerprints would be nearly impossible to find and snapped leave now with morgan and a panicked max behind him hed pushed through the side door and waited at the front of a small garden until the cop had gone inside the restaurant then walked fast down rosenthaler street police max now muttered sounding near tears no no too many people to chase you here and too many people to follow you too many people to rat on you id do anything for him and the party paul looked again down the street back toward the summer garden no one was in pursuit still he felt an electric current of urgency to learn information of ernsts whereabouts from max and get on with the touchoff he turned saying i need to know his voice faded max was gone where is he morgan too turned goddamn he muttered in english did he betray us i cant believe that he would it would mean his arrest too but morgans voice faded as he looked past paul no spinning around paul saw max about two blocks away he was among several people stopped by two men in black uniforms whom he apparently hadnt seen an ss security stop max looked around nervously waiting his turn to be questioned by the ss troopers he wiped his face looking guilty as a teenager paul whispered theres nothing for him to worry about his papers are fine he gave us ernsts photos as long as he doesnt panic hell be all right calm down paul told the man silently dont look around then max smiled and stepped closer to the ss hes going to be fine morgan said no hes not paul thought hes going to shank it and just at that moment the man turned and fled the ss troops pushed aside a couple theyd been speaking with and began running after him stop you will stop no morgan whispered why did he do that why because he was scared witless paul thought max was slimmer than the ss guards who were in bulky uniforms and was beginning to pull away from them maybe he can make it maybe a shot echoed and max tumbled to the concrete blood blossoming on his back paul looked behind him a third ss officer across the street had drawn his pistol and fired max started to crawl toward the curb when the first two guards caught up to him gasping for breath one drew his pistol fired a shot into the poor mans head and leaned against a lamppost to catch his breath lets go paul whispered now they turned back onto rosenthaler street and walked north along with the other pedestrians moving steadily away from the site of the shooting god in heaven morgan muttered ive spent a month cultivating him and holding his hand while he got details on ernst now what do we do whatever we decide its got to be fast somebody might make the connection between him a glance back at the body in the street and ernst morgan sighed and thought for a moment i dont know anyone else close to ernst but i do have a man in the information ministry you have somebody inside there the national socialists are paranoid but they have one flaw that offsets that their ego they have so many agents in place that it never occurs to them that somebody might infiltrate them hes just a clerk but he may be able to find out something they paused on a busy corner paul said im going to get my things at the olympic village and move to the boardinghouse the pawnshop where were getting the rifle is near oranienburger station ill meet you in november square under the big statue of hitler say fourthirty do you have a map ill find it the men shook hands and with a glance back at the crowd standing around the body of the unfortunate man they started their separate ways as another siren filled the streets of a city that was clean and orderly and filled with polite smiling people and that had been the site of two killings in as many hours no paul reflected the unfortunate max hadnt betrayed him but he realized that there was another implication that was far more troubling these two cops or gestapo agents had tracked morgan or paul or both of them from dresden alley to the summer garden on their own and come within minutes of capturing them this was police work far better than any hed seen in new york who the hell are they he wondered johann willi kohl asked the waiter what exactly was this man with the brown hat wearing a light gray suit a white shirt and a green tie which i found rather garish and he was large very large sir but not fat he was a bodybuilder perhaps any other characteristics not that i noticed was he foreign i dont know but he spoke german flawlessly perhaps a faint accent his hair color i couldnt say darker rather than lighter age not young not old kohl sighed and you said companions yes sir he arrived first then he was joined by another man considerably smaller wearing a black or dark gray suit i dont recall his tie and then yet another a man in brown overalls in his thirties a worker it seemed he joined them later did the big man have a leather suitcase or satchel yes it was brown his companions spoke german too yes did you overhear their conversation no inspector and the mans face the man in the hat janssen asked a hesitation i didnt see the face or his companions you waited on them but you did not see their faces kohl asked i didnt pay any attention its dark in here as you can see and in this business so many people you look but you rarely see if you understand that was true kohl supposed but he also knew that since hitler had come to power three years ago blindness had become the national malady people either denounced fellow citizens for crimes they hadnt witnessed or else were unable to recall the details of offenses they actually had seen knowing too much might mean a trip to the alex the kripo headquarters or the gestapos on prince albrecht street to examine endless pictures of known felons no one would willingly go to either of those places todays witness could be tomorrows detainee the waiters eyes swept the floor troubled sweat broke out on his forehead kohl pitied him perhaps in lieu of a description of his face you could give us some other observations and we could dispense with a visit to police headquarters if you happen to think of something helpful the man looked up relieved ill try to assist you the inspector said lets start with some specifics what did he eat and drink ah thats something he at first ordered a wheat beer he must not have ever drunk it before he only sipped it and pushed it aside but he drank all of the pschorr ale that his companion ordered for him good kohl never knew at first what these details about a suspect might ultimately reveal perhaps the mans state or country of origin perhaps something more specific but it was worth noting which willi kohl now did in his wellthumbed notebook after a lick of the pencil tip and his food our sausage and cabbage plate with much bread and margarine they had the same the big man ate everything he seemed ravenous his companion ate half and the third man coffee only how did the big man as well call him how did he hold his fork his fork after he cut a piece of sausage did he change his fork from one hand to another and then eat the bite or did he lift the food to his mouth without changing hands i i dont know sir i would think possibly he did change hands i say that because it seemed he was always placing his fork down to drink the beer good johann i am happy to aid my leader in any way i can yes yes kohl said wearily switching forks common in other countries less so in germany like whistling for taxis so the accent may have indeed been foreign did he smoke i believe so sir pipe cigar cigarette cigarette i believe but i didnt see the brand of the manufacturer no sir i didnt kohl walked across the room and examined the suspects table and the chairs around it nothing helpful he frowned to see that the ashtray contained ash but no cigarette stubs more evidence of their mans cleverness kohl then crouched and struck a match over the floor beneath the table ah yes look janssen some flakes of the same brown leather we found earlier indeed it is our man and there are marks in the dust here that suggest he set a satchel down i wonder what it contains janssen said that does not interest us kohl said scooping up these flakes and depositing them in an envelope not at this point the importance is the bag itself the connection it establishes between this man and dresden alley kohl thanked the waiter and with a longing glance at a plate of wiener schnitzel he walked outside janssen behind him lets inquire around the neighborhood to see if anyone saw our gentlemen you take the far side of the street janssen ill take the flower vendors kohl laughed grimly berlin flower sellers were notoriously rude janssen removed his handkerchief and wiped his brow he seemed to give a faint sigh are you tired janssen no sir not at all the young man hesitated then added its just that it seems our work sometimes is hopeless all this effort for a fat dead man kohl dug his yellow pipe out of his pocket frowning to see that hed put his pistol into the same pocket and had nicked the bowl he filled it with tobacco he said yes janssen youre right the victim was a fat middleaged man but were clever detectives arent we we know something else about him as well whats that sir that he was somebodys son well of course he was and perhaps he was somebodys brother and maybe somebodys husband or lover and if he was lucky he was a father of sons and daughters i would hope too that there are past lovers who think of him occasionally and in his future other lovers might have awaited and three or four more children he could have brought into the world he rasped a match on the side of the box and got a smolder going in the meerschaum so janssen when you look at the incident in this way we dont have merely a curious mystery about a stocky dead man we have a tragedy like a spiderweb reaching many different lives and many different places extending for years and years how sad that is do you see why our job is so important yes sir and kohl believed that the young man did indeed understand janssen you must get a hat but for now ive changed my mind you take the shady side of the street it will mean of course that you must interview the flower vendors theyll treat you to some words you wont hear outside of a stormtrooper barracks but at least you wont return to your wife tonight with skin the shade of fresh beetroot chapter eight walking toward the busy square to find a taxi paul glanced behind him from time to time smoking his chesterfield looking at the sights stores passersby once again searching for anything out of kilter he slipped into a public rest room which was immaculate and stepped into a stall he stubbed out his cigarette and dropped it along with the cigarette butts and wad of pulp that had held the address of käthe richters boardinghouse into the toilet then he tore the pictures of ernst up into dozens of tiny pieces and flushed everything away outside on the street again he put aside the difficult images of maxs sad and unnecessary death and concentrated on the job ahead of him it had been years since hed killed anyone with a rifle he was a good shot with a long weapon people call guns equalizers but thats not completely true a pistol weighs perhaps three pounds a rifle twelve or more to hold a weapon absolutely still requires strength and pauls solid arms had helped make him the best shot in his squadron yet now as hed explained to morgan when he had to touch off someone he preferred to do it with a pistol and he always came in close close as breath he never said a word to his victim never confronted him never even let him know what was about to happen he would appear as silently as a big man could behind the victim if possible and fire the shot into his head killing him instantly he would never think of behaving like the sadistic bugsy siegel or the recently departed dutch schultz theyd slowly beat people to death torment them taunt them what paul did as a button man had nothing to do with anger or pleasure or the gritty satisfaction of revenge it was simply about committing an evil act to eliminate a greater evil and paul schumann insisted on paying the price for this hypocrisy he suffered from the proximity of killing the deaths sickened him sent him into a tunnel of sorrow and guilt every time he killed another part of him died too once drunk in a shabby west side irish bar he concluded that he was the opposite of christ he died so that others might die too he wished hed been too smoked on hooch to remember that thought but itd stuck with him still he supposed morgan was right about using the rifle his buddy damon runyon had once said that a man could be a winner only if he was willing to step over the edge paul sure did that often enough but he also knew when to stop walking hed never been suicidal on a number of occasions hed postponed the touchoff when he sensed the odds were bad maybe six to five against was acceptable but worse than that he didnt a loud crash startled him something flew through a bookstore window onto the sidewalk a few yards away a bookcase some books followed he glanced inside the shop and saw a middleaged man holding his bloody face he appeared to have been struck on the cheek a woman crying gripped his arm they were both terrified four large men in light brown uniforms stood around them paul supposed they were stormtroopers brownshirts one of them was holding a book and shouting at the man you are not allowed to sell this shit theyre illegal theyre a ticket to oranienburg its thomas mann the man protested it means nothing against the leader or our party i the brownshirt slapped the bookseller in his face with the open book he spoke in a mocking voice its another furious slap thomas another and the spine of the book broke mann the bullying angered paul but it wasnt his problem he could hardly afford to draw attention to himself here he started on but suddenly one of the brownshirts grabbed the woman by the arm and pushed her out the door she fell hard into paul and dropped to the sidewalk she was so terrified she didnt even seem to notice him blood ran from her knees and palms where the window glass had cut her skin the apparent leader of the stormtroopers dragged the man outside destroy the place he called to his friends who began to push over the counters and shelves rip the pictures from the walls slam the sturdy chairs onto the floor trying to break them the leader glanced at paul then delivered a powerful blow to the midsection of the bookseller who gave a grunt rolled over on his stomach and vomited the brownshirt stepped toward the woman he grabbed her by the hair and was about to strike her in the face when paul out of instinct grabbed his arm the man spun around spittle flying from his mouth set in a large square face he stared into pauls blue eyes who are you do you know who i am hugo felstedt of the berlin castle stormtrooper brigade alexander stefan paul eased the woman aside she bent and helped up the other bookseller who was wiping his mouth tears falling from the pain the humiliation two stormtroopers emerged from the store who is this one asked your card now felstedt cried although hed boxed all his life paul avoided street brawls his father used to sternly lecture the boy that he should never compete in any event where no one oversaw the rules he was forbidden to fight in school yards and alleyways you listening to me son paul had dutifully replied sure pa you bet but sometimes there was nothing to do but meet jake mcguire or little bill carter and take and give some knuckle he wasnt sure what made those times different but somehow you knew without a doubt that you couldnt walk away and sometimes maybe a lot of times you could but you just plain didnt want to he sized up the man he was like the kid lieutenant vincent manielli paul decided young and muscled but mostly talk the american eased his weight to his toes balanced himself and struck felstedts midsection with a nearly invisible straight right the mans jaw dropped and he backed up struggling for breath tapping his chest as if searching for his heart you swine one of the others cried in a high voice shocked reaching for his pistol paul danced forward grabbed the mans right hand pulled it from the holster cover and popped a left hook into his face in boxing there is no pain worse than a solid blow to the nose and as the cartilage snapped and the blood flowed onto his camelbrown uniform the man gave a keening howl and staggered back against the wall tears pouring from his eyes hugo felstedt had by now dropped to his knees and was no longer interested in his heart he was gripping his belly as he retched pathetically the third trooper went for his gun paul stepped forward fast fists closed dont he warned calmly the brownshirt suddenly bolted up the street crying ill get some help ill get some help the fourth stormtrooper stepped outside paul moved toward him and he cried please dont hurt me eyes fixed on the brownshirt paul knelt opened the satchel and began rummaging through the papers inside to find the pistol his eyes dipped for a moment and the stormtrooper bent suddenly grabbed some shards of window glass and flung them toward paul he ducked but the man launched himself into the american and caught him on the cheek with his brassknuckled fist it was a glancing blow but paul was stunned and fell backward over his briefcase into a small weedy garden next to the store the brownshirt leapt after him they grappled the man was not particularly strong nor was he a trained fighter but still it took paul a moment to struggle to his feet angry that hed been caught off guard he grabbed the mans wrist twisted sharply and heard a snap oh the man whispered he sagged to the ground and passed out felstedt was rolling into a sitting position wiping vomit from his face paul pulled the mans pistol from his belt and flung it onto the roof of a low building nearby he turned to the bookseller and the woman leave now go speechless they stared at him now he muttered sharply a whistle sounded up the street some shouts paul said run the bookseller wiped his mouth again and glanced at the remains of their shop one last time the woman put her arm around his shoulders and they hurried away looking in the opposite direction down rosenthaler street paul noted a half dozen brownshirts running in his direction you jew swine the man with the broken nose muttered oh youre done for now paul grabbed the satchel scooped the scattered contents back inside and began running toward a nearby alley a glance behind the clutch of large men was in pursuit where the hell had they all come from breaking from the alley he found himself on a street of residential buildings pushcarts decrepit restaurants and tawdry shops he paused looking around the crowded street he stepped past a vendor selling secondhand clothing and when the man was looking away slipped a dark green jacket off a rack of mens garments he rolled it up and started into another alley to put it on but he heard shouts from nearby there is that him you stop to his left he saw three more stormtroopers pointing his way word had spread of the incident he hurried into the alley longer and darker than the first more shouts behind him then a gunshot he heard a sharp snap as the bullet hit brick near his head he glanced back another three or four uniformed men had joined his pursuers there are far too many people in this country who will chase you simply because you are running paul spit hard against the wall and struggled to suck air into his lungs a moment later he burst out of the alley into another street more crowded than the first he inhaled deeply and lost himself in the crowds of saturday shoppers looking up and down the avenue he saw three or four alleys branching off which one shouts behind him as the stormtroopers poured into the street no time to wait he picked the nearest alleyway wrong choice the only exits from it were five or six doors they were all locked he started to run back out of the culdesac but stopped there were now a dozen brownshirts prowling through the crowds moving steadily toward this alley most of them held pistols boys accompanied them dressed like the flaglowering youngsters hed met yesterday at the olympic village steadying his breathing he pressed flat against the brick a swell mess this is he thought angrily he stuffed his hat tie and suit jacket into the satchel then pulled on the green jacket paul set the bag at his feet and took out the pistol he checked to make certain the gun was loaded and a round chambered bracing his arm against the wall he rested the weapon on his forearm and leaned out slowly aiming at the man who was in the lead felstedt it would be difficult for them to figure out where the shot had come from and paul hoped theyd scatter for cover giving him the chance to lam through the rows of nearby pushcarts risky but theyd be at this alley in a few minutes what other choices did he have closer closer touching the ice pressure slowly increasing on the trigger as he aimed at the center of the mans chest the sights floating on the spot where the diagonal leather strap from belt to shoulder covered his heart no the voice whispered urgently in his ear paul spun around leveling the pistol at the man whod come up silently behind him he was in his forties dressed in a wellworn suit his thick hair was swept back with oil and he had a bushy mustache he was some inches shorter than paul his belly protruding over his belt in his hands was a large cardboard carton you may point that elsewhere he said calmly nodding down at the pistol the american didnt move the gun who are you perhaps we may converse later we have more urgent matters now he stepped past paul and looked around the corner a dozen of them you must have done something quite irksome i beat up three of them the german lifted a surprised eyebrow ach well i assure you sir if you kill one or two there will be hundreds more here within minutes theyll hunt you down and they may kill a dozen innocent people in the process i can help you escape paul hesitated if you dont do as i say they will kill you murder and marching are the only things they do well put the box down the man did and paul lifted his jacket looked at the waistband then gestured for him to turn in a circle i have no gun the same gesture impatient the german turned paul patted his pockets and ankles he was unarmed the man said i was watching you you removed your jacket and hat thats good and you stood out like a virgin on nollendorf plaza in that gauche tie but it is likely youll be searched you must discard the clothes a nod toward the satchel running footsteps sounded nearby paul stepped back considering the words the advice made sense he dug the items out of the satchel and stepped to a trash bin no the man said not there if you wish to dispose of something in berlin dont throw it into food bins because people foraging for scraps will find it and dont throw it into the waste containers or the gestapo or the vmen or amen from the sd will find it they regularly go through garbage the only safe place is the sewer no one goes through the sewers not yet in any case paul glanced down at a nearby grating and reluctantly shoved in the items his luckoftheirish tie now ill add something to your role as an escaperfromdungshirts he reached into his jacket pocket and extracted several hats he selected a lightcolored canvas crush hat he unfurled and handed it to paul then replaced the others put it on the american did so now the pistol too you must get rid of it i know you are hesitant but in truth it will do you little good no gun carries enough bullets to stop all the stormtroopers in the city let alone a puny luger yes or no instinct again told him the man was right he crouched down and tossed the gun down the grating as well he heard a splash far below street level now follow me the man picked up the carton when paul hesitated he whispered ach youre thinking how can you possibly trust me you dont know me at all but sir i would say that under the circumstances the real question is how can you not trust me still its your choice you have about ten seconds to decide he laughed doesnt that always seem to be the way the more important the decision the less the time to make it he walked to a door fiddled with a key and unlocked it he glanced back paul followed they stepped into a storeroom and the german swung the door shut and locked it watching through the greasy window paul saw the band of stormtroopers step into the alley look around then continue on the room was densely packed with boxes and crates dusty bottles of wine the man paused nodding to a carton take that it will be a prop for our storytelling and perhaps a profitable one too paul looked at the man angrily i could have left my clothes and the gun in your warehouse here i didnt have to throw them out the man jutted out his lower lip ach yes except that this isnt exactly my warehouse now that carton please sir we must hurry paul set the satchel on top hefted the box and followed they emerged into a dusty front room the man glanced out the filthy window he began to open the door wait paul said he touched his cheek the cut from the brass knuckles was bleeding slightly he ran his hands over some dirty shelves and pat ted his face covering the wound and his jacket and slacks the smudges would draw less attention than the blood good the german said and pushed the door wide you are now a sweaty laborer and i will be your boss this way he turned directly toward a cluster of three or four stormtroopers speaking to a woman who lounged against a street lamp holding a tiny poodle on a red leash paul hesitated come on dont slow up they were almost past the brownshirts when one of them called to the two men you there stop we will see your papers one of his friends joined him and they stepped in front of paul and the german seething that hed given up his gun paul glanced to his side the man from the alley frowned ach our cards yes yes i am very sorry gentlemen you must understand were forced to work today as you can see a nod toward the cartons it was unplanned an urgent delivery you must carry your card with you at all times paul said we are only going a short way we are looking for a large man in a gray suit and brown hat he is armed have you seen anyone like that a consulting glance no paul said the second brownshirt patted both the german and paul for weapons then grabbed the satchel and opened it glanced inside he lifted out the copy of mein kampf paul could see the bulge where the russian passport and rubles were hidden the german from the alley said quickly nothing of interest in there but now i recall that we do have our identification look in my mans carton the brownshirts glanced at each other the one holding hitlers book tossed it back inside set the satchel down and ripped open the top of the carton that paul held as you can see we are the bordeaux brothers a brownshirt laughed and the german continued but you can never be too sure perhaps you should take two of those with you for verification several bottles of red wine were lifted out the stormtroopers waved the men on paul picked up the satchel and they continued up the street two blocks farther on the german nodded across the street in there the place he indicated appeared to be a nightclub decorated with nazi flags a wooden sign read the aryan café are you mad paul asked have i been right so far my friend please inside its the safest place to be dungshirts arent welcome here nor can they afford it as long as you havent beaten any ss officers or senior party officials youll be safe you havent have you paul shook his head he reluctantly followed the man inside he saw immediately what the man meant about the price of admission a sign said us dm jesus he thought the ritziest place he went to in new york the debonair club had a fivebuck cover how much dough did he have on him that was nearly half the money morgan had given him but the doorman looked up and recognized the mustachioed german he nodded the men inside without charging them they pushed through a curtain into a small dark bar cluttered with antiques and artifacts movie posters dusty bottles otto the bartender called shaking the mans hand otto set his carton on the bar and gestured for paul to do the same with his i thought you were delivering one case only my comrade here helped me carry a second one ten bottles only in his so that makes the total seventy marks now does it not i asked for one case i need only one case i will pay for only one case as the men dickered paul focused on the loud words coming from a large radio behind the bar modern science has found myriad ways to protect the body from disease and yet if you dont apply those simple rules of hygiene you can fall greatly ill with our foreign visitors in town it is likely that there may be new strains of infection so it is vital to keep in mind rules of sanitation otto finished the negotiation apparently to his satisfaction and glanced out the window theyre still there prowling let us have a beer i will let you buy me one he noticed paul looking at the radio which no one in the bar seemed to be paying attention to despite the high volume ach you like the deep voice of our propaganda minister its dramatic yes but to see him hes a runt i have contacts all over wilhelm street all the government buildings they call him mickey mouse behind his back let us go in the back i cant stand the droning every establishment must have a radio to broadcast the party leaders speeches and must turn the sound up when they are transmitting its illegal not to here they keep the radio up front to satisfy the rules the real club is in the back rooms now do you like men or women what men or women which do you prefer im not interested in i understand but since we must wait for the brownshirts to grow tired of their pursuit please tell me which would you rather look at while we have the beer youve so generously agreed to buy me men dancing as men men dancing as women or women dancing as themselves women ach me too its illegal to be a homosexual in germany now but you would be surprised how many national socialists seem to enjoy one anothers company for reasons other than discussing rightist politics this way he pushed through a blue velvet curtain the second room was for men who enjoyed women it seemed they sat down at a rickety wicker table in the blackpainted room decorated with chinese lanterns paper streamers and animal trophies as dusty as the nazi flags hanging from the ceiling paul handed back the canvas cap it disappeared into the mans pocket with the others thanks otto nodded ach what are friends for he looked for a waiter or waitress ill be back in a moment paul rose and went to the lavatory he washed the smudges and blood off his face and combed his hair back with lotion which shortened and darkened it making him appear somewhat different from the man the brownshirts were seeking his cheek was not badly cut but a bruise had formed around it he stepped out of the washroom and slipped backstage he found the dressing room for performers a man sat at the far end smoking a cigar and reading a newspaper he didnt pay any attention as paul dipped his finger into a pot of makeup returning to the lavatory he smoothed the cosmetic over the bruise he had some experience with makeup all good boxers knew the importance of concealing injuries from their opponents he returned to the table where he found otto gesturing toward the waitress a pretty darkhaired young woman but she was busy and the man sighed in irritation he turned back regarding paul closely now you are obviously not from here because you know nothing of our culture im speaking of the radio and of the dungshirts whom you would not have antagonized by fighting had you been a german but your language is perfect the faintest of accents and not french or slav or spanish what breed of dog are you i appreciate the help otto but some matters ill keep to myself no matter ive decided youre american or english probably american i know from your movies the way you make your sentences yes you are american who else would have a troop of dungshirts after him but a brash american with big balls you are from the land of heroic cowboys who take on a tribe of indians alone where is that waitress he looked about smoothing his mustache now introductions i am presenting myself to you otto wilhelm friedrich georg webber and you but perhaps you wish to keep your name to yourself i think thats wiser webber chuckled so you beat up three of them and earned the endless affection of the brownshirts and the bitch brood the what hitler youth the boys scurrying among the legs of the stormtroopers webber eyed pauls red knuckles you perhaps enjoy the boxing matches mr nameless you look like an athlete i can get you olympic tickets there are none left as you know but i can get them day seats good ones no thanks or i can get you into one of the olympic parties max schmeling will be at some schmeling paul raised an eyebrow he admired germanys most successful heavyweight champ and had been in the bleachers at yankee stadium just last month to see the bout between schmeling and joe louis shocking everyone schmeling knocked out the brown bomber in the twelfth round the evening had cost paul eight for the ticket and the six cnotes for the bum bet webber continued he will be there with his wife she is so beautiful anny ondra an actress you know you will have a truly memorable evening it would be quite expensive but i can arrange it you need a dinner jacket of course i can provide that too for a small fee ill pass ach webber muttered as if paul had made the mistake of his life the waitress stopped at their table and she stood close to paul smiling down at him i am liesl your name is hermann paul said you would like what beers for us both a pschorr for me ach webber said sneering at the choice berlin lager for me bottom fermented a large when she glanced at him her look was cool as if hed recently stiffed her on a check liesl gazed into pauls eyes a moment longer then offered a flirtatious smile and walked to another table you have an admirer mr nothermann pretty yes very webber winked if you like i can no paul said firmly webber raised an eyebrow and turned his attention to the stage where a topless woman gyrated she had loose disks of breasts and flabby arms and even from a distance paul could see creases around her mouth which kept up a fierce smile as she moved to the scratchy sound of a gramophone there is no live music here now in the afternoon webber explained but at night they have good bands brass i love brass i have a gramophone disk i play often the great british bandleader john philip sousa sorry to tell you hes american no its true what a country that must be america they have such wonderful cinema and millions of motorcars i hear and now i learn they have john philip sousa too paul watched the waitress approach slim hips rocking back and forth liesl set the beers down shed put on fresh perfume it seemed in the three or four minutes shed been away she smiled at paul and he grinned back then glanced at the check not familiar with german currency and not wishing to draw attention to himself fumbling with coins paul gave her a fivemark note which was about two bucks four bits he guessed liesl took the difference to be a tip and thanked him heartily gripping his hand in both of hers he was afraid shed kiss him he didnt know how to ask for the rest of the money back and decided to put the loss down to a lesson about german customs with another adoring glance liesl left the table then instantly grew sullen at the prospect of waiting on other tables webber clinked his stein against pauls and both men drank deeply webber eyed paul closely and said so what kind of cons do you run cons when i first saw you in the alley with that gun i thought ach hes no soci or kosi what soci a social democrat it used to be a big political party until it was outlawed kosis are the communists theyre not only outlawed theyre dead no i knew you were not an agitator you were one of us a con runner an artistofdarkdealings he glanced around the room dont worry as long as were quiet its safe to talk no microphones here no party loyalty either not inside these walls after all a mans dick is always more reliable than his conscience and national socialists have no consciences to start with webber persisted so what kind of cons i dont do cons i came over for the olympics you did he winked there must be a new event this year that ive not heard of im a sportswriter ach a writer yet one who fights brownshirts keeps his name to himself walks around with a peashooter of a luger changes clothes to avoid pursuers and then slicks back his hair and puts on pancake webber tapped his own cheek and smiled knowingly i happened to run into some stormtroopers attacking this couple i stopped them as for the luger it was one of theirs i stole it yes yes so you say do you know al capone of course not paul said exasperated webber sighed loudly genuinely disappointed i follow american crime many of us do here in germany we are always reading crime shockers novels you understand many are set in america i followed with great interest the fate of john dillinger he was betrayed by a woman in a red dress and shot down in an alley after theyd been to the cinema i think it was good he saw the film before they killed him he died with that small pleasure within him though it would have been better yet had he seen the film gotten drunk bedded the woman and then been shot that would have been a perfect death yes i think that despite what you say you are a real mobster mr john dillinger liesl beautiful liesl more beer here my friend is buying two more webbers stein was empty pauls was threequarters full he called to liesl no not for me for him only as she disappeared toward the bar she tossed paul another adoring look the brightness in her eyes the slim figure reminding him of marion he wondered how she was what she was doing at the moment which would be six or seven hours earlier in america call me shed said in their last conversation thinking he was bound for detroit on business paul had learned you could actually place a telephone call across the atlantic ocean but it cost almost a minute besides no competent button man would think of leaving such evidence of his whereabouts he looked over the nazis in the audience some ss or soldiers in their immaculate black or gray uniforms some businessmen most were tipsy some were well into their afternoon drunks all smiled gamely but seemed bored as they watched a very unsexy sex show when the waitress arrived she did indeed have two beers she set one in front of webber whom she otherwise ignored and said to paul you may pay for your friends but yours is a present from me she took his hand and placed it around the handle of the stein twentyfive pfennigs thank you he said reflecting that the extra marks from the fiver would probably have bought him a keg he gave her a mark this time she shivered with pleasure as if hed slipped her a diamond ring liesl kissed his forehead please enjoy and headed off again ach you got the familiar discount me i have to pay fifty of course most foreigners pay a mark seventyfive webber drained a third of the stein he wiped the residue from his mustache with the back of his arm and pulled out a pack of cigars these are vile but i rather like them he offered the pack to paul who shook his head they are cabbage leaves soaked in tobacco water and nicotine its hard now to find real cigars what line are you in paul asked aside from being a wine importer webber laughed and squinted a coy gaze at paul he worked to inhale the acrid smoke and then said thoughtfully many different things much of what i do is to acquire and sell hardtofind items military goods are in demand lately not weapons of course but insignias canteens belts boots uniforms everyone here loves uniforms when husbands are at work their women go out and buy them uniforms even if they have no rank or any affiliation children wear them infants medals bars ribbons epaulets collar tabs and i sell them to the government for our real soldiers too we have conscription again our army is swelling they need uniforms and cloth is hard to come by i have people from whom i acquire uniforms and then i alter them somewhat and sell them to the army you steal them from one government source and sell them back to another ach mr john dillinger you are very funny he looked across the room one moment hans come here hans a man dressed in a tuxedo appeared he looked suspiciously at paul but webber assured him that they were friends and then said i have come into possession of some butter would you like it how much how much butter or how much the price both naturally ten kilos seventyfive marks if its like last time you mean you have six kilos of butter mixed with four kilos of coal oil lard water and yellow dye that is too much to pay for six kilos of butter then trade me two cases of french champagne one case ten kilos for one case webber looked indignant six kilos as i explained eighteen bottles with a dismissing shrug the maître d said add more dye and ill agree a dozen patrons refused to eat your white butter last month and who could blame them after he had left paul finished his beer and shook a chesterfield out of the pack once again keeping it below the level of the table so that no one could see the american brand it took him four tries to light the cigarette the cheap matches the club provided kept breaking webber nodded at them i didnt supply those my friend dont blame me paul inhaled long on the chesterfield and then asked why did you help me otto because of course you were in need you do good deeds do you paul raised an eyebrow webber stroked his mustache all right let us be honest in these days one must look much harder for opportunities than in the past and im an opportunity who can say mr john dillinger perhaps no perhaps yes if no then ive wasted nothing but an hour drinking beer with a new friend and that is no waste at all if yes then perhaps we can both profit he rose walked to the window and looked out past a thick curtain i think it is safe for you to leave whatever you are doing in our vibrant city i may be just the man for you i know many people here people in important places no not the men at the top i mean the people it is best to know for those in our line of work what people the little people well placed did you hear the joke about the town in bavaria that replaced its weathervane with a civil servant why because civil servants know better than anyone which way the wind is blowing ha he laughed hard then his face grew solemn again and he finished the stein of beer in truth im dying here dying of boredom i miss the old days so leave a message or come see me im usually here in this room or at the bar he wrote the address down on a napkin and pushed it forward glancing at the square of paper paul memorized the address and pushed the paper back webber watched him ah youre quite the savvy sportswriter arent you they walked to the door paul shook his hand thank you otto outside webber said now my friend farewell i hope to see you again then he scowled and for me a quest for yellow dye ach this is what my life has become lard and yellow dye chapter nine reinhard ernst sitting in his spacious office in the chancellory looked over the carelessly formed characters in the note once again col ernst i await the report you have agreed to prepare on your waltham study i have devoted some time to review it on monday adolf hitler he cleaned his wirerimmed glasses replaced them he wondered what the careless lettering revealed of the writer the signature was particularly distinctive the adolf was a compressed lightning bolt hitler was somewhat more legible but it sloped curiously and severely downward to the right ernst spun around in his chair and stared out the window he felt just like an army commander who knew that the enemy was approaching about to attack but not knowing when he would strike what his tactics would be how strong was his force where he would establish the lines of assault where the flanking maneuver would come aware too that the battle would be decisive and the fate of his army indeed of the whole nation was at stake he wasnt exaggerating the gravity of his dilemma because ernst knew something about germany that few others sensed or would admit out loud that hitler would not be in power long the leaders enemies both within the country and without were too many he was caesar he was macbeth he was richard as his madness played itself out he would be ousted murdered or even die by his own hand so astonishingly manic were his rages and others would step into the immense vacuum after his demise and not göring either greed of soul and greed of body were in a footrace to bring him down ernsts own feeling was that with the two leaders gone and goebbels pining away for his lost love hitler the national socialists would wither and a centrist prussian statesman would emerge another bismarck imperial perhaps but reasonable and a brilliant statesman and ernst might even have a hand in that transformation for short of a bullet or bomb the only sure threat to adolf hitler and the party was the german army in june of hitler and göring murdered or arrested much of the stormtrooper leadership during the socalled night of the long knives the purge was felt necessary largely to appease the regular army which had become jealous of the huge brownshirt militia hitler had regarded the horde of thugs on one side and the german military the direct heirs of the nineteenth centurys hohenzollern battalions on the other and without a moments hesitation chose the latter two months later upon president hindenburgs death hitler took two steps to solidify his position first he declared himself the unrestricted leader of the nation second and far more important he required the german armed forces to pledge a personal oath of loyalty to him de tocqueville had said that there would never be a revolution in germany for the police would not allow it no hitler wasnt concerned about a popular uprising his only fear was the army and it was a new enlightened military that ernst had devoted his life to since the end of the war an army that would protect germany and its citizens from all threats perhaps ultimately even from hitler himself yet he reflected hitler was not gone yet and ernst couldnt afford to ignore the author of this note which was as troubling to him as the distant rumble of armor approaching through the night col ernst i await the report he had hoped that the intrigue göring set in motion would fade away but this piece of onionskin paper meant that it would not he understood that he had to act quickly to prepare for and repel the attack after a difficult debate the colonel came to a decision he pocketed the letter rose from his desk and left his office telling his secretary that he would return within a half hour down one hall down another past the ubiquitous construction work in the old dusty building workers busy even on the weekend were everywhere building was the metaphor for the new germany a nation rising from the ashes of versailles being reconstructed according to hitlers oftenquoted philosophy of bringingintoline with national socialism every citizen and institution in the country down another hallway under a stern portrait of the leader in threequarter view looking slightly upward as if at his vision for the nation ernst stepped outside into the gritty wind hot from the broiling afternoon sun hail colonel ernst nodded to the two guards armed with bayonetmounted mausers he was amused at their greeting it was customary for anyone near cabinet rank to be addressed by his full title but mr plenipotentiary was laughably cumbersome down wilhelm street past voss street then prince albrecht street with a glance to his right at no gestapo headquarters in the old hotel and artsandcrafts school continuing south to his favorite café he ordered a coffee he sat for only a moment and then walked to the phone kiosk he called a number dropped some pfennigs into the slot and was connected a womans voice answered good day please dame keitel no sir i am the housekeeper is doctorprofessor keitel available this is reinhard ernst one moment please a moment later a mans soft voice came through the line good day colonel though a hot one indeed ludwig we need to meet today an urgent matter has come up about the study you can make yourself available urgent extremely so can you come to my office im awaiting word on some matters from england so i must be at my desk four pm would be convenient yes of course they rang off and ernst returned to his coffee what ridiculous measures he needed to resort to simply to find a phone not monitored by görings minions i have seen war from the inside and from the out he thought the battlefield is horrible yes inconceivably horrible but how much purer and cleaner even angelic is war compared with a struggle where your enemies are beside not facing you on the fifteenmile ride from downtown berlin to the olympic village along a wide perfectly smooth highway the taxi driver whistled happily and told paul schumann that he was anticipating many wellpaying fares during the olympics suddenly the man grew silent as some ponderous classical music poured from a radio the opel was equipped with two one to dispatch the driver and one for public transmissions beethoven the driver commented it precedes all official broadcasts we will listen a moment later the music faded and a raw passionate voice began speaking in the first place it is not acceptable to treat this question of infection frivolously it must be understood that good health would depend and does depend on finding ways to treat not only the symptoms of the disease but the source of the illness as well look at the tainted waters of a stagnant pond a breeding ground for germs but a fastmoving river does not offer the same climate for such danger our campaign will continue to locate and drain these stagnant pools thereby offering germs and the mosquitoes and flies that carry them no place to multiply moreover paul listened for a moment longer but the repetitious rambling bored him he tuned out the meaningless sound and looked at the sunbaked landscape the houses the inns as the pretty suburbs west of the city gave way to more sparse areas the driver turned off the hamburg highway and pulled up in front of the olympic villages main entrance paul paid the man who thanked him by lifting an eyebrow but said nothing remaining fixed on the words streaming from the radio he considered asking the driver to wait but decided it would be wiser to find someone else to take him back to town the village was hot in the afternoon sun the wind smelled salty like ocean air but it was dry as alum and carried a fine grit paul displayed his pass and continued down the perfectly laid sidewalk past rows of narrow trees perfectly spaced rising straight from round disks of mulch in the perfect green grass the german flag snapped smartly in the hot wind red and white and black ach surely you know at the american dorms he bypassed the reception area with its german soldier and slipped into his room through the back door he changed his outfit burying the green jacket in a basket full of dirty laundry there being no sewers handy and putting on creamcolored flannels a tennis shirt and a light cableknit sweater he brushed his hair differently to the side the makeup had worn off but there was nothing he could do about that now as he stepped out the door with his suitcase and satchel a voice called hey paul he glanced up to see jesse owens dressed in gymnasium clothes returning to the dorm owens asked whatre you doing heading into town get some work done naw paul we were hoping youd stay around you missed an allright ceremony last night youve gotta see the food they got here its swell i know its grand but i gotta skip im doing some interviews in town owens stepped closer then nodded at the cut and bruise on pauls face then the runners sharp eyes dropped down to the mans knuckles which were raw and red from the fight hope the rest of your interviews go better than the one this morning dangerous to be a sportswriter in berlin looks like i took a spill nothing serious not for you maybe owens said amused but what about the fellow you landed on paul couldnt help but smile the runner was just a kid but there was something worldly about him maybe growing up a negro in the south and midwest made you mature faster same with putting yourself through school on the heels of the depression like stumbling into his own line of work had changed paul changed him real fast what exactly are you doin here paul the runner whispered just my job he answered slowly just doing my job say whats the wire on stoller and glickman hope they havent been sidelined nope theyre still scheduled owens said frowning but the rumors arent sounding good good luck to them and to you too jesse bring home some gold well do our best see you later maybe paul shook his hand and walked off toward the entrance to the village where a line of taxis waited hey paul he turned to see the fastest man in the world saluting him a grin on his face the poll of the vendors and benchsitters along rosenthaler street had been futile though janssen confirmed that hed learned some new curses when a flower seller found out he was troubling her only to ask questions not to buy anything there had been a shooting not far away kohl had learned but that was an ss matter perhaps about their jealously guarded minor security matter and none of the elite guard would deign to speak to the kripo about it upon their return to headquarters however they found that a miracle had occurred the photographs of the victim and of the fingerprints from dresden alley were on willi kohls desk look at this janssen kohl said gesturing at the glossy pictures neatly assembled in a file he sat down at his battered desk in his office in the alex the kripos massive ancient building nicknamed for the bustling square and surrounding neighborhood where it was located alexander plaza all the state buildings were being renovated except theirs it seemed the criminal police were housed in the same grimy building theyd been in for years kohl did not mind this however since it was some distance from wilhelm street which at least gave some practical autonomy to the police even if none now existed administratively kohl was also fortunate to have an office of his own a room that measured four meters by six and contained a desk a table and three chairs on the oak plain of the desk were a thousand pieces of paper an ashtray a pipe rack and a dozen framed photographs of his wife children and parents he rocked forward in his creaking wooden chair and looked over the crime scene photographs and the ones of the fingerprints youre talented janssen these are quite good thank you sir the young man was looking down at them nodding kohl regarded him closely the inspector himself had taken a traditional route up through the police ranks the son of a prussian farmer young willi had become fascinated with both berlin and police work from the storybooks hed read growing up at eighteen hed come to the city and gotten a job as a uniformed schupo officer went through the basic training at the famed berlin police institute and worked his way up to corporal and sergeant receiving a college degree along the way then with a wife and two children hed gone on to the institutes officers school and joined kripo rising over the years from detectiveinspector assistant to senior detectiveinspector his young protégé on the other hand had gone a different route one that was far more common nowadays janssen had graduated from a good university several years ago passed the qualifying exam in jurisprudence then after attending the police institute he was accepted at this young age as a detectiveinspector candidate apprenticed to kohl it was often hard to draw the inspector candidate out janssen was reserved he was married to a solid darkhaired woman who was now pregnant with their second child the only time janssen grew animated was when he talked about his family or about his passion for bicycling and hiking until all police were put on overtime because of the approaching olympics detectives worked only half days on wednesday and janssen would often change into his hiking shorts in a kripo lavatory at noon and go off on a wander with his brother or his wife but whatever made him tick the man was smart and ambitious and kohl was very fortunate to have him over the past several years the kripo had been hemorrhaging talented officers to the gestapo where the pay and opportunities were far better when hitler came to power the number of kripo detectives around the country was twelve thousand now it was down to eight thousand and of those many were former gestapo investigators sent to the kripo in exchange for the young officers whod transferred out in truth they were largely drunks and incompetents the telephone buzzed and he picked it up this is kohl inspector it is schreiber the clerk you spoke to today hail hitler yes yes hail on the way back to the alex from the summer garden kohl and janssen had stopped at the haberdashery department at tietz the massive department store that dominated the north side of alexander plaza near kripo headquarters kohl had shown the clerk the picture of görings hat and asked what kind it was the man didnt know but would look into the matter any luck kohl asked him ach yes yes i have found the answer its a stetson made in the united states as you know minister göring shows the finest taste kohl made no comment on that are they common here no sir quite rare expensive as you can imagine where could i buy one in berlin in truth sir i dont know the minister im told specialorders them from london kohl thanked him hung up and told janssen what hed learned so perhaps hes an american janssen said but perhaps not since göring wears the same hat a small piece of the puzzle janssen but you will find that many small pieces often give a clearer picture of a crime than a single large piece he took the brown evidence envelopes from his pocket and selected the one containing the bullet the kripo had its own forensics laboratory dating back to when the prussian police force had been the nations preeminent law enforcer if not the worlds in the weimar days the kripo closed percent of the murder cases in berlin but the lab too had been raided by the gestapo both for equipment and personnel and the technical workers at headquarters were harried and far less competent than they had once been willi kohl therefore had taken it upon himself to become an expert in certain areas of criminal science despite the absence of his personal interest in firearms kohl had made quite a study of ballistics modeling his approach on the best firearms laboratory in the world the one at j edgar hoovers federal bureau of investigation in washington dc he shook the bullet out onto a clean piece of paper placing the monocle in his eye he found a pair of tweezers and examined the slug carefully your eyes are better he said you look the inspector candidate carefully took the bullet and the monocle while kohl pulled a binder from his shelf it contained photographs and sketches of many types of bullets the binder was large several hundred pages but the inspector had organized it by caliber and by number of grooves and lands the stripes pressed into a lead slug by the rifling in the barrel and whether they twisted to the left or the right only five minutes later janssen found a match ach this is good news kohl said how so it is an unusual weapon our killer used look its a ninemillimeter largo round most likely from the spanish star modelo a good for us it is rare and as you pointed out it is either a new weapon or one that has been fired little let us hope the former janssen you have a way with words please send a telegram to all police precincts in the area have them query gun shops and see if any have sold a new or littleused star modelo a in the past several months or ammunition for such a gun no make that the past year i want names and addresses of all purchasers yes sir the young inspector candidate took down the information and started for the teletype room wait add as a postscript to your message a description of our suspect and that he is armed the inspector gathered up the clearest photographs of the suspects fingerprints and the inked card of the victims sighing he said and now i must try to be diplomatic ach how i hate doing that chapter ten i am sorry inspector kohl the department is engaged entirely yes sir said the prim bald man in a tight suit buttoned high on his chest several hours ago we were ordered to stop all other investigations and compile a list of everyone in the files with a russian background or pronounced appearance they were in the anteoffice of the kripos large identification division where fingerprint analysis and anthropometry were performed everyone in berlin yes there is some alert going on ah the security matter again the one that krauss had deemed too insignificant to mention to the kripo theyre using fingerprint examiners to check personal files and our fingerprint examiners no less drop everything the buttonedup little man replied those were my orders from sipo headquarters himmler again kohl thought please gerhard these are vital he showed him the fingerprint card and the photos they are good pictures gerhard examined them very clear put three or four examiners on it please thats all im asking a pinchedface laugh crossed the administrators face i cannot inspector three impossible kohl felt the frustration a student of foreign criminal science he looked with envy at america and england where forensic identification was now done almost exclusively by fingerprint analysis here yes fingerprints were used for identification but unlike in the united states the germans had no uniform system of analyzing prints each area of the country was different a policeman in westphalia might analyze a print in one way a berlin kripo officer would analyze it differently by posting the samples back and forth it was possible to achieve an identification but the process could take weeks kohl had long advocated standardizing fingerprint analysis throughout the country but had met with considerable resistance and lethargy hed also urged his supervisor to buy some american wirephoto machines remarkable devices that could transmit clear facsimile photographs and pictures such as of fingerprints over telephone lines in minutes they were however quite expensive and his boss had turned down the request without even taking the matter up with the police president more troubling to kohl though was that once the national socialists came to power fingerprints took on less importance than the antiquated system of bertillon anthropometry in which measurements of the body face and head were used to identify criminals kohl like most modern detectives rejected bertillon analysis as unwieldy yes each persons body structure was largely different from anothers but dozens of precise measurements were needed to categorize someone and unlike fingerprints criminals rarely left sufficient bodily impressions at the scene to link any individual to the site of the crime through bertillon data but the national socialists interest in anthropometry went beyond merely identifying someone it was the key to what they termed the science of criminobiology categorizing people as criminal irrespective of their behavior solely on their physical characteristics hundreds of gestapo and ss labored fulltime to correlate size of nose and shade of skin for instance to proclivity to commit a crime himmlers goal was not to bring criminals to justice but to eliminate crime before it occurred to kohl this was as frightening as it was foolish looking out over the huge room of long tables filled with men and women hunched over documents kohl now decided that the diplomacy hed summoned up on the way here would have no effect a different tactic was required deceit very well tell me a date you can begin your analysis i must tell krauss something hes been nagging me for hours a pause our pietr krauss the gestapos krauss yes ill tell him what shall i tell him gerhard it will take you a week ten days the gestapo is involved krauss and i investigated the crime scene together at least this much was true more or less perhaps this incident relates to the security situation the man said uneasy now im sure it does kohl said perhaps those very prints are from the russian in question the man said nothing but looked over the pictures he was so slim why did he wear such a tight suit i will submit the prints to an examiner i will call you with any results whatever you can do will be appreciated kohl said thinking ach one examiner most likely useless unless he happened to find a lucky match kohl thanked the technician and walked back up the stairs to his floor he entered the office of his superior friedrich horcher who was chief of inspectors for berlinpotsdam the lean grayhaired man with a throwback of a waxed mustache had been a good investigator in his early days and had weathered the seas of recent german politics well horcher had been ambivalent about the party hed been a secret member in the terrible days of the inflation then he quit because of hitlers extreme views only recently had he joined again reluctantly perhaps drawn along inexorably by the course the nation was taking or perhaps he was a true convert kohl had no idea which was the case how is this case coming willi the dresden alley case slowly sir he added grimly resources are occupied it seems our resources yes something is going on an alert of some sort indeed have you heard anything about it i wonder horcher asked no nothing but still we are under such pressure they think the world is watching and one dead man near the tiergarten might ruin the image of our city forever at horchers level irony was a dangerous luxury and kohl could detect none in the mans voice any suspects some aspects of his appearance some small clues thats all horcher straightened the papers on his desk it would be helpful if the perpetrator was a foreigner kohl supplied exactly we shall see i would like to do one thing sir the victim is as yet unidentified this is a handicap i would like to run a picture in the peoples observer and the journal and see if anyone recognizes him horcher laughed a picture of a dead body in the paper without knowing the victim we are largely disadvantaged in the investigation i will send the matter to the propaganda office and see what minister goebbels has to say it would have to be cleared with him thank you sir kohl turned to leave then he paused one other matter chief of inspectors i am still waiting for that report from gatow its been a week i was wondering if you perhaps had received it what was in gatow oh that shooting two kohl corrected two shootings in the first two families picnicking by the havel river southwest of berlin had been shot to death seven individuals including three children the next day thered been a second slaughter eight laborers living in caravans between gatow and charlottenburg the exclusive suburb west of berlin the police commandant in gatow had never handled such a case and had one of his gendarmes call the kripo for help raul an eager young officer had spoken to kohl and had sent photos of the crime scene to the alex willi kohl hardened to homicide investigations had nonetheless been shocked at the sight of the mothers and children gunned down the kripo had jurisdiction over all nonpolitical crimes anywhere in germany and kohl wished to make the murders a priority but legal jurisdiction and allocation of resources were two very different matters particularly in these crimes where the victims were raul informed him jews and poles respectively well let the gatow gendarmerie handle it horcher had told him last week homicides of this magnitude kohl had asked both troubled and skeptical the suburban and rural gendarmes investigated automobile accidents and stolen cows and the chief of the gatow constabulary wilhelm meyerhoff was a dull lazy civil servant who couldnt find his breakfast zwieback without help so kohl had persisted with horcher until he got permission to at least review the crime scene report hed called raul and coached him in basic investigation techniques and had asked him to interview witnesses the gendarme promised to send the report to kohl as soon as his superior approved it kohl had received the photographs but no other materials horcher now said ive heard nothing willi but please jews poles we have other priorities kohl said thoughtfully of course sir i understand i only care that the kosis dont get away with anything the communists what does this have to do with them i didnt form the idea until i saw the photographs but i observed there was something organized about the killings and there was no attempt to cover them up the murders were too obvious to me they seemed almost staged horcher considered this youre thinking the kosis wanted to make it appear that the ss or gestapo were behind the killings yes thats clever willi the red bastards would certainly stoop to that kohl added especially with the olympics the foreign press in town how the kosis would love to mar our image in the eyes of the world i will look into the report willi ill make some calls a good thought on your part thank you sir now go clear the dresden alley case if our chief of police wants a blemishfree city he shall have one kohl returned to his office and sat heavily in his chair massaging his feet as he stared at the photographs of the two murdered families it was nonsense what he had told horcher whatever had happened in gatow it was not a communist plot but the national socialists went for conspiracies like pigs for slop these were games that had to be played ach what an education hed had since january of he put the pictures back into the file folder labeled gatowcharlottenburg and set it aside he then placed the brown envelopes of the evidence hed collected that afternoon into a box on which he wrote dresden alley incident he added the extra photographs of the fingerprints the crime scene and the victim he placed the box prominently on his desk ringing up the medical examiner he learned the doctor was at coffee the assistant told him that unidentified corpse a q had arrived from dresden alley but he had no idea when it would be examined by that night possibly kohl scowled he had hoped the autopsy was at least in progress if not finished he hung up janssen returned the teletypes went out to the precincts sir i told them urgent thank you his phone buzzed and he answered it was horcher again willi minister goebbels has said that we cannot display the picture of the dead man in the newspaper i tried to convince him i was at my most persuasive i can tell you i thought i would prevail but in the end i was not successful well chief of inspectors thank you he hung up thinking cynically most persuasive indeed he doubted the call had even been made kohl told his inspector candidate what the man had said ach and it will be days or weeks before a fingerprint examiner can even narrow down the prints we found janssen take that picture of the victim no no the other one where he looks slightly less dead take it to our printing department have them print up five hundred etchings tell them were in a great hurry say its a joint kripogestapo matter we can at least exploit inspector krauss since it was he who made us late for the summer garden about which i am still perturbed i must say yes sir just as janssen returned ten minutes later the phone buzzed once more and kohl lifted the handset yes kohl here it is georg jaeger how are you georg i am fine working this saturday when id hoped for the lustgarten with my family but so it goes and you working too always work jaeger had been a protégé of kohls some years before he was a very talented detective and after the party had come to power had been asked to join the gestapo hed refused and his blunt rejection had apparently offended some officials he found himself back at the uniformed order police a step down for a kripo detective as it turned out though jaeger excelled at his new job too and soon rose to be in charge of the orpo precinct in northcentral berlin ironically he seemed far happier in his banished territory than in the intriguemired alex i am calling with what i hope is some help professor kohl laughed he recalled that this was how jaeger had referred to kohl when they were working together what might that be we just received a telegram about a suspect in a case you are working on yes yes georg have you found a gun shop that sold a spanish star modelo a already no but i heard of some sa complaining that a man attacked them at a bookshop on rosenthaler street not long ago he fit the description in your message ach georg this is most helpful can you have them meet me where the assault occurred they wont want to cooperate but i keep the fools in line if theyre in my precinct ill make sure theyre there when now immediately certainly professor jaeger gave the address on rosenthaler street then he asked and how is life back at the alex perhaps well save that conversation for another time over schnapps and beer yes of course the orpo commander said knowingly the man would be thinking that kohl was reluctant to discuss certain matters over a telephone line which was certainly true kohls motive for ending the call though had less to do with intrigue than with the pitched urgency he felt to find the man in görings hat ach the brownshirt muttered sarcastically a kripo detective has come to help us look comrades heres an odd sight the man was over two meters tall and like many stormtroopers quite solid from day labor before he joined the sa and from the constant mindless parading he would now do he sat on the curb his canshaped light brown hat dangling from his fingers another brownshirt shorter but just as stocky leaned against the storefront of a small grocery the sign in the window said no butter no beef today next door was a bookshop whose window was shattered glass and tornup books littered the sidewalk this man winced as he held his bandaged wrist a third sat sullenly by himself dried blood stained his shirtfront what got you out of your office inspector the first brownshirt continued not us surely communists could have shot us down like horst wessel and it wouldntve pried you away from your cake and coffee at alexander plaza janssen stiffened at their offensive words but kohls glance restrained him and the detective looked the men over sympathetically a police or government official at kohls level could insult most lowlevel stormtroopers to their faces with no consequences but he now needed their cooperation ah my good gentlemen theres no reason for words like that the kripo is as concerned about your wellbeing as everyone elses please tell me about the ambush ach youre right inspector the larger man said nodding at kohls carefully chosen word it was an ambush he came up from behind while we were enforcing the law against improper books you are hugo felstedt i command the barracks at berlin castle this was a deserted brewery warehouse kohl knew two dozen stormtroopers had taken it over castle could be read flophouse who were they kohl asked nodding at the bookstore a couple a husband and wife it seemed kohl struggled to maintain a look of concern he looked around they escaped too thats right the third stormtrooper finally spoke through missing teeth he said it was a plan of course the two distracted us and then the third came up behind he laid into us with a truncheon i see and he wore a stetson hat like minister göring wears and a green tie thats right the larger one agreed a loud jew tie did you see his face he had a huge nose and fleshy jowls bushy eyebrows and bulbous lips he was quite fat felstedt contributed like on last weeks the stormer did you see that he looked just like the man on the cover this was julius streichers pornographic antisemitic magazine that contained fabricated articles about crimes that jews had committed and nonsense about their racial inferiority the covers featured grotesque caricatures of jews embarrassing even to most national socialists it was published only because hitler enjoyed the tabloid sadly i missed it kohl said dryly and he spoke german yes did he have an accent a jew accent yes yes but perhaps another accent bavarian westphalian saxon maybe a nod of the big mans head yes i think so you know he would not have hurt us if hed come at us like a man not a cowardly kohl interrupted might his accent have been from another country the three regarded one another we wouldnt know would we weve never been out of berlin maybe palestine one offered that could have been it all right so he attacked you from behind with his truncheon and these too the third held up a pair of brass knuckles are those his no theyre mine he took his with him yes yes i see he attacked you from behind yet its your nose that has bled i see i fell forward after he struck me and where was this attack exactly over there he pointed to a small garden jutting into the sidewalk one of our comrades went to summon aid he returned and the jew coward took off fleeing like a rabbit which way there down several alleys to the east i will show you in a moment kohl said did he carry a satchel yes and he took it with him thats right its where he had his truncheons hidden kohl nodded to the garden he and janssen walked to it that was useless his assistant whispered to kohl attacked by a huge jew with brass knuckles and truncheons and probably fifty of the chosen people right behind him i feel janssen that the account of witnesses and suspects is like smoke the words themselves are often meaningless but they might lead you to the fire they walked around the garden looking down carefully here sir janssen called excitedly hed found a small guidebook to the mens olympic village written in english kohl was encouraged it would be odd for foreign tourists to be in this bland neighborhood and coincidentally lose the booklet in just the spot where the struggle had taken place the pages were crisp and unstained suggesting it had lain in the grass for only a short time he lifted it with a handkerchief sometimes one could find fingerprints on paper opening it carefully he found no handwriting on the pages and no clue to the identity of the person whod possessed it he wrapped up the booklet and placed it in his pocket he called to the stormtroopers come here please the three men wandered to the garden stand there in a row the inspector pointed to a spot of bare earth they lined up precisely as stormtroopers were exceedingly talented at doing kohl examined their boots and compared the size and shape to the sole prints in the dirt he saw that the assailant had larger feet than they and that his heels were well worn good then to felstedt he said show us where you pursued him you others can leave now the man with the bloody face called when you find him inspector you will call us we have a cell at our barracks we will deal with him there yes yes perhaps that can be arranged and i will give you plenty of time so that you can have more than three men to handle him the stormtrooper hesitated wondering if he was being insulted he examined his crimsonstained shirt look at this ach when we get him well drain all the blood out of him lets go comrade the two walked off down the sidewalk this way he ran this way felstedt led kohl and janssen down two alleys into crowded gormann street we were sure he went down one of these other alleys we had men covering the far ends of them all but he disappeared kohl surveyed them several alleys branched off from the street one a culdesac the others connecting to different streets all right sir we will take over from here with his comrades gone felstedt was more candid in a low voice he said he is a dangerous man inspector and you feel that your description is accurate a hesitation then a jew clearly he was a jew yes crinkly hair like an ethiopian a jew nose jew eyes the stormtrooper brushed at the stain on his shirt and swaggered away cretin janssen muttered glancing cautiously at kohl who said to be kind the inspector was looking up and down the alleys musing despite his own strain of blindness though i believe what commandant felstedt told us our suspect was cornered but managed to escape and from dozens of sa we will look in the trash containers in the alleys janssen yes sir you think he discarded some clothing or the satchel to escape it is logical they inspected each of the alleys looking into the trash bins nothing but old cartons papers cans bottles rotting food kohl stood for a moment with his hands on his hips glancing around and then asked who does your shirts janssen my shirts they are always impeccably washed and pressed my wife of course then my apologies to her for having to clean and mend the one you are presently wearing why should she need to clean and mend my shirt because you are going to lie down on your belly and fish into that sewer grating but yes yes i know but ive done so many times and with age janssen comes some privilege now off with your jacket its lovely silk no need to repair that as well the young man handed kohl his dark green suit jacket it was quite nice janssens family was well off and he had some money independent of his monthly inspector candidate salary which was fortunate considering the paltry compensation kripo detectives received the young man knelt on the cobblestones and supporting himself with one hand reached into the dark opening as it turned out though the shirt was not badly soiled after all for the young man called out only a moment later something here sir he stood up and displayed a crumpled brown object görings hat and a bonus inside it was the tie indeed gaudy green janssen explained that theyd been resting on a ledge only a half meter below the sewer opening he searched once more but found nothing else we have some answers janssen kohl said examining the inside of the hat the manufacturers label read stetson mitylite another had been stitched inside by the store mannys mens wear new york city more to add to our portrait of the suspect kohl took the monocle from his vest pocket squinted it into his eye and examined some hairs caught in the sweatband he has mediumlength dark brown hair with a bit of red in it not black or crinkly at all straight and there are no stains from cream or hair oil kohl handed the hat and tie to janssen licked the tip of his pencil and jotted these latest observations into his notebook which he then folded closed where to now sir back to the alex and what would we do there eat biscuits and sip coffee as our stormtrooper comrades think we do all day long or watch the gestapo siphon off our resources as they round up every russian in town no i think well go for a drive i hope the dkw doesnt overheat again the last time heidi and i took the children to the country we sat outside falkenhagen for two hours with nothing to do but watch the cows chapter eleven the taxi hed taken from the olympic village dropped him at lützow plaza a busy square near a brown stagnant canal south of the tiergarten paul stepped out smelling fetid water and stood for a moment orienting himself as he looked about slowly he saw no lingering eyes peering at him over newspapers no furtive men in brown suits or uniforms he began walking east this was a quiet residential neighborhood with some lovely houses and some modest recalling perfectly morgans directions he followed the canal for a time crossed it and turned down prince heinrich street he soon came to a quiet road magdeburger alley lined with fourand fivestory residential buildings which reminded him of the quainter tenements on the west side of manhattan nearly all of the houses flew flags most of them national socialist red white and black and several with banners bearing the intertwined rings of the olympics the house he sought no flew one of the latter he pressed the doorbell a moment later footsteps sounded the curtain in a side window wafted as if in a sudden breeze then a pause metal snapped and the door opened paul nodded at the woman who looked out cautiously good afternoon he said in german you are paul schumann thats right she was in her late thirties early forties he guessed a slim figure in a flowery dress with a hemline well below the knees which marion would have labeled pretty unstylish a couple of years out of date her dark blonde hair was short and waved and like most of the women hed seen in berlin she wore no makeup her skin was dull and her brown eyes tired but those were superficial qualities that a few square meals and a couple of nights undisturbed sleep would take care of and curiously because of these distractions it made the woman behind them appear all the more attractive to him not like marions friends marion herself too who sometimes got so dolled up that you never knew what they really looked like i am käthe richter welcome to berlin she thrust a red bony hand forward and shook his firmly i didnt know when youd be arriving mr morgan said sometime this weekend in any case your quarters are ready please come in he stepped into the foyer smelling naphtha from moth repellent and cinnamon and just a hint of lilac perhaps her perfume after she closed and locked the door she looked through the curtained side window once again and examined the street for a moment then she took the suitcase and the leather satchel from him no i i will carry them she said briskly come this way she led him to a door halfway down the dim corridor which still had the original gas lamps installed next to the newer electric fixtures a few faded oil paintings of pastoral scenes were on the walls käthe opened the door and motioned him inside the apartment was large clean and sparsely furnished the front door opened onto the living room a bedroom was in the back to the left and along the wall was a small kitchen separated from the rest of the living area by a stained japanese screen tables were covered with figurines of animals and dolls chipped lacquered boxes and cheap paper fans there were two unsteady electric lamps a gramophone was in the corner next to a large console radio which she walked to and turned on the smoking room is in the front of the building i am sure you are used to a menonly smoking room but here everyone may use it i insist on that he wasnt used to smoking rooms at all he nodded now tell me if you like the rooms i have others if you do not glancing quickly at the place he said it will suit me fine you dont wish to see more the closets run the water examine the view paul had noted that the place was on the ground floor the windows were not barred and he could make a quick exit from the bedroom window the living room window or the hallway door which would lead to other apartments and other means of escape he said to her provided the water doesnt come out of that canal i passed im sure it will be fine as for the view ill be working too hard to enjoy it the radio tubes warmed up and a mans voice filled the room brother the health lecture was still going on more talk of draining swamps and spraying to kill mosquitoes at least fdrs fireside chats were short and sweet he walked over to the set and turned the dial looking for music there was none he shut it off you dont mind do you its your room do as you wish she glanced at the silent radio uncertainly then said mr morgan said youre an american but your german is very good thanks to my parents and grandparents he took the suitcase from her walked into the bedroom and set it on the bed the bag sank deep into the mattress and he wondered if it was filled with down his grandmother had told him that shed had a down bed in nuremberg before they immigrated to new york and as a boy paul had been fascinated at the thought of sleeping on bird feathers when he returned to the living room käthe said i serve a light breakfast across the hall from seven to eight am please let me know the night before when youd like to be served and there is coffee in the afternoon of course youll find a basin in the bedroom the bathroom is up the hall to be shared but for now you are our only guest closer to the olympics it will be much more crowded today you are the king of number twentysix magdeburger alley the castle is yours she walked to the door i will get afternoon coffee now you dont have to i actually yes yes i will its part of the price when she stepped into the hall paul went into the bedroom where a dozen black beetles roamed the floor he opened his briefcase and placed the copy of hitlers mein kampf containing the fake passport and rubles on the bookcase removing his sweater he rolled up the sleeves of his tennis shirt washed his hands then dried them on a threadbare towel käthe returned a moment later with a tray containing a dented silver coffeepot a cup and a small plate covered with a lace doily she set this on the table in front of a wellworn couch please you will sit he did rebuttoning his sleeves he asked do you know reggie morgan well no he just answered an advertisement for the room and paid in advance this was the answer paul had been hoping for he was relieved to learn that she had not contacted morgan which would have made her suspect from the corner of his eye he felt her glance at his cheek you are hurt im tall im always banging my head paul touched his face lightly as if he were hitting himself to illustrate his words the pantomime made him feel foolish and he lowered his hand she rose please wait a few minutes later shed returned with a sticking plaster which she offered him thanks i have no iodine im afraid i looked he went into the bedroom where he stood in front of the mirror behind the washstand and pressed the plaster to his face she called we have no low ceilings here you will be safe is this your building he asked returning no it is owned by a man who is presently in holland käthe replied i manage the house in exchange for room and board is he connected to the olympics olympics no why most of the flags on the street are the nazi national socialist i mean but you have an olympic flag here yes yes she smiled we are in the spirit of the games arent we her german grammar was flawless and she was articulate shed had a different and much better career in the past he could tell but the ragged hands and cracked nails and such tired tired eyes told a story of recent difficulties but he could also sense an energy within her a determination to see life through to better times this he decided was part of the attraction he felt she poured him coffee there is no sugar at the moment the stores have run out i dont take sugar but i have strudel i made it before the supplies ran short she took the doily off the plate on which sat four small pieces of pastry do you know what strudel is my mother made it every saturday my brother and sister would help her theyd pull the dough so thin that you could read through it yes yes she said enthusiastically that is how i make it too you did not help them stretch the dough no i never did im not so talented in the kitchen he took a bite and said but i ate plenty of it this is very good he nodded toward the pot would you like coffee ill pour you some me she blinked oh no he sipped the brew which was weak it had been made from used grounds we will speak your language käthe announced and launched into i have never been over to your country but i want very much to go he could detect only a slight v ing of her w s which is the hardest english sound for germans to form your english is good paul said you mean well she blurted smiling to have caught him in a mistake paul said no your english is good you speak english well good is an adjective well is an adverb most of the time she frowned let me think yes yes you are right i am blushing now mr morgan said you are a writer and youve been to university of course two years at a small college in brooklyn before he dropped out to enlist and go fight in france hed never gotten around to finishing his studies when hed returned that was when life got complicated and college fell by the wayside in fact though hed learned more about words and books working for his grandfather and father in the printing plant than he figured hed ever learn in college but he told her none of this i am a teacher that is to say i was a teacher i taught literature to youngsters as well as the difference between will and shall and may and can oh and good and well which i am now embarrassed about english literature no german though i love many english books there was silence for a moment paul reached into his pocket took out his passport handed it to her she frowned turning it over in his hand im really who i say i am i dont understand the language you asked me about speaking english to see if im really an american not a national socialist informer am i right i her brown eyes quickly examined the floor she was embarrassed its all right he nodded look at it the picture she started to return it but then she paused opened it up and compared the picture to his face he took the booklet back yes you are right i hope you will forgive me mr schumann paul then a smile you must be quite a successful journalist to be so perceptive is the word yes thats the word the party is not so diligent nor so wealthy as to hire americans to spy on little people like me i am thinking so i can tell you that i am not in favor a sigh it was my fault i was not thinking i was teaching goethe the poet to my students and i mentioned simply that i respected his courage when he forbade his son to fight in the german war of independence pacifism is a crime in germany now i was fired for saying that and all my books were confiscated she tossed her hand forgive me i am complaining have you read him goethe i dont think so you would like him he is brilliant he spins colors out of words of all the books taken from me his are the ones i miss the most käthe glanced hungrily at the plate of strudel she hadnt eaten any paul held the plate out to her she said no no thank you if you dont eat one then ill think that you re the national socialist agent trying to poison me she eyed the pastry and took one she ate it quickly when paul looked down to reach for his coffee cup he noted from the corner of his eye that she touched up pastry flakes from the tabletop on her fingertips and lifted them to her mouth staring at him to make sure he wasnt looking when he turned back she said ah but now we have been careless you and i as often happens on first meetings we must be more cautious this reminds me she pointed toward the telephone always keep it unplugged you must be aware of listening devices and if you do make a call assume that you are sharing your conversation with a national socialist lackey that is true especially for any longdistance calls you make from the post office though phone kiosks on the street are im told relatively private thanks paul said but if anybody listened to my conversations all theyd hear is pretty boring talk whats the population of berlin how many steaks will the athletes eat how long did it take to build the stadium things like that ach käthe said softly rising to leave what we have said this afternoon you and i would be considered boring by many but would easily merit a visit from the gestapo if not worse chapter twelve willi kohls battered auto union dkw managed the twenty kilometers to the olympic village west of the city without overheating despite the relentless sunlight that forced both officers to shed their jackets contrary both to their natures and to kripo regulations the route had taken them through charlottenburg and had they continued southwest would have led them toward gatow the two towns near which the polish workers and the jewish families had died the terrible pictures of the murders continued to toss about in kohls memory like bad fish in his gut they arrived at the main entrance of the village which was bustling private cars taxis and buses were dropping off athletes and other personnel trucks were delivering crates luggage and equipment jacketed once more they walked to the gate showed their id cards to the guards who were regular army and were let inside the spacious trimmed grounds around them men carted suitcases and trunks along the wide sidewalks others in shorts and sleeveless shirts exercised or ran look janssen said enthusiastically nodding toward a cluster of japanese or chinese men kohl was surprised to see them in white shirts and flannel trousers and not well he didnt know what loincloths perhaps or embroidered silk robes nearby several dark middle eastern men walked together two of them laughing at what the third had said willi kohl stared like a schoolboy he would certainly enjoy watching the games themselves when they began next week but he was also looking forward to seeing people from nearly every country on earth the only major nations not represented being spain and russia the policemen located the american dormitories in the main building was a reception area they approached the german army liaison officer lieutenant kohl said noting the rank on the mans uniform he stood immediately and then grew even more attentive when kohl identified himself and his assistant hail hitler you are here on business sir thats right he described the suspect and asked if the officer had seen such a man no sir but there are many hundreds of people in the american dormitories alone as you can see the facility is quite large kohl nodded i need to speak to someone who is with the american team some official yes sir i will arrange it five minutes later he returned with a lanky man in his forties who identified himself in english as one of the head coaches he wore white slacks and although the day was very hot a white chainknit sweater vest over his white shirt kohl realized that while the reception area had been nearly empty a short time before now a dozen athletes and others had eased into the room pretending to have some business there as he remembered from the army nothing spread faster than news among men housed together the german officer was willing to interpret but kohl preferred to speak directly to those he was interviewing and said in halting english sir i am being a police inspector with the german criminal police he displayed his id is there some problem we are not certain yet but uhm we try to find a man we would like to speak to perhaps you are knowing him its quite a serious matter janssen offered with perfect english pronunciation kohl had not known he spoke the language so well yes yes the inspector continued he had seemingly this book he lost he held up the guidebook unfurled the handkerchief around it it is given to persons with the olympic games is it thats right not just athletes though everybody weve given out maybe a thousand or so and a lot of the other countries give out the english version too you know yes but we have located too his hat and it was purchased in new york new york so mostly likely he is americaner really the coach asked cautiously his hat kohl continued he is being a large man we are believing with red black brown hair black brown frustrated at his own lack of foreign vocabulary kohl glanced at janssen who said his hair is dark brown straight a reddish tint he wears a light gray suit and this hat and tie kohl nodded toward janssen who produced the evidence from his case the coach looked at them noncommittally and shrugged maybe it would help if you told us what this was about kohl thought again how different life was in america no german would dare ask why a policeman wished to know something it is a matter of state security state security uhhuh well id like to help i sure would but unless youve got something more specific kohl looked around perhaps some person here might be knowing this man the coach called any of you boys know who these belong to they shook their heads or muttered no or nope perhaps then i am in hopes you are having a yes yes a list of peoples who came with you here and addresses to see who would be living in new york we do but only the members of the team and the coaches and youre not suggesting no no kohl believed that the killer was not on the team the athletes were in the spotlight it would be unlikely for one of them to slip away from the village unseen on his first full day in berlin murder a man visit several different places in the city on a mission of some sort then return without arousing suspicion i am doubting this man is an athlete so i cant be much help im afraid the coach crossed his arms you know officer ill bet your immigration department has information on visitors addresses they keep track of everybody entering and leaving the country dont they i heard you fellows in germany are real good at that yes yes i was considered that but unfortunate the information does not present a persons address in his home only his nationality oh tough break kohl persisted what i am also been hoping perhaps a manifest of the ship the manhattan passenger list often it is giving addresses ah yeah that ill bet we do have although you realize there were close to a thousand people on board please i am understanding but still i would most hopefully like to see it you bet only i sure hate to be difficult officer but i think this dorm you know i think we might have diplomatic status sovereign territory so i think youd need a search warrant kohl remembered when a judge needed to approve the search of a suspects house or the demand to turn over evidence the weimar constitution creating the republic of germany after the war had many such protections most borrowed from the american it contained a single rather significant flaw though one that hitler seized upon immediately the right of the president to indefinitely suspend all civil rights oh im merely looking at a few matters here i am having no warrant id really feel better if you got one this is a matter of certain urgency im sure it is but hey it might be better for you too we sure dont want to ruffle any feathers diplomatically ruffle feathers you know what i mean i am understanding the words so how bout if your boss called the embassy or the olympic committee they give me the okay then whatever you want ill hand it to you on a silver platter the okay yes yes the us embassy probably would agree kohl reflected if he handled the request properly the americans would not want the story to circulate that a killer had gotten into germany with their olympic team very good sir kohl said politely i am be contacting the embassy and the committee as you suggest good you take care now hey and good luck at the games your boysre going to give us a run for our money i will be in attendance kohl said i am having my tickets for more than a whole year they said goodbye and kohl and the inspector candidate stepped outside we will call horcher from the radio in the car janssen he can contact the american embassy i am sure this could be kohl stopped speaking hed detected a pungent smell something familiar yet out of place somethings wrong what do this way quickly kohl began walking fast around the back of the main american building the smell was of smoke not cooking smoke which one detected often in the summer from grilling braziers but wood smoke from a stove rare in july what is that word janssen on the sign i cannot make out the english it says showerssteam room no whats the matter sir kohl ran through the door into a large tiled area the lavatory was to the left showers to the right and a separate door led to the steam room it was this door that kohl ran to he flung it open inside was a stove on top of which was a large tray filled with rocks nearby were buckets of water which could be ladled onto the hot rocks to produce steam two young negroes in navy blue cotton exercising outfits stood at the stove in which a fire was blazing one bending down to the door had a round handsome face with a high hairline the other was leaner and had thicker hair that came down farther on his forehead the roundfaced one stood and closed the metal stove door he turned around cocking his eyebrow toward the inspector with a pleasant smile good afternoon sirs kohl said once again in dreaded english i am being we heard how are you doing inspector grand place you fellows made for us here the village i mean i smelled smoke and was grown concerned just getting the fire going nothing like steam for achin muscles added his friend kohl stared through the glass door of the stove the damper was wide open and the flames raged he saw some sheets of white paper curling to ash inside sir janssen began sharply in german what are they but kohl cut him off with a shake of his head and glanced at the first man whod spoken you are kohl squinted and his eyes went wide yes yes you are jesse owens the great runner in kohls germanaccented english the name came out yessa ovens the surprised man extended his sweaty hand shaking the firm grip kohl glanced to the other negro ralph metcalfe the athlete said introducing himself a second handshake hes on the team too owens said yes yes i have heard of you as well you won in los angeles in the california state at the last games welcome to you too kohls eyes dipped to the fire you take the steam bath before you exercise sometimes before sometimes after owens said you a steam man inspector metcalfe asked yes yes from time to time mostly now i soak my feet sore feet owens said wincing i know all about that say why dont we get outa here inspector its a heck of a lot cooler outside he held the door open for kohl and janssen the kripo men hesitated then followed metcalfe into the grassy area behind the dorm youve got a beautiful country inspector metcalfe said yes yes that is true kohl watched the smoke rise from the metal duct above the steam room hope you have luck finding that fellow youre looking for owens said yes yes i am supposed it is not useful to ask if you know of anyone who weared a stetson hat and a green tie a man of large size sorry i dont know anyone like that he glanced at metcalfe who shook his head janssen asked would you know anyone who came here with the team and perhaps left soon went on to berlin or somewhere else the men glanced at each other nope afraid not owens replied i sure dont either metcalfe added ach well it is being an honor to meet you both thank you sir i was followed news of your races in was it the michigan state last year the trials ann arbor you heard about that owens laughed again surprised yes yes world records sadly now we are not getting much news from america still i look forward to the games but i am having four tickets and five children and my wife and future soninlaw we will be present and attending in shifts you would say the heat will not be bothering you i grew up running in the midwest pretty much the same weather there with sudden seriousness janssen said you know there are a lot of people in germany who hope you dont win metcalfe frowned and said because of that bull what hitler thinks about the coloreds no the young assistant said then his face broke into a smile because our bookmakers will be arrested if they accept bets on foreigners we can only bet on german athletes owens was amused so youre betting against us oh we would bet in favor of you kohl said but alas we cant because its illegal no because we are only poor policemans with no money so run like the luft the wind you americans say right run like the wind herr owens and herr metcalfe i will be in the stands and cheering you on though perhaps silently come janssen kohl got several feet then stopped and turned back i must ask again you are being certain no one has worn the brown stetson hat no no of course not or you would have telled me good day they walked around to the front of the dormitory and then toward the exit to the village was that the ships manifest with the name of our killer on it sir what the negroes burned in the stove it is possible but say suspect remember not killer the smell of the burning paper wafted through the hot air and stung kohls nose taunting him and adding to the frustration what can we do about it nothing kohl said simply sighing angrily we can do nothing and it was my fault your fault sir ach the subtleties of our job janssen i wished to give nothing away about our purpose and so i said we wished to see this man about a matter of state security which we say far too readily nowadays my words suggested that the crime wasnt the murder of an innocent victim but perhaps an offense against the government which of course was at war with their country less than twenty years ago many of those athletes undoubtedly lost relatives even fathers to the kaisers army and might feel a patriotic interest in protecting such a man and now it is too late to retract what i so carelessly said when they reached the street in front of the village janssen turned toward where they had parked the dkw but kohl asked where are you going arent we returning to berlin not yet weve been denied our passenger manifest but destruction of evidence implies a reason to destroy it and that reason might logically be found near the point of its loss so well make some inquiries we must continue our trail the hard way by using our poor feet ach that food smells good doesnt it theyre cooking well for the athletes i remember when i used to swim daily years ago why then i could eat whatever i wanted and never gain a gram those days are long behind me im afraid to the right here janssen to the right reinhard ernst dropped his phone into its cradle and closed his eyes he leaned back in the heavy chair in his chancellory office for the first time in several days he felt content no he felt joyous a sense of victory swept through him as keen as when he and his sixtyseven surviving men successfully defended the northwestern redoubt against three hundred allied troops near verdun that had earned him the iron cross firstclass and an admiring look from wilhelm ii only the kaisers withered arm had prevented him from pinning the decoration on ernsts chest himself but this success today which would be greeted with no public accolades of course was far sweeter one of the greatest problems hed faced in rebuilding the german navy was the section in the versailles treaty that forbade germany to have submarines and limited the number of warships to six battleships six light cruisers twelve destroyers and twelve torpedo boats absurd of course even for basic defense but last year ernst had engineered a coup he and brash ambassadoratlarge joachim von ribbentrop had negotiated the anglogerman naval treaty which allowed submarine construction and lifted the limitation on germanys surface navy to percent of the size of englands but the most important part of the pact had never been tested until now it had been ernsts brainstorm to have ribbentrop negotiate the percentage not in terms of number of ships as had been the measure at versailles but in tonnage germany now had the legal right to build even more ships than britain had as long as the total tonnage never exceeded the magic percent moreover it had been the goal all along of ernst and erich raeder commander in chief of the navy to create lighter more mobile and deadlier fighting vessels rather than behemoth battleships that made up the bulk of the british war fleet ships that were vulnerable to attack by aircraft and submarines the only question had been would england claim a foul when they reviewed the shipyard construction reports and realized that the german navy would be far bigger than expected the caller on the other end of the line though a german diplomatic aide in london had just reported that the british government had reviewed the figures and approved them without a second thought what a success this was he drafted a note to the leader to give him the good news and had a runner deliver it in person just as the clock on the wall was striking four a bald middleaged man wearing a brown tweed jacket and ribbed slacks stepped into ernsts office colonel i just ernst shook his head and touched his lips silencing doctorprofessor ludwig keitel the colonel spun around and glanced out the window what a delightful afternoon it is keitel frowned it was one of the hottest days of the year close to thirtyfour degrees and the wind was filled with grit but he remained silent an eyebrow raised ernst pointed toward the door keitel nodded and together they stepped into the hallway outside and then left the chancellory turning north on wilhelm street they continued to under the lindens and turned west chatting only of the weather the olympics a new american movie that was supposed to open soon like the leader both men admired the american actress greta garbo her film anna karenina had just been approved for release in germany despite its russian setting and questionable morality discussing her recent films they entered the tiergarten just past the brandenburg gate finally looking around for tails or surveillance keitel spoke what is this about reinhard there is madness among us doctor ernst sighed no are you making a joke asked the professor sardonically yesterday the leader asked me for a report on the waltham study keitel took a moment to digest this information the leader himself i was hoping he would forget it he has been wholly preoccupied with the olympics but apparently not he showed keitel hitlers note and then related the story of how the leader had learned of the study thanks to the man of many titles and more kilos fat hermann keitel said loudly sighing angrily sssh ernst said speak through flowers a common expression nowadays meaning say only good things when mentioning party officials by name in public keitel shrugged in a softer voice he continued why should he care about us ernst had neither the time nor the energy to discuss the machinations of the national socialist government to a man whose life was essentially academic well my friend keitel said what are we going to do ive decided that we go on the offensive we hit back hard well give him a report by monday a detailed report two days keitel scoffed we have only raw data and even thats very limited cant you tell him that in a few months well have better analysis we could no doctor ernst said laughing if one could not speak through flowers a whisper would do one does not tell the leader to wait a few months or a few days or minutes no its best for us to do this now a lightning strike thats what we must do göring will continue his intriguing and may meddle enough so that the leader digs deeper doesnt like what be sees and stops the study altogether the file he stole was some of freuds writings thats what he mentioned in the meeting yesterday i think the phrase was jew minddoctor you should have seen the leaders face i thought i was on my way to oranienburg freud was brilliant keitel whispered the ideas are important we can use his ideas and those of the other psychologists but freud is a psycho analyst ach academics ernst thought worse than politicians but we wont attribute them in our study thats intellectually dishonest keitel said sullenly moral integrity is important under these circumstances no its not was ernsts firm response were not going to publish the work in some university journal thats not what this is about fine fine keitel said impatiently that still doesnt address my concern not enough data i know ive decided we must find more volunteers a dozen it will be the biggest group yet to impress the leader and make him ignore göring the doctorprofessor scoffed we wont have time by monday morning no no we cant yes we can we have to our work is too important to lose in this skir mish well have another session at the college tomorrow afternoon ill write up our magnificent vision of the new german army for the leader in my best diplomatic prose i know the right turn of phrase he looked around another whisper well cut the air ministers fat legs out from underneath him i suppose we can try keitel said uncertainly no we will do it ernst said there is no such thing as trying either one succeeds or one does not he realized he was sounding like an officer lecturing a subordinate he smiled wistfully and added im no happier about it than you ludwig this weekend i had hoped to relax spend some time with my grandson we were going to carve a boat together but therell be time for recreation later the colonel added after were dead keitel said nothing but ernst felt the doctorprofessors head turn uncertainly toward him i am joking my friend the colonel said i am joking now let me tell you some marvelous news about our new navy chapter thirteen the greened bronze of hitler standing tall above fallen but noble troops in november square was impressive but it was located in a neighborhood very different from the others paul schumann had seen in berlin papers blew in the dusty wind and there was a sour smell of garbage in the air hawkers sold cheap merchandise and fruit and an artist at a rickety cart would draw your portrait for a few pfennigs aging unlicensed prostitutes and young pimps lounged in doorways men missing limbs and rigged with bizarre leather and metal prosthetic braces limped or wheeled up and down the sidewalks begging one had a sign pinned to his chest i gave my legs for my country what can you give me it was as if hed stepped through the curtain behind which hitler had swept all the trash and undesirables of berlin paul walked through a rusty iron gate and sat facing the statue of hitler on one of the benches a half dozen of which were occupied he noticed a bronze plaque and read it learning that the monument was dedicated to the beer hall putsch in the fall of when according to the turgid prose set in metal the noble visionaries of national socialism heroically took on the corrupt weimar state and tried to wrest the country out of the hands of the stabbersintheback the german language paul knew was very keen on combining as many words as possible into one he soon grew bored with the lengthy breathless accolades for hitler and göring and sat back wiped his face the sun was lowering but it was still bright and mercilessly hot hed been sitting for only a minute or two when reggie morgan crossed the street stepped through the gate and joined paul you found the place all right i see again speaking his flawless german he laughed nodding at the statue and lowered his voice glorious hmm the truth is a bunch of drunks tried to take over munich and got swatted like flies at the first gunshot hitler dove to the ground and he only survived because he pulled a body of a comrade on top of him then he looked paul over you look different your hair clothes then he focused on the sticking plaster what happened to you he explained about the fight with the stormtroopers morgan frowned was it about dresden alley were they looking for you no they were beating these people who ran a bookshop i didnt want to get involved but i couldnt let them die ive changed clothes my hair too but ill need to steer clear of brownshirts morgan nodded i dont think theres a huge danger they wont go to the ss or gestapo about the matter they prefer to mete out revenge by themselves but the ones you tangled with will stay close to rosenthaler street they never go far afield youre not hurt otherwise your shooting hand is all right yes its fine good but be careful paul theyd have shot you for that no questions asked no arrest theyd have executed you on the spot paul lowered his voice what did your contact at the information ministry find about ernst morgan frowned something odd is going on he said there are hushed meetings all over wilhelm street usually its half deserted on a saturday but the ss and sd are everywhere hes going to need more time were to call him in an hour or so he looked at his watch but for now our man with the rifle is up the street he closed his shop today because we are coming in but he lives nearby hes waiting for us ill call him now he rose and looked around of the divey bars and restaurants here only one the edelweiss café advertised a public telephone ill be back in a moment as morgan crossed the street pauls eyes followed him and he saw one of the disabled veterans ease close to the patio of the restaurant begging for a handout a burly waiter stepped to the railing and shooed him away a middleaged man whod been sitting several benches away rose and sat next to paul he offered a grimace which revealed dusky teeth and grumbled did you see that a crime how some people treat heroes yes it is what should he do paul wondered it might be more suspicious to stand up and leave he hoped the man would fall silent but the german eyed him closely and continued youre of an age you fought this was not a question and paul assumed it would have taken extraordinary circumstances for a german in his twenties to have avoided combat during the war yes of course his mind was racing at which battle did you get that a nod toward the scar on pauls chin that battle had involved no military action whatsoever the enemy had been a sadistic button man named morris starble who inflicted the scar with a knife in the hells kitchen tavern behind which starble died five minutes later the man looked at him expectantly paul had to say something so he mentioned a battle he was intimately familiar with st mihiel for four days in september of paul and his fellow soldiers in the first infantry division iv corps slogged through driving rain and soupy mud to assault eightfootdeep german trenches protected by wire obstacles and machinegun nests yes yes i was there the beaming man shook pauls hand warmly what a coincidence this is my comrade good choice paul thought bitterly what were the odds that this would happen but he tried to look pleasantly surprised at this happenstance the german continued to his brotherinarms so you were part of detachment c that rain i have never seen so much rain before or since where were you at the west face of the salient i faced the second french colonial corps we had the americans against us paul said searching fast through twodecadeold memories ah colonel george patton what a mad and brilliant man he was he would send troops racing all over the battlefield and his tanks they would suddenly appear as if by magic we never knew where he was going to strike next no infantryman ever troubled me but tanks he shook his head grimacing yes that was quite a battle if thats your only wound you were lucky god was looking out for me thats true paul asked and you were wounded a bit of shrapnel in my calf i carry it to this day i show my nephew the wound it is shaped like an hourglass he touches the shiny scar and laughs with delight ah what a time that was he sipped from a flask many people lost friends at st mihiel i did not mine had all died before then he fell silent and offered the flask to paul who shook his head morgan stepped out of the café and gestured i must go paul said to the man a pleasure meeting a fellow veteran and sharing these words yes good day sir hail hitler ach yes hail hitler paul joined morgan who said he can meet us now you didnt tell him anything about why i need the gun no not the truth at least he thinks youre german and you want it to kill a crime boss in frankfurt who cheated you the two men continued up the street for six or seven blocks the neighborhood growing even shabbier until they came to a pawnbrokers shop musical instruments suitcases razors jewelry dolls hundreds of other items filled the grimy ironbarred windows a closed sign was on the door they waited only a few minutes in the vestibule before a short balding man showed up he nodded to morgan ignored paul looked around then let them inside he glanced back closed and locked the door then pulled the shade they walked farther into the musty dustfilled shop come this way the shopkeeper led them through two thick doors which he closed and bolted then down a long stairway into a damp basement lit only by two small yellow bulbs when his eyes grew accustomed to the dim light paul noted that there were two dozen rifles in racks against the wall he handed paul a rifle with a telescopic sight on it its a mauser karabiner a millimeter this one breaks down easily so you can carry it in a suitcase look at the scope the best optics in the world the man clicked a switch and lights illuminated a tunnel perhaps one hundred feet long at the end of which were sandbags and pinned to one a paper target this is completely soundproofed it is a supply tunnel that was dug through the ground years ago paul took the rifle in his hands felt the smooth wood of the sanded and varnished stock smelled the aroma of oil and creosote and the leather of the sling he rarely used rifles in his job and the combination of sweet scents and solid wood and metal took him back in time he could smell the mud of the trenches the shit kerosene fumes and the stink of death like wet rotting cardboard these are special bullets too which are hollowed out at the tip as you can see they are more likely to cause death than standard cartridges paul dryfired the gun several times to get a feel for the trigger he pressed bullets into the magazine then sat down at a bench resting the rifle on a block of wood covered with cloth he began to fire the report was earsplitting but he hardly noticed paul just stared through the scope concentrating on the black dots of the target he made a few adjustments to the scope and then slowly fired the remaining twenty rounds in the box of ammunition good he said shouting because his hearing was numb a good weapon nodding he handed the rifle back to the pawnbroker who took it apart cleaned it and packed the gun and ammunition into a battered fiberboard suitcase morgan took the case and handed an envelope to the shopkeeper who shut the lights out in the range and led them upstairs a look out the door a nod that all was clear and soon they were outside again strolling down the street paul heard a metallic voice filling the street he laughed you cant escape it across the street at a tram stop was a speaker from which a mans voice droned on and on yet more information about public health dont they ever stop no they dont morgan said when we look back that will be the national socialist contribution to culture ugly buildings bad bronze sculpture and endless speeches he nodded at the suitcase holding the mauser now lets go back to the square and call my contact see if hes found enough information to let you put this fine piece of german machinery to use the dusty dkw turned onto november square and unable to find a place to park on the hectic street narrowly avoided a vendor selling questionable fruit as it drove halfway over the curb ach here we are janssen willi kohl said wiping his face your pistol is convenient yes sir then lets go hunting they climbed out the purpose of the inspectors diversion after they left the us dormitory was to interview the taxi drivers stationed outside the olympic village with typical national socialist foresight only cabdrivers who were multilingual were allowed to serve the village which meant both that there was a limited number of them and that they would return to the village after dropping off fares this in turn kohl reasoned meant that one of them might have driven their suspect somewhere after dividing the taxis up between them and speaking to two dozen drivers janssen found one whod had a story that did indeed interest kohl the fare had left the olympics not long before with a suitcase and an old brown satchel he was a burly man with a faint accent his hair did not seem on the long side or to have a red tint but it was slicked straight back and dark though that kohl reasoned might have been due to oil or lotion he said he had been wearing not a suit but lightcolored casual clothing though the driver couldnt describe it in detail the man had got out at lützow plaza and vanished into the crowds this was one of the busiest most congested intersections in the city there were few hopes of picking up the suspects trail there however the cabdriver added that the man had asked directions to november square and wondered if he could walk to it from lützow plaza did he ask anything more about the square anything specific his business comrades he was hoping to meet anything no inspector nothing i told him that it would be a long long hike to the square and he thanked me and got out that was all i was not looking at his face he explained only at the road blindness of course kohl had thought sourly they had returned to headquarters and picked up printed handbills of the dresden alley victim they then had raced here to the monument in honor of the failed putsch in only the national socialists could turn such an embarrassing defeat into an unqualified victory while lützow plaza was too large to search effectively this was a far smaller square and could be more easily canvassed kohl now looked over the people here beggars vendors hookers shoppers unemployed men and women in small cafés he inhaled the air pungent ripe with the scent of trash and asked do you sense our quarry nearby janssen i the assistant seemed uncomfortable with this comment its a feeling kohl said scanning the street as he stood in the shadow of a courageous defiant bronze hitler i myself dont believe in the occult do you not really sir im not religious if thats what you mean well i havent given up on religion completely heidi would not approve but what im speaking of is the illusion of the spiritual based on our perceptions and experience and i have such a feeling now hes near yes sir the inspector candidate said why do you think so an appropriate query kohl thought he believed young detectives should always question their mentors he explained because this neighborhood was part of berlin north here you could find large numbers of war wounded and poor and unemployed and closet communists and socis and antiparty edelweiss pirate gangs petty thieves and supporters of labor whod gone to ground after the unions were outlawed it was populated by those germans who sorely missed the early days not weimar of course no one liked the republic but the glory of prussia of bismarck of wilhelm of the second empire which meant few members of the party and its sympathizers few denouncers therefore ready to run squealing to the gestapo or the local stormtrooper garrison whatever business hes up to its in places like this that hell find support and comrades stand back somewhat janssen it is always easier to spot a person on the lookout for a suspect such as us than to spot that suspect himself the young man moved into the shadows of a fishmongers store whose stinking bins were mostly empty gamy eels carp and sickly canal trout were all he had for sale the officers studied the streets for a few moments looking for their quarry now let us think janssen he got out of the taxi with his suitcase and the incriminating satchel at lützow plaza he did not have the car drive him directly here from the olympics possibly because he dropped his bags off where he is now staying and came here for some other purpose why to meet someone to deliver something perhaps the satchel or to collect something or someone he has been to the olympic village dresden alley the summer garden rosenthaler street lützow plaza and now here what ties these settings together i wonder shall we survey all the stores and shops i think we must but i will tell you janssen the fooddeprivation concern is now serious i am actually feeling lightheaded we will first query the cafés and at the same time get some sustenance for ourselves inside his shoes kohls toes flexed against the pain the lambs wool had migrated and his feet were stinging once again he nodded to the closest restaurant the one hed parked in front of the edelweiss café and they stepped inside it was a dingy place kohl noted the averted eyes that typically greeted the appearance of an official when they were through looking over the patrons on the offchance that their mannys new york suspect might be here kohl displayed his id to a waiter who snapped instantly to attention hail hitler how may i assist in this smoky dive kohl doubted anyone had even heard of the position of maître d so he asked for the manager mr grolle yes sir i will get him at once please sit at this table sirs and if you wish some coffee and something to eat please let me know i will have a coffee and apple strudel perhaps a doublesize piece and my colleague he lifted an eyebrow at janssen just a cocacola whipped cream with the strudel the manager asked but of course willi kohl said in a surprised voice as if it were a sacrilege to serve it without as they were walking back from the gun dealer toward the edelweiss café where morgan would call his contact at the information ministry paul asked what will he get us about ernsts whereabouts he told me that goebbels insists on knowing where all the senior officials will be appearing in public he then decides if it is important to have a filming crew or a photographer present to record the event he gave a sour laugh you go to see say mutiny on the bounty and you dont even get a mickey mouse cartoon until twenty minutes of tedious reels of hitler coddling babies and göring parading in his ridiculous uniforms before a thousand labor service workers and ernst will be on that list thats what im hoping i hear the colonel doesnt have much patience for propaganda and he detests goebbels as much as göring but he has learned to play the game one does not succeed in the government in this day and age without playing the game as they approached the edelweiss café paul noticed a cheap black car sitting on the curb beside the statue of hitler in front of the restaurant detroit still seemed to have one up on the german auto industry while hed seen some beautiful mercedes and bmw models most of the cars in berlin were like this one boxy and battered when he returned to the united states and had the ten gs hed get the car of his dreams a shiny black lincoln marion would look swell in a car like that paul was suddenly very thirsty he decided hed get a table while morgan made his call the café seemed to specialize in pastry and coffee but on a hot day like this those had no appeal to him nope he decided hed continue his education in the fine art of german beer making chapter fourteen sitting at a rickety table at the eidelweiss café willi kohl finished his strudel and coffee much better he thought his hands had actually been shaking from the hunger it wasnt healthy to go without food for so long neither the manager nor anyone else had seen a man fitting the suspects description but kohl hoped someone in this unfortunate area had seen the victim from the dresden alley shooting janssen do you have the pictures of our poor dead man in the dkw sir well fetch them yes sir the young man finished his cocacola and walked to the car kohl followed him out the door absently tapping the pistol in his pocket he wiped his brow and looked up the street to his right toward the sound of yet another siren he heard the dkw door slam and he turned back glancing toward janssen as he did the inspector noticed a fast movement just beyond his assistant to kohls left it appeared that a man in a dark suit carrying a fiberboard musical instrument case or suitcase had turned and stepped quickly into the courtyard of a large decrepit apartment building next door to the edelweiss café there was something unnatural about the abruptness with which the man had veered off the sidewalk it struck him as somewhat odd as well that a man in a suit would be going into such a shabby place janssen kohl called did you see that what that man going into the courtyard the young officer shrugged not clearly i just saw some men on the sidewalk out of the corner of my eye men two i believe kohls instincts took over we must look into this the apartment building was attached to the structure on the right and looking down the alley the inspector could see that there were no side doors therell be a service entrance in the back like at the summer garden cover it again ill go through the front assume that both men are armed and desperate keep your pistol in your hand now run you can beat them if you hurry the inspector candidate sprinted down the alley kohl too armed himself he slowly approached the courtyard trapped just like at malones apartment paul and reggie morgan stood panting from the brief sprint in a gloomy courtyard filled with trash and a dozen browning juniper bushes two teenage boys in dusty clothes tossed rocks at pigeons not the same police gasped morgan from the summer garden impossible the same paul wasnt sure theyd been spotted but the younger officer in the green suit had glanced their way just as paul had pulled morgan into the courtyard they had to assume theyd been seen how did they find us paul ignored the question looking around him he ran to the wooden entrance door in the center of the u of the building it was closed and locked the firstfloor windows were eight feet off the ground a tough climb most were closed but paul saw one was open and the apartment it let onto appeared deserted morgan noticed pauls glance and said we could hide there yes pull the blinds but how do we climb up please paul called to one of the boys whod been pitching rocks do you live here no sir we just come to play do you want to earn a whole mark greet god sir one said his eyes went wide and he trotted over to the men yes we do good but you must act quickly willi kohl paused outside the courtyard entrance he waited a moment until he was sure janssen would be in position in the back and then turned the corner no sign of the suspect from dresden alley or the man with the suitcase only some teenage boys standing around a pile of wooden milk crates across the courtyard they glanced up uneasily at the officers and began to walk out of the courtyard you boys kohl called they stopped looked at each other uneasily yes did you just see two men another uncomfortable shared glance no come here there was a brief pause then simultaneously they began sprinting vanishing from the courtyard raising puffs of dust beneath their feet kohl didnt even try to pursue them gripping his pistol he looked around the courtyard all of the apartments on the ground floor had curtained windows or anemic plants resting on the sills suggesting they were occupied one though was curtainless and dark kohl approached it slowly and noticed that on the dusty ground below the window were indentations from the milk cartons he understood the suspect and his companion had paid the boys to carry the crates to the window then replace them after the men had climbed into the apartment the inspector gripping his pistol tightly pressed the button for the buildings janitor a moment later a harried man arrived the wiry gray janitor opened the door and glanced with a nervous blink at the pistol in kohls hand kohl stepped inside looking past the man into the dark corridor there was motion at the far end of the hall kohl prayed that janssen would remain vigilant the inspector had at least been tested on the battlefield hed been shot at and had he believed shot one or two enemy soldiers but janssen though he was a talented marksman the boy had fired only at paper targets how would he do if the matter came to a gunfight he whispered to the janitor the apartment on this floor two to the right he pointed it is unoccupied yes sir kohl stepped back so he could keep an eye on the courtyard in case the suspects tried to leap out the window and run he told the janitor theres another officer at your back entrance go fetch him at once yes sir but just as he was leaving a stocky old woman in a purple dress and blue head scarf waddled toward them mr greitel mr greitel quickly you must call the police kohl turned to her the janitor said the police are here mrs haeger ach how can that be she blinked the inspector asked her what do you require the police for theft instinct told kohl that this had something to do with the pursuit tell me maam quickly now my apartment is in the front of the building and from my window i noted two men hiding behind the stack of milk crates which i must point out you have been promising for weeks you will cart away mr greitel please continue this matter could be most urgent these two were skulking it was obvious then just a moment ago i saw them stand and take two bicycles from the rack next to the front entrance i dont know about one of the bicycles but the other was clearly miss bauers and she has had no male companion for two years so i know she would not have been lending him the bicycle no kohl muttered and hurried outside now he realized that the suspect had paid the boys simply to drop a couple of the crates beneath the window to leave the marks in the dust but then to return them to the pile behind which the men had hidden the boys then were probably told to act furtive or uneasy making kohl think this was how the suspects had gotten into the building he burst from the courtyard and looked up and down the street seeing living proof of a statistic that he as a diligent police officer knew well the most popular form of transportation in berlin was the bicycle hundreds of which clogged the streets here hiding their suspects escape as effectively as a cloud of dense smoke theyd ditched the bikes and were walking down a busy street a half mile from november square paul and morgan looked for another café or tap room with a phone how did you know they were in the edelweiss café morgan asked breathing hard from the fast cycling the car the one parked on the curb the black one right i didnt think anything of it at first but something clicked in my mind i remembered a couple of years ago when i was on my way to a job it turned out that i wasnt the only one going to visit bo gillette some cops from brooklyn got there first but they were lazy and parked outside halfway up over the curb figuring it was an unmarked car so whod notice well bo noticed he shows up understands theyre looking for him and vanishes it took me a month to find him again in the back of my mind i was thinking police car so when the younger guy stepped outside i realized right away it was the same man id seen on the patio of the summer garden theyve tracked us from dresden alley to the summer garden to here how on earth paul thought back he hadnt told käthe richter he was coming here and hed checked a dozen times to make sure nobody had been following him from the boardinghouse to the cab stand hed told nobody at the olympics the pawnbroker might have betrayed them here but he wouldnt have known about the summer garden no these two industrious cops had trailed them on their own taxis paul finally said what thats the only link to the summer garden and here from now on if we cant shank it we have the driver drop us two three blocks from where were going they continued away from november square some blocks farther on they found a beer hall with a public phone morgan went inside to make the call to his contact while paul ordered ales and edgy and vigilant kept watch outside he wouldnt have been surprised to see the two cops hurrying up the street still on their trail who the hell were they when morgan returned to the table he was troubled we have a problem he took a sip of the beer and wiped his mustache he leaned forward theyre not releasing any information word came from himmler or heydrich my mans not sure who but no information about public appearances of party or government officials is to be released until further notice no press conferences nothing the announcement went out just a few hours ago paul drank down half the beer what do we do do you know anything about ernsts schedule i dont even know where he lives except somewhere in charlottenburg we could stake him out at the chancellory maybe follow him but thatll be very hard if youre within five hundred feet of a senior party official you can be expected to be stopped for your papers and detained if they dont like what they see paul reflected for a moment he said i have a thought i might be able to get some information about what ernst paul said you morgan asked surprised but ill need a couple of hundred marks i have that yes he counted out bills and slipped them to paul and your man in the information ministry do you think he could find out about people who arent officials morgan shrugged i cant say for certain but i can tell you one thing without doubt that if the national socialists have any skill at all it is gathering information on their citizens janssen and kohl left the courtyard building mrs haeger could offer no descriptions of the suspects though ironically this was due to literal not political blindness cataracts in her eyes had allowed the busybody to observe the men hiding then and making off with the bicycles but rendered her unable to give any more details discouraged they returned to november square and resumed their search making their way up and down the street talking to shop vendors and waiters flashing the etching of the victim and inquiring about their suspect they had no success until they came to a bakery across from the park hidden in the shadow of hitlers statue a round man in a dusty white apron admitted to kohl that hed seen a taxi pull up across the street an hour or so ago a taxi here was an unusual occurrence he said since residents could not afford them and there was no earthly reason for anyone from outside the neighborhood to come here at least not in a cab the man had noticed a big man with slickeddown hair climb out look around and then walk to the statue hed sat down on a bench for a short time then left he was wearing what some light clothing i didnt see very clearly any other features you noticed no sir i had a customer did he have a suitcase or satchel with him i dont believe so sir so kohl reflected his assumption was correct most likely he was staying somewhere near lützow plaza and had come here on an errand of some sort which way did he go i didnt see sir sorry blindness of course but at least this was a confirmation that their suspect had indeed arrived here recently just then a black mercedes turned the corner and braked to a stop ach kohl muttered watching peter krauss get out of the vehicle and look around he knew how the man had tracked him down regulations required that he inform the departments desk officers every time he left the alex during duty hours and where he would be hed debated about not sharing this information today but ignoring rules was hard for willi kohl and before he left hed jotted down november square and the time he expected to return krauss nodded a greeting just making the rounds willi wondering how the case is coming which case kohl asked solely to be petulant the body in dresden alley of course ach it seems our department resources are diminished he added in a wry tone for some unknown reason but we think the suspect might have come here earlier i told you i would check with my contacts im pleased to report that my informant has it on good information that the killer is indeed a foreigner kohl took out his pad and pencil and what is the suspects name he doesnt know what is his nationality he wasnt able to say well who is this informant kohl asked exasperated oh i cant release that i need to interview him peter if hes a witness hes not a witness he has his own sources which are also confidential indeed im merely telling you this because it was encouraging to learn that your suspicions have been confirmed my suspicions that he was not german i never said that who are you krauss asked turning to the baker the inspector here was asking me about a man i saw your suspect krauss asked kohl perhaps ach you are good willi were kilometers from dresden alley and yet youve tracked the suspect to this hellhole he glanced toward the witness is he cooperating the baker spoke in a shaking voice i didnt see anything sir not really just a man getting out of a taxi where was this man i dont where krauss growled across the street really sir i didnt see anything his back was to me he liar i swear to i swear to the leader a man who swears a false oath is still a liar krauss gestured toward one of his own young assistants a roundfaced officer well take him to prince albrecht street a day there and hell give us a complete description no please sir i want to help i promise you willi kohl shrugged but the fact is you have not helped i told you kohl asked for the mans identity card with shaking hands he handed the inspector his id which kohl opened and examined krauss glanced at his assistant again cuff him take him back to headquarters the young gestapo officer pulled the mans hands behind him and clamped on the irons tears filled his eyes i tried to recall i honestly well you will recall i assure you that kohl said to him we are dealing with matters of great importance here i would rather you cooperated now but if my colleague wants to take you to prince albrecht street the inspector lifted an eyebrow to the terrified man things will go badly for you mr heydrich very badly the man blinked and wiped his tears but sir yes yes they will indeed kohls voice faded he looked at the id card again you are where were you born göttburg outside of munich sir ah kohls face remained placid he nodded slowly krauss glanced at him but sir i think and the town is small yes sir i please silence kohl said continuing to stare at the identity card krauss finally asked what is it willi kohl gestured the gestapo inspector aside he whispered i think the kripo is no longer interested in this man you can do with him as you wish krauss was silent for a moment trying to make sense of kohls sudden change of heart why and please as a favor dont mention that janssen and i detained him again i must ask why willi after a moment kohl said sd leader heydrich came from göttburg reinhard heydrich head of the sss intelligence division and himmlers number two was considered the most ruthless man in the third empire heydrich was a heartless machine hed once impregnated a girl then abandoned her because he detested women with loose morals it was said that hitler disliked inflicting pain but tolerated its use if it suited his needs heinrich himmler enjoyed inflicting pain but was inept at using it to further his goals heydrich both enjoyed inflicting pain and was a craftsman at its application krauss glanced at the baker and asked uneasily are they are you saying theyre related you think i prefer not to take the chance at the gestapo you have a far better relation with sd than the kripo does you can question him without much risk of consequence if they see my name connected to him in an investigation my career could be over but still interrogating one of heydrichs relatives krauss looked down at the sidewalk he asked kohl do you think that he knows anything valuable kohl studied the miserable baker i think there is perhaps more he knows but nothing particularly helpful to us i have a feeling what you sense him being evasive about is nothing more than his practice of thinning flour with sawdust or using blackmarket butter the inspector glanced around the neighborhood im sure that if janssen and i keep at it here we can learn whatever information might be found regarding the dresden alley incident and at the same time he lowered his voice keep our jobs pacing krauss was perhaps trying to recall if hed mentioned his own name to this man who might in turn relay it to his cousin heydrich he said abruptly remove the cuffs as the young officer did krauss said well need a report on the dresden alley matter soon willi of course hail hitler hail the two gestapo officers climbed into their mercedes circled the statue of the leader and sped into traffic when the car had gone kohl handed the baker back his id card here you are mr rosenbaum you may go back to work now we will not trouble you again thank you oh thank you the baker said effusively his hands were shaking and tears dripped into the creases around his mouth god bless you sir shhhhh kohl said irritated at the indiscreet gratitude now get back into your store yes sir a loaf of bread for you some strudel no no now your store the man hurried back inside as they walked to their car janssen asked his name was not heydrich it was rosenbaum regarding this matter janssen it is better for you not to inquire it will not help you become a better inspector yes sir the young man nodded in a knowing way now kohl continued we know that our suspect got out of a taxi there and sat in the square before he went on his mission here whatever that might have been lets ask the benchwarmers if they saw anything they had no luck with this crowd many of whom were as kohl had explained to janssen not the least sympathetic to the party or police no luck that is until they came to one man sitting in the shadow of the bronze leader kohl looked him over and smelled soldier either regular army or free corps the informal militia that was formed after the war he nodded energetically when kohl asked about the suspect ach yes yes i know who you mean who are you sir i am helmut gershner former corporal in kaiser wilhelms army and what can you tell us corporal i was speaking to this man not fortyfive minutes ago he fit your description kohl felt his heart pound quickly is he still around here do you know not that ive seen well tell us about him yes inspector we were speaking of the war at first i thought we were comrades but then i sensed something was odd what was that sir he spoke of the battle of st mihiel and yet he was not troubled troubled the man shook his head we lost fifteen thousand captured at that battle and many many dead to me it was the blackletter day for my unit detachment c such a tragedy the americans and the french pushed us back to the hindenburg line he knew much of the fighting it seemed i suspect he was there but the battle was not a horror to him i could see in his eyes he found those terrible days as nothing and the mans eyes flared in indignation he would not share my flask in honor of the dead i dont know why you are looking for him but this reaction alone made me suspicious i suspect that he was a deserter or a coward perhaps he was even a backstabber or perhaps kohl thought wryly he was the enemy the inspector asked did he say anything of his business here or anywhere no sir he did not we spoke for only a few moments was he alone i think not he seemed to join another man somewhat smaller than he but i didnt see clearly im sorry i wasnt paying attention sir youre doing fine soldier janssen said to kohl the inspector candidate offered perhaps that man we saw in the courtyard was his colleague a dark suit smaller kohl nodded possibly one of the companions at the summer garden he asked the veteran what was his age the larger man about forty plus a year or two the same as myself and you got a good look at him oh yes sir i was as close to him as i am to you right now i can describe him perfectly greet god kohl thought the plague of blindness is over he glanced up the street looking for someone hed observed on their search of the area a half hour earlier he took the veteran by the arm and holding up one hand to stop traffic led the limping man across the street sir he said to a vendor in a paintstained smock sitting beside a cheap pushcart displaying pictures the street artist looked up from a floral still life he was painting he set down his brush and rose in alarm when he saw kohls identification card i am sorry inspector i promise you i have tried many times to obtain a permit but kohl snapped can you use a pencil or only paints i pencil can you use one yes sir i often began with a pencil to do the preliminary sketch and then i yes yes fine now i have a job for you kohl deposited the limping corporal in the shabby canvas chair and shoved a pad of paper toward the artist you wish me to do a drawing of this man the vendor asked game but confused no i wish you to do a drawing of the man this man is about to describe chapter fifteen the taxi sped past a large hotel from which fluttered blackwhiteandred nazi flags ach thats the metropol the driver said you know who is there presently the great actress and singer lillian harvey i saw her myself you must enjoy her musicals shes good paul had no idea who the woman was she is making a film just now in babelsberg for ufa studios i would love to have her as a fare but of course she has a limousine paul glanced absently at the posh hotel just the sort of place where a movie starlet would stay then the opel turned north and abruptly the neighborhood changed growing seamier by the block five minutes later paul told the driver please here will do the man dropped him at the curb and alert to the risks of taxis now paul waited until the vehicle had disappeared in traffic before walking two blocks to dragoner street then continuing to the aryan café inside he didnt have to search hard for otto webber the german was sitting at a table in the front bar arguing with a man in a dirty light blue suit and a flattopped straw boater hat webber glanced up and beamed a great smile toward paul then quickly dismissed his companion come here come here mr john dillinger how are you my friend webber rose to embrace him they sat before paul could even unbutton his jacket liesl the attractive young waitress whod served them earlier made a beeline for him ach youre back she announced resting a hand on his shoulder squeezing hard you could not resist me i knew it what will it be now pschorr for me paul said for him a berlin beer her fingers brushed the back of his neck as she stepped away webbers eyes followed liesl it seems that you have yourself a special friend and what does bring you back the allure of liesl or have you been beating up more dungshirts and need my help i thought we might be able to do some business after all ach your words are like mozarts music to me i knew you were a sharp one liesl brought the beers immediately paul noted that at least two customers whod ordered earlier had not been served she wrinkled her face looking around the bar i must work now otherwise i would sit and join you and let you buy me schnapps resentfully she strode off webber slammed his glass into pauls thank you for this he nodded after the man in the babyblue suit who was now at the bar such problems i have you wouldnt believe them hitler announced a new car at the berlin auto show last year better than the audi cheaper than the dkw the folkswagon it is to be called a car for everybody you can pay by installments then pick it up when youve paid in full not a bad idea the company can make use of the money and they still keep the car in case you dont complete the payments is that not brilliant paul nodded ach i was lucky enough to find thousands of tires find webber shrugged and now i learn that the damn engineers have changed the wheel size of the pissant little car my inventory is useless how much did you lose webber regarded the foam in his beer i havent actually lost money but i will not make money that is just as bad automobiles are one thing this countrys done well the little mans rebuilt all the roads but we have a joke you can travel anywhere in the country in great speed and comfort but why would you want to all you find at the other end of the road are more national socialists he roared with laughter liesl was looking at paul expectantly from across the room what did she want another order for beer a roll in the hay a marriage proposal paul turned back to webber i will admit you were right otto i am something more than a sportswriter if you are a sportswriter at all i have a proposal fine fine but let us talk among four eyes you understand the meaning just the two of us theres a better place to speak and i need to deliver something they drained their beers and paul left some marks on the table webber picked up a cloth shopping bag with the words kadewe the worlds finest store printed on the side they escaped without saying goodbye to liesl come this way outside they turned north away from downtown from the shops from the fancy metropol hotel and plunged into the increasingly tawdry neighborhood there were a number of nightclubs and cabarets here but theyd all been boarded up ach look at this my old neighborhood its all gone now listen mr john dillinger i will tell you that i was very famous in berlin just like your mobs that i read about in the crime shockers we had our ringvereine here paul was not familiar with the word whose literal translation was ring association but with webbers explanation decided it meant gang rings webber continued ach we had many of them very powerful mine was called after your wild west we were the cowboys he used the english word i was president of it for a time yes president you look surprised but we held elections to choose our leaders democracy webber grew serious you must remember we were a republic then our german government was it was president hindenburg our gang rings were very well run they were grand we owned buildings and restaurants and had elegant parties even costume balls and we invited politicians and police officials we were criminals yes but we were respectable we were proud and we were skillful too someday i may boast to you of my better cons i dont know much about your mob mr john dillinger your al capone your dutch schultz but ours began as boxing clubs laborers would meet to box after work and they began protection rings we had years of rebellion and civil unrest after the war fighting with the kosis madness and then dreadful inflation it was cheaper to burn banknotes for heat than to spend them on wood one of your dollars would buy billions of marks times were terrible we have an expression in our country the devil plays in the empty pocket and all of our pockets were empty its why the little man came to power and its how i made myself a success the world was barter and the black market i bloomed in such an atmosphere i can imagine paul said then he nodded at a boardedup cabaret and the national socialists have cleaned everything up ach thats one way to put it depends on what you mean by cleaned up the little man isnt right in the head he doesnt drink doesnt smoke doesnt like women or men watch how he holds his hat over his crotch at rallies we say hes protecting the last of germanys unemployed webber laughed hard then the smile faded but its no joke thanks to him the inmates have taken over the prison they continued in silence for a time then webber stopped and pointed proudly to a decrepit building here we are my friend look at the name the faded sign read in english the texas club this used to be our headquarters of my gang ring the cowboys i was telling you it was far far nicer then watch your step mr john dillinger there are sometimes men sleeping off hangovers in the entryway ach did i lament already how times have changed webber had delivered his mysterious shopping bag to the bartender and collected an envelope the room was filled with smoke and stank of garbage and garlic the floor was littered with cigarette and cigar butts smoked down to tiny nubs have only beer here webber warned they cant adulterate the kegs they come sealed from the brewery as for everything else well they mix the schnapps with ethyl and food extract the wine ach do not even ask and as for food he nodded at sets of knives forks and spoons chained to the wall next to each table a young man in filthy clothing was walking around the room rinsing the used ones in a greasy pail far better to leave hungry webber said or you might not leave at all they ordered and found seats the bartender staring darkly at paul the whole time brought beers both men wiped the lips of the glasses before drinking webber happened to glance down and then frowned he lifted his solid leg over his opposite knee and examined his trousers the bottom of his cuff had frayed through threads dangling he examined the damage ach and these trousers were from england bond street well ill get one of my girls to fix it girls you have daughters i may sons too perhaps i dont know but i am referring to one of the women i live with women all together of course not webber said sometimes im at ones apartment sometimes at anothers a week here a week there one of them is a cook possessed by escoffier one sews as michelangelo sculpted one is a woman of considerable experience in bed ach theyre all pearls each in her own way do they know of each other webber shrugged perhaps perhaps not they dont ask i dont say he leaned forward now mr john dillinger what can i do for you i am going to say something to you otto and you may choose to stand up and leave ill understand if you do or you can stay and hear me out if so and if you can help me there will be some very good money in it for you im intrigued keep talking i have an associate in berlin he just had a contact of his do some research on you on me im flattered and he truly seemed to be you were born in berlin in moved to cologne when you were twelve and back here three years later after your school expelled you now webber frowned i left voluntarily the story is often misreported for theft of kitchen goods and a liaison with a chambermaid she was the seductress and you have been arrested seven times and served a total of thirteen months in moabit webber beamed so many arrests such short sentences which attests to the quality of my connections in high places paul concluded and the british are none too happy with you because of that rancid oil you sold their embassy cook last year the french as well because of the horsemeat you passed off as lamb they have a notice posted not to deal with you anymore ach the french he sneered so you are telling me that you wish to make sure you can trust me and that i am the clever criminal i purport to be not a stupid criminal like a national socialist spy you are merely being prudent why would i be insulted at this no what you may be insulted about is that my associate has arranged to make some people in berlin aware of you some people in our government now youre free to choose to have nothing more to do with me a disap pointment but understandable but if you do decide to help us and you betray me these people will find you and the consequences will be unpleasant do you understand what im saying bribery and threat the cornerstones of trust in berlin as reggie morgan had said webber wiped his face lowered his gaze and muttered i save your life and this is how you treat me paul sighed not only did he like this improbable man but he saw no other way to get any wire on ernsts whereabouts but hed had no choice in having morgans contacts look into webbers background and to make arrangements to ensure he didnt betray them these were precautions that were vital in this dangerous city so i suppose we finish our beers in silence and go our separate ways after a moment though webbers face broke into a smile but i will admit i am not as insulted as i ought to be mr schumann paul blinked hed never told webber his name you see i had my doubts about you too at the aryan café our first meeting when you walked past me to refresh your makeup as my girls would say i palmed your passport and had a look ach you didnt smell like a national socialist but as you suggest one can never be too careful in this mad town of ours so i made inquiries about you you have no connection with wilhelm street that my contact was able to uncover how was my skill by the way you felt nothing did you when i took your passport no paul said smiling ruefully so i think we have achieved enough mutual respect he laughed wryly to be able to consider a business proposition please continue mr john dillinger tell me what you have in mind paul counted out a hundred of the marks morgan had given him and passed them to webber whose eyebrow rose what do you wish to buy i need some information ach information yes yes that could cost one hundred marks or it could cost much more information about what or whom he regarded the dark eyes of the man sitting across from him reinhard ernst webbers lower lip jutted out and he cocked his head so at last the pieces fall into place you are here for a very interesting new olympic event biggame hunting and you have made a good choice my friend good paul asked yes yes the colonel is making many changes here and not for the countrys benefit hes getting us ready for mischief the little mans a fool but he gathers smart people around him and ernst is one of the smartest webber lit up one of his foul cigars paul a chesterfield breaking only two matches from the cheap box to get a flame this time webbers eyes were distant i served the kaiser for three years until the surrender oh i did some brave things ill tell you my company once advanced over a hundred meters against the british and it only took us two months to do it earned us some medals that one did those of us who survived there are plaques in some villages that say only to the fallen the towns couldnt afford enough bronze to put all the names of the dead on them he shook his head you yankees had the maxims we had our machinegun same as the maxims we stole the design from you or you stole it from us i dont recall which but the britons ach they had the vickers watercooled now that was a snuff grinder for you that was quite a piece of metalwork no no we dont want another war what ever the little man says none of us do that would be the end of everything and thats what the colonel is up to webber slipped the hundred marks into his pocket and puffed on his vile ersatz cigar what do you need to know his schedule at wilhelm street when he arrives for work when he leaves what kind of car he drives where he parks will he be there tomorrow monday or tuesday what routes he takes any cafés he favors in the area one can find out anything given enough time and egg egg he tapped his pocket money i must be honest mr john dillinger we are not talking about palming off threedayold canal trout from the landwehr as fresh from the havel this is a matter that will require me to retire for a time there will be serious repercussions and i will have to go underground there will be otto just give me a number very dangerous besides what is money to you americans you have your fdr in english he said youre rolling on dough in dough paul corrected a number a thousand us dollars what not marks they say the inflations over but nobody whos lived through that time believes it why in a liter of petrol cost five hundred thousand marks and in paul shook his head thats a lot of money but its really not if i get you your information and i guarantee i will you pay me only half up front paul pointed to webbers pocket where the marks resided thats your down payment but you get paid the rest when and if the information pans out and if i get approval ill have expenses paul slipped him the remaining hundred there hardly enough but ill make do then webber looked over paul closely im curious about what about you mr john dillinger whats your tale there is no tale ach theres always a tale go ahead tell otto your story were in business together now thats closer than being in bed and remember he sees all the truth and the lies you seem an unlikely candidate for this job though perhaps that is why you were chosen to visit our fair city because you seem unlikely how did you get into this noble profession of yours paul said nothing for a moment then my grandfather came to america years ago hed fought in the francoprussian war and wanted no more fighting he started a printing company what was his name wolfgang he said printing ink was in his veins and claimed that his ancestors had lived in mainz and worked with gutenberg a grandfathers stories webber said nodding mine said he was bismarcks cousin his company was on the lower east side of new york in the germanamerican area of the city in there was a tragedy over a thousand people from there were killed in an excursion ship fire in the east river the general slocum ach what a sad thing my grandfather was on the boat he and my grandmother werent killed but he was badly burned saving people and he couldnt work any longer then most of the german community moved to yorkville farther north in manhattan people were too sad to stay in little germany his business was going to fail with grandpapa being so sick and fewer people around to order printing so my father took over he didnt want to be a printer he wanted to play baseball you know baseball ach of course but there was no choice he had a wife and my sister and my brother and me to feed my grandparents now too but he we would say rose to the occasion he did his duty he moved to brooklyn added englishlanguage printing and expanded the company made it very successful my brother couldnt go into the army during the war and they ran the shop together when i was in france after i got back i joined them and we built the place up real nice he laughed now i dont know if you heard about this but our country had this thing called prohibition you know yes yes of course i read the crime shockers remember illegal to drink liquor madness my fathers plant was right on the river in brooklyn it had a dock and a large warehouse for storing paper and the finished jobs one of the gangs wanted to take it over and use it to store whisky theyd smuggle in from the harbor my father said no a couple of thugs came to see him one day they beat up my brother and when my father still resisted they put his arms in our big letterpress oh no my friend paul continued he was mangled badly he died a few days later and my brother and mother sold the plant to them the next day for a hundred dollars so you were out of work and you fell in with a difficult crowd webber nodded no thats not what happened paul said softly i went to the police they werent interested in helping find these particular killers you understand are you asking if i know about corrupt police webber laughed hard so i found my old army colt my pistol i learned who the killers were i followed them for a week straight i learned everything about them and i touched them off you he realized that hed translated the phrase literally it would have no meaning in german we say touching off i put a bullet into the backs of their heads ach yes webber whispered unsmiling now snuffing wed say yes well i also knew whom they worked for the bootlegger whod ordered my father tortured i touched him off too webber fell silent paul realized hed never told the story to anyone you got your company back oh no the place had been raided by the feds the government before that and confiscated as for me i disappeared underground in hells kitchen in manhattan and i got ready to die to die id killed a very important man this mob leader i knew that his associates or someone else would come to find me and kill me id covered my tracks very well the police wouldnt get me but the gangs knew i was the one i didnt want to lead anybody to my family my brotherd started his own printing company by then so instead of going back into business with him i took a job in a gym sparring and cleaning up in exchange for a room and you waited to die but i cant help but notice that youre still extremely alive mr john dillinger how did that transpire some other men gang leaders heard what id done they hadnt been happy with the man id killed the way hed done business like torturing my father and killing policemen they thought criminals should be professionals gentlemen like me webber said thumping his chest they heard how id killed the gangster and his men it had been clean with no evidence left behind and no one innocent was hurt they asked me to do the same to another man another very bad man i didnt want to but i found out what hed done hed killed a witness and the mans family even his two children so i agreed and i touched him off too they paid me a lot of money then i killed someone else i saved up the money they paid me and bought a small gym i was going to quit but do you know what it means to get into a rut indeed i do well this rut has been my life for years paul fell silent so thats my story all truth no lies finally webber asked it bothers you doing this for a living paul was silent for a moment it should bother me more i think i felt worse touching off your boys during the war in new york i only touch off other killers the bad ones the ones who do what those men did to my father he laughed i say that im only correcting gods mistakes i like that mr john dillinger webber nodded gods mistakes oh weve got a few of those around here yes we do he finished his beer now its saturday a difficult time to get information meet me tomorrow morning at the tiergarten there is a small lake at the end of stern alley on the south side what time would be good for you early say eight ach very well webber said frowning that is early but i will be on the moment theres one more thing i need paul said what whisky tobacco i can even find some cocaine theres not much left in town yet i its not for me its for a woman a present webber grinned broadly ach mr john dillinger good for you in berlin only a short time and already your heart has spoken or perhaps the voice is from another part of your body well how would your friend like a nice garter belt with stockings to match from france of course a bustier in red and black or is she more modest a cashmere sweater perhaps some belgian chocolates or some lace perfume is always good and for you of course my friend a very special price chapter sixteen busy times there were dozens of matters that might have been occupying the mind of the huge sweating man who late this saturday afternoon sat in his appropriately spacious office within the recently completed squarefoot air ministry building at wilhelm street bigger even than the chancellory and hitlers apartments combined hermann göring could for instance resume work on the creation of the massive industrial empire that he was currently planning and that would be named after him of course he could be drafting a memorandum to rural gendarmeries throughout the country reminding them that the state law for the protection of animals which he himself had written was to be strictly enforced and anyone caught hunting foxes with hounds would be severely punished or there was the vital matter of his party for the olympics for which göring was constructing his own village within the air ministry itself hed managed to get a look at the plans for goebbelss event and upped his own gala to outdo the mealworm by tens of thousands of marks and of course there was the evervital matter of what he would wear to the party he could even be meeting with his adjutants regarding his present mission within the third empire building the finest air force in the world but what fortythreeyearold hermann göring was now preoccupied with was a pensioner widow twice his age who lived in a small cottage outside hamburg not that the man whose titles included minister without portfolio commissioner for air commander in chief of the air force prussian minister president air minister and hunting master of the empire was himself doing any of the legwork regarding mrs ruby kleinfeldt of course a dozen of his minions and gestapo officers scurried about on wilhelm street and in hamburg digging through records and interviewing people göring himself was staring out the window of his opulent office eating a massive plate of spaghetti this was hitlers favorite dish and göring had watched the leader picking at a bowl of it yesterday seeing the unconsumed portion triggered an itch within göring that had festered into a fierce craving so far hed had three large helpings today what will we find about you he silently asked the elderly woman who knew nothing of the bustling inquiry about her the investigation seemed absurdly digressive considering the many vital projects currently on his calendar yet this one was vitally important because it could lead to the downfall of reinhard ernst soldiering was at the core of hermann göring who often recalled the happy days of the war flying his allwhite fokker d biplane over france and belgium engaging any allied pilot foolish enough to be in the skies nearby a confirmed twentytwo had paid for that mistake with their lives though göring remained convinced hed killed many more he might now be a behemoth who couldnt even fit into the cockpit of his old plane a man whose life was painkillers food money art power but if you asked him who he was at heart görings answer would be i am a soldier and a soldier who knew how best to turn his country into a nation of warriors once again you showed your muscle you didnt negotiate you didnt pad around like a youth making for the bushes behind a barn to secretly puff away on his fathers pipe the behavior of colonel reinhard ernst the man had a womans touch about this business even the faggot roehm the head of the stormtroopers killed by göring and hitler in the putsch two years ago was a bulldog compared with ernst secret armslength deals with krupp nervously shifting resources from one shipyard to another forcing their present army such as it was to train with wooden guns and artillery in small groups so they wouldnt draw attention a dozen other such prissy tactics why the hesitancy because göring believed the mans loyalty to national socialist views was suspect the leader and göring were not naive they knew their support was not universal you can win votes with fists and guns you cannot win hearts and many hearts within their country were not devoted to national socialism among them people at the top of the armed forces ernst could very well be intentionally dragging his prussian heels to keep hitler and göring from having the one institution they needed desperately a strong military it was likely ernst himself even hoped to accede to the throne if the two rulers were deposed thanks to his soft voice his reasonable manner his smooth ways his two fucking iron crosses and dozens of other decorations ernst was currently in wolfs favor because it made him feel close to the leader göring liked to use the nickname women sometimes referred to hitler by though the minister of course uttered the intimacy only in his thoughts why look at how the colonel had attacked göring yesterday on the issue of the me fighter at the olympics the air minister had lain awake half the night enraged over that exchange picturing again and again wolf turning his blue eyes to ernst and agreeing another burst of rage swept through him god in heaven göring swept the spaghetti dish to the floor it shattered one of his orderlies a veteran of the war came running stiff on his game leg sir clean that up ill get a pail i didnt say mop the floor just pick up the pieces theyll mop this evening then the huge man glanced at his blousy shirt and saw tomato stains on it his anger doubled i want a clean shirt he snapped the china is too small for the portions tell the cook to find bigger the leader has that meissen set the green and white i want plates like those yes sir the man was bending down to the shards no my shirt first yes air minister the man scurried off he returned a moment later bearing a dark green shirt on a hanger not that one i told you when you brought it to me last month that it makes me look like mussolini that was the black one sir which ive discarded this is green well i want white get me a white shirt a silk one the man left then came back once more with the correct color a moment later one of görings senior aides stepped inside the minister took the shirt and set it aside he was selfconscious of his weight and would never think of undressing in front of a subordinate he felt another flash of rage this time at ernsts slim physique as the orderly picked up the shards of china the senior aide said air minister i think we have good news what our agents in hamburg have found some letters about mrs kleinfeldt they suggest that she is a jew suggest prove mr minister they prove it pure no a halfbreed but from the mothers side so its indisputable the nuremberg laws on citizenship and race enacted last year removed jews german citizenship and made them subjects as well as criminalized marriage or sex between jews and aryans the law also defined exactly who was a jew in the case of ancestral intermarriage with two jewish and two nonjewish grandparents mrs kleinfeldt was a halfbreed this was not as damning as it could be but the discovery delighted göring because of the man who was mrs kleinfeldts grandson doctorprofessor ludwig keitel reinhard ernsts partner in the waltham study göring still didnt know what this mysterious study was all about but the facts were sufficiently damning ernst was working with a man descended from jews and they were using the writings of the jew minddoctor freud and most searing of all ernst had kept the study secret from the two most important people in the government himself and wolf göring was surprised that ernst had underestimated him the colonel had assumed that the air minister wasnt monitoring telephones in the cafés around wilhelm street didnt the plenipotentiary know that in this paranoiasoaked district those were the very phones that yielded the most gold hed gotten the transcript of the call ernst had made to doctorprofessor keitel this morning urgently requesting a meeting what happened in that meeting wasnt important what was critical was that göring had learned the good professors name and had now found out that he had yid blood in his veins the consequences of all this that largely depended on what göring wished those consequences to be keitel a partjew intellectual would be sent to the camp at oranienburg there was no doubt about that but ernst göring decided it would be better to keep him visible hed be ousted from the top ranks of government but retained in some lackey position yes by next week the man would be lucky to be employed scurrying after defense minister von blomberg carting the bald mans briefcase ebullient now göring took several more painkillers shouted for another plate of spaghetti and rewarded himself for his successful intriguing by turning his attention back to his olympic party wondering should he appear in the costume of a german hunter an arab sheik or robin hood complete with a quiver and a bow on his shoulder sometimes it was next to impossible to make up ones mind reggie morgan was troubled i dont have the authority to approve a thousand dollars jesus lord a thousand they were walking through the tiergarten past a stormtrooper on a soapbox sweating fiercely as he hoarsely lectured a small group of people some clearly wished to be elsewhere some looked back with disdain in their eyes but some were mesmerized paul was reminded of heinsler on the ship i love the führer and id do anything for him and the party the threat worked morgan asked oh yes in fact i think he respected me more for it and he can actually get us useful information if anybody can hes the one i know his sort its astonishing how resourceful some people can be when you wave money toward them then lets see if we can come up with some they left the park and turned south at the brandenburg gate several blocks farther on they passed the ornate palace that would when the repairs after the fire were finished become the us embassy look at it morgan said magnificent isnt it or it will be even though the building wasnt officially the us embassy yet an american flag hung from the front the sight stirred paul made him feel good more at ease he thought of the hitler youth back at the olympic village and the black the hooked cross you would say swastika ach surely you know surely you know morgan turned down an alleyway and then another and with a look behind them unlocked the door they entered the quiet dark building and walked down several corridors until they came to a small door beside the kitchen they stepped inside the dim room was sparse a desk several chairs and a large radio bigger than any paul had ever seen morgan flipped on the unit and as the tubes warmed up it began to hum they listen to all the overseas shortwave morgan said so were going to transmit via relays to amsterdam and then london and then be routed through a phone line to the states itll take the nazis a while to get the frequency the man said pulling on earphones but they could get lucky so you have to assume theyre listening everything you say keep that in mind sure well have to go fast ready paul nodded and took the set of headphones morgan offered him then plugged the thick jack into the socket he pointed to a green light finally came to life on the front of the unit morgan stepped to a window glanced out into the alleyway let the curtain fall back he pulled the microphone close to his mouth and pushed the button on the shaft i need a transatlantic connection to our friend in the south he repeated this then released the transmit button and said to paul bull gordons our friend in the south washington you know our friend in the north is the senator roger that said a young voice it was averys be a minute hold on placing the call howdy paul said a pause hey there avery responded hows life treating you oh just swell good to hear your voice paul couldnt believe that hed said goodbye to him just yesterday it seemed like months hows your other half staying out of trouble thats hard to believe paul wondered if manielli had been mouthing off to any dutch soldiers the same way he wisecracked in america youre on a speaker here came maniellis irritated voice just to let you know paul laughed then staticky silence what time is it in washington paul asked morgan lunchtime its saturday wheres gordon we dont have to worry about that theyll find him through the headset a womans voice said one moment please placing your call a moment later paul heard a phone ring then another womans voice answered yes morgan said your husband please sorry to trouble you hold the line as if she knew not to ask who was calling a moment later gordon asked hello its us sir morgan said go ahead setback in the arrangements weve had to approach somebody local for information gordon was silent for a moment who is he general terms morgan gestured to paul who said he knows somebody who can get us close to our customer morgan nodded at his choice of words and added my supplier has run out of product the commander asked this man he works for the other company no works for himself what other options do we have morgan said the only other choice is to sit and wait hope for the best you trust him after a moment paul said yes hes one of us us me paul explained hes in my line of work weve uhm arranged for a certain level of trust theres money involved morgan said thats why were calling he wants a lot immediately whats a lot a thousand your currency a pause that could be a problem we dont have any choice paul said youve got to make it work we could bring you back from your trip early no you dont want to do that paul said emphatically the sound from the radio could have been a wave of static or could have been bull gordons sigh sit tight ill get back to you as soon as i can so what would we get for my money i dont know the details bull gordon said to cyrus adam clayborn who was in new york on the other end of the phone they couldnt go into it worried about eavesdropping you know but apparently the nazis have cut off access to information schumann needs to find ernst thats my take clayborn grunted gordon found himself surprisingly at ease considering that the man he was speaking to was the fourthor fifthrichest human being in the country he had ranked number two but the stock market crash had pulled him down a couple of notches they were very different men but they shared two vital characteristics they had military in their blood and they were both patriots that made up for a lot of distance in income and station a thousand cash yes sir i like that schumann that was pretty sharp his reelection comment fdrs scared as a rabbit clayborn chuckled thought the senator was going to crap right there looked like it okay ill arrange the funds thank you sir clayborn preempted gordons next question course its late saturday in hunville and he needs the money now right thats right hold on three long minutes later the magnate came back on the line have em go to the clerk at the usual pickup spot in berlin morganll know it the maritime bank of the americas number eightyeight udder den linden street or however the hell you say it i can never get it right unter den linden it means under the linden trees fine fine the guardll have the package thanks sir bull yes sir we dont have enough heroes in this country i want that boy to come home in one piece considering our resources men like clayborn would never say my money the businessman continued considering our resources what can we do to improve the odds gordon considered the question only one thing came to mind pray he said and pressed down the cradle on the phone then paused for a moment and lifted it once more chapter seventeen inspector willi kohl sat at his desk in the gloomy alex attempting to understand the inexplicable a game played nowhere more often than in the halls of police departments everywhere he had always been a curious man by nature intrigued say by how the blend of simple charcoal sulfur and nitrate produced gunpowder how undersea boats worked why birds clustered together on particular parts of telegraph lines what occurred within human hearts to whip otherwise rational citizens into a frenzy when some weasely national socialist spoke at a rally his mind was presently preoccupied with the question of what sort of man could take anothers life and why and of course who as he now whispered aloud thinking of the drawing done by the street artist at november square janssen was now having it too printed up downstairs as theyd done with the photo of the victim it wasnt a bad sketch by any means kohl reflected there were some erasures from the false starts and corrections but the face was distinctive a handsome square jaw thick neck hair a bit wavy a scar on the chin and a sticking plaster on his cheek who are you he whispered willi kohl knew the facts the mans size and age and hair color and probable nationality even his likely city of residence but hed learned in his years as an investigator that to find certain criminals you needed far more than details like this to truly understand them something more was required intuitive insights this was one of kohls greatest talents his mind made connections and leaps that occasionally startled even himself but now none of these was forthcoming something about this case was out of balance he sat back in his chair examining his notes as he sucked on his hot pipe one advantage of being with the ostracized kripo was that hitlers disdain for smoking did not reach here to these unhallowed halls he shot smoke toward the ceiling and sighed the results from his earlier requests had not been forthcoming the laboratory technician had not been able to find any fingerprints on the olympic guidebook that theyd found at the scene of the brawl with the stormtroopers and the fpe yes kohl noted angrily still only one examiner hadnt found matches for the prints from dresden alley and still nothing from the coroner how the hell long does it take to cut a man open to analyze his blood of the dozens of missing persons reports that had flooded into the kripo today none matched the description of the man who was certainly a son and maybe a father maybe a husband maybe a lover some telegrams had arrived from precincts around berlin reporting the names of those whod bought spanish star modelo a pistols or largo ammunition in the past year but the list was woefully incomplete and kohl was discouraged to learn that hed been wrong the murder weapon was not as rare as hed thought perhaps because of the close connection between germany and francos nationalist forces in spain many of these powerful and efficient guns had been sold here the list as of the moment totaled fiftysix people in berlin and environs and a number of gun shops remained to be polled officers had also reported that some shops kept no records or were closed for the weekend besides if the man had come to town only yesterday as it now seemed he most likely hadnt bought the gun himself though the list might yet prove valuable the killer could have stolen the gun taken it from the victim himself or gotten it from a comrade who had been in berlin for some time understanding the inexplicable still hoping for the passenger manifest for the manhattan kohl had sent telegrams to port officials in hamburg and to the united states lines the owner and operator of the vessel requesting a copy of the document but kohl wasnt optimistic he wasnt even sure if the port master had a copy as for the ship line itself they would have to locate the document create a copy and then post or teletype it to kripo headquarters that could take days in any event thered so far been no response to these requests he had even sent a telegram to mannys mens wear in new york asking about recent purchasers of stetson mitylites this plea too was presently unanswered he glanced impatiently at the brass clock on his desk it was getting late and he was starving kohl wished either for a break in the case or to return home for dinner with his family konrad janssen stepped into his doorway i have them sir he held up a printed sheet of the street artists rendering fragrant with the scent of ink good now sadly janssen you have one more task tonight yes sir whatever i can do one further quality of serious janssen was that he had no aversion to working hard you will take the dkw and return to the olympic village show the artists picture to everyone you can find american or otherwise and see if anybody recognizes him leave some copies along with our telephone number if you have no luck there take some copies to the lützow plaza precinct if they happen to find the suspect tell them to detain him as a witness only and to call me at once even at home yes sir thank you janssen wait this is your first murder investigation is it not yes sir ah you never forget the first one youre doing well i appreciate that sir kohl gave him the keys to the dkw a delicate hand on the choke she likes air as much as petrol perhaps more yes sir ill be at home telephone me with any developments after the young man had gone kohl unlaced and removed his shoes he opened his desk drawer extracted a box of lambs wool and wound several pieces around his toes to cushion the sensitive areas he placed a few strategic wads in his shoes themselves and wincing slipped his feet back inside he glanced past the picture of the suspect to the grim photographs of the murders in gatow and charlottenburg hed heard nothing more about the report from the crime scene or interviews of any witnesses he supposed that his fiction about the kosi conspiracy hed pitched to chief of inspectors horcher had had no effect gazing at the pictures a dead boy a woman trying to grasp the leg of a man lying just out of reach a worker clutching his worn shovel heartbreaking he stared for some moments he knew it was dangerous to pursue the case certainly dangerous for his career if not his life and yet he had no choice why he wondered why this compulsion he invariably felt to close a murder case willi kohl supposed it was that ironically in death he found his sanity or more accurately in the process of bringing to justice those who caused death this was his purpose on earth he felt and to ignore any killing of a fat man in an alley or a family of jews was to ignore his nature and was therefore a sin the inspector now put the photographs away taking his hat he stepped into the hallway of the old building and proceeded down the length of prussian tile and stone and wood worn down over the years but nonetheless spotlessly clean and polished to a shine he walked through shafts of low rosy sun which was the main source of illumination at headquarters this time of year the grande dame of berlin had become a spendthrift under the national socialists guns before butter göring proclaimed over and over and over and the buildings engineers did all they could to conserve resources since hed given his car to janssen and would have to take a tram home kohl continued down two flights to a back door of headquarters a shortcut to the stop at the bottom of the stairs signs pointed the way to the kripos holding cells to the left and to the oldcase archives straight ahead it was in this latter direction that he headed recalling spending time there in his days as a detectiveinspector assistant reading the files not only to learn what he could from the great prussian detectives of the past but simply because he enjoyed seeing the history of berlin as told through its law enforcers his daughters fiancé heinrich was a civil servant but his passion was police work kohl decided he would bring the young man here sometime and they could browse through the files together the inspector might even show him some of the cases kohl himself had worked on years ago but as he pushed through the doorway he stopped fast the archives were gone kohl was startled to find himself in a brilliantly lit corridor in which stood six armed men they were not however in the green uniforms of the schupo they wore ss black almost as one they turned toward him good evening sir one said the closest to him a lean man with an astonishingly long face he eyed kohl carefully you are detective inspector kohl and who are you if youre looking for the archives they are now on the second floor no im simply using the rear exit door kohl started forward the ss trooper took a subtle step toward him im sorry to report that it is no longer in use i didnt hear about that no well it has been the case for the past several days you will have to go back upstairs kohl heard a curious sound what was it a mechanical clap clap a burst of sunlight filled the hallway as two ss men opened the far door and wheeled in dollies holding cartons they turned into one of the rooms at the end of the corridor he said to the guard that door is the one im speaking of it appears to be in use not in general use the sounds clap clap clap and beneath it the rumbling of a motor or engine he glanced to his right through a partially open doorway where he glimpsed several large mechanical devices a woman in a white coat was feeding stacks of paper into one of them this must be part of the kripos printing department but then he observed that no they werent sheets of paper but cards with holes punched in them and they were being sorted by the device ah kohl understood an old mystery had been answered some time ago hed heard that the government was leasing large calculating and sorting machines called dehomags after the firm that made them the german subsidiary of the american company international business machines these devices used punched cards to analyze and crossreference information kohl had been delighted when hed learned of the leases the machines could be invaluable in criminal investigations they might narrow down fingerprint categories or ballistics information a hundred times faster than a technician could by hand they could also crossreference modus operandi to link criminal and crime and could keep track of parolees or recidivist offenders the inspectors enthusiasm soon soured though when he learned that the devices were not available for use by the kripo hed wondered whod gotten them and where they were but now to his shock it seemed that at least two or three were less than a hundred meters from his office and guarded by the ss what was their purpose he asked the guard i couldnt tell you sir the man replied in a brittle voice i have not been informed from inside the room the woman in white looked out her hands paused and she spoke to someone kohl couldnt hear what was said nor see the person she was speaking to the door slowly swung shut as if by magic the guard with the vertical face stepped past kohl and opened the door that led back up the stairs again inspector as i said there is no exit here you will find another door up one flight and im familiar with the building kohl said testily and returned to the stairs i brought you something he said standing in pauls living room in the magdeburger alley boardinghouse käthe richter took the small package with a curious look cautious awe as if it had been years since anyone had given her a present she rubbed her thumbs on the brown paper covering what otto webber had located for him oh she uttered a faint exhalation as she looked at the leatherbound book on whose jacket was stamped collected poems of johann wolfgang von goethe my friend said its not illegal but its not legal either that means it will soon be illegal limbo she said nodding it was the same with american jazz here for a time which is now forbidden continuing to smile käthe turned the volume over and over in her hands he said i didnt know his names run in my family she glanced up with a quizzical look on her face my grandfather was wolfgang my father was johann käthe smiled at the coincidence and flipped through the book i was wondering he said if youre not busy perhaps some dinner her face went still as i told you i am able to serve only breakfast not he laughed no no i want to take you out to dinner perhaps see some sights in berlin you want to i would like to take you out i no no i couldnt oh you have a friend a husband hed glanced at her hand and seen no rings but he wasnt sure how one declared commitment in germany please ask him to come too käthe was at a loss for words finally she said no no there is no one but paul said firmly no buts im not in berlin for very long i could use somebody to show me around town he gave her a smile in english ill tell you miss i aint taking no for an answer i dont understand aint she said but i have not been to a restaurant for a long time perhaps such an evening could be enjoyable paul frowned youve got the english wrong oh what should it be she asked the proper word is will be enjoyable not could she gave a faint laugh and agreed to meet him in a half hour she returned to her room while paul showered and changed thirty minutes later a knock on the door when he opened it he blinked she was an entirely different person käthe was wearing a black dress that would have satisfied even fashion goddess marion in manhattan close fitting made from a shimmery material a daring slit up the side and tiny sleeves that barely covered her shoulders the garment smelled faintly of mothballs she seemed slightly ill at ease embarrassed almost to be wearing such a stylish gown as if all shed worn recently were housedresses but her eyes shone and he had the same thought as earlier how a subdued beauty and passion radiated from within her wholly negating the matte skin and the bony knuckles and pale complexion the furrowed brow as for paul his hair was still dark with lotion but was now combed differently and when they went out it would be hidden by a hat very different from his brown stetson a dark broadbrimmed trilby hed purchased that afternoon after leaving morgan he was wearing a navy blue linen doublebreasted suit and a silver tie over his white arrow shirt at the department store where hed bought the hat hed also picked up more makeup to cover the bruise and cut hed discarded the sticking plaster käthe picked up the book of poems which shed left in his room to go change and flipped through the pages this is one of my favorites its called proximity of the beloved one she read it aloud i think of you when upon the sea the sun flings her beams i think of you when the moonlight shines in silvery streams i see you when upon the distant hills the dust awakes at night when on a fragile bridge the traveler quakes i hear you when the billows rise on high with murmur deep to tread the silent grove where wander i when alls asleep she read in a low voice and paul could picture her up in front of a classroom her students spellbound by her obvious love of the words käthe laughed and looked up with bright eyes this is very kind of you she then took the book in both strong hands and ripped the leather binding off this part she threw into the trash bin he stared at her frowning she smiled sadly i will keep the poems but should dispose of the portion that shows most obviously the title and the poets name that way a visitor or guest will not accidentally see who wrote it and wont be tempted to turn me in what a time we live in and i will leave it in your room for now best not to carry some things with you on the streets even a naked book now lets go out she said with girlish excitement she switched to english as she said i want to do the town that is what you say is it not yep do the town where do you want to go but ive got two requirements please first im hungry and i eat a lot and second id like to see your famous wilhelm street her face again went still for a moment ach the seat of our government he supposed that being someone persecuted by the national socialists she would not enjoy that particular sight yet he needed to find the best location for touching off ernst and he knew that a man by himself was always far more suspicious than one with a woman on his arm this had been reggie morgans second mission today not only had he looked into otto webbers past but hed gotten the wire on käthe richter too she had indeed been fired from a teaching job and had been marked down as an intellectual and a pacifist there was no evidence that shed ever informed for the national socialists now watching her gaze at the poetry book he felt pangs of guilt about employing her in this way but he consoled himself with the thought that she was no fan of the nazis and by helping him in this unwitting way shed be doing her part to stop the war hitler was planning she said yes of course i will show you and for your first requirement i have just the restaurant in mind you will like it she added with a mysterious smile its just the place for people like you and me you and me he wondered what she meant they walked out into the warm evening he was amused to note that as they took the first step toward the sidewalk both their heads swiveled from side to side looking to see if anyone was watching as they walked they spoke about the neighborhood the weather the shortages the inflation about her family her parents had passed away and she had one sister who lived in nearby spandau with her husband and four children she asked him about his life too but the cautious button man gave vague answers and continually steered the conversation back to her wilhelm street was too far to walk to she explained paul knew this recalling the map he was still cautious about taxis but as it turned out none was available this was the weekend before the olympics began and people were pouring into town käthe suggested a doubledecker bus they climbed aboard the vehicle and walked up to the top deck where they sat close together on the spotless leather seat paul looked around carefully but could see no one paying particular attention to them though he halfexpected to see the two policemen whod been tracking him all day the heavy cop in the offwhite suit the lean one in green the bus swayed as they drove through the brandenburg gate narrowly missing the stone sides and many of the passengers gave a gasp of humorous alarm like on the roller coaster at coney island he supposed the reaction was a berlin tradition käthe pulled the rope and they disembarked on under the lindens at wilhelm street then walked south along the wide avenue that was the center of the nazi government it was nondescript with monolithic gray office buildings on either side clean and antiseptic the street exuded an unsettling power paul had seen pictures of the white house and congress they seemed picturesque and amiable here the facades and tiny windows of the rows upon rows of stone and concrete buildings were forbidding and more to the point tonight they were heavily guarded hed never seen such security wheres the chancellory he asked there käthe pointed toward an old ornate building with a scaffolding covering much of the front paul was discouraged his quick eyes took in the place armed guards in front dozens of ss and what appeared to be regular soldiers were patrolling the street stopping people and asking for papers on the tops of the buildings were other troops armed with guns there must have been a hundred uniformed men nearby it would be virtually impossible to find a shooting position and even if he were able to there was no doubt that hed be captured or killed trying to get away he slowed i think ive seen enough he eyed several large blackuniformed men demanding papers from two men on the sidewalk not as picturesque as youd expected she laughed and started to say something perhaps i told you so but then thought better of it if you have more time dont worry i can show you many parts of our city that are quite beautiful now shall we go to dinner she asked yes lets she directed him back to a tram stop on under the lindens they got aboard and rode for a brief while then climbed off at her direction käthe asked what hed thought of berlin so far in his short time here paul again gave some innocuous answers and turned the conversation back to her he asked are you going with anyone going hed translated literally i mean romantically involved straightforward she answered most recently i had a lover we no longer are together but he still owns much of my heart what does he do he asked a reporter like you im not really a reporter i write stories and hope to sell them human interest wed say and you write about politics politics no sports sports her voice was dismissive you dont like sports i am sorry to say i dislike sports why because there are so many important questions facing us not just here but everywhere in the world sports are well theyre frivolous paul replied so is strolling down the streets of berlin on a nice summer evening but were doing it ach käthe said testily the sole point of education in germany now is to build strong bodies not minds our boys they play war games they march everywhere did you hear weve started conscription paul recalled that bull gordon had described the new german military draft to him but he said no one out of three boys fails because they have flat feet from all the marching they do at school its a disgrace well you can overdo anything he pointed out i enjoy sports yes you seem athletic do you bodybuild some mostly i box box you mean the sort where you hit other people he laughed thats the only kind of boxing there is barbaric it can be if you let your guard down you joke she said but how can you encourage people to strike each other i couldnt really tell you but i like it its fun fun she scoffed yeah fun he said growing angry too lifes hard sometimes you need to hold on to something fun when the rest of the world is turning to shit around you why dont you go to a boxing match sometime go see max schmeling drink some beer yell till youre hoarse you might enjoy it kakfif she said bluntly what kakfif käthe repeated its a shortening for completely out of the question suit yourself she was silent for a moment then she said im a pacifist as i was telling you today all my friends in berlin are pacifists we dont combine the idea of fun with hurting people i dont walk around like a stormtrooper and beat up the innocent the guys i spar with they want to do it you encourage causing pain no i discourage people from hitting me thats what sparring is like children she muttered youre like children you dont understand and why do you say that because im a woman she snapped maybe yeah maybe thats it im not stupid im not talking about intelligence i only mean that women arent inclined to fight we arent inclined to be the aggressor we will fight to protect our homes sometimes the wolf isnt in your home dont you go out and kill him first no you ignore him and hope he goes away yes exactly and you teach him he doesnt need to be destructive thats ridiculous paul said you cant talk a wolf into being a sheep but i think you can if you wish to she said and if you work hard at it too many men dont want that however they want to fight they want to destroy because it gives them pleasure dense silence between them for a long moment then her voice softening she said ach paul please forgive me here you are being my companion doing the town with me which i havent done for so many months and i repay you by being like a shrew are american women shrews like me some are some arent not that you are one im a difficult person to be with you have to understand paul many women in berlin are this way we have to be after the war there were no men left in the country we had to become men and be as hard as they i apologize dont i enjoy arguing its just another way of sparring ach sparring and me a pacifist she gave a girlish laugh what would your friends say what indeed she said and took his arm as they crossed the street chapter eighteen even though he was a lukewarm politically neutral not a member of the party willi kohl enjoyed certain privileges reserved for devout national socialists one of these was that when a senior kripo official had moved to munich kohl had been offered the chance to take his large fourbedroom apartment in a pristine lindenlined culdesac off berliner street near charlottenburg berlin had had a serious housing shortage since the war and most kripo inspectors even many at his level were relegated to boxy nondescript folkapartments thrown together in boxy nondescript neighborhoods kohl wasnt quite sure why hed been so rewarded most likely because he was always ready to help fellow officers analyze crime scene information make deductions from the evidence or interview a witness or suspect kohl knew that the most invaluable man in any job is the one who can make his colleagues and superiors especially appear invaluable as well these rooms were his sanctuary they were as private as his workplace was public and were populated by those closest to his heart his wife and children and on occasion sleeping always in the parlor of course charlottes fiancé heinrich the apartment was on the second floor and as he walked wincing up the stairs he could make out the smells of onions and meat heidi kept to no schedule in preparing her food some of kohls colleagues would solemnly declare saturdays mondays and wednesdays for instance to be state loyalty meatfree days the kohl household at least seven strong went without meat often owing to scarcity as well as cost but heidi refused to be bound by a ritual this saturday night they might have aubergine with bacon in cream sauce or kidney pudding or sauerbraten or even an italianstyle dish of pasta with tomatoes always a sweet of course willi kohl liked his linzertorte and strudel wheezing from the walk up the stairs he opened the door just as elevenyearold hanna raced to him every inch the little blonde nordic maid despite her parents brown hair she wrapped her arms around the large man papa can i carry your pipe for you he fished out the meerschaum for her she carried it to the rack in the den where dozens of others sat im home he called heidi stepped into the doorway and kissed her husband on both cheeks a few years younger than he shed become round over the course of their marriage developing a smooth extra chin and huge bosom adding pounds with each child but this was as it should be kohl felt you should grow both in soul and in girth with your partner five children had earned her a certificate from the party women with more offspring had higher accolades producing nine children won you a gold star indeed a couple with fewer than four offspring were not allowed to call themselves a family but heidi had angrily stuffed the parchment into the bottom of her bureau she had children because she enjoyed them enjoyed everything about them giving them life raising them directing their course not because the little man wished to swell the population of his third empire his wife vanished then returned a moment later bearing a snifter of schnapps she let him have only one glass of the potent drink before dinner he grumbled about the rationing occasionally but he secretly welcomed it he knew far too many policemen who didnt stop with the second glass or second bottle he said hello to hilde his seventeenyearold lost as always in a book she rose and hugged him and then returned to the divan the willowy girl was the family scholar but shed been having a difficult time lately goebbels himself said that a womans sole purpose was to be beautiful and populate the third empire the universities were largely closed to girls now and those admitted were limited to two courses of study domestic science which earned what was contemptuously called the pudding degree or education hilde however wished to study mathematics and science and ultimately become a university professor but she would be allowed to teach only lower grades kohl believed both of his older daughters were equally smart but learning came more easily to hilde than to vivacious and athletic charlotte four years older he was often amazed at how he and heidi had produced such similar and yet vastly different human beings the inspector walked out onto his small balcony where he would sometimes sit and smoke his pipe late at night it faced west and now he gazed at the fierce redandorange clouds lit by the vanished sun he took a small sip of the harsh schnapps the second was kinder and he sat down comfortably in his chair trying hard not to think about fat dead men about the tragic deaths in gatow and charlottenburg about pietr forgive me peter krauss about the mysterious churning of the dehomags in the basement of the kripo trying not to think about their clever mannys new york suspect who are you a clamor from the front hall the boys were returning feet thudded powerfully on the stairs younger herman was first through the doorway swinging it shut on günter who blocked the door and started for a tackle they then noticed their father and the wrestling match ceased papa herman cried and hugged his father günter lifted his head in greeting the sixteenyearold had stopped hugging his parents exactly eighteen months ago kohl supposed sons had behaved according to that schedule since the days of otto i if not forever you will wash before dinner heidi called but we swam we went to the wilhelm marr street pool then their father added you will wash the swimming water off of you what are we having for supper mutti herman asked the sooner you bathe she announced the sooner youll find out they charged off down the corridor teenagecalamityinmotion a few moments later heinrich arrived with charlotte kohl liked the fellow he would never have let a daughter marry someone he did not respect but the handsome blond mans fascination with police matters prompted him to query kohl enthusiastically and at length about recent cases normally the inspector enjoyed this but the last thing he wanted tonight was to talk about his day kohl brought up the olympics a sure conversation deflector everyone had heard different rumors about the teams favorite athletes the many nations represented soon they were seated at the table in the dining room kohl opened two bottles of saarruwer wine and poured some for everyone including small amounts for the children the conversation as always in the kohl household went in many different directions this was one of the inspectors favorite times of the day being with those you loved and being able to speak freely as they talked and laughed and argued kohl looked from face to face his eyes were quick listening to voices observing gestures and expressions one might think he did this automatically because of his years as a policeman but in fact no he made his observations and drew his conclusions because this was an aspect of parenthood tonight he noted one thing that troubled him but filed it away in his mind the way he might a key clue from a crime scene dinner was over relatively early in about an hour the heat had dampened everyones appetite except kohls and his sons heinrich suggested card games but kohl shook his head not for me i will smoke he announced and soak my feet i think please günter you will bring a kettle of hot water yes father kohl fetched his footsoaking pan and the salts he dropped into his leather chair in the den the very chair his father had sat in after a long day working in the fields charged a pipe and lit it a few minutes later his oldest son walked into the room easily carrying the steaming kettle which must have weighed ten kilos in one hand he filled the basin kohl rolled up his cuffs removed his socks and avoiding looking at the gnarled bunions and yellow calluses eased his feet into the hot water and poured in some salts ach yes the boy turned to go but kohl said günter wait a moment yes father sit down the boy did cautious and set the kettle on the floor in his eyes was a flash of adolescent guilt kohl wondered with amusement what transgressions were fluttering through his sons mind a cigarette a bit of schnapps some fumbling exploration of young lisa wagners undergarments günter what is the matter something was bothering you at dinner i could see it nothing father nothing no in a soft but firm voice willi kohl now said you will tell me the boy examined the floor finally he said school will start soon not for a month still i was hoping father can i be transferred to a different one but why the hindenburg school is one of the best in the city headmaster muntz is very respected please whats wrong with it i dont know i just dislike it your grades are good your teachers say you are a fine student the boy said nothing is it something other than your lessons i dont know what could it be günter shrugged please cant i just go to a different school until december why then the boy wouldnt answer and avoided his fathers eyes tell me kohl said kindly because go on because in december everyone must join the hitler youth and now well you wont let me ah this again a recurring problem but was this new information true would hitler youth be mandatory a frightening thought after the national socialists came to power they folded all of germanys many youth groups into the hitler youth and the others were outlawed kohl believed in childrens organizations hed been in swimming and hiking clubs in his teen years and loved them but the hitler youth was nothing more than a prearmy military training organization manned and operated no less by the youngsters themselves and the more rabidly national socialist the junior leaders the better and now you wish to join i dont know everyone makes fun of me because im not a member at the football game today helmut gruber was there hes our hitler youth leader he said i better join soon but you cant be the only one who isnt a member more join every day günter replied those of us who arent members are all treated badly when we play aryans and jews in the school yard im always a jew what do you play kohl frowned he had never heard of this you know father the game aryans and jews they chase us they arent supposed to hurt us doctorprofessor klindst says they arent its supposed to be tag only but when he isnt looking they push us down youre a strong boy and ive taught you how to defend yourself do you push them back sometimes yes but there are many more who play the aryans well im afraid you cant go to another school kohl said günter looked at the cloud of pipe smoke rising to the ceiling his eyes brightened maybe i could denounce someone maybe then theyd let me play on the aryan side kohl frowned denunciation another national socialist plague he said firmly to his son you will denounce no one they would go to jail they could be tortured or killed günter frowned at his fathers reaction but i would only denounce a jew father his hands trembling heart pounding kohl was at a loss for words forcing himself to be calm he finally asked you would denounce a jew for no reason his son seemed confused of course not i would denounce him because he is a jew i was thinking helen morrells father works at karstadt department store his boss is a jew but he tells everyone hes not he should be denounced kohl took a deep breath and weighing his words like a rationing butcher said son we live in a very difficult time now it is very confusing its confusing to me and it must be far more confusing to you the one thing that you must always remember but never must say out loud is that a man decides for himself what is right and wrong he knows this from what he sees about life about how people live and act together how he feels he knows in his heart what is good and bad but jews are bad they wouldnt teach us that in school if it werent true kohls soul shivered in rage and pain to hear this you will not denounce anyone günter he said sternly that is my wish all right father the boy said walking away günter kohl said the boy paused at the door how many in your school have not joined the youth i cant say father but more join every day soon there wont be anyone left to play the jew but me the restaurant that käthe had in mind was the lutter and wegner wine bar which she explained was well over a hundred years old and an institution in berlin the rooms were dark smoky and intimate and the place was devoid of brownshirts ss and suited men wearing red armbands with the hooked surelyyouknow cross i brought you here because as i said it used to be the haunt of people like you and me you and me yes bohemians pacifists thinkers and like you writers ah writers yes eta hoffmann would find inspiration here he drank copious champagne whole bottles of it and would then write all night youve read him of course paul hadnt he nodded yes can you think of a better writer of the german romantic era i cant the nutcracker and the mouse king so much darker and more real than what tchaikovsky did with it that ballet is pure puff dont you think definitely paul agreed he thought hed seen it one christmas as a boy he wished hed read the book so he could discuss it intelligently how he enjoyed simply talking with her as they sipped their cocktails he reflected on the sparring hed done with käthe on the walk here hed meant what hed said about arguing with her it was exhilarating he didnt think hed had a disagreement with marion in all the months theyd gone out he couldnt even remember her getting angry sometimes a new stocking would run and shed let go with a darn or damnation then shed press her fingers to her mouth like the prelude to blowing someone a kiss and apologize for cussing the waiter brought menus and they ordered pig knuckles and spaetzle and cabbage and bread ach real butter she whispered in astonishment staring at the tiny yellow rectangles to drink she ordered a sweet golden wine they ate leisurely talking and laughing the whole time after theyd finished paul lit a cigarette he noticed she seemed to be debating as if speaking to her students she said we have been too serious today i will tell a joke her voice fell to a whisper do you know hermann göring some official in the government yes yes he is hitlers closest comrade hes an odd man very obese and he parades around in ridiculous costumes in the company of celebrities and beautiful women well he finally got married last year is that the joke not yet no he really did get married this is the joke käthe gave an exaggerated pout did you hear about görings wife the poor things given up religion you must ask me why please tell me why has görings wife given up religion because after their wedding night she lost her belief in the resurrection of the flesh they both laughed hard he saw that she was blushing crimson ach my paul ive told a naughty joke to a man i dont know and one that could land us in jail not us he said straightfaced only you i didnt tell it oh even laughing at a joke like that will get you arrested he paid the bill and they left forgoing the tram and returning to the boardinghouse on foot along the sidewalk that skirted the south boundary of the tiergarten paul was tipsy from the wine which he rarely drank the sensation was nice better than a corn whisky zing the warm breeze felt good so did the pressure of käthes arm through his as they walked they spoke of books and politics arguing some laughing some an unlikely couple maneuvering through the streets of this immaculate city paul heard voices men coming their way about a hundred feet ahead he saw three stormtroopers they were boisterous joking in their brown uniforms with their youthful faces they resembled happy schoolboys unlike the belligerent thugs hed taken on earlier in the day this trio seemed bent only on enjoying the fine night they paid no attention to anyone on the street paul felt käthe slowing he looked down at her her face was a mask and her arm began to tremble whats the matter i dont wish to pass them you dont have anything to worry about she looked to the left panicked the traffic on the street was busy and they were some blocks from a pedestrian crossing to avoid the brownshirts they had only one choice the tiergarten he said really youre safe theres no need to worry i can feel your arm paul i can feel you ready to fight them thats why youre safe no she looked at the gate that led into the park this way they turned into the park the thick foliage cut out much of the sound of the traffic and soon the creekcreek of insects and the baritone call of frogs from the ponds filled the night the stormtroopers continued along the sidewalk ignoring everything but their ebullient conversation and their singing they passed by without even glancing into the park still käthe kept her head down her stiff gait reminded paul of the way hed walked after breaking a rib in a sparring session are you all right he asked silence she looked around shivering are you afraid here he asked do you want to leave still she said nothing they came to an intersection of sidewalks one of which would take them to the left south out of the park and back to the boardinghouse she stopped after a moment she said come this way turning käthe led him farther into the park north along winding paths they finally came to a small boathouse on a pond dozens of forhire boats rested upside down nestled against one another now in the hot night the area was deserted i havent been inside the tiergarten for three years she whispered paul said nothing at last she continued that man who has my heart yes your journalist friend michael klein he was a reporter for the munich post hitler got his start in munich michael covered his rise and wrote much about him about his tactics the intimidation the beatings the murders michael kept a running count of the unsolved murders of people who were opposed to the party he even believed that hitler had his own niece killed in thirtytwo because he was obsessed with her and she loved someone else the party and the stormtroopers threatened him and everybody at the post they called the paper the poison kitchen but before the national socialists came to power they never hurt him then there was the reichstagfire oh look you can just see it there she pointed to the northeast paul caught a glimpse of a tall domed building our parliament just weeks after hitler was named chancellor someone lit a fire inside hitler and göring blamed the communists and they rounded up thousands of them social democrats too they were arrested under the emergency decree michael was among them he went to one of the temporary prisons set up around the city they kept him there for weeks i was frantic no one told me what happened no one told me where he was it was terrible he told me later that they beat him fed him once a day at the most made him sleep naked on a concrete floor finally a judge let him go since he hadnt committed any crime after he was released i met him at his apartment not far from here it was a spring day in may a beautiful day two in the afternoon we were going to hire a boat right here at this lake id brought some stale bread to feed the birds we were standing there and four stormtroopers came up to us and pushed me to the ground theyd followed us they said theyd been watching him since hed been released they told him that the judge had acted illegally in releasing him and they were now going to carry out the sentence she choked for a moment they beat him to death right in front of me right there i could hear his bones break you see that oh käthe no you see that square of concrete that was where he fell that one the fourth square from the grass that was where michaels head lay as he died he put his arm around her she didnt resist but neither did she find any comfort in the contact she was frozen may is now the worst month she whispered then she looked around at the textured canopy of summer trees this park is called the tiergarten i know in english she said tier means animal or beast and garten of course is garden so this is the garden of beasts where the royal families of imperial germany would hunt game but in our slang tier also means thug like a criminal and thats who killed my lover criminals her voice grew cold here right here in the garden of beasts his grip tightened around her she glanced once more at the pond then at the square of concrete the fourth from the grass käthe said please take me home paul in the hallway outside his door they paused paul slipped his hand into his pocket and found the key he looked down at her käthe in turn was staring at the floor good night he whispered ive forgotten so much she said looking up walking through the city seeing lovers in cafés telling ribald jokes sitting where famous writers and thinkers have sat the pleasure in things like those ive forgotten what thats like forgotten so much his hand went to the tiny scallop of cloth covering her shoulder and then he touched her neck felt her skin move against her bones so thin he thought so thin with his other hand he brushed her hair out of her face then he kissed her she stiffened suddenly and he realized hed made a mistake she was vulnerable shed seen the site of her lovers death shed walked through the garden of beasts he started to back away but suddenly she flung her arms around him kissing him hard teeth met his lip and he tasted blood oh she said shocked im sorry but he laughed gently and then she did too i said ive forgotten much she whispered im afraid this is one more thing lost from my memory he pulled her to him and they remained in the dim hallway their lips and hands frantic images flashing past a halo around her golden hair from the lamp behind her the cream lace of her slip over the lighter lace of her brassiere her hand finding the scar left by a bullet fired from albert reillys hidden derringer a only but it tumbled when it hit bone and exited his biceps sideways her keening moan hot breath the feel of silk of cotton his hand sliding down and finding her own fingers waiting to guide him through complicated layers of cloth and straps her garter belt which had been worn threadbare and stitched back together my room he whispered in a few seconds the door was open and they were staggering inside where the air seemed hotter even than in the hot corridor the bed was miles away but the rosecolored couch with gullwing arms was suddenly beneath them he fell backward onto the cushions and heard a crack of wood käthe was on top of him holding him in a vise grip by the arms as if were she to let go he might sink beneath the brown water of the landwehr canal a fierce kiss then her face sought his neck he heard her whisper to him to herself to no one how long has this been she began to unbutton his shirt frantically ach years and years well he thought not such a long time in his case but as he lifted off her dress and slip in one smooth sweep his hands sliding to the sweating small of her back he realized that while yes thered been others recently it had been years since hed felt anything like this then gripping her face in his hands bringing her closer closer losing himself entirely he corrected himself once more maybe it had been forever chapter nineteen the evening rituals in the kohl household had been completed dishes dried linens put away laundry done the inspectors feet were feeling better and he poured out the water from the tub and then dried and replaced it he tied the salts closed and put them back under the sink he returned to the den where his pipe awaited a moment later heidi joined him and sat down in her own chair with her knitting kohl explained to her about his conversation with günter she shook her head so thats what it was he was upset when he got home from the football field yesterday too but he would say nothing to me not to a mother not about such things kohl said we need to talk to them someone has to teach them what we learned right and wrong moral quicksand heidi clicked the thick wooden needles together expertly she was knitting a blanket for charlotte and heinrichs first child which she assumed would arrive approximately nine and a half months after their wedding next may she asked in a harsh whisper and then what happens in the school yard günter mentions to his friends that his father says its wrong to burn books or that we should allow american newspapers in the country ach then youre taken away and never heard from again or they send me your ashes in a box with a swastika on it we tell them to keep what we say to themselves like playing a game it must be secret a smile from his wife theyre children my darling they cant keep secrets true kohl thought how true what brilliant criminals the leader and his crowd are they kidnap the nation by seizing our children hitler said his would be a thousandyear empire this is how he will achieve it he said i will speak to a huge pounding filled the hall the bronze bear knocker on kohls front door god in heaven heidi said standing up dropping the knitting and glancing toward the childrens rooms willi kohl suddenly realized that the sd or gestapo had a listening device in his house and had heard the many questionable exchanges between himself and his wife this was the gestapos technique to gather evidence on the sly then arrest you in your home either early in the morning or during the dinner hour or just after when you would least expect them quickly put the radio on see if theres a broadcast he said as if listening to goebbelss rantings would deter the political police she did the dial glowed yellow but no sound yet came through the speakers it took some moments for the tubes to heat up another pounding kohl thought of his pistol but he kept it at the office he never wanted the weapon near his children yet even if he had it what good would it do against a company of gestapo or ss he walked into the living room and saw charlotte and heinrich standing side by side looking uneasily at each other hilde appeared in the doorway her book drooping in her hand goebbelss passionate baritone began surging out of the radio talking about infections and health and disease as he walked to the door kohl wondered if günter had already made some casual comment about his parents to a friend perhaps the boy had denounced someone his father albeit unknowingly kohl glanced back at heidi who was standing with her arm around her youngest daughter he unbolted the lock and swung open the heavy oak slab konrad janssen stood in the doorway looking fresh as a child at holy communion he looked past the inspector and said to heidi forgive the intrusion mrs kohl its unforgivable at this late hour mother of god kohl thought hands and heart vibrating he wondered if the inspector candidate could hear the pounding in his chest yes yes janssen the hour is not a problem but next time a lighter touch on the door if you please of course the young face usually so calm bristled with enthusiasm sir i showed the picture of the suspect all over the olympics and half the rest of the city it seemed and i found a reporter for a british newspaper hed come over from new york on the ss manhattan hes been writing a story on athletic fields around the world and this briton is our suspect the man in the artists picture no but then this portion of your story doesnt interest us janssen of course sir forgive me its sufficient to say that this reporter recognized our man ah well done janssen tell me what did he have to say not a great deal all he knew was that he is an american this paltry confirmation was worth a burst heart kohl sighed but the inspector candidate it seemed was only pausing to catch his breath he continued and his name is paul schumann words spoken in the dark words spoken as if in a dream they were close finding in each other a comfortable opposite knee to back of knee swell of belly to back chin to shoulder the bed assisted the feather mattress in pauls bedroom formed a v under their joint weight and seated them firmly they could not have moved apart had they wanted to words spoken in the anonymity of new romance the passion past though only momentarily smelling her perfume which was in fact the source of the lilac hed smelled when hed first met her paul kissed the back of käthes head words spoken between lovers speaking of everything of nothing whims jokes facts speculations hopes a torrent of words käthe was telling him of her life as a landlady she fell silent through the open window they could hear beethoven once again growing louder as someone in a nearby apartment turned up the volume a moment later a firm voice echoed through the damp night ach she said shaking her head the leader speaks thats hitler himself it was yet more talk about germs about stagnant water about infections paul laughed whys he so obsessed with health health all day long everybodys been talking about germs and cleanliness you cant get away from it she was laughing germs whats so funny dont you understand what hes saying i no its not germs hes talking about its jews hes changed all his speeches during the olympics he doesnt say jew but thats what he means he doesnt want to offend the foreigners but he cant let us forget the national socialist dogma paul dont you know what is happening here why in the basements of half the hotels and boardinghouses in berlin are signs that were taken down for the olympics and that will be put back up the day the foreigners leave they say no jews or jews not welcome here there is a sharp turn on the road to my sisters home in spandau the sign warns dangerous curve kilometers per hour jews do it is a road sign not painted by vandals but by our government youre serious serious paul yes you saw the flags on the houses of magdeburger alley the street here you commented on ours when you arrived the olympic flag yes yes not the national socialist flag like on most of the other homes on this street do you know why because this building is owned by a jew its illegal for him to fly germanys flag he wants to be proud of his fatherland like everyone else but he cant be and how could he fly the national socialist flag anyway the swastika the broken cross it stands for antisemitism ah so that was the answer surely you know have you heard of aryanization no the government takes a jewish home or business its theft pure and simple göring is the master of it paul recalled the empty houses hed passed that morning on the way to meet morgan at dresden alley the signs saying that the contents were to be sold käthe moved closer yet to him after a long silence she said there is a man he performs at a restaurant fancy it would be called that is to say the name of the establishment is fancy but it is fancy too very nice i went to this restaurant once and this man was in a glass cage in the middle of the dining room do you know what he was a hunger artist what a hunger artist like in the kafka story he had climbed into his cage some weeks before and had survived on nothing except water he was there for everyone to see he never ate how does he is allowed to go to the lavatory but someone always accompanies him and verifies that he has had nothing to eat day after day words spoken in the dark words between lovers what those words mean is often not important but sometimes it is paul whispered go on i met him after he had been in the glass cage for fortyeight days no food was he a skeleton he was very thin yes he looked sick but he came out of the cage for some weeks i met him through a friend i asked him why he chose to do this for a living he told me he had worked in the government for some years something in transportation but when hitler came to power he left his job he was fired because he wasnt a national socialist no he quit because he couldnt accept their values and wouldnt work for their government but he had a child and he needed to make money a child and needed money but everywhere he looked he could find no position that wasnt tainted with the party he found that the only thing he could do with any integ what is that word integrity yes yes integrity was to be a hunger artist it was pure it could not be corrupted and do you know how many people come to see him thousands thousands come to see him because he is honest and there is so little honesty in our lives now a faint shudder told him she was shivering with tears words between lovers käthe what have they done she gasped for breath what have they done i dont understand what has happened we are a people who love music and talk and who rejoice in sewing the perfect stitch in our mens shirts and scrubbing our alley cobblestones clean and basking in the sun on the beach at wannsee and buying our children clothing and sweets were moved to tears by the moonlight sonata by the words of goethe and schiller yet we are possessed now why her voice faded why a moment later she whispered ach that is a question for which im afraid the answer will come too late leave the country paul whispered she rolled about to face him he felt her strong arms strengthened from scrubbing tubs and sweeping floors snake around him he felt her heel rise and find the small of his back pulling him closer closer leave he repeated the shivering stopped her breathing grew more regular i cannot leave why not its my country she whispered simply i cant abandon it but its not your country any longer its theirs what did you say tier beasts thugs its been taken over by beasts leave get away before it gets worse you think it will get worse tell me paul please youre a writer the way of the world isnt my way it isnt teaching or goethe or poetry youre a clever man what do you think i think it will get worse you have to get out of here as soon as you can she relaxed her desperate grip on him even if i wanted to i cannot after i was fired my name went on a list they took my passport ill never get exit papers theyre afraid well work against them from england or paris so they keep us close come back with me i can get you out words between lovers come to america had she not heard or had she decided no already we have wonderful schools you could teach your english is as good as anyones she inhaled deeply what are you asking leave with me a harsh laugh a woman cries a man says anything to stop the tears ach i dont even know you paul said and i dont know you im not proposing im not saying we live together im just saying you have to get the hell out of here i can arrange that in the silence that followed paul was thinking that no he wasnt proposing nothing of the sort but truth be told paul schumann couldnt help but wonder if his offer wasnt about more than helping her escape from this difficult place oh hed had his share of women good girls and bad girls and good girls playing at being bad some of them hed thought hed loved and some hed known he had but he knew hed never felt for them what he felt for this woman after such a short period of time yes he loved marion in a way hed spend an occasional night with her in manhattan or she with him in brooklyn theyd lie together theyd share words about movies about where hemline lengths would go next year about luigis restaurant about her mother about his sister about the dodgers but they werent lovers words paul schumann realized not like hed spoken tonight with this complicated passionate woman finally she said dismissively irritated ach i cant go how can i go i told you about my passport and exit papers this is what im saying you dont have to worry about that i have connections you do people in america owe me favors this much was true he thought of avery and manielli in amsterdam ready at a moments notice to send the plane to collect him then he asked her do you have ties here how about your sister ach my sister shes married to a party loyalist she doesnt even see me im an embarrassment after a moment käthe said no i have only ghosts here and ghosts are no reason to remain theyre reasons to leave outside laughter and drunken shouts a slurring male voice sang when the olympic games are done the jews will feel our knife and gun then the crash of breaking glass another song several voices singing this time hold high the banner close the ranks the sa marches on with firm steps give way give way to the brown battalions as the stormtroopers clear the land he recognized the song that the hitler youth had sung yesterday as they lowered the flag at the olympic village the red the white and the black hooked cross ach surely you know oh paul you can really get me out of the country without papers yes but ill be leaving soon tomorrow night i hope or the night after how leave the details to me are you willing to leave immediately after a moment of silence i can do that yes she took his hand stroked his palm and interlaced her fingers with his this was by far the most intimate moment between them tonight he gripped her tightly stretched his arm out and struck something hard under the pillow he touched it and from the size and feel realized that it was the volume of goethes poems that hed given her earlier you wont shhhh he whispered and stroked her hair paul schumann knew that there are times for lovers words to end iv six to five against sunday july to monday july chapter twenty he had been in his office at the alex for an hour since a m painstakingly writing out the englishlanguage telegram that he had composed in his mind as he lay sleepless in bed beside peaceful heidi fragrant with the powder she dusted on before retiring willi kohl now looked over his handiwork i am being senior detective inspector willi kohl of the kriminalpolizei criminal police in berlin stop we seek information regard ameri can possibly from new york presently in berlin paul schumann in connection of homicide stop arrived with american olympic team stop please to remit me information about this man at krim inalpolizei headquarters alexanderplatz berlin to direction of inspector willi kohl stop most urgent stop thanking you regards hed struggled hard with the wording the department had translators but none worked on sunday and he wanted to send the telegram immediately it would be earlier in america he wasnt sure about the time zones and he guessed the hour to be about midnight overseas but he hoped that the law enforcers there would keep the same long shifts as police in most countries kohl read the telegram once again and decided that though flawed it was good enough on a separate sheet of paper he wrote instructions to send it to the international olympic committee the new york city police department and the federal bureau of investigation he walked down to the telegraph office he was disappointed to find that no one was as yet on duty angrily he returned to his desk after a few hours sleep janssen was presently en route back to the olympic village to see if he could pick up any more leads there what else could kohl himself do nothing occurred to him except hounding the medical examiner for the autopsy and fpe for the fingerprint analysis but they of course were not in their offices yet either and might not come in at all on sunday he felt the frustration acutely his eyes dropped down to the hardworkedon telegram ach this is absurd he would wait no longer how difficult could it be to man a teletype machine kohl rose and hurried back to the department figuring he would do the best he could to transmit the telegram to the united states himself and if because of his clumsy fingers it ended up being sent by mistake to a hundred different places in america well so much the better she had returned to her own room not long before around am and was now back in his wearing a dark blue housedress pins holding her hair flat to her head a little blush on her cheeks paul stood in the doorway wiping the remnants of the shaving froth from his face he put the cover on his safety razor and dropped it into his stained canvas bag käthe had brought coffee and toast along with some pale margarine cheese dried sausage and soupy marmalade she walked through the low dusty light streaming into the front window of his living room and set the tray on the table near the kitchen there she announced nodding at the tray no need for you to come to the breakfast room she looked at him once quickly then away i have chores so you still game he asked in english what is game he kissed her it means what i asked you last night are you still willing to come with me she ordered the china on the tray which had seemed to him already perfectly ordered im game are you he shrugged i wouldnt have let you change your mind it would be kakfif out of the question she laughed then a frown one thing i wish to say yeah i give opinions quite often she looked down and quite strongly michael called me a cyclone i want to say regarding the subject of sports i could learn to like them too paul shook his head id rather you didnt no then ill feel i had to like poetry she pressed her head to his chest he believed she was smiling you will like america he said but if you dont when all this blows over you can come back you arent necessarily leaving the country forever ah my wise writerman you think this will the expression will blow over yes i do i think they wont be in power much longer he looked at the clock the time was nearly seventhirty now i have to meet my associate on sunday morning ach i finally understand your secret he looked at her with a cautious smile youre writing about priests who play sports she laughed thats your big story then her smile faded and why must you leave so quickly if you are writing about sports or the cubic meters of concrete used for the stadium i dont have to leave quickly i have some important meetings back in the united states paul drank his coffee quickly and ate one piece of toast and sausage you finish whats left im not hungry now well hurry back to me i will pack but only one bag i think if i take too many perhaps a ghost will try to hide in one a laugh ach i am sounding like someone out of a story by our macabre friend eta hoffmann he kissed her and left the boardinghouse stepped out into the morning already hot already painting a damp coat on the skin with a glance up and down the empty street he made his way north over the canal and into the tiergarten the garden of beasts paul found reggie morgan sitting on a bench in front of the very pond where käthe richters lover had been beaten to death three years ago even at this early hour dozens of people were here a number of walkers and bicyclists morgans jacket was off and his shirt sleeves partly rolled up paul sat down beside him morgan flicked an envelope inside his jacket pocket got the greenbacks okay he whispered in english they reverted to german they cashed a check on saturday night paul asked laughing im living in a whole new world you think webber will show up morgan asked skeptically oh yes if theres money involved hell be here but im not sure how helpful hell be i looked over wilhelm street last night there are dozens of guards hundreds maybe itd be far too risky to do the job there well have to see what otto says maybe hes found another location they sat in silence for a moment paul watched him look around the park morgan seemed wistful he said i will miss this country very much for a moment the mans face lost its keenness and the dark eyes were sad there are good people here i find them kinder than the parisians more open than the londoners and they spend far more time enjoying life than new yorkers if we had time id take you to the lustgarten and luna park and i love to walk here in the tiergarten i enjoy watching birds the thin man seemed embarrassed at this a foolish diversion paul laughed to himself thinking of the model airplanes sitting on his bookshelf in brooklyn foolishness is in the eye of the beholder so youll leave paul asked i cant stay ive been here far too long every day theres another chance of a mistake some carelessness that will tip them off to me and after what were about to do theyll look very closely at every foreigner whos had business here recently but after life returns to normal and the national socialists are gone i can return what will you do when you come back morgan brightened i would like to be a diplomat thats why i am in this business after what i saw in the trenches he nodded at a bullet scar on his arm after that i decided i was going to do whatever i could to stop war the diplomatic corps made sense i wrote the senator about it he suggested berlin a country in flux he called it so here i am i hope to be a liaison officer in a few years then ambassador or a consul like our ambassador dodd here hes a genius a true statesman i wont be posted here of course not at first too important a country i could start out in holland or maybe spain well after their civil war is over of course if theres any spain left francos as bad as hitler itll be brutal but yes i would like to come back here when sanity returns a moment later paul spotted otto webber coming down the path walking slowly a bit unsteadily and squinting against the powerful sunlight there he is now him he looks like a bürgermeister and one who spent the evening in his cups were relying on him webber approached the bench and sat down breathing hard hot hot day i didnt know it could be this hot in the morning im rarely up at this hour but neither are the dungshirts so we can meet without much concern you are mr john dillingers associate dillinger morgan asked i am otto webber he shook morgans hand vigorously you are ill keep my name to myself if you dont mind ach me yes thats fine webber examined morgan closely say i have some nice trousers several pair i can sell them to you cheap yes yes very cheap the best quality from england i can have one of my girls alter them to fit you perfectly ingrid is available and very talented quite pretty too a real pearl morgan glanced down at his gray flannel slacks no i dont need any clothes champagne stockings otto paul said i think the only transaction were interested in involves what we were talking about yesterday ach yes mr john dillinger except i have some news you may not like all of my contacts report that a veil of silence has descended on wilhelm street something has made them cautious security has become higher than ever and all this in the last day there is no information anyone has about this person you were mentioning pauls face twisted in disappointment morgan muttered i spent half of last night coming up with the money good webber said brightly dollars correct my friend the slim american added caustically you dont get paid if we dont get results but the situation is not hopeless i can still be of some assistance go on morgan said impatiently he looked down again at his slacks brushing at a smudge the german continued i cant tell you where the chicken is but what would you say if i can get you into the henhouse and you could find out for yourself the he lowered his voice i can get you into the chancellory ernst is the envy of all the ministers everyone tries to snuggle close to the little man and get offices in the building but the best that most of them can do is to find space nearby that ernst abides there is a source of anguish to many paul scoffed i looked it over last night therere guards everywhere you couldnt get me in there ah but i am of a different opinion my friend how the hell can you do it paul had lapsed into english he repeated the question in german we have the little man to thank he is obsessed with architecture he has been renovating the chancellory since he came to power laborers are there seven days a week i will provide a workmans outfit a forged identification card and the two passes that will get you into the building one of my contacts is doing the plastering there and he has access to all the documentation morgan considered this and nodded now less cynical about the idea my friend tells me that hitler wishes rugs in all the offices on the important floors that will include ernsts the carpet suppliers are measuring the offices some have been measured some have not we will hope ernsts has not in the event it has been you can make some excuse about having to measure again the pass i will give you is from a company that is known for among other things its fine carpeting i will also provide a meter stick and a notebook how do you know you can trust this man paul asked because hes been using cheap plaster and pocketing the difference between its cost and what the state is paying him thats a death offense when youre building hitlers seat of power so i have some leverage with him he wouldnt lie to me besides he thinks only that were running some scam to undercut the price of carpets of course i did promise him a bit of egg egg morgan asked it was for paul to interpret money whose bread i eat is whose song i sing take it out of the thousand dollars i wish to point out that i dont have the thousand dollars morgan shook his head reached into his pocket and counted out a hundred thats fine see im not greedy morgan rolled his eyes at paul not greedy why hes like göring ach i take that as a compliment sir our air minister is a very resourceful businessman webber turned to paul now there will be some officials in the building even on sunday but my man tells me they will be senior people and will be mostly in the leaders portion of the building to the left which you will not be allowed near to the right are the lowerlevelofficials offices thats where ernsts is they and their secretaries and aides will most likely not be there you should have some time to browse through his office and with luck find his calendar or a memo or notation about his appointments in the next few days this is not bad morgan said webber said it will take me an hour or so to put everything in place i will pick up the coveralls and your papers and a truck ill meet you by that statue there the woman with the large bosom at ten a m and ill bring some pants for you he added to morgan twenty marks such a good price he smiled then said to paul your friend here eyes me with a very particular look mr john dillinger i dont believe he trusts me reggie morgan shrugged i will tell you otto wilhelm friedrich georg webber a glance at paul my colleague here told you about the precautions weve taken to make certain you dont betray us no my friend trust is not the issue im looking at you this way because i wish to know what the hell you think is wrong with these trousers of mine he saw marks face in the young boys before him this was to be expected of course seeing the father in the son but it was still unsettling come here rudy reinhard ernst said to his grandson yes opa the hour was early on sunday and the housekeeper was removing breakfast dishes from the table on which sunlight fell as yellow as pollen gertrud was in the kitchen examining a plucked goose which would be dinner later that day their daughterinlaw was at church lighting candles to the memory of mark albrecht ernst the very same young man the colonel saw now echoed in his grandson he tied the laces of rudys shoes he glanced once more at the boys face and saw mark again though noted a different look on his face this time curious discerning it was uncanny really oh how he missed his son it was eighteen months since mark had said goodbye to his parents wife and rudy all of them standing behind the rail at lehrter station ernst had given the twentysevenyearold officer a salute a real salute not the fascist one as his son had boarded the train to hamburg to take command of his ship the young officer was fully aware of the dangers of the ramshackle vessel yet hed wholly embraced them because that is what soldiers and sailors do ernst thought about mark daily but never before had the spirit of his son come so close to him as now seeing these familiar expressions in his own grandsons face so direct so confident so curious were they evidence that the boy had his fathers nature rudy would be subject to the draft in a decade where would germany be then at war peace back in possession of the lands stolen away by the treaty of versailles would hitler be gone an engine so powerful that it quickly seizes and burns or would the leader still be in command burnishing his vision of the new germany ernsts heart told him he should be vitally concerned about these questions yet he knew he couldnt worry about them all he could focus on was his duty one had to do ones duty even if that meant commanding an old training ship not meant to carry powder and shells whose jerryrigged magazine was too close to the galley or engine room or a sparking wire no one would ever know the consequences being that one moment the ship was practicing war maneuvers in the cold baltic and the next she was a cloud of acrid smoke over the water her shattered hull dropping through the blackness of water to the sea floor duty even if that meant spending half ones days battling in the trenches of wilhelm street all the way to the leader if necessary to do what was best for germany ernst gave a final tug on rudys shoelace to make sure it wouldnt come undone and trip the boy then he stood and looked down at this tiny version of his son acting on impulse very unusual for ernst he asked rudy i have to see someone this morning but later would you like to come with me to the olympic stadium would you like that oh yes opa the boys face blossomed into a huge smile i could run around the tracks you run quickly gunni at my childschool and i ran a race from the oak tree to the porch and hes two years older than i but i won good good then you will enjoy the afternoon youll come with me and you can run on the same track that our olympians will race on then when we see the games next week you can tell everyone that you ran on the same track wont that be fun oh yes opa i have to go now but ill return at noontime and pick you up ill practice running yes you do that ernst walked to his den collected several files on the waltham study then found his wife in the pantry he told her that he would pick up rudy later that day and for now yes yes it was sunday morning but still he had to attend to some important matters and no they couldnt wait whatever else they said about him hermann göring was tireless today for instance hed arrived at his desk in the air ministry at am a sunday no less and hed had a stop to make on the way sweating furiously he had marched into the chancellory a half hour before that making his way to hitlers office it was possible that wolf was awake still awake that is an insomniac the man often stayed up past dawn but no the leader was in bed the guard reported that hed retired about five with instructions not to be disturbed göring had thought for a moment then jotted a note and left it with the guard my leader i have learned of a matter of concern at the highest level betrayal might be involved significant future plans are at stake i will relate this information in person as soon as it suits göring good choice of words betrayal was always a trigger the jews the communists the social democrats the republicans the backstabbers in short had sold out the country to the allies at the end of the war and still threatened to play pilate to hitlers jesus oh wolf got hot when he heard that word future plans was good as well anything that threatened setbacks to hitlers vision of the third empire would get the mans immediate attention though the chancellory was merely around the corner it had been unpleasant to make the trip a large man on a hot morning but göringd had no choice he couldnt telephone or send a runner reinhard ernst wasnt a competent enough intriguer to have his own intelligence network to spy on colleagues but any number of others would be delighted to steal görings revelation about ludwig keitels jewish background and hand it to the leader as if it were their own discovery goebbels for instance görings chief rival for wolfs attention would do so in a heartbeat now close to am the minister was turning his attention to a discouragingly large file about aryanizing a large chemical company in the west and folding it into the hermann göring works his phone buzzed from the anteroom his aide answered minister görings office the minister leaned forward and looked out he could see the man standing to attention as he spoke the aide hung up and walked to the doorway the leader will see you in a half hour sir göring nodded and walked to the table across his office he sat and served himself food from the heapedhigh tray the aide poured coffee the air minister flipped through the financial information on the chemical company but he had trouble concentrating the image that kept emerging from the charts of numbers was of reinhard ernst being led from the chancellory by two gestapo officers a look of bewilderment and defeat on the colonels otherwise irritatingly placid face a frivolous fantasy to be sure but it provided some pleasant diversion while he scarfed down a huge plate of sausage and eggs chapter twentyone in a spacious but dusty and unkempt krausen street apartment which had been in existence from the days of bismarck and wilhelm a half kilometer southeast of the government buildings two young men sat at an ornate dining room table for hours theyd been engaged in a debate the discussion had been lengthy and fervent because the subject was nothing less than their survival as with so many matters nowadays the ultimate question theyd been wrestling with was that of trust would the man deliver them to salvation or would they be betrayed and pay for that gullibility with their lives tink tink tink kurt fischer the older of the two blondhaired brothers said stop making that noise hans had been tapping the knife on the plate that had held an apple core and some rinds from cheese the remnants of their pathetic breakfast he continued the tink for a moment more and then set the utensil down five years separated the brothers but there were other gulfs far wider between them hans said he could denounce us for money he could denounce us because hes drunk on national socialism he could denounce us because its sunday and he simply takes a fancy to denounce someone this was certainly true and as i keep saying whats the hurry why today i would like to see ilsa again you remember her dont you oh she is as beautiful as marlene dietrich you are making a joke arent you kurt replied exasperated were concerned for our lives and youre pining away for a bigtitted girl youve known for less than a month we can leave tomorrow or why not after the olympics people will leave the games early toss away their day tickets we can get in for the afternoon events this was the crux of the matter most likely the olympics for a handsome youth like hans there would be many ilsas in his life she was not particularly pretty or bright though she did seem particularly loose by national socialist standards but what troubled hans the most about their escape from germany was missing the games kurt sighed in frustration his brother was nineteen an age at which many men held responsible positions in the army or a trade but his brother had always been impulsive and a dreamer and a bit lazy as well what to do kurt thought taking up the debate with himself he chewed on a piece of dry bread theyd had no butter for a week in fact they had little of any food left but kurt hated to go outside ironically he felt more vulnerable there when in fact it was probably far more dangerous to be in the apartment which was undoubtedly watched from time to time by the gestapo or the sd reflecting again it all came down to trust should they or should they not what was that hans asked lifting an eyebrow kurt shook his head he hadnt realized hed spoken out loud the question had been addressed to the only two people in the world who would have answered honestly and with sound judgment their parents but albrecht and lotte fischer were not present social democrats pacifists the couple had attended a worldwide peace conference in london two months ago but just before they returned theyd learned from a friend that their names were on a gestapo list the secret police were planning to arrest them at tempelhof when they arrived albrecht made two attempts to slip into the country and get his sons out once through france and once through the czech sudetenland he was refused entry both times nearly arrested the second ensconced in london taken in by likeminded professors and working parttime as translators and teachers the distraught parents had managed to get several messages to the boys urging them to leave but their passports had been lifted and their identity cards stamped not only were they the children of pacifists and ardent socis but the gestapo had files on the boys themselves it seemed they held their parents political beliefs and the police had noted their attendance at the forbidden swing and jazz clubs where american negro music was played and girls smoked and the punch was spiked with russian vodka they had friends who were activists hardly subversive but it was merely a matter of time until they were arrested or they starved kurt had been dismissed from his job hans had completed his mandatory sixmonth labor service stint and was back home now hed been drummed out of university the gestapo had seen to that as well and like his brother he too was unemployed their future might very well see them becoming beggars on alexander plaza or oranienburger square and so the question of trust had arisen albrecht fischer managed to contact a former colleague gerhard unger from the university of berlin a pacifist and soci himself unger had quit his job teaching not long after the national socialists had come to power and returned to his family confectionary company he often traveled over borders and being firmly antihitler was more than happy to help smuggle the boys out of germany in one of his companys trucks every sunday morning unger made a run to holland to deliver his candy and pick up ingredients it was felt that with all the visitors coming into the country for the olympics the border guards would be preoccupied and pay no attention to a commercial truck leaving the country on a regular run but could they trust him with their lives there was no apparent reason not to unger and albrecht had been friends they were likeminded he hated the national socialists yet nowadays there were so many excuses for betrayal he could denounce us because its sunday and there was another reason behind kurt fischers hesitation to leave the young man was a pacifist and social democrat mostly because of his parents and his friends hed never been very active politically life to him had been hiking and girls and traveling and skiing but now that the national socialists were in power he was surprised to find within him a strong desire to fight them to enlighten people about their intolerance and evil perhaps he debated he should stay and work to bring them down but they were so powerful so insidious and so deadly kurt looked at the clock on the mantelpiece it had run down he and hans were always forgetting to wind it this had been their fathers job and the image of the still timepiece made kurts heart ache he pulled his pocket watch out and checked the time we have to go now or call him and tell him were not doing it tink tink tink the knife resumed its cymbal tapping on the plate then long silence i say we stay hans said but he looked at his brother expectantly thered always been rivalry between the two yet the younger would abide by any decision the older made but will i decide correctly survival kurt fischer finally said were going get your pack tink tink kurt shouldered his knapsack and glared defiantly at his brother but hanss mood changed like spring weather he suddenly laughed and gestured at their clothing they were dressed in shorts shortsleeved shirts and hiking boots look at us paint us brown and wed be hitler youth kurt couldnt help but smile lets go comrade he said sarcastically the term the same one used by stormtroopers and youth to refer to their fellows refusing a last look around the apartment for fear hed start to cry kurt fischer opened the door and they stepped into the corridor across the hallway was stocky applecheeked mrs lutz a war widow scrubbing her doormat the woman usually kept to herself but would sometimes stop by certain residents apartments only those who met her strict standards of neighborliness whatever those might be to deliver her miraculous foodstuffs she considered the fischers her friends and over the years had left presents of lung pudding prune dumplings head cheese pickled cucumbers garlic sausage and noodles with tripe just seeing her now kurt began to salivate ach the fischer brothers good morning mrs lutz youre hard at work early it will be hot again ive heard ach for some rain oh we dont want anything to interfere with the olympics hans said with a hint of irony were so looking forward to seeing them she laughed silly people running and jumping in their undergarments who needs them when my poor plants are dying of thirst look at my johngotobedatnoons outside the door and the begonias now tell me where are your parents still on that trip of theirs in london yes their parents political difficulties were not common knowledge and the brothers were naturally reluctant to mention them to anyone its been several months they better get home soon or they wont recognize you where are you off to now hiking in the grünewald oh its lovely there and much cooler than in the city she returned to her diligent scrubbing as they walked down the stairs kurt glanced at his brother and noticed that hans had quickly grown sullen again whats the matter you seem to think this city is the devils playground but its not there are millions of people like her he nodded back up the stairs good people kind people and were leaving all of them behind and to go to what a place where we know no one where we can hardly speak the language where we have no jobs a place we were at war with only twenty years ago how well do you think well be received kurt had no rebuttal for this his brother was one hundred percent correct and there were probably a dozen more arguments to be made against their leaving outside they looked up and down the hot street none of the few people out at this hour paid any attention to them lets go kurt said and strode down the sidewalk reflecting that in a way hed been honest with mrs lutz they were going on a wander only not to any rustic hostel in the fragrant woods west of berlin but toward an uncertain new life in a wholly alien land he jumped when his phone buzzed hoping it was the medical examiner on the dresden alley case he grabbed the receiver kohl here come see me willi click a moment later his heart beating solidly he was walking up the hall to friedrich horchers office what now the chief of inspectors was at headquarters on a sunday morning had peter krauss learned that kohl had made up the story about reinhard heydrich and göttburg the man came from halle to save the witness the baker rosenbaum had someone overheard him make an improvident comment to janssen had word come down from on high that the inspector inquiring about dead jews in gatow was to be reprimanded kohl stepped into horchers office sir come in willi he rose and closed the door gestured kohl to sit the inspector did so he held the mans eye as hed told his sons to do whenever they looked at another human being with whom difficulty might arise there was silence as horcher resumed his seat and rocked back and forth in the sumptuous leather chair playing absently with the brilliant red armband on his left biceps he was one of the few senior kripo officials who actually wore one in the alex the dresden alley case keeping you busy is it an interesting one this i miss the days of investigating willi yes sir horcher meticulously ordered papers on his desk you will go to the games i got my tickets a year ago did you your children are looking forward to it indeed my wife too ach good good horcher had not heard a single word of kohls more silence for a moment he stroked his waxed mustache as he was accustomed to do when not playing with his crimson armband then sometimes willi its necessary to do difficult things especially in our line of work dont you think horcher avoided his eyes when he said this through his concern kohl thought this is why the man will not advance very far in the party hes actually troubled to deliver bad news yes sir people within our esteemed organization have been aware of you for some time like janssen horcher was incapable of being sardonic esteemed would be meant sincerely though which organization he might be referring to was a mystery given the incomprehensible hierarchy of the police to his shock he learned the answer to this question when horcher continued the sd has quite some file on you wholly independent of the gestapos this chilled kohl to his core everyone in government could count on a gestapo file it would be insulting not to have one but the sd the elite intelligence service for the ss and its leader was none other than reinhard heydrich himself so the story hed spun to krauss about heydrichs hometown had returned and all to save a jew baker he didnt even know breathing hard palms staining his trousers with sweat willi kohl numbly nodded as the end of his career and perhaps his life began to unfold before him apparently there have been discussions about you at high levels yes sir he hoped his voice didnt quaver he locked his eyes onto horchers which tore themselves away after an electric few seconds and examined a bakelite bust of hitler on a table near the door there is a matter that has come up and unfortunately i can do nothing about it of course there would be no help from friedrich horcher who was not only merely kripo the lowest rung of the sipo but was a coward as well yes sir what might this matter be it is desired it actually is ordered that you represent us at the icpc in london this february kohl nodded slowly waiting for more but no this seemed to be the entire volley of bad news the international criminal police commission founded in vienna in the twenties was a cooperative network of police forces throughout the world they shared information about crime criminals and law enforcement techniques via publications telegram and radio germany was a member and kohl had been delighted to learn that though america was not representatives from the fbi would be attending the conference with an eye toward joining horcher scanned his desktop upon whose surface hitler göring and himmler also gazed down from their wooden frames on the wall kohl took several breaths to steady himself he said it would be an honor honor horcher scowled leaning forward he said softly generous of you kohl understood his superiors scorn attendance at the conference would be a waste of time because the hue and cry of national socialism was a selfreliant germany an alliance of international law enforcement organizations sharing information was the last thing hitler wanted there was a reason that gestapo was an acronym for secret state police kohl was being sent as a figurehead merely to keep up appearances no one higher would dare go for a national socialist official to leave the country for two weeks meant he might not find his job awaiting him when he returned but kohl since he was merely a worker bee with no intent to rise in the party ranks could disappear for a fortnight and return with no loss aside of course from the little matter that a dozen cases would be delayed and rapists and killers might go free which was not their concern of course horcher was relieved at the detectives reaction he asked with animation when was your last holiday willi heidi and i go to wannsee and the black forest frequently i mean abroad ah well some years now france and one trip to brighton in england you should take your wife with you to london the suggestion alone was enough to expiate horchers guilt after a judicious moment he said to kohl im told the ferry and train fares are quite reasonable at that time of year another pause though we will of course provide for your travel and accommodations most generous again im sorry you must bear this cross willi but youll eat and drink well british beer is much better than what one hears and you can see the tower of london yes i would enjoy that what a treat the tower of london the chief of inspectors repeated enthusiastically well good day to you willi good day sir through the halls eerie and gloomy despite shafts of bright sunlight falling on the oak and marble kohl returned to his office calming slowly from the scare he sat heavily in his chair and glanced at the box of evidence and his notes regarding the dresden alley incident then his eyes slid to a folder sitting next to it he lifted the telephone receiver and placed a call to the operator in gatow and asked to be connected to a private residence yes a young mans voice answered cautiously unaccustomed perhaps to calls on sunday morning this is gendarme raul kohl asked a pause yes i am inspector willi kohl ah yes inspector hail hitler you are telephoning me at home on a sunday kohl chuckled indeed i am forgive the interruption im calling regarding the crime scene report from the shootings in gatow and the other the polish workers forgive me sir i am inexperienced the report im sure was shoddy compared to what you are used to certainly nothing of the quality you yourself could produce i did the best i could you mean the report is completed another hesitation longer than the first yes sir and it was submitted to gendarmerie commander meyerhoff i see when was that wednesday last i believe yes that is correct has he reviewed it i noticed a copy on his desk friday evening sir i had also asked that one be sent to you im surprised you havent received it yet well i will follow this matter up with your superior tell me raul were you satisfied with your handling of the crime scene i believe i did a thorough job sir did you reach any conclusions kohl asked i speculation is perfectly acceptable at this stage of an investigation the young man said robbery did not seem to be the motive you are asking me no sir im stating my conclusion well speculation good their belongings were on them their money was missing but jewelry and other effects were not taken some of them appeared quite valuable though go on the items were on the victims when they were brought into our morgue im sorry to say the effects have since disappeared that does not interest or surprise me did you find any suggestion that they had enemies any of them no sir at least not regarding the families in gatow quiet hardworking apparently decent folk jews yes but they did not practice their religion they were of course not involved in the party but they were not dissidents as for the polish workers they had come here from warsaw only three days before their deaths to plant trees for the olympics they were not communists or agitators that anyone knew any other thoughts there were at least two or three killers involved i noted the footprints as you instructed me both incidents the same the type of weapon used no idea sir the casings for the shells were gone when i arrived gone an epidemic of conscientious murderers it seemed well the lead slugs may tell us did you recover any in good shape i searched the ground carefully but i couldnt find any the coroner must have recovered some i asked him sir and he said none were found none im sorry sir my irritation is not directed at you gendarme raul you are a credit to your profession and forgive me for disturbing you at home you have children i think i hear an infant in the background did i awaken him her sir but when she is old enough i will tell her of the honor of being awakened from her dreams by such a famed investigator as yourself good day hail hitler kohl dropped the phone in the cradle he was confused the facts in the murders suggested an ss gestapo or stormtrooper killing but had that been the case kohl and the gendarme would have been ordered at once to stop the investigation the way kripo detectives had been told instantly to cease looking into a recent blackmarket food case when the investigation found leads to admiral raeder of the navy and walter von brauchitsch a senior army officer they werent being prevented from pursuing the case but they were encountering footdragging what to make of the ambiguity it was almost as if the killings whatever the motive had been dangled before kohl as a test of his loyalty had commander meyerhoff called the kripo at the behest of the sd to see if the inspector would refuse to handle cases involving jew and pole killings could this be the case but no no that was too paranoid he was thinking of this only because hed learned of the sd file on him kohl could come up with no answers to these questions and so he rose and wandered through the silent halls once more to the teletype room to learn if another miracle had occurred and his counterparts in america had seen fit to respond to his urgent inquiries the battered van hot as an oven inside pulled up on wilhelm square and parked in an alley how do i address people paul asked sir webber said always sir there wont be any women ach good question mr john dillinger yes there may be a few but they will not be in official positions of course theyll be your peers secretaries cleaners file clerks typists they will be single no married women may work so you will say miss and you may flirt a little if you like that would be appropriate from a workman but they will also understand if you ignore them wishing only to get your job done as efficiently as possible and get back home to your sunday meal do i knock on doors or just enter always knock morgan offered webber nodded and i say hail hitler webber scoffed as often as you like one has never gone to prison for saying that and that salute you do the arm in the air not necessary morgan said not from a workman he reminded and remember your g s soften them speak as a berliner lull suspicions before they arise in the back of the sweltering van paul stripped off his clothes and pulled on the coveralls webber had provided good fit the german said i can sell them to you if you wish to keep them otto paul said sighing he examined the battered identity card which contained a picture of a man resembling himself whos this there is a warehouse not much used where the weimar stored files of soldiers who fought in the war there are millions of them of course i use them from time to time for forging passes and other documents i locate a picture that resembles the person buying the documents the photographs are older and worn but so are our identity cards because we must keep them with us at all times he looked at the picture then up at paul this is a man who was killed at argonnemeuse his file notes that he won several medals before he died they were considering an iron cross you look good for a dead man webber then handed him the two work permits that would allow him access to the chancellory paul had left his own passport and the fake rus sian one at the boardinghouse had bought a pack of german cigarettes and carried the cheap unmarked matches from the aryan café webber had assured him hed be searched carefully at the front of the building here webber handed him a notebook and pencil and a battered meter stick he also gave him a short steel rule which he could use as a jimmy on the lock in ernsts office door if need be paul looked these items over he asked webber theyre really going to fall for this ach mr john dillinger if you want certainty arent you in the wrong line of work he took out one of his cabbage cigars youre not going to smoke that here morgan asked where would you have me smoke it on the door stoop of the leaders abode striking the match on an ss guards ass he lit the stogie nodded at paul we will be waiting here for you hermann göring strode through the chancellory building as if he owned it which he believed he one day would the minister loved adolf hitler the way peter loved christ but jesus eventually got nailed to a t of wood and peter took over the operation that is what would happen in germany göring knew hitler was an unearthly creation unique in the history of the world mesmerizing brilliant beyond words and because of that he would not survive to see old age the world cannot accept visionaries and messiahs wolf would be dead within five years and göring would weep and beat his breast pierced by pitched genuine sorrow he would officiate during the lengthy mourning and then he would lead the country to its position as the greatest nation in the world hitler said that this would be a thousandyear empire but hermann göring would steer his regime on the course to forever but for now smaller goals tactical measures to make certain that it was he who stepped into the role of leader after hed finished his eggs and sausage the minister had changed clothes again he normally went through four or five outfits a day he was now in a flamboyant green military uniform encrusted with braids ribbons and decorations some earned many bought he had dressed for the part because he felt like he was on a mission and his goal to tack reinhard ernsts head to the wall göring was after all hunting master of the empire the file exposing keitels jewish heritage tucked under his arm like a riding crop he strode down the dim corridors turning a corner he winced in pain from his wound the bullet hed taken in the groin during the november beer hall putsch hed swallowed his pills only an hour before he was never without them but already the numbness was wearing off ach the pharmacist must have gotten the strength wrong he would berate the man about this later he nodded to the ss guards and stepped into the leaders outer office smiling to the secretary he asked that you go in at once mr minister göring strode across the carpet and then entered the leaders office hitler was leaning against the edge of his desk as he often did wolf was never comfortable sitting still he would pace he would perch hed rock back and forth gazing out windows he now sipped his chocolate set the cup and saucer on the desktop and nodded gravely to someone sitting in a highbacked armchair then he looked up ah mr air minister come in come in hitler held up the note göring had penned earlier i must hear more about this its interesting that you mention a conspiracy our comrade here it seems has brought similar news of such a matter too halfway through the large office göring blinked and stopped abruptly seeing the other visitor to the leaders office rise from the armchair it was reinhard ernst he nodded and offered a smile good morning mr minister göring ignored him and asked hitler a conspiracy indeed hitler said we have been discussing the colonels project the waltham study it seems some enemies have falsified information about his associate doctorprofessor ludwig keitel can you imagine theyve gone so far as to suggest that the professor has jewish blood in him please sit hermann and tell me about this conspiracy youve uncovered reinhard ernst believed that for as long as he lived he would never forget the look on hermann görings puffy face at that moment in the ruddy grinning moon of flesh the eyes registered utter shock a bully cut down ernst took no particular pleasure in the coup however because once the shock bled out the visage turned to one of pure hatred the leader didnt seem to notice the silent exchange between the men he tapped several documents on the desk i asked colonel ernst for information about his study on our military he is currently conducting which he will deliver tomorrow a sharp look at ernst who nodded and assured him indeed my leader and in preparing it he learned that someone has altered records of the relatives of doctorprofessor keitel and others working with the government men at krupp farben siemens and ernst muttered i was shocked to find that the matter goes beyond that they have even altered records of the relatives and ancestors of many prominent officials in the party itself planting information in and around hamburg mostly i saw fit to destroy much of what i came across ernst looked göring up and down some lies referred to people quite high up suggestions of liaisons with jewish tinkers bastard children and the like göring frowned terrible his teeth were close together furious not only at the defeat but at ernsts hint that jewish ancestry might have figured in the air ministers past as well who would do such a thing he began fidgeting with the folder he held who hitler muttered communists jews social democrats i myself have been troubled lately by the catholics we must never forget they oppose us its easy to be lulled considering our common hatred for the jews but who knows we have many enemies indeed we do göring again cast a look at ernst who asked if he could pour the minister some coffee or chocolate no thank you reinhard was the chilly reply as a soldier ernst had learned early that of all the weapons in the arsenal of the military the single most effective was accurate intelligence he insisted on knowing exactly what his enemy was up to hed made a mistake in thinking that the phone kiosk some blocks away from the chancellory was not monitored by görings spies through that carelessness the air minister had learned the name of the coauthor of the waltham study but fortunately ernst while appearing to be naive in the art of intrigue nonetheless had good people placed where they were quite useful the man who regularly provided information to ernst about goingson at the air ministry had last night reported just after hed cleaned up a broken spaghetti plate and fetched the minister a clean shirt that göring had unearthed information about keitels grandmother disgusted to have to be playing such a game yet aware of the deadly risk the situation posed ernst had immediately gone to see keitel the doctorprofessor had supposed that the womans jewish connection was true but hed had nothing to do with that side of the family for years ernst and keitel had themselves spent hours last night creating forgeries of documents suggesting that businessmen and government officials who were pureblooded aryan had jewish roots the only difficult part of ernsts strategy was to make certain that he got to hitler before göring did but one of the techniques of warfare that ernst was committed to in strategic military planning was what he called the lightning strike by this he meant moving so quickly that your enemy had no time to prepare a defense even if he was more powerful than you the colonel blustered his way into the leaders office early this morning and laid out his conspiracy proffering the forgeries we will get to the bottom of it hitler now said and stepped away from the desk to pour himself more hot cocoa and take several zwiebacks from a plate now hermann what about your note what have you uncovered with a smiling nod toward ernst the huge man refused to acknowledge defeat instead he shook his head with a massive frown and said ive heard of unrest at oranienburg particular disrespect for the guards there im worried about the possibility of rebellions i would recommend reprisals harsh reprisals this was absurd being extensively rebuilt with slave labor and renamed sachsenhausen the concentration camp was perfectly secure there was no chance for rebellion whatsoever the prisoners were like penned declawed animals görings comments were told for one purpose only out of vindictiveness to lay a series of deaths of innocent people at ernsts feet as hitler considered this ernst said casually i know little about the camp my leader and the air minister has a good point we must make absolutely certain there is no dissent but i sense some hesitation colonel hitler said ernst shrugged only that i wonder if such reprisals would be better inflicted after the olympics the camp is not far from the olympic village after all particularly with the foreign reporters in town it could be quite awkward if stories leaked out i would think it best to keep the camp as secret as possible until later this idea didnt please hitler ernst could see at once but before göring could protest the leader said i agree its probably best well deal with the matter in a month or two when he and göring would have forgotten about the matter ernst hoped now hermann the colonel has more good news the british have completely accepted our warship and undersea boat quotas under last years treaty reinhards plan has worked how fortunate göring muttered air minister is that file for my attention the leaders eyes which missed little glanced at the documents under the mans arm no sir its nothing the leader poured himself yet more chocolate and walked to the scale model of the olympic stadium come gentlemen and look at the new additions theyre quite nice dont you think elegant i would say i love the modern styling mussolini thinks he invented it but he is a thief of course as we all know indeed my leader göring said ernst too murmured his approval hitlers dancing eyes reminded him of rudys when the boy had shown his opa an elaborate sand castle hed built at the beach last year im told the heat might be breaking today let us hope that will be the case for our picturetaking session colonel you will wear your uniform i think not my leader i am after all merely a civil servant now i wouldnt want to appear ostentatious in the company of my distinguished colleagues ernst kept his eyes on the mockup of the stadium and with some effort avoided a glance at görings elaborate uniform the office of the plenipotentiary for domestic stability the sign painted in stark gothic german characters was on the third floor of the chancellory the renovations on this level seemed largely completed though the smell of paint and plaster and varnish was heavy in the air paul had entered the building without difficulty though hed been carefully searched by two blackuniformed guards armed with bayonetmounted rifles webbers paperwork passed muster though he was stopped and searched again on the third floor he waited until a patrol had walked down the hallway and knocked respectfully on the rippledglass window in the door to ernsts office no answer he tried the knob and found it unlocked he walked through the dark anteroom and toward the door that led to ernsts private office he stopped suddenly alarmed that the man might be here since the light under the door was so bright but he knocked again and heard nothing he opened the door and found that the brilliance was sunlight the office faced east and the morning light streamed viciously into the room debating about the door he decided to leave it open closing it was probably against regulations and would be suspicious if guards made rounds his first impression was how cluttered the office was papers booklets account sheets bound reports maps letters they covered ernsts desk and a large table in the corner many books sat on the shelves most dealing with military history apparently arranged chronologically starting with caesars gallic wars after what käthe had told him about german censorship he was surprised to find books by and about americans and englishmen pershing teddy roosevelt lord cornwallis ulysses s grant abraham lincoln lord nelson there was a fireplace empty this morning of course and scrubbed clean on the blackandwhite marble mantel were plaques of war decorations a bayonet battle flags pictures of a younger uniformed ernst with a stout man sporting a fierce mustache and wearing a spiked helmet paul opened his notebook in which hed sketched a dozen room plans then paced off the perimeter of the office drew it and added dimensions he didnt bother with the measuring stick he needed credibility not accuracy walking to the desk paul looked over it he saw several framed pictures these showed the colonel with his family others were of a handsome brunette woman probably his wife and a threesome a young man in uniform with apparently his own young wife and infant then there were two of the same young woman and the child taken several years apart and more recently paul looked away from the pictures and quickly read over dozens of papers on the desk he was about to reach for one of the piles of documents and dig through it but he paused aware of a sound or perhaps an absence of sound just a softening of the loose noises floating about him instantly paul dropped to his knees and set the measuring stick on the floor then began walking it from one side of the room to the other he looked up as a man slowly entered glancing at him with curiosity the photographs on the mantel and the ones that morgans contact max had shown him had been several years old but there was no doubt that the man standing in front of him was reinhard ernst chapter twentytwo hail hitler paul said forgive me if i am disturbing you sir hail the man replied lethargically you are i am fleischman i am measuring for carpets ah carpets another figure glanced into the room a large blackuniformed guard he asked to see pauls papers read them carefully and then returned to the anteoffice pulling up a chair just outside the door ernst asked paul and how big a room do i have here eight by nine and a half meters pauls heart was pounding hed nearly said yards i would have thought it bigger oh it is bigger sir i was referring to the size of the rug generally with fine floors like this our customers want a border of wood visible ernst glanced at the floor as if hed never seen the oak he took his jacket off and hung it on a suit form beside his desk he sat back in his chair closed his eyes and rubbed them then he sat forward pulled on some wirerimmed glasses and read some documents you are working on sunday sir paul asked as you ernst replied with a laugh not looking up the leader is eager to finish the renovations to the building yes that is certainly true as he bent to measure a small alcove paul glanced sideways at ernst noting the scarred hand the creases around the mouth the red eyes the demeanor of someone with a thousand thoughts percolating in his mind someone carrying a thousand burdens a faint squeal as ernst swiveled in his chair to face the window removing his glasses he seemed to soak up the glare and heat of the sun hungrily with pleasure but with a hint of regret as well as if he were a man of the outdoors not happy that his duty kept him deskbound how long have you done this work fleischman he asked without turning paul stood clutching the notebook at his side all my life sir since the war ernst continued to bask in the sun leaning back slightly eyes closed paul walked quietly to the mantel the bayonet was a long one it was dark and had not been sharpened recently but it was still quite capable of death and you enjoy it ernst asked it suits me he could snatch the grisly weapon up and step to ernsts back in one second kill him quickly hed killed with a blade before using a knife is not like fencing in a douglas fairbanks movie the blade is merely a deadly extension of the fist a good boxer is a good knife man touching the ice but what about the guard outside the door that man would have to die too yet paul never killed his touchoffs bodyguards never even put himself in a situation where he might have to he might kill ernst with the blade then knock the guard out but with all the other soldiers around somebody might hear the ruckus and theyd arrest him besides his orders were to make sure the death was public it suits you ernst repeated a simple life with no conflicts and no difficult choices the phone buzzed ernst lifted it yes yes ludwig the meeting went to our advantage yes yes now have you found some volunteers ach good but perhaps another two or three yes ill meet you there good afternoon hanging up the phone ernst glanced at paul then toward the mantel some of my mementos ive known soldiers all my life and we all seem to be pack rats of memorabilia like this i have many more items at home isnt it odd how we keep souvenirs of such horrendous events it sometimes seems mad to me he looked at the clock on his desk are you finished fleischman yes sir i am i have some work to do now in private thank you for allowing the intrusion sir hail hitler fleischman paul turned at the doorway you are a lucky man to have your duty coincide with your circumstance and your nature how rare that is i suppose it is sir good day to you yes hail outside into the hallway with ernsts face and his voice burned into pauls mind he walked down the stairs eyes forward moving slowly passing invisibly among the men here in black or gray uniforms or suits or the coveralls of laborers and everywhere the stern twodimensional eyes staring down at him from the paintings on the walls the trinity whose names were etched into brass plates a hitler h göring and p j goebbels on the ground floor he turned toward the glaring front doorway that opened onto wilhelm street footsteps echoing loudly webber had provided used boots a good addition to the costume except that a hobnail had worn through the leather and tapped loudly with every step no matter how paul twisted his foot he was fifty feet from the doorway which was an explosion of sunlight surrounded by a halo forty feet tap tap tap twenty feet he could see outside now cars streaming past on the street tenfeet tap tap you you will stop paul froze he turned to see a middleaged man in a gray uniform striding quickly to him you came down those stairs where were you i was only let me see your documents i was measuring for carpets sir paul said digging webbers papers out of his pocket the ss man looked them over quickly compared the photo and read the work order he took the meter stick from pauls hand as if it were a weapon he returned the work order then looked up where is your special permit special permit i wasnt told i needed one for access upstairs you must have one my superior never told me thats not our concern everyone with access to floors above the ground needs a special permit your party membership card i i dont have it with me you are not a member of the party of course sir i am a loyal national socialist believe me youre not a loyal national socialist if you dont carry your card the officer searched him flipped through the notebook glanced at the sketches of the rooms and the dimensions he was shaking his head paul said i am to return later in the week sir i can bring you a special permit and party card then he added and at that time i can measure your office as well my office is on the ground floor in the back the area not scheduled for renovation the ss officer said sourly all the more reason to have a fine persian carpet of which we happen to have several more than have been allotted and nothing to do but let them rot in a warehouse the man considered this then he glanced at his wristwatch i dont have time to pursue this matter i am security underleader schechter you will find my office down the stairs and to the right the name is on the door on with you now but when you come back have the special permit or it will be prince albrecht street for you as the three men sped away from wilhelm square a siren sounded nearby paul and reggie morgan looked uneasily out the windows of the van which stank of burned cabbage and sweat webber laughed its an ambulance relax a moment later the medical vehicle turned the corner i know the sounds of all the official vehicles its helpful knowledge in berlin nowadays after a few moments paul said quietly i met him met whom morgan asked ernst morgans eyes widened he was there he came into the office just after i got there ach what do we do webber said we cant get back inside the chancellory how will we find out where hell be oh i found that out paul said you did morgan asked i had time to look over his desk before he arrived hell be at the stadium today which stadium morgan asked there are dozens in the city the olympic stadium i saw a memorandum hitlers having photographs of senior party officials taken there this afternoon he glanced at a nearby clock tower but we have only a few hours to get me into place i think well need your help once again otto ach i can get you anywhere you wish mr john dillinger i work the miracles and you pay for them that is why we are such good partners of course and speaking of which my american cash if you please and he let the transmission of the van scream in second gear as he held out his right hand palm up until morgan dropped the envelope into it after a moment paul was aware that morgan had been looking him over the man asked what was ernst like did he seem like the most dangerous man in europe he was polite he was preoccupied he was weary and sad sad webber asked paul nodded recalling the mans fast yet burdened eyes the eyes of someone waiting for arduous trials to be over with the sun finally sets morgan glanced at the shops and buildings and flags on the wide avenue of under the lindens he asked is that a problem problem will meeting him make you hesitate to to do what youve come here for will it make a difference paul schumann wished to god that he could say it would that seeing someone up close that talking to him would melt the ice would make him hesitate to take that mans life but he answered truthfully no it will make no difference they sweated from the heat and kurt fischer at least sweated from fear the brothers were now two blocks from the square where they would meet unger the man who was to spirit them away from this foundering country and reunite them with their parents the man they were trusting with their lives hans stooped down picked up a stone and skipped it across the waters of the landwehr canal dont kurt whispered harshly dont draw attention to us you should relax brother skipping stones doesnt draw attention everybody does it god its hot can we stop for a ginger beer ach you think we are on holiday dont you kurt glanced around there were not many people out the hour was early the heat already fierce see anyone following us his brother asked with some irony do you want to stay in berlin all things considered all i know is that if we give up our house well never see it again if we dont give it up well never see mother and father again probably well never see anyone again hans scowled and picked up another stone he got three skips this time look did you see that hurry up they turned into a market street where vendors booths were being set up there were a number of trucks parked on the streets and sidewalks the vehicles were filled with turnips beets apples potatoes canal trout carp cod oil none of the mostindemand items of course like meat olive oil butter and sugar even so people were already queuing up to find the best or rather the least unappetizing purchases look there he is kurt said crossing the street and making for an old truck parked off the side of the square a man with curly brown hair leaned against it smoking as he looked through a newspaper he glanced up saw the boys and nodded subtly he tossed the paper inside the cab of the truck it all comes down to trust and sometimes youre not disappointed kurt had had doubts that he would even show up mr unger kurt said as they joined him they shook hands warmly this is my brother hans ach he looks just like his father you sell chocolates the boy asked looking at the truck i manufacture and sell candy i was a professor but that is not a lucrative job any longer learning is sporadic but eating sweets is a constant not to mention politically safe we can talk later now we should get out of berlin you can ride in the cab with me until we get near the border then you will climb into a space in the back i use ice to keep the chocolate from melting on days like this and you will lie under boards covered with ice dont worry you wont freeze to death ive cut holes in the side of the truck to let in some warm air well cross the border as i do every week i know the guards i give them chocolate they never search me unger walked to the back of the truck and closed the gate hans climbed into the cab picked up the newspaper and started reading kurt turned wiped his brow and looked out one last time over the city in which hed spent his entire life in the heat and the haze it seemed italian reminding him of a trip hed taken to bologna with his parents when his father was lecturing for a fortnight at the old university there the young man was turning back to climb into the truck next to his brother when there was a collective gasp from the crowd kurt froze eyes wide three black cars skidded to a stop around ungers truck six men jumped out in black ss uniforms no hans run kurt shouted but two of the ss troops raced to the passenger side of the vehicle they ripped the door open and dragged his younger brother onto the street he fought back until one struck him in the gut with a truncheon hans yelped and stopped struggling rolling on the ground clutching his belly the soldiers pulled him to his feet no no no unger cried both he and kurt were shoved against the side of the truck papers empty your pockets the three captives did as they were told the fischers said the ss commander looking over their identity cards and nodding in recognition tears running down his cheeks unger said to kurt i didnt betray you i swear i didnt no he didnt said the ss officer who unholstered his luger worked the toggle to cock it and shot the man in the head unger dropped to the pavement kurt gasped in horror she did the ss man added nodding toward a large middleaged woman leaning out of the ss cars window her voice filled with fury raged at the boys betrayers swine it was mrs lutz the war widow who lived on their floor in the apartment building the woman who had just wished them a good day shocked staring at ungers limp body from which blood flowed copiously kurt heard her breathless scream you ungrateful pigs ive been watching you i know what youve done i know whos been to your apartment i write down what ive seen youve betrayed our leader the ss commander grimaced with irritation at the woman he nodded toward a younger officer and he pushed her back into the car you have been on our list both of you for some time weve done nothing staring at ungers blood unable to look away from the growing crimson pool kurt whispered nothing i swear we were just trying to be with our parents illegally escaping the country pacifism antiparty activities all capital offenses he pulled hans closer aimed the pistol at his head the boy whimpered please no please kurt stepped forward fast a guard slugged him in the belly and he doubled over he saw the commander touch the gun to the back of his brothers head no the commander squinted and leaned back to avoid the spray of blood and flesh please sir but then another officer whispered we have those orders sir during the olympics restraint he nodded toward the market where a crowd had gathered watching foreigners might be present perhaps reporters hesitating for a long moment the commander muttered impatiently all right take them to columbia house although it was being phased out in favor of the more ruthlessly efficient and less visible oranienburg camp columbia house was still the most notorious jail in berlin the man nodded at ungers corpse and dump that somewhere find out if hes married and if so send his wife his bloody shirt yes my leader with what message the shirt will be the message the commander put his gun away and strode back to his car he glanced briefly at the fischer brothers but his eyes didnt really see them it was as if they were already dead where are you paul schumann like his question yesterday to the then anonymous suspect who are you willi kohl posed this query aloud and in frustration with no immediate hope of an answer the inspector had thought that knowing the mans name would speed the resolution of the case but this was not so kohl had received no reply to his telegrams to the federal bureau of investigation or the international olympic committee hed gotten a brief response from the new york city police department but it said only that they would look into the matter when practicable this was not a word that kohl was familiar with but when he looked it up in the departments englishgerman dictionary an angry scowl filled his face over the past year hed sensed a reluctance by american law enforcers to cooperate with the kripo some of this was due to antinational socialist sentiment in the united states some too he believed might have roots in the lindbergh baby kidnapping bruno hauptmann had escaped from police custody in germany and fled to america where hed murdered the child kohl had sent a second brief telegram in his halting english thanking the nypd and reminding them of the urgency of the matter hed alerted the border guards to detain schumann if he tried to leave but word would get only to the major crossings nor had janssens second trip to the olympic village proved fruitful paul schumann had not been officially connected to the american team he had come to berlin as a writer with no known affiliation hed left the olympic village the day before and no one had seen him since nor did anyone know where he might have gone schumanns name wasnt on the list of those who had bought largo ammunition or modelo as recently but this was no surprise since hed only arrived with the team on friday rocking back in his chair looking through the box of evidence reading his penciled notes kohl looked up to see that janssen had paused in the doorway chatting with several other young plainclothed assistant inspectors and inspector candidates kohl frowned at the noisy coffee klatch the younger officers paid their respects hail hitler hail inspector kohl yes yes we are on our way to the lecture are you coming no kohl muttered im working since the partys ascension in onehour talks on national socialism were held weekly in the main assembly hall of the alex attendance by all kripo officers was mandatory lukewarm willi kohl rarely went the last one hed attended was two years ago and had been entitled hitler pangermanism and the roots of fundamental social change hed fallen asleep sd leader heydrich himself may show up were not sure another added enthusiastically but he might can you imagine we could shake his hand as i said im working kohl looked past their youthful enthusiastic faces what do you have janssen good day inspector one young officer said exuberantly they went off loudly down the hall kohl fixed his frown on janssen who winced sorry sir they attach themselves to me because im attached to me well yes sir kohl nodded in the direction theyd gone theyre members of the party several are yes before hitler came to power it was illegal for a police officer to be a member of any political party kohl said dont be tempted to join janssen you think it will help your career but it wont it will only get you stuck further in the spiderweb moral quicksand janssen quoted back his boss indeed anyway how could i possibly join he asked gravely then offered one of his rare smiles working with you leaves me no time for the rallies kohl smiled back then asked now what do you have the postmortem from dresden alley its about time twentyfour hours to perform an autopsy inexcusable the inspector candidate handed his boss the thin folder which contained only two pages whats this did the coroner do the autopsy in his sleep i never mind kohl muttered and read through the document it first stated the obvious of course as autopsies always did in the dense language of physiology and morphology that the cause of death was severe trauma to the brain due to the passage of a bullet no sexual diseases a bit of gout a bit of arthritis no war wounds he and kohl had in common bunions and the calluses on the victims feet suggested that he was indeed an ardent walker janssen looked over kohls shoulder look sir he had a broken finger that set badly that does not interest us janssen its the little finger which is prone to breaking under many circumstances as opposed to an injury that is unique and might help us understand the man better a recent break might be helpful we could call upon physicians in northwest berlin for leads to patients but this fracture is old he turned back to the report the alcohol in his blood suggested that hed had some liquor not long before hed died the stomach contents revealed chicken garlic herbs onion carrots potatoes a reddishcolored sauce of some sort and coffee all digested to the point that suggested the meal had been enjoyed about a half hour before death ah kohl brightened jotting all these facts down in pencil in his battered little notebook what sir here is something that does interest us janssen while we cant be positive it appears that the victim ate a very sublime dish for his last meal it is probably coq au vin a french delicacy that marries chicken with the unlikely partner of red wine usually a burgundy such as chambertin we dont see it here often janssen you know why because we germans make pissbad red wines and the austrians who make brilliant reds dont send us very much oh yes this is good he thought for a moment then rose and walked to a map of berlin on his wall he found a pushpin and stuck it into dresden alley he died here at noon and he had lunch at a restaurant about thirty minutes before that you recall he was a good walker janssen his leg muscles which put mine to shame and the calluses on his feet so while he might have taken a taxi or tram to his fatal encounter we will assume that he walked allowing him a few minutes after the meal for a cigarette you recall his yellowstained fingertips not exactly sir be more observant then allowing him time for a cigarette and to pay the check and savor his coffee we will assume that he walked on his sturdy legs for twenty minutes before he came to dresden alley how far could a brisk walker go in that time i would guess a kilometer and a half kohl frowned i too would guess that he examined the legend of the berlin map and drew a circle around the site of the killing janssen shook his head look at that its huge we need to take the photograph of the victim to every restaurant in that circle no only to those serving coq au vin and of those only the ones that do so at lunchtime on saturday a fast look at the hours of service and the menu in front will tell us if we need to inquire further but it will still be a huge task and one that must be undertaken immediately the young officer stared at the map is it up to you and me sir can we visit all of them ourselves how can we he shook his head discouraged of course we cant then willi kohl sat back his eyes floating around the room they settled momentarily on his desktop then he said you wait here for any telegrams or other messages about the case janssen kohl took his panama hat from the rack in the corner of his office and me i have a thought where will you be sir on the trail of a french chicken chapter twentythree the anxious atmosphere that hung about the three men in the boardinghouse was like cold smoke paul schumann knew the sensation well from those moments as he waited to step into the boxing ring trying to remember everything he knew about his opponent picturing the guys defenses planning when best to dance under them when to rise onto his toes and deliver a roundhouse or jab figuring out how to exploit his weaknesses and how best to compensate for your own he knew it from other times too as a button man planning his touchoffs looking at maps drawn in his own careful handwriting doublechecking the colt and his backup pistol looking over the notes hed assembled of his victims schedules preferences dislikes routines acquaintances this was the before the hard hard before the stillness preceding the kill the moment when he chewed the facts amid a feeling of impatience and edginess fear too of course you never got away from that the good button men didnt in any case and always the growing numbness the crystalizing of his heart he was starting to touch the ice in the dim room windows closed shades down phone unplugged of course paul and morgan looked over a map and two dozen publicity photos of the olympic stadium which webber had dug up along with a pair of sharply creased gray flannel trousers for morgan which the american had examined skeptically at first but then decided to keep morgan tapped one of the photos where do you please one moment webber interrupted he rose and walked across the room whistling he was in a jovial mood now that he had a thousand dollars in his pocket and wouldnt have to worry about lard and yellow dye for a while morgan and paul exchanged frowns the german dropped to his knees and began pulling records out from the cabinet beneath a battered gramophone he grimaced ach no john philip sousa i look all the time but they are hard to find he glanced up at morgan say mr john dillinger here tells me that sousa is american but i think he is joking please the bandleader is english is he not no hes american the slim man said i have heard otherwise morgan lifted an eyebrow perhaps youre right maybe a wager would be in order a hundred marks webber considered then said i will look into the matter further we dont really have time for music morgan added watching webber examining the stack of disks paul said but i think we have time to cover up the sounds of our conversation exactly webber said and we shall use he examined a label a collection of our stolid german hunting songs he turned on the device and set the needle in the groove of the disk a rousing scratchy tune filled the room this is the deerstalker a laugh appropriate considering our mission the mobsters luciano and lansky did exactly the same in america usually playing the radio to cover up conversation in the event deweys or hoovers boys had a mike in the room where they were meeting now you were saying morgan asked where is the photography session ernsts memorandum says the pressroom thats here webber said paul examined the drawing carefully and wasnt pleased the stadium was huge and the press box must have been two hundred feet long it was located near the top of the buildings south side he could take up position in the stands on the north side but that meant a very long shot across the entire width of the facility too far a little breeze the distortion of the window no i couldnt guarantee a fatal shot and i might hit someone else so webber asked lethargically maybe you could shoot hitler or göring why hes as big a target as a dirigible a blind man could hit him he looked over the map again you could get ernst when he got out of the car what do you think of that mr morgan the fact that webber had gotten paul into and out of the chancellory safely had given the gang leader sufficient credibility to be trusted with morgans name but we dont know exactly when and where hell be arriving morgan pointed out there were a dozen walks and passages he could take they might not use the main entrance we couldnt anticipate that and you should be in hiding before he gets there the entire national socialist pantheon will be assembled security is going to be massive paul continued to peruse the map morgan was right and he noticed from the map that there was an underground driveway that seemed to circle the entire stadium probably for the leaders to use for protected entrances and exits ernst might never be outside at all they stared silently for a time an idea occurred to paul and touching the photos he explained it the back walkways of the stadium were open leaving the pressroom one would walk either east or west along this corridor then down several flights of stairs to the ground level where there was a parking area a wide drive and sidewalks that led to the railway station about a hundred feet from the stadium overlooking the parking lot and drive was a cluster of small buildings labeled on the map storage facilities if ernst came out onto that walkway and down the stairs i could shoot from that shed the one there you could make the shot paul nodded yes easily but as we were saying we dont know that ernst will arrive or leave that way maybe we can force him outside flush him out like a bird and how morgan asked paul said we ask him ask him morgan frowned we get a message to him in the pressroom that hes urgently needed theres someone who needs to see him in private about something important he walks out the corridor onto the porch into my sights webber lit one of his cabbage cigars but would any message be so urgent that hed interrupt a meeting with the leader göring and goebbels from what ive learned about him hes obsessed with his job we tell him that theres a problem having to do with the army or navy i know thatll get his attention what about this krupp the armorer that max told us about could a message from krupp be urgent morgan nodded krupp yes id think so but how do we get the message to ernst while hes in the photography session ach easy webber said ill telephone him how the man drew on his ersatz cigar i will find out the number of one of the telephones in the pressroom and place a call i will do this myself i will ask for ernst and tell him that there is a driver downstairs with a message only for him to see from gustav krupp von bohlen himself i will call from a post office so when the gestapo dials seven afterward to find the source of the call therell be no lead to me how can you get the number morgan asked contacts paul asked cynically do you really have to bribe someone to find the number otto i would suspect that half the sports journalists in berlin have them ach webber said smiling in delight he tried english you are hitting the head on the nail back to his native tongue of course thats true but the most important aspect of any venture is knowing which individual to approach and what his price is all right morgan said exasperated how much and remember we are not a bottomless well another two hundred marks will be fine and for that i will add for no extra charge a way to get into and out of the stadium mr john dillinger a full ss uniform you can sling your rifle over your shoulder and walk straight into the stadium like himmler himself and no one will stop you practice your hails and your hitler salute flapping your limp arm in the air like our goatpeeing leader morgan frowned but if they catch him masquerading as a soldier theyll shoot him for a spy paul glanced at webber and they both broke into laughter it was the gang leader who said please mr morgan our friend is about to kill the national military tzar if he is caught he could be dressed like george washington and whistling stars and stripes forever and they would still shoot him quite dead do you not think i was only considering ways to make it less obvious morgan grumbled no its a good plan reggie paul said after the shot theyll get all the officials back to berlin as fast as possible ill ride with the guards protecting them once were in town ill get lost in the crowd afterward hed slip into the embassy building near the brandenburg gate and radio andrew avery and vince manielli in amsterdam whod send the plane out to the aerodrome for him as their eyes returned to the maps of the stadium paul decided it was time he said i want to tell you theres someone coming with me morgan glanced at webber who laughed ach what are you thinking that i could possibly live anywhere but this prussian garden of eden no no i will leave germany only for heaven paul said a woman morgans mouth tightened the one here nodding toward the hallway of the boardinghouse thats right käthe paul added you looked into her you know shes legitimate what have you told her asked the troubled american the gestapo has her passport and its only a matter of time until they arrest her its a matter of time until they arrest a lot of people here what have you told her paul morgan repeated just our cover story about sportswriting thats all but shes coming with me he said i should call washington or the senator call who you like shes coming morgan looked at webber ach i have been married three times possibly four the german said and i now have a complicated arrangement expect no advice from me on matters of the heart morgan shook his head jesus were running an airways service paul fixed his fellow american with a gaze one other thing at the stadium ill only have the russian passport for id if i dont make it shell never hear what happened will you tell her something about me having to leave i dont want her thinking that i ditched her and do what you can to get her out of course ach youll make it mr john dillinger youre the american cowboy with big balls right webber wiped his sweating forehead he rose and found three glasses in the cupboard from a flask he poured some clear liquid into them and passed them around austrian obstler you have heard of it it is the best of all liquors good for the blood and good for the soul now drink up gentlemen then let us go out and change the fate of my poor nation i will need as many of them as you can find willi kohl said the man nodded cautiously it isnt really a question of finding them they are always quite findable its a question of how outoftheordinary this matter is there is really no precedent for it it is out of the ordinary kohl agreed that much is true but police chief himmler has branded this an unusual case and an important one other officers are occupied throughout the city with equally pressing matters and he left it to me to be resourceful so i have come to you himmler asked johann muntz the middleaged man stood in the doorway of a small house on grün street in charlottenburg shaved and trimmed and wearing a suit he looked as if hed just returned from church this sunday morning a risky outing to be sure if you wished to retain your job as headmaster of one of the best schools in berlin well as you know theyre autonomous completely selfgoverned i cannot dictate anything to them they might say no and there is nothing i can do about that ah dr muntz im just asking for an opportunity to appeal to them in hopes they will volunteer to help the cause of justice but today is sunday how can i contact them i suspect you need only call the leader at home and he will arrange for their assembly very well i will do it inspector threequarters of an hour later willi kohl found himself in muntzs backyard looking over the faces of nearly two dozen boys many of whom were dressed in brown shirts shorts and white socks black ties dangling from a braided leather clasp at the throat the youngsters were for the most part members of the hindenburg schools hitler youth brigade as the schools headmaster had just reminded kohl the organization was completely independent of any adult supervision the members selected their own leaders and it was they who determined the activities of their group whether that was hiking football or denouncing backstabbers hail hitler kohl said and was greeted with a number of outstretched right hands and a surprisingly loud echo of the salutation i am senior detectiveinspector kohl with the kripo some of the faces broke into looks of admiration and some of the youthful faces remained as emotionless as the face of the fat dead man in dresden alley i need your assistance in the furtherance of national socialism a matter of the highest priority he looked at a young blond boy who had been introduced to him as helmut gruber who kohl recalled was the leader of the hindenburg brigade he was smaller than most of the others but he had an adult confidence about him a steely look filled his eyes as he gazed back at a man thirty years older than he sir we will do whatever is necessary to help our leader and our country good helmut now listen everyone you may think this is an odd request i have here two bundles of documents one is a map of an area near the tiergarten the other is a picture of a man we are trying to identify written on the bottom of the mans picture is the name of a particular dish one would order at a restaurant its called coq au vin a french term you dont need to know how its pronounced all you need to do is go to every restaurant in the circled area on the map and see if the establishment was open yesterday and if that dish is on the luncheon menu if it is you will ask if the manager of the restaurant knows the person in this picture or remembers him dining there recently if so contact me at kripo headquarters at once will you do this yes inspector kohl we will squad leader gruber announced not bothering to poll his troops good the leader will be proud of you i will now distribute these sheets he paused and caught the eye of one particular student in the back one of the few not dressed in a uniform one other matter it is necessary that you all be discreet regarding something discreet the boy asked frowning yes it means you must refrain from mentioning a fact i am about to share with you i have come to you for this assistance because of my son günter in the back there several dozen eyes swiveled toward the boy whom kohl had called at home not long before and instructed to come to his headmasters house günter blushed fiercely and looked down his father continued i suspect you do not know that my son will in the future be assisting me in important matters of state security this by the way is why i cannot let him join your fine organization i prefer that he remain behind the scenes as it were in this way he will be able to continue to help me work for the glory of the fatherland please keep this fact among yourselves you will do that helmuts eyes grew still as he glanced back at günter thinking perhaps of recent aryan and jew games that possibly should not have been played of course mr inspector kohl he said kohl looked at his sons face and its repressed smile of joy and then said now line up in a single queue and i will distribute the papers my son and squad leader gruber will decide how you divide the labor yes sir hail hitler hail hitler kohl forced himself to offer a firm outstretchedarm salute he gave the handouts to the two boys he added oh and gentlemen yes sir helmut responded standing to attention mind the traffic look carefully when crossing streets chapter twentyfour he knocked on the door and she let him into her room käthe seemed embarrassed by her living space in the boardinghouse bare walls no plants rickety furniture she or the landlord had moved all the better items into the rooms to be let nor did anything here seem personal maybe shed been pawning off her possessions sunlight hit the faded carpet but it was a small solitary trapezoid and pale the light was reflected from a window across the alley then she gave a girlish laugh and flung her arms around him she kissed him hard you smell of something different i like it she sniffed his face shaving soap perhaps thats it yes hed used some hed found in the lavatory a german brand rather than his burma shave because he was afraid a guard at the stadium might smell the unfamiliar scent of the american soap and grow suspicious its nice he noticed a single suitcase on the bed the goethe book was on the bare table a cup of weak coffee next to it there were white lumps floating on the surface and he asked her if there was such a thing as hitler milk from hitler cows she laughed and said that the national socialists had plenty of asses among them but to her knowledge theyd created no ersatz cows even real milk curdles when its old then he said were leaving tonight she nodded frowning tonight when you say immediately you mean it i will meet you here at five where are you going now käthe asked him just doing one final interview well good luck paul i will look forward to reading your article even if it is about oh perhaps the black market and not sports she gave him a knowing look käthe was a clever woman of course she suspected he had business here other than writing stories probably like half the town putting together some semilegal ventures which made him think shed already accepted a darker side to him and that she wouldnt be very upset if he eventually told her the truth about what he was doing here after all his enemy was her enemy he kissed her once more tasting her smelling lilac feeling the pressure of her skin against him but he found that unlike last night he wasnt the least stirred this didnt trouble him though it was the way things had to be the ice had taken him completely how could she have betrayed us kurt fischer answered his brothers question with a despairing shake of his head he too was heartsick at the thought of what their neighbor had done why mrs lutz to whom they took a loaf of their mothers warm stollen lopsided and overfilled with candied fruit every christmas eve whom their parents had comforted as she cried on the anniversary of germanys surrender that date a surrogate for the day her husband was killed during the war since no one knew exactly when he died how could she do it hans whispered again but kurt fischer was unable to explain if she had denounced them because they had been planning to post dissident billboards or to attack some hitler youth he might have understood but all they wanted to do was leave a country whose leader had said pacifism is the enemy of national socialism like so many others he supposed mrs lutz had become intoxicated by hitler the prison cell at columbia house was about three by three meters made of roughhewn stone windowless with metal bars for a door opening onto the corridor water dripped and the young men heard the scuttle of rats nearby there was a single bare glaring bulb overhead in the cell yet none in the corridor so they could see few details of the dark forms that occasionally passed sometimes the guards were alone other times they escorted prisoners who were barefoot and made no sound except their occasional gasps or pleas or sobs sometimes the silence of their fear was more chilling than the noises they uttered the heat was unbearable it made their skin itch kurt couldnt understand why they were underground and it should have been cool here then he noticed a pipe in the corner hot air streamed out fiercely the jailors were pumping it in from a furnace to make sure the prisoners didnt get even a small respite from their discomfort we shouldntve left hans muttered i told you yes we should have stayed in our apartment that would have saved us he was speaking with sharp irony until when next week tomorrow dont you understand shes been watching us shes seen the parties she heard what weve said how long will we be here and how does one answer that question kurt thought they were in a place where every moment was forever he sat on the floor there was nowhere else to perch as he stared absently into the dark empty cell across the corridor from theirs a door opened and boots sounded on the concrete kurt began counting the steps one two three at twentyeight the guard would be even with their cell counting footsteps was something hed already learned about being a prisoner captives are desperate for any information for any certainty twenty twentyone twentytwo the brothers regarded each other hans balled up his fists theyll hurt theyll taste blood he muttered no kurt said dont do anything foolish twentyfive twentysix the steps slowed blinking against the glare from the light overhead kurt saw two large men in brown uniforms appear they looked at the brothers then turned away one of them opened the cell opposite and harshly called grossman you will come out the darkness in the cell moved kurt was startled to realize that hed been staring at another human being the man staggered to his feet and stepped forward using the bars as support he was filthy if hed gone inside cleanshaven the stubble on his face told kurt that he had been in the cell for at least a week the prisoner blinked looked around him at the two large men then at kurt across the hallway one of the guards glanced at a piece of paper ali grossman you have been sentenced to five years in oranienburg camp for crimes against the state step outside but i remain quiet you are to be prepared for the trip to the camp they deloused me already what do you mean i said quiet one guard whispered something to the other who replied didnt you bring yours no well here use mine he handed some lightcolored leather gloves to the other guard who pulled them on with the grunt of a tennis player delivering a powerful serve the guard swung his fist directly into the thin mans belly grossman cried out and began to retch the guards knuckles silently struck the mans chin no no no more blows finding their targets on his groin his face his abdomen blood flowed from his nose and mouth tears from his eyes choking gasping please sir in horror the brothers watched as the human being was turned into a broken doll the guard whod been doing the hitting looked at his comrade and said im sorry about the gloves my wife will clean and mend these if its convenient they picked the man up and dragged him up the hall the door echoed loudly kurt and hans stared at the empty cell kurt was speechless he believed hed never been so frightened in his life hans finally asked he probably did something quite terrible dont you think to be treated like that a saboteur id guess kurt said in a shaky voice i heard there was a fire in a government building the transportation ministry did you hear that ill bet he was behind it yes a fire he was surely the arsonist they sat paralyzed with terror as the blistering stream of air from the pipe behind them continued to heat the tiny cell it was no more than a minute later that they heard the door open and slam closed again they glanced at each other the footsteps began echoing as leather met concretesix seven eight i will kill the one who was on the right hans whispered the bigger i can do it we can get the keys and kurt leaned close shocking the boy by gripping his face in both of his hands no he whispered so fiercely that his brother gasped you will do nothing you will not fight them you will not speak back you will do exactly what they say and if they hit you you will take the pain silently all his earlier thoughts of fighting the national socialists of trying to make some difference had vanished but kurts powerful fingers pulled hans close you will do as i saythirteen fourteen the footsteps were like a hammer on the olympic bell each one sending a jolt of fear vibrating within kurt fischers soul seventeen eighteen at twentysix they would slow at twentyeight they would stop and the blood would begin to flow youre hurting me but even hanss strong muscles couldnt shake off his brothers grip if they knock out your teeth you will say nothing if they break your fingers you can cry and wail and scream but you will say nothing to them we are going to survive this do you understand me to survive we cannot fight back twentytwo twentythree twentyfour a shadow fell on the floor in front of the bars understand yes hans whispered kurt put his arm around his brothers shoulder and they faced the door the men stopped at the cell but they werent the guards one was a lean grayhaired man in a suit the other was heavier balding wearing a brown tweed jacket and a waistcoat they looked the brothers over you are the fischers the grayhaired man asked hans looked at kurt who nodded he pulled a piece of paper from his pocket and read kurt he looked up you would be kurt and you hans yes what was this the man looked up the hallway open the cell more footsteps the guard appeared glanced in and unlocked the door he stepped back his hand on the truncheon that hung from his belt the two men stepped inside the grayhaired man said i am colonel reinhard ernst the name was familiar to kurt he occupied some role in hitlers government though he wasnt sure what exactly the second man was introduced as doctorprofessor keitel from some military college outside of berlin the colonel asked your arrest document says crimes against the state but they all do what exactly were your crimes kurt explained about their parents and about trying to leave the country illegally ernst cocked his head and regarded the boys closely pacifism he muttered and turned to keitel who asked youve committed antiparty activities no sir you are edelweiss pirates these were informal antinational socialist clubs of young people some said gangs rising up in reaction to the mindless regimentation of the hitler youth theyd meet clandestinely for discussions about politics and art and to sample some of the pleasures of life that the party publicly at least condemned drinking smoking and unmarried sex the brothers knew some young people who were members but they themselves were not kurt told the men this the offense may seem minor but ernst displayed a piece of paper you have been sentenced to three years at oranienburg camp hans gasped kurt felt stunned thinking of the terrible beating theyd just seen poor mr grossman pounded into submission kurt knew too that people sometimes went to oranienburg or dachau to serve a short sentence but were never seen again he sputtered there was no trial we were arrested an hour ago and today is sunday how can we have been sentenced the colonel shrugged as you can see there was a trial ernst handed him the document which contained dozens of prisoners names kurts and hanss among them next to each was the length of sentence the heading on the document said simply the peoples court this was the infamous tribunal that consisted of two real judges and five men from the party the ss or the gestapo there was no appeal from its judgment he stared at it numb the professor spoke you are in general good health both of you the brothers glanced at each other and nodded jewish to any degree no and you have done labor service kurt said my brother has i was too old as to the matter at hand professor keitel said we are here to offer you a choice he seemed impatient choice ernsts voice lowered and he continued it is the thinking of some people in our government that particular individuals should not participate in our military perhaps they are of a certain race or nationality perhaps they are intellectuals perhaps they tend to question decisions of our government i however believe that a nation is only as great as its army and that for an army to be great it must be representative of all its citizens professor keitel and i are doing a study that we think will support some shifts in how the government views the german armed forces he glanced back into the hall and said to the sa guard you can leave us but sir you can leave us ernst repeated in a calm voice and yet it seemed to kurt as strong as krupp steel the man glanced again at kurt and hans and then receded down the hall ernst continued and this study may very well ultimately determine how the government values its citizens in general we have been looking for men in your circumstances to help us the professor said we need healthy young men who would otherwise be excluded from military service for political or other reasons and what would we do ernst gave a brief laugh why youd become soldiers of course you would serve in the german army navy or air force for one year regular duty he glanced at the professor who continued your service will be as any other soldiers the only difference is that we will monitor your performance your commanding officers will keep notes on your record the information will be compiled and we will analyze it ernst said if you serve the year your criminal record will be erased a nod at the courts sentencing list you will be free to emigrate if you wish but the currency regulations will remain in place you can only take a limited number of marks and you will not be allowed back into the country kurt was thinking about something hed heard a moment ago perhaps they are of a certain race or nationality did ernst foresee that jews or other nonaryans would someday be in the german army and if so what did that mean for the country in general what changes did these men have in mind you are pacifists ernst said our other volunteers whove agreed to help us have had less of a difficult choice than you can a pacifist morally join a military organization thats a hard decision to make but we would like you to participate you are nordic in appearance are in excellent health and have the bearing of soldiers with people like you involved i believe certain elements in the government would be more inclined to accept our theories regarding these beliefs of yours keitel added i will say this being a professor at a war college and a military historian i find them naive but we will take your sentiments into account and your duties in the service would be commensurate with your views we would hardly make a flier out of a man terrified of heights or put a claustrophobic in an undersea boat there are many jobs in the military that a pacifist could hold medical service comes to mind ernst said and as i said after some time you may find that your feelings about peace and war become more realistic there is no better crucible for becoming a man than the army i feel impossible kurt thought he said nothing but if your beliefs dictate that you cannot serve ernst said you have another option a gesture toward the sentencing document kurt glanced at his brother may we discuss this between ourselves ernst said certainly but you only have a few hours there is a group being inducted late this afternoon with basic training to start tomorrow he looked at his watch i have a meeting now ill be back here by two or three to learn your decision kurt handed the sentencing document to ernst but the colonel shook his head keep that it might help you make up your mind chapter twentyfive twenty minutes from downtown berlin just past charlottenburg the white van turned north at adolf hitler plaza reggie morgan behind the wheel he and paul schumann beside him gazed at the stadium to the left two massive rectangular columns stood at the front the five olympic rings floating between them as they turned left onto olympic street paul again noted the massive size of the complex according to the directional signs in addition to the stadium itself were a swimming facility a hockey rink a theater a sports field and many outbuildings and parking areas the stadium was white toweringly high and long it didnt remind paul of a building as much as an impregnable battleship the grounds were crowded mostly workmen and provisioners but also many grayand blackuniformed soldiers and guards security for the national socialist leaders attending the photography session if bull gordon and the senator wanted ernst to die in public then this was the place for it it appeared that one could drive right up to the front plaza of the stadium but for an ss lieutenant the commission was courtesy of otto webber no extra cost to climb out of a private van would be suspicious of course so they decided to skirt the stadium morgan would drop paul off in some trees near a parking lot which he would patrol examining trucks and workmen as he slowly made his way to the shed overlooking the press office on the south side of the stadium the van now pulled off the road onto a grassy patch and rocked to a stop invisible from the stadium paul climbed out and assembled the mauser he took the telescopic sight off the rifle it was not the sort of accessory a guard would have and slipped it into his pocket he slung the gun over his shoulder and put his black helmet on his head how do i look paul asked authentic enough to scare me good luck to you ill need it paul thought grimly peering through the trees at the scores of workmen on the grounds ready and able to point out an intruder and at the hundreds of guards whod be happy to gun him down six to five against brother he glanced at morgan and felt an impulse to lift his hand in an american salute one veteran to another but of course paul schumann was fully aware of his role hail and lifted his arm morgan repressed a smile and reciprocated as paul turned to leave morgan said softly oh wait paul when i spoke to bull gordon and the senator this morning they wished you luck and the commander said to tell you you can print his daughters wedding invitations as your first job you know what he means paul gave a nod and gripping the sling of the mauser started toward the stadium he stepped through the line of trees and into a huge parking lot which must have had room for twenty thousand cars he strode with authority and determination glancing sharply toward the vehicles parked here every inch the diligent guard ten minutes later paul had made his way through the lot and was at the soaring entrance to the stadium there were soldiers on duty here carefully checking papers and searching anyone who wanted to enter but on the surrounding grounds paul was merely another soldier and no one paid him any attention with an occasional hail hitler and nods he skirted the building heading toward the shed he passed a huge iron bell on the side of which was an inscription i summon the youth of the world as he approached the shed he noticed that it had no windows there was no back door the escape after the shooting would be difficult hed have to exit by the front in full view of the entire stadium but he suspected the acoustics would make it very difficult to tell where the shot had come from and there were many sounds of construction pile drivers saws riveting machines and the like to obscure the report of the rifle paul would walk slowly from the shed after firing pause and look around even call for help if he could do so without raising suspicion the time was onethirty otto webber who was in the potsdam plaza post office would place his call around twofifteen plenty of time he strolled on slowly examining the grounds looking in parked vehicles hail hitler he said to some laborers who were stripped to the waist and painting a fence it is a hot day for work like that ach its nothing one replied and if it were so what we work for the good of the fatherland paul said the leader is proud of you and continued on to his hunting blind he glanced at the shed curiously as if wondering if it posed any security threat pulling on the black leather gloves that were part of the uniform he opened the door and stepped inside the place was filled with cardboard cartons tied with twine paul recognized the smell immediately from his days as a printer the bitter scent of paper the sweet scent of ink the shed was being used to store programs or souvenir booklets of the games he arranged some cartons to make a shooting position in the front of the shed he then laid his open jacket to the right of where hed be lying to catch the ejected shells when he worked the bolt of the gun these details retrieving the casings and minding fingerprints probably didnt matter he had no record here and would be out of the country by nightfall but nonetheless he went to the trouble simply because this was his craft you make sure nothing is out of kilter you check your p s and q s standing well inside the small building he scanned the stadium with the rifles telescopic sight he noted the open corridor behind the pressroom which ernst would take to reach the stairway and walk down to meet the messenger or driver that webber would tell him about hed have a perfect shot as soon as the colonel stepped out of the doorway there were large windows too which he might shoot through if the man paused in front of one the time was onefifty paul sat back legs crossed and cradled the rifle in his lap sweat was dripping down his forehead in tickling rivulets he wiped his face with the sleeve of his shirt then began to mount the telescopic sight onto the rifle what do you think rudy but reinhard ernst did not expect his grandson to answer the boy wasstaring with smiling awe over the expanse of the olympic stadium they were in the long press facility on the south side of the building above the leaders reviewing stand ernst held him up so that he could look through the window rudy was virtually dancing with excitement ah who is this a voice asked ernst turned to see adolf hitler and two of his ss guards enter the room my leader hitler walked forward and smiled at the boy ernst said this is rudy my sons boy a faint look of sympathy on the leaders face told ernst that he was thinking of marks death in the war maneuvers accident ernst was momentarily surprised that the man remembered but realized that he should not have been hitlers mind was as expansive as the olympic field frighteningly quick and it retained everything he wished to retain say hello to our leader rudy salute as i taught you the boy gave a smart national socialist salute and hitler laughed in delight and tousled rudys hair the leader stepped closer to the window and pointed out some of the features of the stadium talking in an enthusiastic voice hitler asked the boy about his studies and what subjects he liked which sports he enjoyed more voices in the hallway the two rivals goebbels and göring arrived together what a drive that must have been thought ernst smiling to himself after his defeat at the chancellory that morning göring remained desultory ernst could see it clearly despite the smile what a difference between the two most powerful men in germany hitlers tantrums admittedly extreme were rarely about personal matters if his favorite chocolate was not available or he knocked his shin on a table he would shrug the matter off without anger and as to reversals on issues of state yes he had a temper that could terrify his closest of friends but once the problem was solved he was on to other matters göring on the other hand was like a greedy child anything that went against his wishes would infuriate him and fester until he found suitable revenge hitler was explaining to the boy what sporting events would be played in which areas of the stadium ernst was amused to see that beneath his broad smile göring was growing all the more angry that the leader was paying such attention to his rivals grandson over the next ten minutes other officials began arriving von blomberg the state defense minister and hjalmar schacht head of the state bank with whom ernst had developed a complicated system of financing rearmament projects using untraceable funds known as mefo bills schachts middle name was horace greeley after the american and ernst would joke with the brilliant economist about having cowboy roots here too were himmler blockfaced rudolf hess and serpenteyed reinhard heydrich who greeted ernst in a distracted way which was how he greeted everyone the photographer meticulously set up his leica and other equipment so that he could get both the subject in the foreground and the stadium in the back yet the lights would not flare in the windows ernst had developed an interest in photography he himself owned several leicas and hed planned to buy rudy a kodak which was imported from america and easier to use than the german precision cameras the colonel had recorded some of the trips he and his family had taken paris and budapest in particular had been well documented as had a hiking sojourn in the black forest and a boat trip down the danube good good the photographer now called we can begin hitler first insisted on taking a picture with rudy and lifted the boy onto his knee laughing and chatting with him like a good uncle after this the planned pictures began though he was pleased that rudy was enjoying himself ernst was growing impatient he found publicity absurd moreover it was a bad tactical error as was the whole idea of holding the olympics in germany for that matter there were far too many aspects of the rearmament that should have been kept secret how could a foreign visitor not see that this was a military nation and becoming more so every day the flashes went off as the celebrities of the third empire looked cheerful or thoughtful or ominous for the lens when ernst was not being photographed he talked with rudy or stood by himself and in his mind composed his letter to the leader about the waltham study considering what to say and what not to sometimes you couldnt share all an ss guard appeared in the doorway he spotted ernst and called mr minister a number of heads turned mr minister ernst the colonel was as amused as göring was irritated ernst was not officially a minister of state yes sir there is a phone call for you from the secretary of gustav krupp von bohlen there is a matter he needs to inform you of immediately something most important regarding your latest meeting what had they discussed then that was so urgent armor for the warships had been one topic it hadnt seemed so critical but now that england had accepted the new german shipbuilding figures perhaps krupp would have a problem meeting the production quotas but then he reflected that no the baron had not been informed of the victory regarding the treaty krupp was as brilliant a capitalist as he was a technician but he was also a coward whod shunned the party until hitler came to power then had become a rabid convert ernst suspected the crisis was minor at worst but krupp and his son were so important to the rearmament plans that they could not be ignored you may take the call on one of those phones there i will have it put through excuse me for one moment my leader hitler nodded and returned to discussing the angle of the camera with the photographer a moment later one of the many phones against the wall buzzed a glowing light indicated which it was and ernst picked it up yes this is colonel ernst colonel i am stroud an aide to baron von bohlen i apologize for the disturbance hes sent some documents for you to examine a driver has them at the stadium where you are now what are these about a pause i was instructed by the baron not to mention the subject over this telephone yes yes fine where is the driver in the driveway on the south side of the stadium he will meet you there its better to be discreet alone i am saying sir those are my instructions yes of course hail hitler hail ernst hung the phone in the cradle göring had been watching him like an obese falcon a problem minister the colonel decided both to ignore the feigned sympathy and the irony in the title rather than lie he admitted some problem that krupps having hes sent me a message about it as a maker primarily of armor artillery and munitions krupp dealt more with ernst and the naval and army commanders than with göring whose province was the air ach the huge man turned back to the mirror the photographer had provided he began moving a finger around his face smoothing his makeup ernst started for the door opa may i come with you of course rudy this way the boy scurried after his grandfather and they stepped into the interior corridor that connected all the pressrooms ernst put his arm around the boys shoulder he oriented himself and noticed a doorway that would lead to one of the south stairways they started toward it hed downplayed the concern at first but in fact he was growing troubled krupp steel was recognized as the best in the world the spire of new york citys magnificent chrysler building was made of his companys famed enduro ka but this meant too that foreign military planners were looking very carefully at krupps products and output he wondered if the british or french had learned how much of his steel was going not to rails or washing machines or automobiles but to armor grandfather and grandson made their way through a crowd of workers and foremen energetically finishing the construction here on the pressbooth floor cutting doors to size mounting hardware sanding and painting walls as they dodged around a carpentry station ernst glanced down at the arm of his suit and grimaced whats wrong opa rudy shouted over the scream of a saw oh look at this look at what ive gotten on me there was a sprinkling of plaster on it he brushed the dust away as best he could but some remained he wondered if he should wet his fingers to clean it but this might cause the plaster to set permanently in the cloth gertrud would not be pleased if that happened hed leave it for now he put his hand on the door handle to step onto the outer walkway that led to the stairs colonel a voice called in his ear ernst turned the ss guard had run up behind him he shouted over the whine of the saw sir the leaders dogs are here he wonders if your grandson would like to pose with them dogs rudy asked excitedly hitler liked german shepherds and had several of them they were genial animals house pets would you like that ernst asked oh yes please opa dont play roughly with them no i wont ernst escorted the boy back down the hall and watched him run to the dogs which were sniffing around the room exploring hitler laughed seeing the youngster hug the larger one and kiss him on top of the head the animal licked rudy with his huge tongue with some difficulty göring bent down and petted the animals too a childlike smile on his round face though he was heartless in many ways the minister loved animals devoutly the colonel then returned to the corridor and walked toward the outer door once again he blew again at the plaster dust on his sleeve then paused in front of one of the large southfacing windows and looked outside the sun fell on him fiercely hed left his hat back in the press booth should he get it no he thought it would his breath was knocked from his lungs as he felt a jarring blow to his body and found himself tumbling to the drop cloth covering the marble gasping in agony confused frightened but the one thought most prominent in his mind as he struck the floor was now ill get paint on my suit too what will gertrud say about this chapter twentysix the munich house was a small restaurant ten blocks northwest of the tiergarten and five from dresden alley willi kohl had eaten here several times and recalled enjoying the hungarian goulash to which they added caraway seeds and raisins of all things hed drunk a wonderful red austrian blaufrankisch wine with the meal he and janssen parked the dkw in front of the place and kohl tossed the kripo card onto the dashboard to fend off eager schupos armed with their traffic offense booklets tapping spent tobacco from his meerschaum pipe kohl hurried toward the restaurant konrad janssen close behind inside the decor was bavarian brown wood and yellowing stucco plaster with borders of wooden gardenias everywhere clumsily carved and painted the room was aromatic of sour spices and grilled meat kohl was instantly hungry he had eaten only one breakfast that morning and it had consisted of nothing more than pastry and coffee the smoke was dense for the lunch hour was nearly over and people had exchanged empty plates for coffee and cigarettes kohl saw his son günter standing with the young hitler youth leader helmut gruber and two other teenagers dressed in the groups uniform the youth had kept their army officerstyle hats on even though they were inside either out of disrespect or ignorance i received your message boys extending his arm in a salute the hitler youth leader said detectiveinspector kohl hail hitler we have identified the man you are seeking he held up the picture of the body found in dresden alley have you now yes sir kohl glanced at günter and saw contradictory feelings in his sons face he was proud to have elevated his status with the youth but wasnt happy that helmut had preempted the restaurant search the inspector wondered if this incident would be a double benefit the identification of the body for him and a lesson about the realities of life among the national socialists for his son the maître d or owner a stocky balding man in a dusty black suit and shabby goldstriped waistcoat saluted kohl when he spoke he was clearly uneasy hitler youth were among the most energetic of denouncers inspector your son and his friends here were inquiring about this individual yes yes and you sir are gerhard klemp i am the manager and have been for sixteen years did this man eat lunch here yesterday please yes he did and almost three days a week he first came in several months ago he said he liked it because we prepare more than just german food kohl wanted the boys to know as little about the murder as possible so he said to his son and the hitler youths ah thank you son thank you helmut he nodded to the others we will take over from here youre a credit to your nation i would do anything for our leader detectiveinspector helmut said in a tone fitting to his declaration good day sir again he lifted his arm kohl watched his sons arm extend similarly and in response the inspector himself gave a sharp national socialist salute hail kohl ignored janssens faint look of amusement at his gesture the youngsters left chattering and laughing they seemed normal for a change boyish and happy free from their usual visage mindless automatons out of fritz langs science fiction film metropolis he caught his sons eye and the boy smiled and waved as the cluster disappeared out the door kohl prayed his decision on his sons behalf was not a mistake günter could so easily be seduced by the group he turned back to klemp and tapped the picture what time did he lunch here yesterday he came in early about eleven just as we were opening he left thirty forty minutes later kohl could see that klemp was troubled by the death but reluctant to express sympathy in case the man turned out to be an enemy of the state he was also very curious but as with most citizens these days was afraid to ask questions about the investigation or to volunteer anything more than he was asked at least he didnt suffer from blindness was he alone yes janssen asked but did you happen to observe him outside to see if he arrived with anyone or perhaps met someone when he left he nodded toward the restaurants large uncurtained windows i didnt see anyone no were there persons he dined with regularly no he was usually by himself and which way did he go after he finished eating yesterday kohl asked jotting it all down in his notebook after touching the pencil tip to his tongue i believe to the south that would be the left the direction of dresden alley what do you know about him kohl asked ach a few things for one i have his address if that helps indeed it does said kohl excitedly after he began coming here regularly i suggested he open an account with us he turned to a file box containing neatly penned cards and wrote down an address on a slip of paper janssen looked at it two blocks from here sir do you know anything else about him not much im afraid he was secretive we spoke rarely it wasnt the language no it was his preoccupation he was usually reading the newspaper or a book or business documents and didnt wish to converse what do you mean by it wasnt the language oh he was an american kohl lifted an eyebrow at janssen he was yes sir the man replied glancing once more at the picture of the dead man and his name mr reginald morgan sir and you are who robert taggert held up a cautionary finger in response to reinhard ernsts question then looked carefully out the window ernst had been standing at when taggert had tackled the colonel a moment before to get him out of the line of sight of the shed where paul schumann was waiting taggert caught a glimpse of the black doorway in the shed and could vaguely make out the muzzle of the mauser easing back and forth no one go outside taggert called to the workers keep away from the windows and the doors he turned back to ernst who sat on a box containing cans of paint several of the laborers had helped him up from the floor and stood nearby taggert had been late arriving at the stadium driving the white van hed had to circle far to the north and west to make certain schumann didnt see him after flashing his identity cards to the guards he had run up the stairs to the press floor to find ernst pausing in front of the window the construction noise was loud and the colonel hadnt heard his shout over the screams of the power saws so the american had sprinted down the hall past a dozen or so astonished workers and knocked ernst away from the window the colonel was cradling his head which had struck the tarpaulincovered floor there was no blood on his scalp and he didnt seem badly hurt though taggerts tackle had stunned him and knocked the wind from his lungs responding to ernsts question taggert said im with the american diplomatic staff in washington dc he proffered his papers a government identification card and an authentic american passport issued in his real name not the forgery in the name of reginald morgan the office of naval intelligence agent hed shot to death in front of paul schumann in dresden alley yesterday and had been impersonating ever since taggert said ive come here to warn you about a plot against your life an assassin is outside now but krupp is baron von bohlen involved krupp taggert feigned surprise and listened as ernst explained about the phone call no that must have been one of the conspirators who called to lure you out he gestured out the door the killer is in one of the supply sheds south of the stadium weve heard hes a russian but dressed in an ss uniform a russian yes yes there was a security alert about such a man in fact there would have been no danger had ernst stayed at the window or stepped out onto the porch the rifle that schumann now held was the same one hed tested at november square yesterday but last night taggert had plugged the barrel of the gun with lead so that if schumann had fired the bullet never would have left the muzzle yet had that happened the american gangster would have known hed been set up and might have escaped even if hed been injured by the exploding rifle our leader could be in danger no taggert said its only you hes after me then ernsts head swiveled my grandson he rose abruptly my grandson is here he could be at risk too we have to tell everyone to stay away from the windows taggert said and to evacuate the area the two men hurried down the hallway is hitler in the pressroom taggert asked he was a few minutes ago oh this was far better than taggert could have hoped for when schumann had reported back in the boardinghouse that hitler and the other leaders would be assembled here hed been ecstatic though hed obscured this reaction of course he now said i need to tell him what weve learned we have to act fast before the assassin escapes they walked into the pressroom the american blinked stunned to find himself among the most powerful men in germany their heads turning to look at him in curiosity the only ones in the room who ignored taggert were two cheerful german shepherd dogs and a cute little boy of about six or seven adolf hitler noticed ernst still holding the back of his head the paint and plaster on his suit alarmed he asked reinhard you are hurt opa the boy ran forward ernst first put his arms around the child and ushered him quickly to the center of the room away from the doors and windows its all right rudy i just took a spill everyone keep back from the windows he gestured to an ss guard take my grandson into the hallway stay with him yes sir the man did as ordered whats happened hitler called ernst replied this man is an american diplomat he tells me theres a russian out there with a rifle in one of the supply sheds south of the stadium himmler nodded to a guard get some men in here now and assemble a detachment downstairs yes my police chief ernst explained about taggert and the german leader approached the american who was nearly breathless with excitement to be in hitlers presence the man was short about the same height as taggert but broader of body and with thicker features a stern frown filled his wan face and he examined the americans papers carefully the eyes of the dictator of germany were surrounded by drooping lids above and bags below but they themselves were every bit the pale but piercing blue that hed heard of this man could mesmerize anyone taggert thought feeling this force himself please my leader may i see himmler asked hitler handed him the documents the man looked them over and asked you speak german yes i do with all respect sir are you armed i am taggert said with the leader and the others here i will take possession of your weapon until we learn what this matter is about of course taggert lifted his jacket and allowed one of the ss men to take the pistol from him hed expected this himmler was after all head of the ss whose primary purpose was guarding hitler and the government leaders himmler told another ss trooper to take a look at the sheds and see if he could observe the purported assassin hurry yes my police chief as he left the pressroom a dozen armed ss guards filed into the room and spread out protecting the assembly taggert turned to hitler and nodded respectfully state chancellorpresident several days ago we learned of a potential plot by the russians nodding himmler said the intelligence we received friday from hamburg about the russian doing some damage hitler waved him silent and nodded for taggert to continue we thought nothing particular of this information we hear it all the time from the damn russians but then we learned some specifics a few hours ago that his target was colonel ernst and that he might be here at the stadium this afternoon i assumed he was examining the stadium with an eye toward shooting the colonel during the games themselves i came here to see for myself and noticed a man slip into a shed south of the stadium and then i learned to my shock that the colonel and the rest of you were here how did he get on the grounds hitler raged an ss uniform and false identity papers we believe taggert explained i was about to step outside ernst said this man saved my life what about krupp the phone call göring asked krupp has nothing to do with this im sure taggert said the call was undoubtedly from a confederate to lure the colonel outside himmler nodded to heydrich who strode to the phone dialed a number and spoke for several moments he looked up no it was not krupp who called unless he now makes his calls from the potsdam plaza post office hitler muttered ominously to himmler why did we not know about this taggert knew that conspiracy paranoia danced constantly in hitlers head he came to himmlers defense saying they were very clever the russians we only learned about it from our sources in moscow by happenstance but please sir we must move quickly if he realizes were onto him hell escape and try again why ernst göring asked meaning taggert supposed why not me taggert directed his response to hitler state leader we understand that colonel ernst is involved in rearmament we are not troubled with that in america we consider germany our greatest european ally and we want you to be militarily strong your countrymen feel this way hitler asked it was well known in diplomatic circles that he was very troubled by the antinazi sentiment in america now able to discard the placid demeanor of reggie morgan taggert spoke with an edge to his voice you dont always get the full story jews talk loudly in your country and in mine and the leftist element are forever whining the press the communists the socialists but theyre a small fraction of the population no our government and the majority of americans are firmly committed to being your ally and seeing you get out from under the yoke of the versailles its the russians who are concerned about your rearming however please sir we have only minutes the assassin the ss guard returned just then its as he said sir there are some sheds beside the parking plaza the door to one is open and yes theres a rifle barrel protruding scanning for a target at the stadium here several of the men in the room gasped and muttered indignation joseph goebbels picked at his ear nervously göring had unholstered his luger and was waving it around comically like a child with a wooden pistol hitlers voice shook and his hands quivered in rage communist jew animals they come to my country and do this to me backstabbers and with our olympics about to start they he was unable to continue his diatribe he was so furious to himmler taggert said i speak russian surround the shed and let me try to convince him to surrender im sure the gestapo or the ss can persuade him to tell us who and where the other conspirators are himmler nodded then turned to hitler my leader it is important that you and the others leave at once by the underground route perhaps there is only the one assassin but perhaps too there are others that this american doesnt know about like everyone whod read the intelligence reports on himmler taggert considered the former fertilizer salesman half insane and an incurable sycophant but the americans role here was clear and he said submissively police chief himmler is correct im not sure how complete our information is go to safety i will help your troops capture the man ernst shook taggerts hand my thanks to you taggert nodded he watched ernst collect his grandson from the corridor and then join the others who took an internal stairway down to the underground driveway surrounded by a squad of guards only when hitler and the others were gone did himmler return taggerts pistol the police chief then called to the ss officer who had arranged the detachment downstairs where are your men the guard explained that two dozen were deployed to the east out of view of the shed himmler said sd leader heydrich and i will remain here and call a general alert for the area bring us that russian hail hitler the guard turned on his heels and hurried down the staircase taggert behind him they jogged to the east side of the stadium joined the troops there and in a wide arc to the south approached the shed the men ran quickly surrounded by the emotionless ss troops amid the sound of gun bolts and toggles snapping bullets into place but despite the apparent tension and drama robert taggert was at ease for the first time in days like the man hed killed in dresden alley reggie morgan taggert was one of those people who exist in the shadows of government and diplomacy and business doing the bidding for their principals in ways sometimes legal and often not one of the few truthful things hed told schumann was his passion for a diplomatic posting either in germany or elsewhere spain would indeed be nice but such plums were not easy to come by and had to be earned often in mad and risky situations such as the plan involving the poor sap paul schumann his instructions from the united states had been simple reggie morgan would have to be sacrificed taggert would kill him and take over his identity he would help paul schumann plan reinhard ernsts death and then at the last moment taggert would dramatically rescue the german colonel proof of how firmly the us supported the national socialists word of the rescue and taggerts comments about that support would trickle up to hitler but as it turned out the results were far far better taggert had actually performed his routine for hitler and göring themselves what happened to schumann was irrelevant whether he died now which would be cleaner and more convenient or was caught and tortured in the latter case schumann would eventually talk and tell an unlikely tale of being hired by the american office of naval intelligence to kill ernst which the germans would instantly dismiss since it was taggert and the americans who turned him in and if he turned out to be a germanamerican gangster and not a russian ah well he mustve been recruited by the russians a simple plan but there had been setbacks from the beginning hed planned to kill morgan several days ago and impersonate him at the first meeting with schumann yesterday but morgan had been a very cautious man and talented at leading a covert life taggert had had no chance to murder him before dresden alley and how tense that had been reggie morgan had had only the old pass phrase not the lines about the tram to alexanderplatz so when hed met schumann in the alley theyd each believed the other was an enemy taggert had managed to kill morgan just in time and convince schumann that he was in fact the american agent thanks to the right pass phrase the forged passport and the accurate description of the senator taggert had also made sure he was the first to go through the dead mans pockets hed pretended to find proof that morgan was a stormtrooper though the document hed showed schumann was in fact simply a card attesting that the bearer had donated a sum to a war veterans relief fund half the people in berlin had such cards since the brownshirts were very adept at soliciting contributions schumann himself had also proved to be a source of concern oh the man was smart far smarter than the thug whom taggert had expected he had a suspicious nature and didnt tip off what he was really thinking taggert had had to watch what he said and did constantly remind himself to be reginald morgan the dogged nondescript civil servant when schumann for instance had insisted they check morgans body for tattoos taggert was horrified the most likely tattoo theyd find would have said us navy or maybe the name of the ship hed served on in the war but fate had smiled the man had never been under the needle now taggert and the blackuniformed troops arrived at the shed he could just see the barrel of the mauser protruding as paul schumann searched for his target the men deployed quietly the senior ss officer directing his soldiers with hand signals taggert was as impressed as ever with the brilliance of german tactical skills closer now closer schumann was preoccupied continuing to scan the balcony behind the press box he would be wondering what had happened why the delay in getting ernst outside had the phone call from webber gone through properly as the ss men circled the shed cutting off any chance of schumanns escape taggert reminded himself that after he was finished here he would have to return to berlin and find otto webber and kill him käthe richter too when the young soldiers were in position around the shed taggert whispered i will go speak to him in russian and get him to surrender the ss commander nodded the american took his pistol from his pocket he was in no danger of course because of the mausers plugged barrel still he moved slowly pretending to be cautious and uneasy keep back he whispered ill go in first the ss nodded eyebrows raised impressed at the americans courage taggert lifted his pistol and stepped toward the doorway the rifle muzzle still eased back and forth schumanns frustration at not finding a target was palpable in a swift motion taggert flung one of the doors open and lifted his pistol applying pressure on the trigger he stepped inside robert taggert gasped a chill ran through him the mauser continued its scan of the stadium moving back and forth slowly the deadly rifle though was gripped not by a wouldbe assassins hands but by lengths of twine torn from packing cartons and tethered to a roof beam paul schumann was gone chapter twentyseven running not his favorite form of exercise by any means though paul often ran laps or jogged in place to get the legs in shape and to work the tobacco and beer and corn whisky out of his system and now he was running like jesse owens running for his life unlike poor max gunned down in the street as he sprinted away from the ss guards paul attracted little notice he was wearing gymnasium clothes and shoes hed stolen from the locker room of the olympic stadiums swimming complex and he looked like any one of the thousands of athletes in and around charlottenburg in training for the games he was about three miles east of the stadium now heading back to berlin pumping hard putting distance between himself and the betrayal which he had yet to figure out he was surprised that reggie morgan if it was morgan had made a careless mistake after going to such elaborate efforts to set him up there were certainly button men who didnt look over their tools every time they were going on a job but that was nuts when you were up against ruthless men always armed you made sure that your own weapons were in perfect shape that nothing was out of kilter in the bakinghot shed paul had mounted the telescopic sight and made sure the calibrations were set to the same numbers as at the pawnshop shooting range then as a final check hed slipped the bolt out of the mauser and sighted up the bore it was blocked he thought at first this was some dirt or creosote from the fiberboard carrying case but paul had found a length of wire and dug inside he looked closely at what he scraped off somebody had poured molten lead down the muzzle if hed fired the barrel might have exploded or the bolt shot backward through pauls cheek the gun had been in morgans possession overnight and was the same weapon paul had noted a unique configuration in the grain when he was sighting it in yesterday so morgan or whoever he might be had clearly sabotaged the gun moving fast hed ripped twine from the cartons in the shed and hung the rifle from the ceiling to make it appear he was still there then slipped outside joining a group of other troopers walking north hed split off from them at the swimming complex found a change of clothing and shoes thrown away the ss uniform and torn up and flushed the russian passport down a toilet now a half hour from the stadium running running sweating fiercely through the thick cloth paul turned off the highway and trotted into a small village center he found a fountain made from an old horse trough and bent to the spigot drinking a quart of the hot rusty water then he bathed his face how far from the city was he probably four miles or so he guessed he saw two officers in green uniforms and tall greenandblack hats stopping a large man demanding his papers he turned casually away from them and walked down side streets deciding it was too risky to continue into berlin on foot he noticed a parking lot rows of cars around a train station paul found an openair dkw and making sure he was out of sight used a rock and a broken branch to knock the key lock into the dashboard he fished underneath for the wires using his teeth he cut through the cloth insulation and twined the copper strands together he pushed the starter button the engine ground for a moment but didnt catch grimacing he realized hed forgotten to set the choke he adjusted it to rich and tried again the engine fired to life and sputtered and he adjusted the knob until it was running smoothly it took a moment to figure out the gears but soon he was easing east through the narrow streets of the town wondering whod sold him out and why had it been money politics some other reason but at the moment he could find no hint of the answers to those questions escaping occupied all his thoughts he shoved the accelerator to the floor and turned onto a broad immaculate highway passing a sign that assured him that the city center of berlin was six kilometers away modest quarters off bremer street in the northwest portion of town typical of many dwellings in this neighborhood reginald morgans was in a gloomy stone fourflat that dated from the second empire though this particular structure summoned up no prussian glory whatsoever willi kohl and his inspector candidate climbed from the dkw they heard more sirens and glanced up to see a truck of ss troops speeding along the roads yet another installment of the secret security alert even more extensive than earlier it seemed with random roadblocks now being set up throughout the city kohl and janssen themselves were stopped the ss guard glanced with disdain at the kripo id and waved them through he didnt respond to the inspectors query about what was happening and merely snapped move along kohl now rang the bell beside the thick front door the inspector tapped his foot with impatience as they waited two lengthy rings later a stocky landlady in a dark dress and apron opened the door eyes wide at the sight of two stern men in suits hail hitler im sorry sirs that i didnt get here sooner but my legs arent inspector kohl with the kripo he showed his identity card so the woman would relax somewhat at least they were not gestapo do you know this man janssen displayed the photo taken in dresden alley ach thats mr morgan who lives here he doesnt look is he dead yes he is god in heav the politically questionable phrase died in her mouth wed like to see his rooms yes sir of course sir follow me they walked into a courtyard so overwhelmingly bleak kohl thought that it would sadden even mozarts irrepressible papageno the woman rocked back and forth as she walked she said breathlessly i always thought him a little strange to tell the truth sirs this was served up with careful glances at kohl to make it clear that she was no confederate of morgans in case hed been killed by the national socialists themselves and yet that his behavior wasnt so suspicious that she should have denounced him herself we havent seen him for a whole day he went out just before lunch yesterday and he never returned they went through another locked door at the end of the courtyard and up two flights of stairs which reeked of onion and pickle how long had he lived here kohl asked three months he paid for six in advance and tipped me her voice faded but not much the rooms were furnished yes sir any visitors you recall none that i knew of none that i let into the building show her the drawing janssen he displayed the picture of paul schumann have you seen this man no sir is he dead too she added abruptly i mean sir no ive never seen him kohl looked into her eyes they were evasive but with fear not deception and he believed her under questioning she told him that morgan was a businessman he took no phone calls here and picked up his mail at the post office she didnt know if he had an office elsewhere he never said anything specific about his job leave us now hail hitler she replied and scurried off like a mouse kohl looked around the room so you see how i made an incorrect deduction janssen how is that sir i assumed mr morgan was german because he wore clothes made of hitler cloth but not all foreigners are wealthy enough to live on under the lindens and to buy topoftheline at kadewe though that is our impression janssen thought for a moment thats true sir but there could be another reason he wore ersatz clothes that he wished to masquerade as a german yes sir good janssen though perhaps he wanted not so much to masquerade as one of us but more to not draw attention to himself but either makes him suspicious now lets see if we can make our mystery less mysterious start with the closets the inspector candidate opened a door and began his examination of the contents kohl himself chose the less demanding search and eased into a creaking chair to look through the documents on morgans desk the american had been it seemed a middleman of sorts providing services for a number of us companies in germany for a commission he would match an american buyer with a german seller and vice versa when american businessmen came to town morgan would be hired to entertain them and arrange meetings with german representatives from borsig bata shoes siemens ig farben opel dozens of others there were several pictures of morgan and documents confirming his identity but it was curious kohl thought that there were no truly personal effects no family photographs no mementos perhaps he was somebodys brother and maybe somebodys husband or lover and if he was lucky he was a father of sons and daughters i would hope too that there are past lovers who think of him occasionally kohl considered the implications of this absence of personal information did it mean he was a loner or was there another reason for keeping his personal life secret janssen dug through the closet and is there anything in particular i ought to be looking for sir embezzled money a married mistresss handkerchief a letter of extortion a note from a pregnant teenager any of the indicia of motive that might explain why poor mr morgan had died brutally on the immaculate cobblestones of dresden alley look for anything that enlightens us in any way regarding the case i can describe it no better than that it is the hardest part of being a detective use your instinct use your imagination yes sir kohl continued his own examination of the desk a moment later janssen called look at this sir mr morgan has some pictures of naked women they were in a box here are they commercially made or did he take them himself no they are postcards sir he bought them somewhere yes yes then they do not interest us janssen you must discern between the times that a mans vices are relevant and when they are not and i promise you voluptuous postcards are not presently important please continue your search some men grow calm in direct proportion to their desperation such men are rare and they are particularly dangerous because while their ruthlessness is not diminished they are never careless robert taggert was one such man he was livid that some goddamn button man from brooklyn had outthought him had jeopardized his future but he was not going to let emotion cloud his judgment he knew how schumann had figured things out there was a piece of wire on the floor of the shed and bits of lead next to it of course hed checked the bore of the gun and found it plugged taggert thought angrily why the hell didnt i empty the powder out of his shells and recrimp the bullets back into the brass casing thered have been no danger to ernst that way and schumann never would have figured out the betrayal until it was too late and the ss troops were around the shed but he reflected the matter wasnt hopeless after a second brief meeting in the olympic pressroom with himmler and heydrich during which he told them he knew little more of the plot than what hed already explained he left the stadium telling the germans that he would contact washington at once and see if they had more details taggert left them both muttering about jewish and russian conspiracies he was surprised hed been allowed out of the stadium without being detained his arrest would not have been logical but was certainly a risk in a country topheavy with suspicion and paranoia taggert now considered his quarry paul schumann was not stupid of course hed been set up to be a russian and hed know that was whom the germans would be looking for hed have ditched his fake identity by now and be an american again but taggert preferred not to tell the germans that it would be better to produce the dead russian along with his confederates a gangring criminal and a woman dissident käthe richter undoubtedly had some kosisympathizing friends adding to the credibility of the russian assassin scenario desperate yes but as he steered the white van south over the stormtrooperbrown canal then east he remained calm as stone he parked on a busy street and climbed out there was no doubt that schumann would return to the boardinghouse for käthe richter hed adamantly insisted on taking the woman with him back to america which meant that even now he wasnt going to leave her behind taggert also knew that hed come in person not call her schumann knew the dangers of tapped phones in germany continuing quickly through the streets feeling the comforting bump of the pistol against his hip he turned the corner and proceeded into magdeburger alley he paused and examined the short street carefully it seemed deserted dusty in the afternoon heat he casually walked past käthe richters boardinghouse and then sensing no threat returned quickly and descended to the basement entrance he shouldered open the door then slipped into the dank cellar taggert climbed the wooden stairs keeping to the sides of the steps to minimize the creaks he came to the top eased the doorway open and pulling the pistol from his pocket stepped out into the groundfloor hallway empty no sounds no movement other than the frantic buzzing of a huge fly trapped between two panes of glass he walked the length of the corridor listening at each door hearing nothing finally he returned to the door on which hung a crudely painted sign that read landlady he knocked miss richter he wondered what she looked like it had been the real reginald morgan whod arranged for these rooms for schumann and apparently theyd never met she and morgan had spoken on the phone and exchanged a letter of agreement and cash through the pneumatic delivery system that crisscrossed berlin another rap on the door ive come about a room the front door was open no response he tried the door it was not locked he slipped inside and noted a suitcase resting open on the bed clothes and books around it this reassured him it meant schumann hadnt returned yet where was she though perhaps she wanted to collect money she was owed or more likely borrow what she could from friends and family emigrating from germany through proper channels meant leaving with nothing more than clothes and pocket money thinking shed be leaving illegally with schumann shed get as much cash as she could the radio was on the lights shed be back soon taggert noticed next to the door a rack containing keys for all the rooms he found the set to schumanns and stepped into the corridor again he walked quietly up the hall in a swift motion he unlocked the door pushed inside and lifted his pistol the living room was empty he locked the door then stepped silently into the bedroom schumann was not here though his suitcase was taggert stood in the middle of the room debating schumann was sentimental perhaps in his concern for the woman but he was a thorough professional before he entered he would look through the windows in the front and back to see if anybody was here taggert decided to lie in wait he settled on the only realistic option the closet hed leave the door open an inch or two so he could hear schumann enter when the button man was in the midst of packing his bag taggert would slip out of the closet and kill him if he was lucky käthe richter would be with him and he could murder her as well if not hed wait in her room she might arrive first of course in which case he could kill her then or wait until schumann returned hed have to consider which was best hed then scour the rooms to make certain that there was no trace of schumanns real identity and call the ss and gestapo to let them know that the russian had been stopped taggert stepped inside the large closet swung the door nearly shut and undid his top several shirt buttons to alleviate the terrible heat he breathed deeply sucking air into his aching lungs sweat dotted his forehead and prickled the skin in the pits of his arms but that mattered not one iota robert taggert was wholly sustained no intoxicated by an element far better than damp oxygen the euphoria of power the boy from low gray hartford the boy beaten simply because he was a sharper thinker but a slower runner than the others in his low gray neighborhood had just met adolf hitler himself the most savvy politician on the face of the earth he had seen the mans searing blue eyes regard him with admiration and respect a respect that would soon be echoed in america when he returned home and reported about the success of his mission ambassador to england to spain yes even here eventually the country he loved he could go anywhere he wished wiping his face again he wondered how long he would have to wait for schumann to return the answer to that question came just a moment later taggert heard the front door of the boardinghouse open and heavy footsteps in the hall they continued past this room there was a knocking käthe came the distant voice it was paul schumann speaking would he go inside her apartment to wait no the footsteps returned in this direction taggert heard the jangle of the key the squeak of old hinges and then a click as the door closed paul schumann had walked into the room where he would die chapter twentyeight heart pounding like any hunter close to his prey robert taggert listened carefully käthe schumanns voice called morgan heard the creak of boards the sound of water running in the sink the gulp of a man drinking thirstily taggert lifted his pistol it would be better to shoot him in the chest front on as if hed been attacking the ss would want him alive of course to interrogate him and wouldnt be happy if taggert shot the man in the back still he could take no chances schumann was too large and too dangerous to confront facetoface hed tell himmler that hed had no choice the assassin had tried to escape or grab a knife taggert had been forced to shoot him he heard the man walk to the bedroom and a moment later the sounds of rummaging through drawers as he filled his suitcase now he thought taggert pushed one of the two closet doors open further this gave him a view of the bedroom he raised the pistol but schumann wasnt visible taggert could see only the suitcase on the bed and scattered around it were some books and other objects then he frowned looking at a pair of shoes sitting in the bedroom doorway they hadnt been there before oh no taggert realized that schumann had walked to the bedroom but had then slipped off his shoes and eased back into the living room in stocking feet hed been pitching books through the doorway onto the bed to make taggert think he was still there that meant the huge fist crashed through the closet door as if it were spun sugar the knuckles struck taggert in the neck and jaw and he saw searing red in his vision as he staggered into the living room he dropped the pistol and grabbed his throat pressing the agonized flesh schumann gripped taggert by the lapels and flung him across the room he crashed into a table and fell to the floor where he lay crumpled like the german bisque doll that had landed beside him unbroken staring at the ceiling with her eerie violet eyes youre a ringer right youre not reggie morgan paul didnt bother to explain that hed done what every smart button man has to do memorize the appearance of a room when he left it and then match that memory with what the place looks like when he returned hed seen the closet door which hed left closed was open a few inches knowing that taggert would have to track him down and kill him he knew thats where the man was hiding i who paul growled when the man said nothing paul took him by the collar with one hand and with the other emptied his jacket pocket a wallet a number of american passports a us diplomatic identity card in the name of robert taggert and the stormtrooper card hed flashed at paul in the alley when theyd met dont move paul muttered then examined the find the wallet was reginald morgans it contained an id card some business cards with his name and an address on bremer street in berlin and one in washington dc there were several photographs too all depicting the man whod been killed in dresden alley one photo had been taken at a social function he stood between an elderly man and woman his arms around them both all smiling at the kodak one of the passports well used and filled with entry and exit stamps was in morgans name it too contained a picture of the man from the alley another passport the one hed showed paul yesterday also contained the name reginald morgan but the picture was of the man in front of him now he held it under a lamp and examined the document closely it seemed phony a second passport which seemed genuine contained dozens of stamps and visas and was in the name of robert taggert like the diplomatic id card the two remaining passports a us one in the name of robert gardner and a german one in the name of artur schmidt had pictures of the man here so this guy on the floor in front of him had killed his contact in berlin and taken over his identity paul understood okay whats the game just settle down buddy dont do anything stupid the man had dropped the stiff reggie morgan persona the one who emerged was slick like one of lucky lucianos sharkskinsuited manhattan underbosses paul held up the passport he thought was genuine thiss you taggert right the man pressed his jaw and neck where paul had hit him and rubbed the reddened area you got me paulio howd it work he frowned you intercepted the pass codes about the tram right thats why morgan did a doubletake in the alley he thought i was the rat because i flubbed the phrase about the tram same as i thought about him then you swapped documents when you were searching the body paul read the stormtrooper card veterans relief crap he snapped furious he hadnt looked at it more closely when taggert had first flashed it at him who the hell are you mister a businessman i just do odd jobs for people and you got picked because you looked a little like the real reggie morgan this offended him i got picked because im good what about max he was legit morgan paid him a hundred marks to get him the wire on ernst then i paid him two hundred to pretend i was morgan paul nodded thats why the sap was so nervous it wasnt the ss he was afraid of it was me but the history of the deception seemed to bore taggert he continued impatiently weve got some horse trading to do my friend now what was the point of this paulio we dont exactly have time for chats dont you think half the gestapos looking for you no taggert if im understanding this right thanks to you theyre looking for some russian they dont even know what i look like and you wouldnt lead em back here at least not until after youd killed me so weve got all the time in the world now spill this is about bigger things than you and me buddy taggert moved his jaw in a slow circle you fucking loosened my teeth tell me its not paul stepped closer closing his hand into a fist okay okay calm down big guy you want to know the truth heres the lowdown therere a lot of people back home that dont want to get into another fight over here thats what im doing for gods sake stopping the rearmament actually we dont give a fig about hun rearmament what we care about is keeping hitler happy get it show him the us is on his side paul finally understood so i was the easter lamb you set me up as a russian killer and then you rat me out so it looks to hitler like the us is his good pal is that it taggert nodded pretty much on the money paulio are you goddamn blind paul said dont you see what hes doing here how can anybody be on their side christ schumann whats the hitch maybe hitler takes over part of poland austria the sudetenland he laughed hell he can even have france no skin off our nose hes murdering people doesnt anybody see that just a few jews what are you hearing what youre saying taggert held up his hands look i dont mean it like that things here are only temporary the nazisre like kids with a new toy their country theyll get tired of this aryan crap before the year is out hitlers all talk hell calm down and realize eventually that he needs jews no paul said emphatically youre wrong there hitlers nuts hes bugsy siegel times a thousand well okay paulio its not for you or me to decide stuff like that lets concede you caught us we tried to pull a fast one and good for you you tumbled to it but you need me buddyboy youre not getting out of this country without my help so heres what were going to do lets you and me find some russianlooking sap kill him and call the gestapo nobodys seen you ill even let you play the hero you can meet hitler and göring get a goddamn medal you and the broad can go back home and ill sweeten the pot ill throw some business to your friend webber black market dollars hed love it hows that sound i can make it happen and everybody wins or you can die here paul asked ive got one question was it bull gordon was he behind it him naw he wasnt part of it it was other interests what the hell does that mean interests i want an answer sorry paulio i didnt get to where i am now by having a loose tongue nature of the business you know youre as bad as the nazis yeah taggert muttered and whore you to talk button man he stood up dusting his jacket off so whatta you say lets find ourselves some slav hobo cut his throat and give the huns their bolshevik lets do it everybody wins without shifting his weight without narrowing his eyes without giving any hint of what he was about to do paul drove his fist directly into the mans chest taggerts eyes snapped wide as his breath stopped he never even glanced toward pauls left fist as it shot forward and crushed his throat by the time taggert dropped to the floor his extremities were shivering in death throes and a rattle echoed from his wideopen mouth whether it was a ruptured heart or a broken neck that killed him he was dead within thirty seconds paul stared down at the body for a long moment hands shaking not from the powerful blows but from the fury within him at the betrayal and at the mans words he can even have france just a few jews paul hurried into the bedroom stripped off the sweat clothes hed stolen at the stadium sponged off with water from the basin in the bedroom and dressed he heard a knocking on the door ah käthe had returned he realized suddenly that taggerts body still lay visible in the living room he hurried out to move the corpse into the bedroom just as he was bending down to drag it into the closet though the front door to the apartment opened paul looked up it hadnt been käthe knocking he found himself staring at two men one was round mustachioed wearing a wrinkled creamcolored suit with a waistcoat a panama hat was in his hand a slim younger man in a dark suit stood beside him gripping a black automatic pistol no it was the very same cops whod been dogging him since yesterday he sighed and slowly stood ach at last is mr paul schumann said the older man in heavily accented english blinking in surprise i am detectiveinspector kohl you are under arrest sir for the murder of reginald morgan in dresden alley yesterday he glanced down at taggerts body and added and now it seems for the murder of someone else as well chapter twentynine keep your hands still yes yes please mr schumann keep them raised the american was quite large kohl observed easily four inches taller than the inspector himself and broad the street artists rendering had been accurate but the mans face was marred with more scars than in the sketch and the eyes well they were a soft blue cautious yet serene janssen see if that man is indeed dead kohl said returning to german he covered schumann with his own pistol the young detective leaned down and examined the figure though there was little doubt in kohls mind he was looking at a corpse the young officer nodded and stood up willi kohl was as shocked as he was pleased to find schumann here hed never expected this just twenty minutes before in reginald morgans room on bremer street the inspector had found a letter of confirmation taking rooms in this boardinghouse on behalf of paul schumann but kohl was sure that after hed killed morgan schumann would have been smarter than to remain in the residence his victim had arranged for him he and janssen had sped here in hopes of finding some witnesses or evidence that might lead to schumann but hardly the american himself so are you one of those gestapo police schumann asked in german indeed as the witnesses had reported he had just a trace of accent the g was that of a born berliner no we are with the criminal police he displayed his identification card janssen search him the young officer expertly patted every place that a pocket obvious or secret might be the inspector candidate discovered his us passport money comb matches and a pack of cigarettes janssen handed everything over to kohl who told his assistant to handcuff schumann he then flipped open the passport and examined it carefully it appeared authentic paul john schumann i didnt kill reggie morgan he did a nod toward the body his name is taggert robert taggert he tried to kill me too thats why we were fighting kohl wasnt sure that fighting was the right word to describe a confrontation between this tall american with red calloused knuckles and huge arms and the victim who had the physique of joseph goebbels fight he pulled a gun on me schumann nodded toward a pistol lying on the floor i had to defend myself our spanish star modelo a sir janssen said excitedly the murder weapon the same type of gun as the murder weapon kohl thought a bullet comparison would tell if it was the same gun or not but he would not correct a colleague even a junior one in front of a suspect janssen draped a handkerchief around the weapon picked it up and noted the serial number kohl licked his pencil jotted the number into his notebook and asked janssen for the list of people who had bought such guns supplied by police precincts around town the young man produced it from his briefcase now get the fingerprint kit from the car and print the gun and our friends here both the live one and the dead one yes sir he stepped outside the inspector flipped through the names on the list seeing no schumann try taggert the american said or one of those names he nodded toward a stack of passports sitting on the table he had those on him please you may sit the inspector helped the cuffed schumann onto the couch hed never had a suspect assist him in an investigation before but kohl picked up the stack of passports that schumann suggested might be revealing and indeed they were one passport was reginald morgans the man killed in dresden alley it was clearly authentic the others contained pictures of the man lying at their feet but were issued in different names one could not be a criminal investigator in national socialist germany these days without being familiar with forged documents of the others only the passport in the name of robert taggert seemed genuine to kohl and was the only one filled with apparently legitimate stamps and visas he compared all the names with those on the list of gun purchasers he stopped at one entry janssen appeared in the doorway with the fingerprint kit and the leica kohl held up the list it seems the deceased did buy the modelo a last month janssen under the name of artur schmidt which still didnt preclude schumann from being morgans killer taggert might simply have given or sold him the gun proceed with the fingerprinting kohl instructed the young officer opened the briefcase and began his task i didnt kill reggie morgan im telling you he did please say nothing now mr schumann reginald morgans wallet was also here kohl looked through it he paused and looked at the picture of the man at a social event standing with two older people we know something else about him that he was somebodys son and perhaps he was somebodys brother and maybe somebodys husband or lover the inspector candidate proceeded to dust powder on the gun and then took taggerts prints the young man said to schumann sir if you could sit forward please kohl approved of his protégés polite tone schumann cooperated and the young man printed him then wiped the ink off his fingers with the astringent cleaner that was included in the kit janssen placed the gun and the two printed cards on a table for his bosss inspection sir kohl pulled out his monocle he examined the weapon and the mens prints closely he was no expert but his opinion was that the only prints on the pistol were taggerts janssens eyes narrowed and he nodded to the floor kohl followed the glance a battered leather bag there ah the telltale satchel kohl walked over and opened the clasp he leafed through the contents deciphering the english as best he could there were many notes about berlin sports the olympics a press pass in the name of paul schumann dozens of innocuous clippings from american newspapers so the inspector thought hes been lying the bag placed him at the murder scene but as kohl examined it carefully he noted that while it was old yes the leather was supple not flaking then he glanced at the body in front of them kohl set the case down and crouched over the dead mans shoes they were brown worn and shedding bits of leather the color and shine were just like the ones theyd found on the cobblestones of dresden alley and on the floor of the summer garden restaurant schumanns shoes were not shedding such flakes the inspectors face twisted in irritation at himself another erroneous assumption schumann had been telling the truth perhaps search him now janssen kohl said rising a nod toward the body the inspector candidate dropped to his knees and began examining the corpse carefully kohl lifted an eyebrow at janssen who continued the search he found money a penknife a packet of cigarettes a pocket watch on a heavy gold chain then the young man frowned look sir he handed the inspector some silk clothing labels undoubtedly cut from the garments reginald morgan had worn in dresden alley they bore the names of german clothing manufacturers or stores ill tell you what happened schumann said yes yes you may talk in a minute janssen contact headquarters have someone there get in touch with the american embassy ask about this robert taggert tell them hes in possession of a diplomatic identity card say nothing about his death at this time yes sir janssen located the phone which kohl noted was disconnected from the wall a common sight nowadays the olympic flag on the building unaccompanied by the national socialist banner told him the place was owned or managed by a jew or someone else in disfavor the phones might be tapped call from the wireless in the dkw janssen the inspector candidate nodded and left the room again now sir you may enlighten me and please spare me no details schumann said in german i came over here with the olympic team im a sportswriter a freelance journalist do you yes yes i am familiar with the term i was supposed to meet reggie morgan and hed introduce me to some people for the stories i wanted what we call color information about the livelier parts of the city gamblers hustlers boxing clubs and this reggie morgan did what as a profession i mean he was just an american businessman id heard about hed lived here for a few years and knew the place pretty well kohl pointed out you came over with the olympic team and yet theyseemed unwilling to tell me anything about you thats curious dont you think schumann laughed bitterly you live in this country and you ask me why anyone would be reluctant to answer a policemans questions it is a matter of state security willi kohl allowed no expression to cross his face but he was momentarily embarrassed at the truth of this comment he regarded schumann closely the american appeared at ease kohl could detect no signs of fabrication which was one of the inspectors particular talents continue i was to meet with morgan yesterday that would have been when and where around noon outside a beer hall on spener street right next to dresden alley kohl reflected and around the time of the shooting surely if he had something to hide he would not place himself near the scene of the killing or would he the national socialist criminals were by and large stupid and obvious kohl sensed he was in the presence of a very smart man though whether he was a criminal or not the inspector could not tell but as you contend the real reginald morgan did not show up it was this taggert thats right though i didnt know it at the time he claimed he was morgan and what happened at this meeting it was very brief he was agitated he pulled me into this alley said something had come up and i was supposed to meet him later at a restaurant the name the summer garden where the wheat beer was not to your liking schumann blinked then replied is it to anyones liking kohl refrained from smiling and you met taggert again as planned at the summer garden thats right a friend of his joined us there i dont recall his name ah the laborer he whispered something to taggert who looked worried and said we ought to beat it a frown at the literal german translation of what would be an english idiom i mean leave quickly this friend thought there were some gestapo or something around and taggert agreed we slipped out the side door i shouldve guessed then that something wasnt right but it was kind of an adventure you know thats just what i was looking for for my stories local color kohl said slowly reflecting that it is so much easier to make a big lie believable when the liar feeds you small truths and did you meet this taggert at any other times a nod toward the body other than today of course kohl wondered if the man would admit going to november square yes schumann said some square later that day a bad neighborhood near oranienburger station by a big statue of hitler we were going to meet some other contact but that guy never showed up and you beat it from there as well thats right taggert got spooked again it was clear something was off thats when i decided i better cut things off with the guy what happened kohl asked quickly to your stetson hat a concerned look well ill be honest detective kohl i was walking down the street and saw some young a hesitation as he sought a word beasts toughs yes yes thugs in brown uniforms stormtroopers thugs schumann said with some disgust they were beating up a bookseller and his wife i thought these men were going to kill them i stopped them the next thing i knew there were a dozen of them after me i threw some clothes away down the sewer so they wouldnt recognize me this is a wiry man kohl thought and clever are you going to arrest me for beating up some of your nazi thugs that doesnt interest me mr schumann but what does very much interest me is the purpose of this whole masquerade orchestrated by mr taggert he was trying to fix some of the olympic events fix the american thought for a moment to have a player lose intentionally thats what hed been doing here over the past several months putting together gambling pools in berlin taggerts colleagues were going to place bets against some of the american favorites i have a press pass and can get close to the athletes i was supposed to bribe them to lose on purpose thats why he was so nervous for the past couple days i guess he owed some of your gang rings he called them a lot of money morgan was killed because this taggert wished to impersonate him thats right quite an elaborate plot kohl observed quite a lot of money was involved hundreds of thousands of dollars another glance at the limp body on the floor i noted that you said you decided to end your relationship with mr taggert as of yesterday and yet here he is how did this tragic fight as you call it transpire he wouldnt take no for an answer he was desperate for the money hed borrowed a lot to place the bets he came here today to threaten me he said they were going to make it look like i killed morgan to extort you into helping them thats right but i said i didnt care i was going to turn him in anyway he pulled that gun on me we struggled and he fell it seems he broke his neck kohls mind instinctively applied the information schumann had provided against the facts and the inspectors awareness of human nature some details fit some were jarring willi kohl always reminded himself to keep an open mind at crime scenes refrain from reaching conclusions too quickly now this process happened automatically his thoughts were deadlocked it was as if a punch card had jammed in one of the dehomag sorting machines you fought to save yourself and he died in a fall a womans voice said yes that is exactly what happened kohl turned to the figure in the doorway she was about forty slim and attractive though her face was tired troubled please your name käthe richter she automatically handed her card to him i manage this building in the owners absence her papers confirmed her identity and he returned the id and you were a witness to this event i was here in the hallway i heard some disturbance from inside and opened the door partway i saw the whole thing and yet you were gone when we arrived i was afraid i saw your car pull up i didnt want to get involved so she was on a gestapo or sd list and yet here you are i debated for some moments i took the chance that there are still some policemen in this city who are interested in the truth she said this defiantly janssen stepped inside he eyed the woman but kohl said nothing about her yes the inspector asked sir the american embassy said they have no knowledge of a robert taggert kohl nodded as he continued to ponder the information he stepped closer to taggerts body and said quite a fortuitous fall fortuitous from your perspective of course and you miss richter ill ask you again you saw the struggle firsthand you must be honest with me yes yes that man had a gun he was going to kill mr schumann do you know the victim no i dont ive never seen him kohl glanced again at the body then tucked his thumb into his vest watch pocket its a curious business being a detective mr schumann we try to read the clues and follow where they lead and in this case the clues put me on your trail indeed they led me here directly to you and now it seems those very same clues suggest that it was actually this other man i have been seeking all along lifes funny sometimes the phrase made no sense in german kohl assumed it was a translation of an american idiom but he deduced the meaning which he certainly could not dispute he took his pipe from his pocket and without lighting it slipped it into his mouth and chewed on the stem for a moment well mr schumann i have decided not to detain you not at this moment i will let you leave though i will retain your passport while i look into these matters in more depth do not leave berlin as you have probably seen our various authorities are quite adept at locating people in our country now im afraid you will have to quit the boardinghouse its a crime scene do you have another place to stay where i can contact you schumann thought for a moment ill get a room at the hotel metropol kohl wrote this down in his notebook and pocketed the mans passport very well sir now is there anything else you wish to tell me not a thing inspector ill cooperate however i can you may leave now take only your necessities uncuff him janssen the inspector candidate did so schumann walked to his suitcase as kohl watched carefully he packed a shaving kit with a razor shaving soap toothbrush and dental cream the inspector handed him back his cigarettes matches money and comb schumann glanced at the woman can you walk me to the tram stop yes of course kohl asked miss richter you live here in the building the back apartment on this floor yes very well ill be in touch with you as well together they walked out the door after they had gone janssen frowned and said sir how can you let him go did you believe his story some of it enough to allow me to release him temporarily kohl explained to the inspector candidate his concerns he believed that the killing here had been in selfdefense and it did indeed appear that taggert was the killer of reginald morgan but there remained unanswered questions if they had been in any other country kohl would have detained schumann until he verified everything but he knew that if he now ordered the man held while he investigated further the gestapo would peremptorily declare the american to be the guilty foreigner himmler wanted and hed be in moabit prison or oranienburg camp by nightfall not only would a man die for a crime he probably did not commit but the case will be declared closed and well never find the complete truth which is of course the whole point of our job but shouldnt i at least follow him kohl sighed janssen how many criminals have we ever apprehended by following them what do they say in the american crime shockers shadowing well none i would guess but so we will leave that to fictional detectives we know where we can find him but the metropol is a huge hotel with many exits he could escape from us easily there that does not interest us janssen well continue to look into mr schumanns role in this drama shortly our priority now though is to examine the room here carefully ach congratulations inspector candidate why is that sir you have solved the dresden alley murder he nodded toward the body and whats more the perpetrator is dead we need not be inconvenienced by a trial chapter thirty accompanied by an ss bodyguard colonel reinhard ernst had taken rudy back home to charlottenburg he was grateful for the boys young age the child hadnt completely understood the peril at the stadium the grim faces of the men the urgency in the pressroom and the fast drive away from the complex had been troubling to him but he could not fathom the significance of the events all he knew was that his opa had fallen and hurt himself slightly even though his grandfather had made light of the adventure as he called it the highlights of the afternoon for the boy in fact had not been the magnificent stadium nor meeting some of the most powerful men in the world nor the alarm over the assassin it had been the dogs rudy now wanted one himself preferably two he talked endlessly about the animals construction everywhere ernst muttered to gertrud ive ruined my suit true she wasnt pleased but she was more troubled that hed taken a fall she examined his head closely you have a bump you must be more careful reinie ill bring you ice for it he hated to be less than honest with her but he simply would not tell her that hed been the target of an assassin if shed learned that she would implore him to stay home no insist and he would have to refuse as he rarely did with his wife hitler may have buried himself beneath corpses during the november rebellion to remain out of harms way but ernst would never avoid an enemy when his duty required otherwise under different circumstances yes he might have remained home for a day or two until the assassin was found which surely he would be now that the great mechanism of the gestapo sd and ss was in motion but ernst had a vital matter to attend to today conducting the tests at the college with doctorprofessor keitel and preparing the memo about the waltham study for the leader he now asked to have the housekeeper bring him some coffee bread and sausage in the den but reinie gertrud said exasperated its sunday the goose afternoon meals on the day of rest were a long tradition in the ernst household not to be broken if at all possible im sorry my dear i have no choice next week i will spend the entire weekend with you and the family he walked into the den and sat at his desk then began jotting notes ten minutes later gertrud herself appeared carrying a large tray i wont have you eating a coarse meal she said lifting the cloth off the tray he smiled and looked over the huge plate of roast goose with orange marmalade cabbage boiled potatoes and green beans with cardamon he rose and kissed her on the cheek she left him and as he ate without much appetite he began to peck out a draft of the memo on his typewriter highest confidentiality adolf hitler leader state chancellor and president of the german nation and commander of the armed forces field marshal werner von blomberg state minister of defense my leader and my minister you have asked for details of the waltham study being conducted by myself and doctorprofessor ludwig keitel of waltham military college i am pleased to describe the nature of the study and the results so far this study arises out of my instructions from you to make ready the german armed forces and to help them achieve most expeditiously the goals of our great nation as you have set forth he paused and organized his thoughts what to share and what not to share a half hour later he finished the pageandahalf document made a few penciled corrections this draft would do for now he would have keitel read the document as well and make corrections then ernst would retype the final version tonight and personally deliver it to the leader tomorrow he wrote a note to keitel asking for his comments and clipped it to the draft carrying the tray downstairs he said goodbye to gertrud then left hitler had insisted that guards be stationed outside his house at least until the assassin was caught ernst had no objection to this but he now asked that they remain out of sight so as not to alarm his family he also acquiesced to the leaders demand that he not drive himself in his open mercedes as he preferred but be driven in a closed auto by an armed ss bodyguard they drove first to columbia house at tempelhof the driver climbed out and looked around to make sure the entry area was safe he walked to the other two guards stationed in front of the door spoke with them and they looked around too though ernst couldnt imagine anyone being so foolish as to attempt an assassination in front of an ss detention center after a moment they waved and ernst climbed out of the car he stepped through the front door and was led down the stairs through several locked doors and then into the cell area walking down the long hallway again hot and dank stinking of urine and shit what a disgusting way to treat people he thought the british american and french soldiers hed captured during the war had been treated with respect ernst had saluted the officers chatted with the enlisted men made sure they were warm and dry and fed he now felt a burst of contempt for the brownuniformed jailer who accompanied him down the corridor softly whistling the horst wessel song and occasionally banging on bars with his truncheon simply to frighten the prisoners when they came to a cell threequarters of the way down the corridor ernst stopped looked inside his skin itching in the heat the two fischer brothers were drenched with sweat they were frightened of course everyone was frightened in this terrible place but he saw something else in their eyes youthful defiance ernst was disappointed the look told him they were going to reject his offer theyd chosen a spell in oranienburg hed thought for certain that kurt and hans would agree to participate in the waltham study they would have been perfect good afternoon the older one nodded ernst felt a strange chill the boy resembled his own son why hadnt he noticed it before perhaps it was the selfconfidence and the serenity that hadnt been there this morning perhaps it was just the lingering aftermath of the look in young rudys eyes earlier in any case the similarity unnerved him i need your answer now regarding your participation in our study the brothers looked at each other kurt began to speak but it was the younger one who said we will do it so hed been wrong ernst smiled and nodded genuinely pleased the older brother then added provided you let us send a letter to england a letter we wish to communicate with our parents that is not allowed im afraid but youre a colonel right arent you someone who can decide whats allowed and what isnt hans asked ernst cocked his head and examined the boy but his attention returned to the older brother the resemblance to mark was indeed uncanny he hesitated then said one letter but you must send it in the next two days while youre under my supervision your training sergeants wont permit it not a letter to london they are definitely not someone who can decide whats allowed and what isnt another glance passed between the boys kurt nodded the colonel did too and then he saluted them just as hed said goodbye to his son not with a fascist extended arm but in a traditional gesture lifting his flat palm to his forehead which the sa guard pretended not to notice welcome to the new germany ernst said in a voice that was close to a whisper and belied the crisp salute they turned the corner and headed for lützow plaza putting as much distance between them and the boardinghouse as possible before they found a taxi paul looking back often to make sure they werent being followed we arent staying at the metropol he said gazing up and down the street ill find someplace safe my friend otto can do that im sorry but youll have to just leave everything back there you cant go back again on the busy street corner they stopped absently his arm slipped around käthes waist as he looked into traffic but he felt her stiffen then she pulled away he glanced down at her frowning i am going back paul she spoke in a voice that was devoid of emotion käthe whats wrong i was telling the truth to the kripo inspector you i was outside the door looking in you were the one who lied you murdered that man in the room there was no fight he didnt have a gun he was standing there helpless and you hit him and killed him it was horrible i havent seen anything so horrible since since the fourth square from the grass paul was silent an open truck drove past a half dozen stormtroopers were in the back they shouted out something to a group of people on the street laughing some of the pedestrians waved back the truck disappeared fast around a corner paul led käthe to a bench in a small park but she wouldnt sit no she whispered arms folded across her chest she stared at him coldly its not as simple as you think he whispered simple theres more to me to why im here yes i didnt tell you because i didnt want you to be involved now at last raw anger exploded oh theres an excuse for lying you didnt want to get me involved you asked me to come to america paul how much more involved could i be i mean involved with my old life this trip will be the end of that old life are you a soldier in a way then he hesitated no thats not true i was a criminal in america i came here to stop them them your enemies he nodded at one of the hundreds of redwhiteandblack flags that stirred nearby in the breeze i was supposed to kill someone in the government here to stop him from starting another war but afterwards that part of my life will be over with id have a clean record id and when were you going to tell me this little secret of yours paul when we got to london to new york believe me its over with you used me i never last night that wonderful night you had me show you wilhelm street you were using me as cover werent you you wished to find a place where you could murder this man he looked up at one of the stark flapping banners and said nothing and what if in america i did something that angered you would you hit me would you kill me käthe of course not ach you say that but youve lied before käthe pulled a handkerchief from her purse the smell of lilac touched him momentarily and his heart cried as if it were the smell of incense at a loved ones wake she wiped her eyes and stuffed the cloth away tell me one thing paul how are you different from them tell me how no no you are different youre crueller do you know why choking on tears you gave me hope and then you took it away with them with the beasts in the garden there is never any hope at least theyre not deceitful like you no paul fly back to your perfect country ill stay here ill stay until the knock on the door and then ill be gone like my michael käthe i havent been honest with you no but you have to leave with me please do you know what our philosopher nietzsche wrote he said he who fights monsters must take care that he does not become a monster himself oh how true that is paul how true please come with me he took her by the shoulders gripping her hard but käthe richter was strong too she pulled his hands off and stepped back her eyes fixed on his and she whispered ruthlessly id rather share my country with ten thousand killers than my bed with one and turning on her heels she hesitated for a moment then walked away quickly drawing the glances of passersby who wondered what might have caused such a fierce lovers spat chapter thirtyone willi willi willi chief of inspectors friedrich horcher drew the name out very slowly kohl had returned to the alex and was nearly to his office when his boss caught up with him yes sir ive been looking for you yes have you its about that gatow case the shootings you will recall how could he forget those pictures would be burned into his mind forever the women the children but now he felt the chill of fear again had the case in fact been a test as hed worried earlier had heydrichs boys waited to see if hed drop the matter and now learned that hed done worse hed secretly called the young gendarme at home about it horcher tugged at his bloodred armband i have good news for you the case has been solved charlottenburg too the polish workers they were both the work of the same killer kohls initial relief that he was not going to be arrested turned quickly to bewilderment who closed the case someone at kripo no no it was the head of the gendarmerie himself meyerhoff imagine ach the matter was beginning to crystalize to willi kohls disgust he wasnt the least surprised at the rest of the tale that his boss laid out the killer was a czech jew deranged much like vlad the impaler was he czech maybe romanian or hungarian i dont recall ha history was always my poorest subject in any case the suspect was caught and confessed he was handed over to the ss horcher laughed they took time out from their important and mysterious security alert to actually do some police work was there one accomplice or more kohl asked accomplice no no the czech was alone alone but the gendarme in gatow concluded there had to be at least two or three perpetrators probably more the pictures support that theory and logic as well given the number of victims ach as we know willi being trained policemen the eye can be fooled and a young gendarme in the suburbs they are not used to crime scene investigation anyway the jew confessed he acted alone the case is solved and the fellow is on his way to the camp i would like to interview him a hesitation then smiling still horcher adjusted his armband once again ill see what i can do about that though its likely that he might already be in dachau dachau why would they send him to munich why not oranienburg overcrowding perhaps in any event the case is done so theres really no reason to talk to him the man was of course dead by now besides you need all your time to concentrate on the dresden alley matter how is that coming weve had some breakthroughs kohl told his boss trying to keep anger and frustration out of his voice a day or two and i think well have all our answers excellent horcher frowned even more hubbub over on prince albrecht street than before did you hear more alerts more security measures even mobilizing among the ss still havent heard whats going on have you caught a glimmer by any chance no sir poor horcher afraid everybody was better informed than he youll have the report on the killing soon kohl told him good it is leaning toward that foreigner isnt it i believe you said it was kohl thought no you said it was the case is moving apace excellent my look at us willi here we are working sundays can you imagine it remember when we actually had saturday afternoon and sunday off the man wandered back up the quiet hallway kohl walked to the doorway of his office and saw the blank spaces where his notes and the photographs of the gatow killings had rested horcher would have filed them away meaning theyd had the same fate as the poor czech jew probably burned like the manifest of the manhattan and floating over the city as particles of ash in the alkaline berlin wind he leaned wearily against the doorjamb staring at the empty spaces on his desk and he thought this is the one thing about murder it can never be undone you return the stolen money bruises heal the burneddown house is rebuilt you find the kidnap victim troubled but alive but those children who had died their parents the polish workers their deaths were forever and yet here was willi kohl being told that this was not so that the laws of the universe were somehow different in this land the deaths of the families and the workers had been erased because if they had been real then honest people would not rest until the loss had been understood and mourned and kohls role vindicated the inspector hung his hat on the rack and sat heavily in his creaking chair he looked over his incoming mail and telegrams nothing regarding schumann with his magnifying monocle kohl himself compared the fingerprints janssen had taken of taggert with the photos of those found on the cobblestones of dresden alley they were the same this relieved him somewhat it meant that taggert was indeed the murderer of reginald morgan and the inspector had not let a killer go free it was just as well that he could make the comparison himself a message from the identification department told him that all the examiners and analysts had been ordered to drop any kripo investigation and make themselves available to the gestapo and ss in light of a new development in the security alert he walked to janssens desk and learned that the coroners men still hadnt collected taggerts body from the boardinghouse kohl shook his head and sighed well do what we can here have the ballistics technicians run tests on the spanish pistol to make sure it is the murder weapon yes sir oh and janssen if the firearms examiners too have been commandeered in the search for this russian then run the tests yourselves you can do that can you not i can sir yes after the young man had left kohl sat back and began to jot a list of questions about morgan and the mysterious taggert which he would have translated and sent to the american authorities a shadow appeared in the doorway sir a telegram said the floor runner a young man in a gray jacket he offered the document to kohl yes yes thank you thinking it would be from the united states lines about the manifest or mannys mens wear tersely explaining they could be of no help he ripped the envelope open but he was wrong it was from the new york city police department the language was english but he could understand the meaning well enough to detective inspector w kohl kriminalpolizei alexanderplatz berlin in response to your request of even date be advised that the file on p schumann has been expunged and our investigation re said individual suspended indefinitely stop no more information is available stop regards capt g omalley nypd kohl frowned he found the departments englishgerman dictionary and learned that expunged meant obliterated he read the telegram several times more feeling his skin grow hot with each reading so the criminal police had been investigating schumann for what and why had the file been destroyed and the investigation stopped what were the implications of this well the most immediate was that while the man might not have been guilty of killing reginald morgan he was possibly in town for some criminal venture and the other was that kohl himself had let a potentially dangerous man loose in the city he needed to find schumann or at least more information about him and fast without waiting for janssen to return willi kohl collected his hat and walked along the dim hallway then down the stairs so distracted was he that he took the stairway to the forbidden ground floor he pushed the door open anyway and was immediately confronted by an ss soldier amid the flapping of the dehomag card sorters the man said sir this is a restricted you will let me pass kohl growled with a fierceness that startled the young guard another guard armed with an erma machine gun glanced their way i am leaving my building by the door at the end of that hallway i dont have time to go the other way the young ss man looked uneasily around him no one else in the hallway said a word finally he nodded kohl stalked down the hall ignoring the pain in his feet and pushed outside into the brilliant hot afternoon light he oriented himself lifted his foot to a bench and adjusted the lambs wool to pad his right foot then the inspector started north in the direction of the hotel metropol ach mr john dillinger otto webber frowned gesturing him to a chair in a dark corner of the aryan café he gripped pauls arm hard and whispered i was worried about you no word was my phone call to the stadium successful i havent heard anything on the radio not that our rodent goebbels would go on state radio to spread the word of an assassination then the gang leaders smile faded whats the matter my friend your face is not pleased but before he could say anything the waitress liesl noticed paul and moved in fast hello my love she said then pouted shame on you last time you left without kissing me goodbye what can i get you a pschorr yes yes im pleased to ive missed you ignored by the waitress webber said petulantly excuse me ach excuse me a lager for me liesl bent and kissed pauls cheek he smelled powerful perfume it hung around him even after she left he thought of lilac thought of käthe he pushed the thoughts aside abruptly then explained what had happened at the stadium and afterward no our friend morgan webber was horrified a man pretending to be morgan the kripo has my name and passport but they dont think i killed him and they havent connected me with ernst and the stadium liesl brought them the beers she squeezed pauls shoulder as she stepped away and brushed against him flirtatiously leaving another cloud of strong perfume around the table paul leaned away from it she smiled lasciviously as she sashayed away she just cant figure out im not interested can she he muttered all the angrier because he couldnt get käthe out of his mind who webber asked drinking several large gulps her liesl he nodded webber frowned no no no mr john dillinger not her him what webber frowned you thought liesl is a woman paul blinked shes a but of course he drank more beer wiped his mustache with the back of his hand i thought you knew its obvious jesus lord paul rubbed his cheek hard where hed been kissed he glanced back obvious to you maybe for a man with your profession youre a babe in the woods i said i liked women when you asked me about the rooms here ach the show in here is women but half the waitresses are men dont blame me if both sexes find you attractive besides its your fault you tipped her like a prince from addis ababa paul lit a cigarette to cover the scent of the perfume which he now found revolting so mr john dillinger i see there are problems for you are the people behind this betrayal the ones who were to get you out of berlin i dont know yet he glanced around the nearly empty club but still leaned forward to whisper i need your help again otto ach here i am always ready to assist me the saverfromdungshirts the buttermaker the champagnedealer the kruppimpersonator but i have no money left webber gave a sneer money its the root of all evil after all what do you need my friend a car another uniform and another gun a rifle webber was quiet your hunt continues thats right ach what i couldve done with a dozen men like you in my gang ring but ernsts security will be higher than ever he may leave town for a while true but perhaps not immediately when i was in his office i saw that he had two appointments today the first was at the stadium the other is at a place called waltham college where is that waltham webber asked its hello darling do you wish another beer or maybe you wish me paul jumped as hot breath blew against his ear and arms snaked around him liesl had come up from behind the first time the waitress whispered will be free perhaps even the second time stop it he barked the waitresss face went cold now knowing the truth about him paul could see that while the creatures face was pretty it had clearly masculine angles you neednt be rude my darling im sorry paul said leaning away im not interested in men liesl said coolly im not a man you know what i mean well then you shouldnt have flirted liesl snapped you owe me four marks for the beers no five i added wrong paul paid and the waitress turned away coldly muttering and noisily cleaning adjacent tables my girls webber said dismissively they get the same way sometimes it can be such a bother they resumed their conversation and paul repeated waltham college what do you know about it a military school not far from here its on the way to oranienburg by the way the home of our beautiful concentration camp why dont you just knock on the door while youre there and give yourself up save the ss the trouble of tracking you down a car and a uniform paul repeated i want to be an official but not a soldier thats what we did at the stadium and they might be anticipating it maybe ach i know you can be an rad leader a what national labor service a soldier of the spade every young man in the country must do a stint as a laborer probably thought up by ernst himself as another clever way to train soldiers they carry their shovels like guns and practice marching as much as digging youre too old to be in the service but you could be an officer they have trucks to shuttle workers to job sites and parade grounds and theyre common in the countryside no one would notice you i know where to find you one a nice truck and a uniform theyre a tasteful bluegray just the color for you paul whispered and the rifle that will be harder but i have some thoughts he finished his beer when do you wish to do this i should be at waltham college by fivethirty no later webber nodded then we must move quickly to turn you into a national socialist official he laughed though you need no training god knows the real ones have none chapter thirtytwo he heard only static at first then the scratchy sounds coalesced into gordon we dont use names the commander reminded pressing the bakelite phone to his ear furiously so that he could hear the words from berlin more clearly it was paul schumann calling via radio patched through london the time was just before am on sunday morning but gordon was at his desk at the office of naval intelligence in washington dc where hed been all night anxiously waiting to hear whether the man had succeeded in killing ernst are you all right whats going on weve been checking all the press monitoring the radio broadcasts and nothings be quiet schumann snapped i dont have time for friends in the north and friends in the south just listen gordon sat forward in his chair go ahead morgans dead oh no gordon closed his eyes momentarily feeling the loss he hadnt known the man personally but his information had always been solid and any man who risks his life for his country was okay in gordons book then schumann delivered a bombshell he was murdered by somebody named robert taggert an american you know him what an american do you know him no never heard of him he tried to kill me too before i could do what you sent me for the guy youve been talking to for the past couple of days was taggert not morgan what was that name again schumann spelled it and told gordon that he might have some connection with the us diplomatic service but he wasnt sure the commander wrote the name on a slip of paper and shouted yeoman willets the woman appeared in the doorway a moment later gordon jammed the note into her palm get me everything you can find about this guy he said she vanished instantly then into the phone are you all right were you part of it despite the bad connection gordon could feel the mans anger what it was all a setup from the beginning were you part of it gordon felt the swampy july morning air of washington dc float in and out of the open window i dont know what youre talking about after a pause schumann told the whole story about the murder of morgan taggerts masquerading as him and the betrayal of schumann to the nazis gordon was genuinely shocked my god no i swear id never do that to one of my men and i consider you one of them i honestly do another pause taggert said you werent involved but i wanted to hear it from you i swear well youve got a traitor somewhere on your end commander you need to find out who gordon sat back shattered at this news he stared numb at the wall in front of him on which were a number of citations his yale diploma and two pictures president roosevelt and theodorus bm mason the solidjawed naval lieutenant whod been the first head of the office of naval intelligence a traitor what does this taggert say all he said was that it was interests nothing more specific they wanted to keep the boss here happy the overall boss i mean can you talk to him again find out more a hesitation no gordon understood the implication taggert was dead schumann continued i got the pass phrases about the tram when i was on the ship taggert got the same phrases we did but morgan didnt know them how could that happen i sent the code to my men on the ship it also went separately to where you are now morgan was supposed to pick it up there so taggert got the right message and had a different one sent to morgan that germanamerican bund spy on board didnt transmit anything it wasnt him so who couldve done that who knew the right phrase two names came immediately to gordons mind a soldier before everything else gordon knew that a military commander had to consider all possibilities but young andrew avery was like a son to him he knew vincent manielli less well yet hed seen nothing in the young officers record that would make him doubt his loyalty as if he were a mind reader schumann asked how long have you worked with those two boys of yours it would be next to impossible impossible has a whole goddamn different meaning lately who the hell else knew about the code daddy warbucks gordon considered but the moneybags cyrus clayborn only knew in general what they had planned he didnt even know there was a pass code then who came up with the phrase we did together the senator and me more static schumann said nothing but gordon added no it cant be him was he with you when you sent the codes no he was in washington gordon was thinking the moment he hung up with me the senator could have sent a message to taggert in berlin with the right code and arranged for the wrong one to go to morgan impossible i keep hearing that word gordon that doesnt cut it with me look this whole thing was the senators idea in the first place he had some talks with people in the administration and he came to me all that means is hes been planning to set me up from the beginning schumann added ominously along with those same people facts cascaded through gordons mind could this be where could the betrayal lead finally schumann said listen you handle that situation the way you want are you still going to get me that plane yes sir you have my absolute word on that ill contact my men in amsterdam myself well have it there in about three and a half hours no ill need it later than that about ten tonight we cant land in the dark the strip were usings abandoned it doesnt have lights but there should be enough daylight left to set down around eightthirty hows that no then make it dawn tomorrow why there was a pause im going to get him this time going to do what i came here for schumann growled no no you cant its too dangerous now come on home get that job you were talking about you earned it you commander you listening go on see im here and youre there and theres nothing you can do to stop me so all of this jawing nows just a waste of time make sure that planes at the field at dawn tomorrow yeoman ruth willets appeared in the doorway hold on gordon said into the phone nothing on taggert yet sir recordsll call as soon as they find something wheres the senator in new york get me on any plane you can going up there now army private whatever it takes yessir gordon turned back to the phone paul well get you your lift out of there but please listen to reason everythings changed now you have any idea what the risks are the noise on the line rose and swallowed most of schumanns words but it seemed to bull gordon that he heard what mightve been laughter and then the button mans voice again part of the phrase was something like six to five against then he was listening to a silence that was far louder than the static had ever been in a warehouse in eastern berlin which otto webber called his despite the fact they had to break a window to get inside they found racks of national labor service uniforms webber pulled a fancy one off a hanger ach yes as i said the bluegray becomes you maybe it did but the color was also conspicuous especially since his shooting blind at waltham college would be an open field or forest as webber had described the landscape there the uniform was also closefitting bulky and hot it would get him close to the school but he took another set of more practical clothing as well dungarees a dark shirt and a pair of boots to wear for the touchoff itself one of webbers business associates had access to a motor pool of government trucks and with the assurance that webber would return the vehicle within one day and not try to sell it back to the government when he did so the key was handed over in exchange for some cuban cigars that had been made in romania now they needed only the rifle paul had considered the pawnbroker near november square the one whod supplied the mauser but he couldnt be sure whether the man had been part of taggerts deceit or even if not whether the kripo or gestapo had traced the gun back to the shop and arrested him but webber told him there were often rifles stored in a small warehouse on the spree river where he sometimes made deliveries of military supplies they drove north and just after crossing the river at wullenweber street turned west and headed through an area of low manufacturing and commercial buildings webber tapped pauls arm and he pointed to a dark building to their left thats it my friend the place appeared deserted which theyd expected today being sunday even godless dungshirts insist on a day of rest webber explained but unfortunately the warehouse was set back behind a tall barbedwire fence and had a spacious now empty parking area in the front which made it very visible from the welltraveled street how do we relax mr john dillinger webber said i know what im doing theres a waterside entrance for boats and barges its impossible to see from the street and you cant tell its a national socialist warehouse from that side no eagles or hooked crosses on the dock so no one will think twice about our visit they parked a half block past the warehouse and webber led him through an alley south toward the water the men stepped out onto a stone wall above the brown river where the air was pungent with the scent of rotten fish they walked down old stairs carved into stone and onto a concrete wharf several rowboats were tied up and webber climbed into one paul joined him they cast off and in a few minutes had rowed their way to a similar dock beneath the back of the military warehouse webber tied the boat up and climbed carefully onto the stone slick with bird droppings paul followed looking around he could see boats on the river mostly pleasure craft but webber was right no one was paying them any attention they climbed a few steps to the back door and paul took a fast look through the window no lights were on inside and only dim sunlight filtered through several opaque skylights but the large room appeared deserted webber extracted a key ring from his pocket and tried several skeleton keys until he found one that worked paul heard a soft click webber glanced at him and nodded paul pushed the door open they walked into the hot musty room filled with the eyeburning fumes of creosote paul looked around and noticed hundreds of crates against the wall were racks of rifles the army or ss was using this place as an assembly station taking the guns from the crates ripping off the oilpaper wrapping and cleaning off the creosote which had been smeared on to prevent rusting they were mausers similar to the one that taggert had arranged for him though with longer barrels which was good this meant they were more accurate and at waltham he might be quite far from ernst no telescopic sights but paul schumann hadnt had one on his springfield at st mihiel and argonne woods and his marksmanship there had been deadly accurate he walked to the rack picked up one looked it over and tried the bolt it worked smoothly giving the satisfying click of finely machined metal he aimed and dryfired it a few times getting a feel for the trigger they located crates labeled mm the caliber of ammunition for the mauser inside were gray cardboard boxes printed with swastikas and eagles he opened one took out five bullets loaded the gun then chambered and ejected a round to make absolutely certain the bullets were right good lets get out of here he said putting two boxes of the shells into his pocket can we his words were interrupted as the front door opened casting a beam of fierce sunlight on them they turned squinting before paul could lift the rifle the young man in the doorway wearing a black ss uniform was pointing a pistol toward them you put that down at once hands up paul crouched set the mauser on the floor and slowly rose chapter thirtythree otto webber said gruffly what are you doing we are from the krupp munitions works we were sent to make certain that the correct ammunition quiet the young guard looked around nervously to see if anyone else was here there was a problem with a delivery we got a call from its sunday why are you working on sunday webber laughed my young friend when we deliver the wrong shipment to the ss we will correct our error no matter what the day or the hour my supervisor quiet the young soldier spotted a telephone on a dusty workstation and moved toward it keeping the pistol pointed toward them when he was nearly to the table webber lowered his hands and started walking in his direction ach this is absurd he was exasperated i have identification you will stop right there he thrust the gun forward i will show you the paperwork from my supervisor webber kept walking the ss guard pulled the trigger a short metallic bang shook the walls unsure if webber was hit or not paul scooped the mauser up from the floor and rolled behind a high stack of rifle crates chambering a round the young trooper lunged for the phone and pulled the receiver off the cradle then ducked back please listen he cried into the handset paul rose fast he had no view of the soldier but he fired a bullet into the phone unit which exploded into a dozen bakelite shards the trooper cried out paul slipped back behind cover but not before he caught a glimpse of otto webber lying on the floor writhing slowly as he gripped his belly which was stained with blood no you jew the young trooper raged you will throw down your gun at once there will soon be a hundred men here paul made his way to the front of the building where he could cover both the front and back doors he glanced quickly out the window and saw a lone motorcycle parked in front he knew the young man was merely making a routine check of the warehouse and there would be no others coming but someone might have heard the shot and the ss man could simply stay where he was keeping paul pinned down until his superior realized he hadnt reported back and sent more troops to the warehouse he looked out from his end of the stack of crates he had no idea where the soldier was he another gunshot echoed glass splintered the front window nowhere near paul the ss guard had fired through the glass to draw attention hed shot directly into the street not caring if he hit anyone you jew pig the man raged stand up and raise your hands or youll die screaming in columbia house the voice came from a different place this time closer to the front of the warehouse hed crawled forward to put more crates between himself and his enemy another shot through the window outside a car horn blared paul moved into the next row swinging the gun before him finger on the trigger the mauser was ungainly good for distance bad for this he looked fast the aisle was empty he jumped as another shot shattered a window someone must have heard by now or seen a bullet strike a wall or house across the street maybe a car or passerby had been hit he started for the next aisle fast swinging the gun before him a glimpse of the mans black uniform disappearing the ss man had heard paul or anticipated him and slipped behind another stack of crates paul decided he couldnt wait any longer hed have to stop the guard there was nothing to do but charge over the center row of crates just like hed gone over the top of the trenches in an assault during the war and hope he could get off a fatal shot before the man sprayed bullets at him from the semiautomatic pistol okay paul said to himself he took a deep breath another go he leapt to his feet and climbed onto the crate in front of him lifting the gun his foot just touched the second crate when he heard a sound behind him and to his right the soldier had flanked him but as he turned the grimy windows shook again from a gunshot paul froze the ss soldier stepped directly in front of him twenty feet away paul frantically raised the mauser but just before he fired the soldier coughed blood sprayed from his mouth and the luger dropped to the floor he shook his head he fell heavily and lay still blood turning his uniform ruddy to his right paul could see otto webber on the floor he clutched his bloody gut with one hand in his other was a mauser hed managed to crawl to a rack of guns load one and fire the rifle slid to the floor are you crazy paul whispered angrily why did you go toward him like that didnt you think hed shoot no the whitefaced sweating man said laughing i didnt think hed do that the man sighed in pain go see if anybody has responded to his subtle call for help paul ran to the front and noted the area was still deserted across the street was a tall windowless building a factory or warehouse closed today it was likely that the bullets had struck the wall unnoticed its clear he said returning to webber who had sat up and was looking down at the mass of blood on his belly ach we have to find a doctor paul slung the rifle over his shoulder he helped webber to his feet and they made their way out the back doorway and into the boat pale and sweating the german lay back with his head against the bow as paul rowed frantically to the dock near the truck where can i take you for a doctor doctor webber laughed its too late for that mr john dillinger leave me go on i can tell its too late no im taking you for help paul repeated firmly tell me where to find somebody who wont go running to the ss or gestapo he pulled the boat to the dock tied it up and climbed out he set the mauser in a patch of grass nearby and turned back to help webber out of the boat no paul whispered webber had untied the rope and with his remaining strength pushed off from the dock the dinghy was now ten feet away drifting into the current otto no as i say too late webber called gasping then he gave a sour laugh look at me a vikings funeral ach when you return home play some john philip sousa and think of me though i still say hes english you americans take credit for far too much now go on mr john dillinger do what you have come here for the last glimpse paul schumann had of his friend were the mans eyes closing as he slumped to the bottom of the boat which gathered speed drawn into the murky water of the spree a dozen of them all young men who had chosen life and freedom over honor was it cowardice or intelligence that had motivated them to do this kurt fischer wondered if he was the only one among them plagued by this question they were being driven through the countryside northwest of berlin in the same sort of bus that used to take them on outings as young students the round driver piloted his vehicle smoothly over the winding road and tried unsuccessfully to get them to sing hunting and hiking songs kurt sat next to his brother as they shared stories with the others little by little he learned something about them mostly aryan all from middleclass families all with degrees attending universities or planning to do so after their labor service half were like kurt and hans marginally antiparty for political and intellectual reasons socialists pacifists protestors the other half were swing kids richer rebellious too but not as political their main complaint with the national socialists was cultural the censoring of movies dance and music there were no jews slavs or roma gypsies among this crowd of course nor any kosis either despite colonel ernsts enlightenment kurt knew that it would be many years before such ethnic and political groups would find a home in the military or german officialdom kurts personal belief was that it would never happen as long as the triumvirate of hitler göring and goebbels was in power so here they were he was thinking these young men brought together by the predicament of having to choose between a concentration camp and possible death or an organization they found morally wrong am i a coward kurt wondered again choosing as i did he remembered goebbelss call for the nationwide boycott of jewish stores in april of the national socialists thought it would receive an overwhelming show of support in fact the event went badly for the party with many germans his parents among them openly defying the boycott thousands in fact sought out stores they hadnt previously been to just to show support for their jewish fellow citizens that was courage did he not have this bravery within him kurt he looked up his brother had been speaking to him youre not listening what did you say when will we eat supper im hungry i dont have any clue how would i know is army food any good i heard you eat well i suppose it depends though if youre in the field itll be different than at a base i wonder what its like what the food no being in the trenches being we wont be in the trenches there wont be another war and if there is you heard colonel ernst we wont have to fight well be given different duties his brother didnt look convinced and more troubling he didnt look that upset that he might be seeing combat why he even seemed intrigued by the thought this was a very new and disturbing side to his brother i wonder what its like conversation in the bus continued about sports about the scenery about the olympics about american movies and girls of course finally they arrived turning off the highway and easing down a long maplelined drive that led to the campus of waltham military college what their pacifist parents would think to see them in such a place the bus squealed to a halt in front of one of the schools redbrick buildings kurt was struck by the incongruity an institution devoted to the philosophy and practice of warfare yet set in an idyllic vale with a rich carpet of grass fluttering ivy crawling up the ancient buildings forests and hills behind which formed a gentle frame for the scene the boys gathered their rucksacks and climbed off the bus a young soldier not much older than they identified himself as their recruitment officer and shook their hands welcoming them he explained that doctorprofessor keitel would be with them shortly he held up a football that he and another soldier had been kicking around and he tapped it toward hans who expertly sent it on its way to another of the recruits and as always happens when young men and a ball end up together on a grassy field it was only a matter of minutes before two teams had formed and a game begun chapter thirtyfour at pm the labor service truck eased over a smooth immaculate highway that wove through tall stands of pine and hemlock the air was flecked with motes of dust and lazy insects died on the flat windshield paul schumann struggled to think only of reinhard ernst of his target groping for the ice dont think about otto wilhelm friedrich georg webber this was however impossible paul was consumed with memories of the man hed known only a day presently he was thinking that otto would have fit in perfectly on the west side of new york drinking with runyon and jacobs and the boxing crew maybe hed even enjoy sparring a little but what webber really would have loved were the opportunities in america the freedom to run countless scams and grifts someday i may boast to you of my better cons but then his thoughts faded as he turned around a slow curve and diverted down a side road a kilometer along the highway he saw a carefully painted sign waltham military college three or four young men in hiking outfits lounged on the grass surrounded by packs baskets and the remnants of their sunday afternoon dinner a sign beside them pointed down the wide drive to the main hall a second road led to the stadium and gymnasium and academic buildings through farther along was the driveway to buildings through it was in building that ernst would have his meeting in a half hour paul had read on his schedule he continued past the turnoff though drove another hundred yards along the road and pulled onto a deserted unpaved byway overgrown with grass he nosed the truck into the woods so that it couldnt be seen from the main road a deep breath paul rubbed his eyes and wiped the sweat from his face would ernst actually show up he wondered or would he be like dutch schultz that time in jersey city when the mobster had skipped out on a meeting where hed instinctively some said psychically known he was going to be ambushed but what else could paul do he had to believe the colonel would go ahead with the meeting and his assessment was that the man would in fact show up here everything hed learned about him suggested someone who didnt shirk his obligations the american climbed out of the truck he stripped off the bulky bluegray uniform and hat folded them neatly and rested them on the front seat beneath which hed also hidden another suit in case he needed to change identity yet again to escape paul dressed quickly in the working clothes hed stolen from the warehouse then collecting the rifle and the ammunition he plunged into the thickest part of the woods moving as silently as he could he slowly made his way through the quiet fragrant forest cautious at first expecting more guards or troops especially after the attempt that afternoon on ernsts life but he was surprised to find none at all as he moved closer to the buildings easing through brush and trees he saw some people and vehicles near the front of one of the structures which a sign reported was no the one he sought parked up the drive about one hundred feet from it was a black mercedes sedan a man wearing an ss uniform stood beside the car looking around vigilantly a machine gun over his shoulder was this ernsts car he couldnt see through the glare of the windows paul also noted a small panel van and a bus near which a dozen young men in civilian clothing and a soldier in a gray uniform were playing soccer a second soldier leaned against the bus watching the game and cheering the teams on why would someone as senior as ernst meet with this small group of students maybe they were a handpicked group of future officers the boys looked like model national socialists fair blond and in very good shape whoever they were paul assumed that ernst would meet with them in the classroom which would require him to walk the fifty feet or so from the mercedes to building paul would have plenty of time to touch him off from where he now crouched though he had no good shooting angle the trees and brush waved in the hot wind and not only impaired the sight of his prey but could deflect the bullet the door to the mercedes opened and a balding man in a brown jacket climbed out paul looked past him into the backseat yes ernst was inside then the door slammed and he lost sight of the colonel who remained in the car the man in brown carried a large folder to a second car an opel near paul where the wooded hill bottomed out he set the folder in the backseat and returned to the far side of the field pauls attention was drawn to the opel it was unoccupied the car would give him a good shooting position provide some cover from the soldiers and offer paul a head start back into the woods to the truck for his escape afterward yes he decided the car would be his hunting blind cradling the mauser in the crook of his arm paul moved slowly forward hearing the soft buzz of insects the snap and crunch of the dusty july vegetation beneath his body and the shouts and laughter of young men enjoying their soccer game the faithful set of auto union wheels clattered along the highway at a paltry sixty kilometers per hour rattling madly despite the mirrorsmooth surface of the road a backfire erupted and the engine gulped for air willi kohl adjusted the choke and stomped on the accelerator once again the car shuddered but finally picked up a bit of speed after hed left kripo headquarters through the forbidden back door defiantly and yes foolishly the inspector had walked toward the hotel metropol as hed approached he gradually became aware of music the notes penned by mozart so many years ago were dancing from the strings of a chamber quartet in the magnificent lobby hed looked through the windows at the glittering chandeliers the murals of scenes from wagners ring the waiters in perfect black trousers and perfect white jackets balancing silver trays on their palms and hed continued past the hotel not even pausing the inspector had known all along of course that paul schumann was lying about coming here his investigation had revealed that the american was a man who was comfortable not with champagne and limousines and mozart but with pschorr ale and sausages he was a man with worn shoes and a love of boxing rings a man with some connection with the fringe neighborhood around november square if a man had no hesitation to take on four stormtroopers with his fists he would not be checking into an effete place like the metropol nor could he afford it either yet this place had been the first location schumann had thought of inresponse to kohls question about his new address which suggested that the american might have seen it recently and since miss richters boardinghouse was far across town it was logical that he had seen the hotel on his way to berlin north the tough neighborhood that began just a block past the hotel this was an area that was akin to paul schumanns temperament and tastes it was a large district under most circumstances a half dozen investigators would be needed to canvass the locals and gather information on a suspect but some evidence kohl had found might he believed help him narrow his search considerably at the boardinghouse hed discovered in schumanns pockets a limp box of cheap matches tucked into the packet of german cigarettes kohl was familiar with these he often found them in the possession of other suspects whod picked them up in establishments in bad areas of the city like berlin north perhaps the american had no connection here but it was a good place to start his search armed with paul schumanns passport kohl had made the rounds in the southern end of the neighborhood noting first what kind of matches they gave away and if they were the same then showing the americans picture to waiters and bartenders no inspector i am so sorry greet god inspector i have seen no one like that hail hitler ill keep on the lookout for him hail hitler hail hitler hail hitler he tried a restaurant on dragoner street nothing then walked a few doors farther on to a club on the same street hed flashed his id card to the man at the entrance and walked into the bar yes the matches were the same as schumann had had hed walked through the various rooms flashing the americans passport asking if anyone had seen him the civilians in the audience were typically blind and the ss typically uncooperative one barked youre blocking my view kripo move your ass but then hed shown the picture to a waitress her eyes had flashed in anger you know him kohl had asked ach do i know him yes yes you are liesl he claimed his name was hermann but i see that was a lie she nodded at the passport im not surprised he was here not an hour ago with his toad of a companion otto webber who is this webber a toad as i say what were they doing here what else drinking talking ach and flirting a man flirts with a girl and then rejects her coldly how cruel that is liesls adams apple had quivered and kohl deduced the whole sad story will you arrest him please what do you know about him where he is staying what his business is liesl had not known much but one bit of information was golden schumann and webber apparently planned to meet with someone later that afternoon and a clandestine gathering it was to be the spurned waitress had offered darkly a toads business at someplace called waltham college kohl had hurried from the aryan café collected the dkw and sped to waltham he now saw the military college in front of him and eased the car gently onto the gravel shoulder near two low brick columns topped with statues of imperial eagles several students lounging on the grass beside backpacks and a picnic basket glanced at the dusty black car kohl gestured the students over to the car and the blond young men sensing authority trotted quickly forward hail hitler hail kohl replied school is still in session in the summer there are courses being taught sir today though we have no classes so weve been hiking like his own sons these students were caught in the great fever of third empire education only more so of course since the whole point of this college was to produce soldiers what brilliant criminals the leader and his crowd are they kidnap the nation by seizing our children he opened schumanns passport and displayed the picture have you seen this man no inspector one said and glanced at his friends who shook their heads no how long have you been here perhaps an hour has anyone arrived in that time yes sir not long ago a school bus arrived and with it an opel and a mercedes a black one fiveliter new no it was the sevenpointseven a friend corrected youre blind it was much smaller a third said and that labor service truck only it didnt drive in here no it went past and then turned off the road the boy pointed near the entrance of some other academic buildings labor service yes sir was the truck full of workers we couldnt see in the back did you get a look at the driver no sir nor i labor service kohl pondered this rad workers were used primarily for farming and public works it would be very unusual for them to be assigned to a college especially on sunday has the service been doing some work here the boy shrugged i dont believe so sir ive heard of nothing either sir dont say anything of my questions kohl said to anyone a matter of party security one boy asked with an intrigued smile kohl touched his finger to his lips and left them gossiping excitedly about what the mysterious policeman might mean chapter thirtyfive closing in on the gray opel crawling pause then crawling again just like at st mihiel and the dense ancient forests of argonne paul schumann smelled hot grass and the old manure used to fertilize the field smelled the oil and creosote of the weapon smelled his own sweat another few feet then pause he had to move slowly he was very exposed here anyone on the field around building might have glanced his way and noticed the grass swaying unnaturally or caught the glint of low light reflecting off the rifle barrel pause he looked over the field again the man in brown was taking a stack of documents from the panel truck the glare on the windows continued to obscure any view of ernst in the mercedes the ss guard continued his vigil of the area looking back toward the classroom building paul watched the balding man call the young men together they reluctantly ended the soccer game and walked into the classroom with their attention focused away from him paul continued more quickly now to the opel opened the back door and climbed into the baking vehicle feeling his skin prickle from the heat looking out through the back left window he noted that this was the perfect vantage point to shoot from he had an excellent view of the area around ernsts car a clear killing field of forty to fifty feet to bring the man down and it would take the bodyguard and soldiers some time to figure out where the shot had come from paul schumann was touching the ice firmly he clicked the mausers safety catch off and squinted toward ernsts car greetings future soldiers welcome to waltham military college kurt fischer and the others replied to doctorprofessor keitel with various greetings most said hail hitler it was interesting that keitel himself did not use that salutation kurt noted the recruitment soldier whod been playing football with them stood beside the doctorprofessor in the front of the classroom holding a stack of large envelopes the man winked at kurt whod just missed blocking a goal the soldier had scored the volunteers sat at oak desks on the walls around them were maps and flags that kurt didnt recognize his brother was looking around too and he leaned over and whispered battle flags of second empire armies kurt shushed him frowning in irritation both at the interruption and because his younger brother knew something he did not and how he now wondered troubled did his brother the son of pacifists even know what a battle flag was the dowdy professor continued im going to tell you what is planned for the next few days you will listen carefully yes sir and its variations filled the room first you will fill out a personal information form and application for induction into the armed forces then you will answer a questionnaire about your personality and your aptitudes the answers will be compiled and analyzed and will help us determine your talents and mental preferences for certain duties some of you for instance will be better suited for combat some for radio work some for office detail so it is vital that you answer honestly kurt glanced toward his brother who did not however acknowledge him their agreement had been that they would answer any such questions in a way as to be guaranteed of being assigned office tasks or even manual labor anything to keep from having to kill another human being but kurt was troubled that hans might be thinking differently now was he being seduced by the idea of becoming a combat soldier after you are through with the forms colonel ernst will address you then you will be shown to your dormitory and be given supper tomorrow you will begin your training and spend the next month marching and improving your physical condition before your classroom instruction begins keitel nodded at the soldier who began passing out the packets the recruitment officer paused at kurts desk they agreed to try for another game before supper if the light held the soldier then followed keitel outside to get pencils for the inductees as he absently smoothed his hand over his documents kurt found himself oddly content despite the harrowing circumstances of this hard hard day yes certainly some of this was gratitude to colonel ernst and doctorprofessor keitel for providing this miraculous salvation but more than that he was beginning to feel that hed been given the chance to do something important after all an act that transcended his own plight had kurt gone to oranienburg his imprisonment or death would have been courageous perhaps but meaningless now though he decided that the incongruous act of volunteering for the army might prove to be exactly the gesture of defiance hed been searching for a small but concrete way of helping save his country from the brown plague with a smile toward his brother kurt ran his hand over the test envelope realizing that for the first time in months his heart was truly content chapter thirtysix willi kohl parked the dkw not far from the labor service truck which was about fifty meters off the road parked in such a way that the driver clearly intended that the vehicle not be seen as he walked quietly to the truck his panama hat low to keep the glaring sun out of his eyes he removed his pistol and listened for footsteps voices but he heard nothing out of the ordinary only birds crickets cicadas he approached the truck slowly he looked into the back and found the burlap bags shovels and hoes hed expected the weapons of the labor service but in the cab he located some items that interested him considerably more on the seat was an rad officers uniform carefully folded as if it would be used again soon and the wearer was concerned that wrinkles might make him appear suspicious more important though was what he found wrapped in paper beneath the seat a blue doublebreasted suit and a white shirt both in large sizes the shirt was an arrow made in the united states and the suit kohl felt his heart thud as he looked at the label inside the jacket mannys mens wear new york city paul schumanns favorite store kohl replaced the clothes and looked around for any sign of the american the toad webber or anyone else no one the footsteps in the dust outside the door of the truck suggested that schumann had gone into the woods toward the campus an old service drive leading in that direction was overgrown with grass but more or less smooth but it was also exposed the hedgerows and brush on either side would be a perfect place for schumann to lie in wait the only other route was through the hilly woods strewn with rocks and branches ach his poor feet cried out at the very sight of it but he had no choice willi kohl started forward through the painful obstacle course please paul schumann prayed please step out of the car colonel ernst and into clear view in a country that has outlawed god where there were fewer prayers to hear perhaps hed grant this one but apparently this was not the moment for divine help ernst remained inside the mercedes glare from the windshield and windows kept paul from seeing exactly where he was in the backseat if he fired through the glass and missed hed never have another chance he scanned the field again reflecting no breeze good light from the side not in his eyes illuminating the killing field a perfect opportunity to shoot paul wiped the sweat off his forehead and sat back in frustration he felt something pressing uncomfortably into his thigh and he glanced down it was the folder of papers that the balding man had placed in the car ten minutes before he pushed it to the floor but as he did he glanced at the document on top he lifted it and alternating between glancing at ernsts mercedes and the letter he read ludwig you will find annexed hereto my draft letter to the leader about our study note that ive included a reference to the testing being done today at waltham we can add the results tonight at this early stage of the study i believe it is best that we refer to those killed by our subject soldiers as state criminals therefore you will see in the letter that the two jewish families we killed at gatow will be described as jew subversives the polish laborers killed at charlottenburg as foreign infiltrators the roma as sexual deviants and the young aryans at waltham today will be political dissidents at a later point we can i feel be more forthright about the innocence of those exterminated by our subjects but at the moment i do not believe the climate is right for this nor do i refer to the questionnaires you administer to the soldiers as psychological testing this too i feel would be unfavorably received please review this and contact me about alterations i intend to submit the letter as requested on monday july reinhard paul frowned what was this all about he flipped to the next sheet and continued reading highest confientiality adolf hitler leader state chancellor and president of the german nation and commander of the armed forces field marshal werner von blomberg state minister of defense my leader and my minister you have asked for details of the waltham study being conducted by myself and doctorprofessor ludwig keitel of waltham military college i am pleased to describe the nature of the study and the results so far this study arises out of my instructions from you to make ready the german armed forces and to help them achieve most expeditiously the goals of our great nation as you have set forth in my years of commanding our courageous troops during the war i learned much about mens behavior during combat while any good soldier will follow orders it became clear to me that men respond in different ways to the matter of killing and this difference i believe is based on their nature in brief our study involves asking questions of soldiers before and after they execute condemned enemies of the state and then analyzing their responses these executions involve a number of different situations various methods of execution categories of prisoners relationship of the soldier to the prisoners the family background and personal history of the soldier etc the examples to date are as follows on july of this year in the town of gatow a soldier subject a questioned at length two groups convicted of jewish subversive activities he was then ordered to carry out the execution order by automatic weapon fire on july a soldier in charlottenburg subject b similarly executed a number of polish infiltrators although subject b was the proximate cause of their deaths he had had no communication with them prior to their extermination unlike the gatow executions on july a soldier subject c executed a group of roma gypsies engaged in sexually deviant behavior in a special facility we have had constructed at waltham college carbon monoxide gas from vehicle exhaust was the means of death like subject b this soldier never conversed with the victims but unlike him he did not witness their actual deaths paul schumann gasped in shock he looked again at the first letter why these people killed were innocent by ernsts own admission jewish families polish workers he read the passages again to make sure hed seen correctly he thought he must have mistranslated the words but no there wasnt any doubt he looked across the dusty field at the black mercedes which still sheltered ernst he glanced down at the letter to hitler and continued on july a soldier subject d executed a dozen political dissidents at the waltham facility the variation in this case was that these particular convicts were of aryan extraction and subject d spent an hour or more conversing and playing sports with them immediately before he executed them getting to know some of them by name he was further instructed to observe them die oh christ thats here today paul leaned forward squinting over the field the grayuniformed german soldier whod been playing soccer with the boys gave a stiffarm salute to the balding man in brown then he hooked a thick hose from the tailpipe of the bus into a fixture on the outside wall of the classroom we are presently compiling the responses provided by all of these subject soldiers several dozen other executions are planned each one a variation intended to provide us with as much helpful data as possible the results of the first four tests are attached hereto please be assured we reject out of hand the tainted jewthinking of traitors like dr freud but feel that solid national socialist philosophy and science will allow us to match the personality types of soldiers with the means of death the nature of the victims and the relationship between them to more efficiently achieve the goals you have set forth for our great nation we will be submitting the complete report to you within two months with all humble respect col reinhard ernst plenipotentiary for domestic stability paul looked up across the field to see the soldier glance into the classroom at the young men close the door then walk calmly to the bus and turn on the engine chapter thirtyseven when the door to the classroom closed the students looked around them it was kurt fischer who got out of his seat and walked to the window he rapped on it youve forgotten the pencils he called there are some in the back someone called kurt found three stubby pencils sitting on a chalkboard ledge but not enough for us all how can we take a test without pencils open a window somebody called my god its hot in here a tall blond boy jailed because hed written a poem ridiculing the hitler youth walked to the windows he struggled to undo the latch kurt returned to his seat and tore open his envelope he pulled out the sheets of paper to see what sort of personal information they wanted and if there would be any questions about their parents pacifism but he laughed in surprise look at this he said the printing didnt come out on mine no mine too its all of them theyre blank this is absurd the blond boy at the window called they dont open he looked around the stifling room at the others none of them the windows they dont open i can do it said a huge young man but the locks defeated him too theyre sealed shut why would that be then he squinted at the window its not normal glass either its thick it was then that kurt smelled the sweet strong aroma of petrol exhaust flooding into the room from a vent above the door whats that somethings wrong theyre killing us a boy shrieked look outside a hose look break out break the glass the large boy whod tried to open the windows looked around a chair table anything but the tables and benches were bolted to the floor and although the room had seemed to be a regular classroom there were no pointers no globes not even ink bottles in the wells they might try to shatter the glass with several students tried to shoulder down the door but it was thick oak and barred from the outside the faint blue cloud of exhaust smoke streamed steadily into the room kurt and two other boys tried to kick the windows out but the glass was indeed thick far too strong to break without heavy tools there was a second door but that too was securely closed and locked stuff something in the vents two boys stripped off their shirts and kurt and another student boosted them up but their murderers keitel and ernst had anticipated everything the vents were thick screening a half meter by a meter in size there was no way to block the smooth surface the boys began to choke everyone scrabbled away from the vent into the corners of the room some crying some praying kurt fischer looked outside the recruitment officer whod scored a goal against him just minutes earlier stood with his arms crossed gazing at them calmly the same way someone might watch bears frolic in their pen at the zoological garden on budapest street paul schumann saw before him the black mercedes still protecting his prey he saw the ss guard looking around vigilantly he saw the balding man walk up to the soldier whod fitted the hose to the classroom building speaking to him then jotting on a sheet of paper he saw an empty field where a dozen young men had just played a soccer game in their last minutes on earth and above all of these discrete images he saw what linked them the appalling specter of indifferent evil reinhard ernst was not simply hitlers architect of war he was a murderer of the innocent and his motive the handy collection of information the whole goddamn world here was out of kilter paul swung the mauser to the right toward the bald man and the soldier the second grayuniformed trooper leaned against the van smoking a cigarette the two soldiers were some distance apart but paul could probably touch them both off the balding man maybe the professor mentioned in the letter to hitler was probably not armed and would most likely flee at the first shot paul could then sprint to the classroom open the door and give covering fire so the boys could get away to safety ernst and his guard would escape or hunker down behind the car until help arrived but how could paul let these young men die the sights of the mauser centered on the soldiers chest paul began applying pressure to the trigger then he sighed angrily and swung the muzzle of the rifle back to the mercedes no he had come here for one purpose to kill reinhard ernst the young people in the classroom were not his concern theyd have to be sacrificed once he shot ernst the other soldiers would take cover and return fire forcing paul to escape back into the woods while the boys suffocated trying not to imagine the horror in the room what those young men would be going through paul schumann touched the ice once more he steadied his breathing and just at that moment his prayer was finally answered the back door to ernsts car opened chapter thirtyeight i used to swim for hours at a time and hike for days willi kohl thought angrily as he leaned against a tree and caught his breath it was unjust to be given both a hearty appetite and a flair for a sedentary job ach and there was the matter of his age too of course not to mention the feet prussian police training was the best in the world but tracking a suspect through the woods like göring on a bear hunt had not been part of the curriculum kohl could find no signs of paul schumanns route nor anyone elses his own progress had been slow he would pause from time to time as he approached a particularly dense thicket and make sure no one was sighting at him with a weapon then hed resume his cautious pursuit finally through the brush ahead of him he noticed a mowed field around a classroom building parked nearby were a black mercedes a bus and a van an opel too on the opposite side of the field several men stood about two soldiers among them with an ss trooper beside the mercedes was this some sort of furtive black market business deal schumann was involved in with this webber if so where were they questions nothing but questions then kohl noted something unusual he eased closer pushing aside brush he squinted the sweat from his eyes and looked carefully a hose ran from the tailpipe of the bus into the school why would that be perhaps they were killing vermin then he soon forgot this curious detail his attention turned to the mercedes whose back door was open a man was climbing out kohl realized with a shock that it was a government minister reinhard ernst the man in charge of what was dubbed domestic stability though everyone knew that he was the military genius behind rearming the country what was he doing here could it oh no willi kohl whispered aloud good god he suddenly understood exactly what the security alerts were all about what the relationship between morgan and taggert and schumann were and what the americans mission in this country was gripping his pistol the inspector began jogging through the woods toward the clearing cursing the gestapo and the ss and peter krauss for not telling him what they knew cursing too the twenty years and twentyfive kilos that life had added to his body since hed become a policeman as for his feet so urgent was his desire to prevent ernsts death that he forgot about the pain completely all lies everything theyd said was a lie to get us to come willingly to their death chamber kurt had taken what he thought was the cowardly choice agreeing to join the service and he was now about to die for that decision while if he and hans had gone to the concentration camp they might very well have survived listless and dizzy kurt fischer sat in the corner of academic building beside his brother no less frightened than anyone else no less desperate he was not however trying to rip the iron desks from the floor or batter the door with his shoulder like the others he knew ernst and keitel had thought this out ahead of time and had constructed an impregnable airtight building to be their coffin the national socialists were as efficient as they were demonic rather he was wielding a different tool with the stub of pencil from the back of the room he was jotting unsteady words onto a page of blank paper ripped from the back of a book ironically considering that it was pacifism that had brought them to this terrible place the volumes title was cavalry tactics during the war between france and prussia whimpers of fear shouts of anger around him sobs kurt hardly heard them dont be afraid he told his brother no the terrified younger man said his voice cracking im not rather than the letter of reassurance that hed planned on writing to their parents that night which ernst had promised they could send he now wrote a very different note albrecht and lotte fischer prince george street no swiss cottage london england if by some miracle this reaches you please know that you are in our thoughts now at these last minutes of our lives the circumstances of our deaths are as pointless as those of the ten thousand who have died before us here we pray that you continue your work with us in your thoughts so that perhaps this madness can end tell everyone who will listen that the evil here is worse than the worst they can imagine and it will not end until somebody has the courage to stop it know that we love you your sons around him the screams abated as the young men dropped to their knees or bellies and began kissing the scuffed oak floor and baseboards to suck whatever air they might from beneath the floors some simply prayed peacefully kurt fischer looked over his writing once more he actually gave a soft laugh for hed realized suddenly that this was the essential purpose hed been hoping for delivering the message to his parents and ultimately he prayed the world this is how he would fight the party his weapon was his death and now at the end he felt a curious optimism that this note would be found and delivered and perhaps through his parents or others it would be the final root that cracked the wall of the jail imprisoning his country the pencil fell from his hand using his last morsels of thought and strength kurt folded the paper and put it into his wallet which had the most chance of being removed from his body by a local mortician or doctor who god willing might find the words hed written and have the courage to send them on then he took his brothers hand and closed his eyes still paul schumann had no target reinhard ernst was pacing erratically beside the mercedes as he spoke into the microphone attached by a wire to the dashboard in the front seat the mans tall bodyguard also blocked pauls view he kept the gun steady finger on the trigger waiting for the man to stop touching the ice controlling his breathing ignoring the flies buzzing into his face ignoring the heat silently screaming to reinhard ernst stop moving for christs sake let me do this thing and get away back to my country back to my printing plant my brother the family that ive had the family that i may yet have an image of käthe richter came quickly into his head and he saw her eyes felt her tears heard the echo of her voice id rather share my country with ten thousand killers than my bed with one his finger caressed the trigger of the mauser and her face and words vanished in a spray of ice and just at that moment ernst stopped pacing clipped the microphone back onto the dashboard of the mercedes and stepped away from the car he stood with arms folded chatting amiably to his bodyguard who nodded slowly as they gazed at the classroom paul rested the sights on the colonels chest chapter thirtynine approaching the clearing willi kohl heard a loud gunshot it echoed off the buildings and the landscape and was swallowed in the tall grass and juniper around him the inspector ducked instinctively he saw across the clearing the tall form of reinhard ernst drop to the ground beside the mercedes no the man is dead its my fault through my oversight my stupidity a man has been killed a man vital to the fatherland the ministers ss bodyguard crouching looked for the assailant what have i done the inspector thought but then another shot rang out easing to the protective trunk of a thick oak at the edge of the clearing kohl saw one of the regular army soldiers slump to the ground kohl looked just beyond him and saw another soldier lying on the grass blood on his chest nearby a balding man in a brown jacket scrabbled to safety under the bus the inspector then looked back to the mercedes what was this hed been wrong the minister was unhurt ernst had dived to the ground for cover when hed heard the first shot but was now rising cautiously a pistol in his hand his guard had unslung a machine pistol and he too was looking for a target schumann hadnt killed ernst then a third shot rang through the clearing it hit ernsts mercedes shattering a window a fourth too hitting the cars tire and inner tube then kohl saw motion on the grassy field it was schumann yes he was running from the opel toward the school firing occasionally toward the mercedes with a long rifle forcing ernst and his guard to remain low he reached the front door of the classroom as ernsts ss man rose and fired several times the bus however protected the american from the shots but he was not protected from willi kohl the inspector wiped his hand on his slacks and aimed his revolver at schumann it was a longrange shot but not impossible and at least he could pin the man down until other troops arrived but just as kohl began to squeeze the trigger schumann ripped the front door of the building open he stepped inside and emerged a moment later dragging out a young man several others followed staggering holding their chests coughing some vomiting another one then three more god in heaven kohl was stunned it was they whod been gassed not rats or mice schumann motioned the men toward the woods and before kohl could recover from the shock of what hed seen and aim once more the american was firing toward the mercedes again giving the young men cover with the rifle as they made for the safety of the dense forest the mauser kicked hard against his shoulder as paul fired again he aimed low hoping to hit ernsts or his guards legs but their car was in a shallow gully and he couldnt find a target beneath it he glanced inside the classroom quickly the last of the young men were leaving they staggered out and ran for the woods run paul cried run he fired twice more to keep ernst and the guard down flinging sweat from his forehead with his fingers paul tried to get closer to the mercedes but both ernst and his guard were armed and good shots and the ss man had a submachine gun they fired repeatedly and paul could make no headway toward them as paul worked the bolt to chamber a round the guard peppered the bus and the ground nearby ernst leapt into the front seat of the mercedes and grabbed the microphone then took cover again on the far side of the car how long would it be until help arrived paul had driven through waltham only two miles up the road he was sure the goodsized town would be home to a garrison of police and the school itself might have its own security force if he wanted to survive hed have to flee now he fired twice more using up the last of the mauser ammunition he tossed the rifle to the ground then bent down and pulled a pistol from the belt of one of the dead soldiers it was a luger like reginald morgans he worked the toggle to put a bullet in the chamber he looked down and saw crouching halfway under the bus the balding mustachioed man whod led the students into the building whats your name paul asked in german please sir his voice shook do not your name doctorprofessor keitel sir the man was crying please paul recalled that this was the name on the letter about the waltham study he lifted the pistol and shot him once in the center of the forehead then he took a final look toward ernsts car and could see no target paul ran across the field firing several shots into the mercedes to keep ernst and the guard down and soon he plunged into the woods as bullets from the ss mans weapon chopped through the lush green foliage around him none even close to its mark chapter forty willi kohl had turned away from the clearing and now drenched in sweat and sick from the heat and exertion was heading back in the direction of the labor service truck schumanns means of escape he assumed he would flatten the tires to prevent him from leaving a hundred meters two hundred gasping wondering who were the young people were they criminals were they innocent he paused to try to catch his breath if he didnt he was sure schumann would easily hear the wheezing rasp as he approached he scanned the forest he saw nothing where was the truck he was disoriented this direction no it was the other way but perhaps schumann wasnt making for the truck maybe he did have another way out the man was brilliant after all he might have hidden without a sound without any warning a piece of hot metal touched the back of his head no his first thought was heidi my love how will you manage alone with the children in this mad world of ours oh no no dont move in barely accented german i wont is you schumann he asked in english give me the pistol kohl let the weapon go schumann took it from him a huge hand gripped his shoulder and turned the inspector around what eyes kohl thought chilled he reverted to his native language you are going to kill me yes schumann said nothing but patted the inspectors pockets for other weapons he stood back and then examined the field and forest around them apparently satisfied that they were alone the american reached into his shirt pocket and withdrew several pieces of paper damp with sweat he handed them to kohl who asked what is this read it schumann said kohl said please my spectacles glancing down at his breast pocket schumann lifted the glasses out he handed them to the inspector placing them on his nose he unfolded and read the documents quickly shocked by the words he looked up speechless staring into schumanns blue eyes he looked down and read the top page again ludwig you will find annexed hereto my draft letter to the leader about our study note that ive included a reference to the testing being done today at waltham we can add the results tonight at this early stage of the study i believe it is best that we refer to those killed by our subject soldiers as state criminals therefore you will see in the letter that the two jewish families we killed at gatow will be described as jew subversives the polish laborers killed at charlottenburg as foreign infiltrators the roma as sexual deviants and the young aryans at waltham today will be political dissidents oh our dear god in heaven he thought the gatow case the charlottenburg case another too gypsies murdered and those young men today with more planned they were killed simply as fodder for this barbarous study one sanctioned at the highest levels of government i schumann took the sheets back on your knees close your eyes kohl looked once more at the american ach yes these are the eyes of a killer he realized how had he missed the look earlier at the boardinghouse perhaps because there are so many killers among us now that we have grown immune willi kohl had acted humanely letting schumann go while he continued to investigate rather than send the man to sure death in an ss or gestapo cell hed saved the life of a wolf that had now turned on him oh he could tell schumann that he knew nothing about this horror yet why should the man believe him besides kohl thought with shame despite his ignorance about this particular monstrosity the inspector was undeniably linked to the people who had perpetrated it now schumann whispered fiercely kohl knelt in the leaves thinking of his wife recalling that when they were young first married they would picnic in the grünewald forest ah the size of the basket she packed the salt of the meat the resinous aroma of the wine the sour pickles the feel of her hand in his the inspector closed his eyes and said a prayer thinking that at least the national socialists hadnt found a way to make your spiritual communications a crime he was soon lost in a fervent narrative which god had to share with heidi and their children and then he realized that some moments had passed eyes still closed he listened carefully he heard only the wind through the trees the buzzing of insects an airplanes tenor motor high above him another endless minute or two finally he opened his eyes he debated then willi kohl slowly looked behind him expecting to hear the crack of a pistol shot at any moment no sign of schumann the large man had slipped silently from the clearing not far away he heard an internal combustion engine start then the mesh of gears he rose and as fast as his solid frame and difficult feet could manage trotted toward the sound he came to the grass service road and followed it toward the highway there was no sign of the labor service truck kohl veered in the direction of his dkw but he stopped quickly the hood was up and wires dangled schumann had disabled it he turned and hurried back down the road toward the academic building he arrived at the same time that two ss staff cars skidded to a stop nearby uniformed troops leapt out and immediately surrounded the mercedes in which ernst sat they drew their pistols and gazed out into the woods looking for threats kohl hurried across the clearing toward them the ss officers frowned at kohls approach and turned their weapons on him im kripo he called breathlessly and waved his identification card the ss commander gestured him over hail hitler hail kohl gasped a kripo inspector from berlin what are you doing here you heard the wireless report of the assault on colonel ernst no i followed the suspect here captain i didnt know his designs on the colonel though i wanted him in connection with a different matter the colonel and his guard didnt get a look at the assailant the ss man said to the inspector do you know what he looks like kohl hesitated a single word burned into the inspectors mind it seated itself like a lamprey and would not leave that word was duty finally kohl said yes yes i do know sir the ss commander said good ive ordered roadblocks throughout the area ill send them his description hes russian is he not thats what we heard no hes american kohl said and i can do better than merely describe him i know what vehicle hes driving and i have his photograph you have the commander asked frowning how he surrendered this to me earlier today willi kohl knew he had no choice still his heart cried in agony as he dug into his pocket and handed the passport to the commander chapter fortyone im a fool thought paul schumann he was in despair and there was no bottom to it piloting the labor service truck west along rough back roads that led to berlin looking in the mirror for signs that he was being followed a fool ernst had been in my sights i could have killed him and yet yet those others the young men would have died horrible deaths in that goddamn classroom hed told himself to forget them to touch the ice to do what hed come to this troubled country for but he hadnt been able to paul now slammed his palm against the steering wheel shaking with anger now how many others would die because of his decision every time he read that the national socialists had expanded their army that they had developed new weapons that their soldiers had engaged in training exercises that more people had disappeared from their homes that they had died bloody on the fourth square of concrete from the grass in the garden of beasts he would feel responsible and killing the monstrous keitel didnt take the horror out of his choice reinhard ernst a far worse man than anyone had ever imagined was still alive he felt tears fill his eyes fool bull gordon had picked him because he was so goddamn good oh sure he touched the ice but a better man a stronger man would not simply have gripped the cold he would have taken it into his soul and made the correct decision whatever the cost to those young men his face burning with shame paul schumann drove on heading back toward berlin where he would hide out until the rescue plane arrived in the morning then he rounded a bend and braked hard an army truck blocked the way standing beside it were six ss troopers two with machine guns paul hadnt thought they would set up roadblocks this quickly or on small roads like this he took both the pistols his and the inspectors and put them nearby on the seat paul gave a limp salute hail hitler hail hitler officer was the crisp reply from the ss commander though he glanced with a hint of derision at the labor service uniform which paul had put back on please what is the problem paul asked the commander approached the truck we are looking for someone in connection with an incident at waltham military college is that why ive seen all the official cars on the road paul asked heart slamming in his chest the ss officer grunted then he studied pauls face he was about to ask a question when a motorcycle pulled up and the driver killed the engine leapt off and hurried to the commander sir he said a kripo detective has learned the assassins identity heres his description pauls hand slowly curled around the luger he could kill these two but there were still the others nearby handing a sheet of paper to the commander the motorcyclist continued hes an american but he speaks german fluently the commander consulted the note he glanced at paul then back down at the paper he announced the suspect is about five feet six inches high and quite thin black hair and a mustache according to his passport his name is robert e gardner paul stared at the commander nodding silent gardner he wondered ach the ss officer asked why are you looking at me have you seen such a man or not no sir im sorry i havent gardner who was he wait yes paul remembered it was the name on one of robert taggerts fake passports kohl had given that documentation to the ss not pauls own the commander looked down at the sheet of paper again the detective reported that the man was driving a green audi sedan have you seen this vehicle in the area no sir in the mirror paul noticed two of the other officers looking in the back of the truck they called everythings fine here the commander continued if you see him or the audi you will contact the authorities immediately he shouted to the driver of the truck barricading the road let him pass hail hitler paul said with an enthusiasm he believed he hadnt heard anyone else use since hed arrived in germany yes yes hail hitler now move along an ss staff mercedes skidded to a stop outside building of waltham military college where willi kohl was watching dozens of troops prowl through the forest in search of the young men whod escaped from the classroom the door of the car opened and no less than heinrich himmler himself climbed out wiped his schoolteacher glasses with a handkerchief and strode up to the ss commander kohl and reinhard ernst who was out of the car now and surrounded by a dozen guards kohl raised his arm and himmler responded with a brief salute and then studied the man closely with his tight eyes you are kripo yes police chief himmler detectiveinspector kohl ah yes so you are willi herman kohl the detective was taken aback that the overlord of german police would know his name he recalled his sd file and felt all the more uneasy at the recognition the mousy man turned away and asked ernst you are unharmed yes but he killed several officers and my colleague doctorprofessor keitel where is the assassin the ss commander said sourly he escaped and who is he inspector kohl has learned his identity with a temerity that ernsts rank allowed but kohl would not dare use the colonel said abruptly look at the passport picture heinrich he was the same man who was at the olympic stadium he was standing one meter from the leader from all the ministers he was that close to us all gardner himmler asked uneasily gazing at the booklet the ss com mandant held up he was using a fake name at the stadium or this one is fake the small man looked up and frowned but why did he save your life at the stadium obviously he didnt save my life ernst snapped i wasnt in danger then he must have rigged the gun in the shed himself to make it appear that he was our ally to get under our defenses of course who knows whom else he was going to target after hed killed me perhaps the leader himself the report you told us about said that he was russian he added sharply but this is an american passport himmler fell silent for a moment eyes sweeping the dry leaves at their feet the americans would have no incentive to harm you of course i would guess that the russians hired him he looked at kohl how do you happen to know of this assassin purely a coincidence state police chief i followed him as a suspect in another case only after i arrived here to conduct surveillance did i realize that colonel ernst was present at the college and that the suspect had designs to kill him but surely you knew of the earlier attempt on colonel ernsts life himmler asked quickly the incident that the colonel was just referring to at the olympic stadium no sir i was not apprised of that you werent no sir kripo was not informed and i just met with chief of inspectors horcher no more than two hours ago he knew nothing of it either kohl shook his head i wish we had been informed sir i could have coordinated my case with the ss and gestapo so that this incident might not have happened and those soldiers not died youre saying that you did not know that our security forces were looking for a possible infiltrator as of yesterday himmler asked with the leaden delivery of a bad cabaret actor thats correct my police chief kohl looked into the mans tiny eyes framed by round blackrimmed glasses and knew that it had been himmler himself whod given the order to keep the kripo in the dark about the security alert he was after all the third empires michelangelo in the art of hoarding credit plundering glory and deflecting blame better even than göring kohl wondered if he himself was somehow at risk here a potentially disastrous security breach had occurred would it benefit himmler to sacrifice someone for the oversight kohls stock seemed high but sometimes a scapegoat was necessary especially when your intrigue has nearly gotten hitlers rearmament expert killed kohl made a quick decision and added and curiously i heard nothing from our gestapo liaison officer either we just met yesterday afternoon i wish hed mentioned the specific details of the security matter and who is your gestapo liaison that would be peter krauss sir ah the state chief of police nodded filing the information away and lost interest in willi kohl there were some political prisoners here too reinhard ernst said evasively a dozen or so young men they have escaped into the woods ive sent troops to find them his eyes strayed again to the deadly classroom kohl too looked at the building which seemed so benign a modest facility of higher learning dating from second empire prussia and yet which he now understood represented the purest of evils he noticed that ernst had had the soldiers remove the hose from the exhaust and drive the bus away the clipboard and some documents that had been scattered on the ground probably part of the abhorrent waltham study were likewise gone kohl said to himmler with your permission sir i would like to prepare a report as soon as possible and assist in finding the killer yes do so immediately inspector hail hail himmler said kohl turned and started toward some ss troopers beside a van to arrange for a ride back to berlin as he walked painfully toward them he decided that he could finesse the incident in such a way as to reduce the risk to himself true the picture in the passport matched the face of a man killed in a boardinghouse in southwest berlin before the attempt on ernsts life but only janssen paul schumann and käthe richter knew that the latter two would not be volunteering any information to the gestapo and as for the inspector candidate kohl would dispatch janssen to potsdam immediately for several days on one of the homicides that awaited their attention there and take control of all the files on taggert and the dresden alley murder tonight kohl would produce the body of the assassin who died while trying to escape the coroner would not of course have performed the autopsy yet if the corpse had even been picked up and kohl could make sure through favors or bribery that the time of death would be noted as occurring after the assassination attempt here at the school he doubted there would be any further inquiry the whole matter was now a dangerous embarrassment to himmler for being slack in state security and to ernst because of the incendiary waltham study he could oh kohl inspector kohl heinrich himmler called he turned yes sir how soon will your protégé be ready do you think the inspector thought for a moment and could make no sense of this ah yes police chief himmler my protégé konrad janssen how soon will he be transferring to the gestapo what did he mean kohls mind was blank for a moment himmler continued why you knew that we accepted him into the gestapo before his graduation from the police college didnt you but we wanted him to apprentice to one of the best investigators in the alex before he began working on prince albrecht street kohl felt the blow in his chest hearing this news but he recovered quickly forgive me state police chief the inspector said shaking his head and smiling of course i was aware the incident here has wholly occupied my mind regarding janssen hell be ready soon hes proving extremely talented weve had our eye on him for some time heydrich and i both you can be proud of that boy hes going to the top quickly i have a feeling hail hitler hail hitler devastated kohl walked away janssen hed planned all along to work for the secret political police the inspectors hands trembled with pain at this betrayal so the boy had lied about everything his desire to be a criminal detective about joining the party to rise through the gestapo and the sipo he would have to be a member and with a chill running through him he thought of the many indiscretions hed shared with the inspector candidate janssen you could have me arrested you know and sent to oranienburg for a year for saying what i just did still he reflected the inspector candidate needed kohl to get ahead and could not afford to denounce him perhaps the danger was not as great as it could have been kohl looked up from the ground at the coterie of ss troops standing around the van one of them a huge man in a black helmet asked yes can we help you he explained about his dkw the killer disabled it why did he bother he could have outrun you on foot the soldiers laughed yes yes well give you a ride inspector well leave in a few minutes kohl nodded and still numb with shock from learning about janssen climbed into the van and sat by himself he stared into the orange disk of the sun slipping behind a hillside bristling with the silhouettes of flowers and grass he slouched head against the back of the seat the ss troops got into the vehicle and they started off out of the college heading southeast back to berlin the soldiers talked about the attempted assassination and the olympic games and plans for a big national socialist rally outside of spandau this coming weekend it was at this moment that the inspector came to a decision his choice seemed absurdly impulsive as fast as the sudden vanishing of the sun below the horizon brilliant color in the sky one moment then nothing but a bluegray dimness an instant later but perhaps he reflected his was no conscious choice at all but was inevitable and had been determined long long before by immutable laws in the same way that day had to become dusk willi kohl and his family would leave germany konrad janssens betrayal and the waltham study both stark emblems of what the government was and where it was going were reason enough yet what truly decided the matter was the american paul schumann standing with the ss officers outside building aware that he had both schumanns real passport and taggerts fake ones in his pocket kohl had agonized over doing his duty and in the end he had done so but the sorrow was that his obligation had dictated he act against his country as for how he would leave he knew that too he would remain ignorant of janssens choice but would of course cease his improvident asides to the young man he would mouth whatever lines chief of inspectors horcher wished him to he would stay well clear of the basement of kripo headquarters with its busy dehomag cardsorting machines he would handle murders like the one in gatow exactly the way they wished him to which was of course to handle them not at all he would be the model national socialist policeman and then in february he would take his entire family with him to the international criminal police commission conference in london and from there they would sail for new york to which two cousins had emigrated some years ago and had made lives for themselves being a senior official traveling on kripo business he could easily arrange for exit documents and permission to take a good amount of money out of the country there would be some tricky maneuvering of course in making the arrangements but who in germany nowadays did not have some skill at intrigue heidi would welcome the change of course finding a haven for her children günter would be saved from his nazi youth classmates hilde could attend school once again and perhaps become the professor she wished to be his older daughter had a complication of course her fiancé heinrich sachs but kohl decided he would convince the man to come with them sachs was vehemently antinational socialist had no close relatives and was so completely in love with charlotte that he would follow her anywhere the young sachs was a talented civil servant spoke english well and despite some bouts of arthritis he was a tireless worker kohl suspected that he would have a far easier time finding a job in america than would kohl himself as for the inspector starting over in middle age what an overwhelming challenge he thought ironically of the leaders nonsensical opus my struggle well what a struggle he himself would have a tired man with a family beginning again at an age when he should be delegating cases to young inspectors and taking halfdays off to escort his children to the wavemaking pool at luna park yet it was not the thought of the effort and uncertainty awaiting him that made him choke quietly and that drew tears from his eyes which he averted from the young ss troopers no the tears were for what he was now looking at as they swept around a turn en route to berlin the plains of prussia and though they were dusty and wan on this dry summer evening they still exuded a grandeur and palpable significance for they were the plains of his germany a great nation at heart whose truths and ideals had somehow tragically been stolen by thieves kohl reached into his pocket and pulled out his meerschaum pipe he filled the bowl then searched his jacket but could find no match he heard a rasp as the ss trooper sitting next to him struck one and held it out for him thank you kohl said and sucked on the stem to ignite the tobacco he sat back filling the air around him with the scent of pungent cherries and stared out the front windshield as the lights of berlin came into view chapter fortytwo the car wove like a dancer along the road to his home in charlottenburg reinhard ernst sat in the back bracing himself against the turns his head resting on the luxurious leather he had a new driver and guard claus the ss lieutenant with him at waltham college had been injured by glass flying from a window of the mercedes and had been taken to a surgeon another ss car filled with blackhelmeted guards was behind them he removed his glasses and rubbed his eyes ach keitel dead along with the soldier taking part in the study subject d was how ernst thought of him hed never even known the mans name what a disaster this day had been yet the one thing that stood out most prominently in ernsts thoughts was the choice that the killer had made outside building if hed wanted to kill me the colonel reflected which was clearly his mission he could have easily yet he had decided not to hed rescued the young men instead reflecting on this act the horror of what ernst had been doing became clear yes he realized the waltham study was abominable he had looked those young men in the face and told them serve in the army for a year and your sins will be absolved all the while knowing that this was a lie hed spun the fiction solely to keep the victims relaxed and unsuspecting so that the soldier could get to know them before he killed them yes hed lied to the fischer brothers just as hed lied to the polish workers when hed said they would receive double pay to transplant some trees near charlottenburg for the olympics and hed lied to the jewish families in gatow telling them to assemble by the riverside because there were some renegade stormtroopers nearby and ernst and his men would protect them ernst didnt dislike jews hed fought beside some in the war and found them as smart and courageous as everyone else indeed based on the jews hed known then and since he couldnt find any difference between them and aryans as for poles well his reading of history told him they too were not so very different from their prussian neighbors and indeed had a nobility that few national socialists possessed repugnant what he was doing with the study horrifying he felt a twist of razorsharp shame within him like the searing pain in his arm when the hot shrapnel had ripped into his shoulder in the war the road now straightened and they approached the neighborhood where he lived ernst leaned forward and gave the driver directions to his home abominable yes and yet as he looked around him at the familiar buildings and cafés and parks of this portion of charlottenburg the horror began to dull just as happened on the battlefield after the last mauser or enfield was fired the cannon salvos ceased the cries of the wounded abated he recalled tonight watching the recruitment officer subject d who had willingly cavalierly hooked up the deadly hose to the school even though hed been playing soccer with the victims shortly before another soldier might have balked altogether had he not died his answers to the doctorprofessors questionnaire would have been extremely helpful in establishing the criteria they would use to match soldiers and duties the weakness hed felt a moment ago the contrition prompted by the assassins choice to forsake his own duty vanished suddenly he was once again convinced he was doing the right thing let hitler have his fling with madness some innocents would die yes until the storm blew over but eventually the leader would be gone while the army ernst was creating would outlast him and be the backbone of a new german glory and ultimately a new european peace sacrifices had to be made tomorrow ernst would begin searching for another psychologist or doctorprofessor who might help him continue the work and this time he would find one who was more attuned to the spirit of national socialism than keitel and one without jewish grandparents for gods sake ernst must be more clever this was a time in history when one had to be clever the car pulled up in front of his house ernst thanked the driver and stepped out the ss troops in the car behind his leapt out as well and joined the others already guarding his residence the commander told him that the men would remain until the assassin was caught or it could be verified that hed been killed or fled the country ernst politely thanked him as well and walked inside he greeted gertrud with a kiss she glanced at the grass and mud stains on his pants ach you are hopeless reinie without explaining he smiled wanly she returned to the kitchen where she was cooking something fragrant with vinegar and garlic ernst climbed the stairs to wash and change his clothes he saw his grandson in his room drawing on a tablet of paper opa the boy cried and ran to him hello mark are we going to work on our boat tonight he didnt respond and ernst realized the little boy was frowning what is the matter opa you called me mark that was papas name had he im sorry rudy i was not thinking clearly im very tired today i believe i need a nap yes i take naps too the boy said eagerly happy to please his grandfather with his knowledge in the afternoon sometimes i get tired mutti gives me hot milk cocoa sometimes and then i have a nap exactly thats how your foolish grandfather feels its been a long day and he needs a nap now you get the wood and knives ready after supper we will work on our boat yes opa ill do it now close to pm bull gordon walked up the steps to the room in manhattan the city was busy and vibrant in other neighborhoods even on sunday but here the cross street was still the blinds were closed and the town house appeared deserted but as gordon wearing civvies today approached the front door opened before he even took the key from his pocket afternoon sir the uniformed naval officer said in a soft voice gordon nodded the senators in the parlor sir alone thats right gordon walked inside hung his topcoat on a rack in the hallway he felt the weapon in his pocket he wouldnt need it probably but he was glad it was there he drew a deep breath and walked into the small room the senator was sitting in an armchair beside a tiffany floor lamp he was listening to the philco radio when he saw gordon he shut it off and asked tiring flight theyre always tiring seems that way gordon walked to the bar and poured himself a scotch maybe not a good idea what with the gun but to hell with it he added another finger to the glass he offered a querying glance to the senator sure only double that he nodded at gordons glass the commander poured smoky liquid into another glass and handed it to the older man he sat down heavily his head still throbbed from the flight in the rd the naval version of the dc it was just as fast but lacked the comfortable wicker chairs and soundproofing of the douglas commercial line the senator was wearing a suit waistcoat and stiffcollared shirt with a silk tie gordon wondered if it had been what hed worn to church that morning hed once told the commander that whatever a politician personally believed even if he was an atheist he had to go to church image it counts the senator said gruffly so you may as well tell me what you know get it over with the commander took a deep sip of whisky and did just what the old man asked berlin sat under a veil of night the city was a huge expanse flat except for the few cloudcatchers of the skyline and the tempelhof airport beacon to the south this view vanished as the driver piloted his vehicle over the crest of the hill and plunged into the ordered northwestern neighborhoods of the city among cars apparently returning from their weekends at nearby prussian lakes and mountains all of which made driving particularly difficult and paul schumann wanted to make certain he was not stopped by the traffic police no identification a stolen truck no it was vital to be inconspicuous he turned down a street that led to a bridge across the spree and worked his way south finally he found what he sought an open lot in which dozens of delivery vehicles and vans were parked hed noticed this as hed walked from lützow plaza to käthe richters boardinghouse along the canal when hed first arrived in the city could that only have been yesterday he thought again about her and about otto webber too as hard as it was to picture them though those images were better than dwelling on his pitiful decision at waltham on the best day on the worst day the sun finally sets but it would be a long long time before the sun set on his failure today maybe it never would he parked between two large vans killed the engine he sat back wondering if it was crazy to return here but he concluded that it was probably a wise move he wouldnt have to stay long smoothfaced avery and buckingforafight manielli would make sure the pilot took off promptly for the rendezvous at the aerodrome besides he sensed instinctively he was safer here than anywhere outside the city beasts as arrogant as the national socialists would never suspect that their prey was hiding squarely in the middle of their garden the door opened and the orderly let another man into the room where bull gordon and the senator sat in his trademark white suit looking every inch a plantation owner from a hundred years ago cyrus clayborn walked inside and nodded to the two men with a casual smile on his ruddy face then he squinted and nodded once more he glanced at the liquor cabinet but didnt make a move toward it he was an abstainer bull gordon knew they have any coffee here clayborn asked no ah clayborn set his walking stick against the wall near the door and said you only ask me here when you need money and i suspect youre not after alms today he sat heavily its the other thing huh its the other thing gordon echoed wheres your man my bodyguard clayborn cocked his head right outside in the car relieved that he wouldnt need his pistol after all clayborns minder was notoriously dangerous gordon called one of the three navy men in an office near the front door and told him to make sure the fellow stayed inside the limo not to let him into the town house use any force you need to yes sir with pleasure sir gordon hung up and saw the financier chuckling dont tell me you were thinkin itd come to sixguns commander when the officer said nothing clayborn asked so howd you tip to it fellow named albert heinsler gordon replied who you oughta know grumbled the senator he was on the manhattan because of you gordon continued the nazisre smart sure but we thought why would they have a spy on the ship that seemed bum to me we knew heinsler was with the jersey division of the germanamerican bund so we had hoover put some pressure on them doesnt that faggot have anything better to do with his time clayborn grumbled we found out youre a big contributor to the bund mans gotta put his money to work somehow he said glibly making gordon detest him all the more the magnate nodded heinsler was his name huh never knew it he was just on board to keep an eye on schumann and get a message to berlin about a russian being in town needed to keep the huns on alert make our little play more credible you know all part of the act how did you know taggert served with me in the war promised him some diplomatic postings if he helped me out here the senator shook his head we couldnt figure out how you got the pass codes he laughed and nodded toward gordon at first the commander here thought i was the one sold schumann out thats okay though didnt ruffle my feathers but then bull remembered your companies you control every telephone and telegraph line on the east coast you had somebody listen in when i called the commander and we decided on the codes thats baloney i gordon said one of my men checked your companys files cyrus you had transcripts of the conversations between the senator and me you found out everything clayborn shrugged more amused than troubled which really rubbed gordon the wrong way the commander snapped weve got it all clayborn he explained how the original idea to kill reinhard ernst had come from the magnate who suggested it to the senator patriotic duty hed said hed help fund the assassination hell hed fund the whole thing the senator had gone to certain people high in the administration and theyd approved the operation on the sly but clayborn had secretly called robert taggert and ordered him to kill morgan meet schumann and help him plot to kill ernst then save the german colonel at the last minute when gordon had gone to him to ask for the extra thousand bucks clayborn had kept up the pretense that it was morgan not taggert whom gordon was talking to whys it so important to you to keep hitler happy gordon asked clayborn scoffed youre a fool if youre ignoring the jew threat theyre plotting all over the world not to mention the communists and for gods sake the coloreds we cant let our guard down for a minute disgusted gordon snapped so thats what thiss all about jews and negroes before the old man could answer though the senator said oh ill betcha theres something else bull money right cyrus bingo the whitehaired man whispered the germans owe us billions all the loans we floated to keep them going over the past fifteen years we have to keep hitler and schacht and the rest of the money boys over there happy so our notes keep getting paid theyre rearming to start another war gordon growled clayborn said matteroffactly all the better to be on their side then dont you think bigger market for our arms he pointed a finger at the senator provided you fools in congress get rid of the neutrality act then he frowned so what do the huns think about the ernst situation oh well its a goddamn mess the senator raged taggert tells them about an assassination but the killer escapes and tries again then taggert disappears publicly theyre talking about the russians hiring an american assassin but in private theyre wondering if we werent behind the whole thing clayborn grimaced in disgust and taggert then he nodded dead sure and schumann did it well thats the way it goes so gentlemen i suppose this is the end of our fine working relationship reggie morgans dead because of you youre guilty of some pretty bad crimes here cyrus the man brushed a white eyebrow how bout you funding this little outing with private money oh thatd make a nice topic for a congressional hearing dontcha think we have ourselves a standoff here looks like so im thinking its best we both go our separate ways and keep mum good night now oh and keep buying stock in my company if you civil servants can afford any its only going to go up clayborn stood slowly he picked up his cane and headed for the door gordon decided that whatever the consequences whatever happened to his own career hed make sure clayborn get didnt away with this not after the man had murdered reginald morgan and nearly killed schumann but larger justice would have to wait there was only one matter that needed attention at the moment i want schumanns money the commander said what money the ten thousand you promised him oh he didnt produce the huns suspect us and my mans dead schumanns outa luck no dough youre not going to chisel him sorry the businessman said not looking the least contrite well in that case cyrus the senator called good luck well keep our fingers crossed for you gordon added the businessman stopped looked back im just thinking what might happen if schumann finds out you not only tried to kill him but you stiffed him too knowing his line of work and all gordon chimed in again you wouldnt dare hell be back here in a week ten days the industrialist sighed all right all right he reached into his pocket and pulled out a booklet of bank drafts he tore one out and started to write gordon shook his head nope youre going to go dig up some good oldfashioned scratch right now now not next week sunday night ten thousand now the senator echoed if paul schumann wants greenbacks greenbacksre what were going to give him chapter fortythree they were sick of waiting during their weekend in amsterdam lieutenants andrew avery and vincent manielli had seen tulips in every color imaginable and looked at plenty of fine paintings and flirted with pageboyed blondes who had round rosy faces manielli at least avery being contentedly married theyd enjoyed the company of a dashing royal air force flier named len aarons who was in the country on his own intrigues about which he was as evasive as the americans theyd drunk quarts of amstel beer and cloying genever gin but life on a foreign army base wears thin fast and in truth they were also tired of hanging from tenterhooks worrying about paul schumann now though the waiting was over at a m monday morning the twinengine plane streamlined as a gull flared for a moment and then touched down on the grass field at machteldt aerodrome outside of amsterdam it settled onto its tail wheel and slowed then taxied toward the hangar weaving in a zigzag since the pilot couldnt see over the raised nose when the plane was on the ground avery waved as the sleek silver plane eased toward them i think ill go a few rounds with him manielli shouted over the sound of the engines and prop wash who avery asked schumann do some sparring i watched him hes not as good as he thinks he is the lieutenant looked his colleague over and laughed what hed eat you like a box of cracker jack and spit out the prize im younger im faster youre stupider the plane eased up to a parking strip and the pilot cut the engines the props coughed to a stop and the ground crew ran out to chock the wheels under the big pratt whitneys the lieutenants walked up to the door theyd tried to think of something to get schumann a present but couldnt figure out what manielli had said well tell him we gave him his first airplane ride thatll be his present but avery had said no you cant tell somebody that something youve already done for them is a present manielli figured the lieutenant would know this married men knew all about the protocols of giving presents so they bought him a carton of packs o pleasure chesterfields which had taken them some effort and expense to find in holland manielli now held it under his arm one of the ground crew walked to the door of the plane and pulled it down it became stairs the lieutenants stepped forward grinning but stopped fast as a man in his early twenties wearing filthy clothing stepped into the doorway hunched over because of the low clearance he blinked held his hand up to shelter his eyes from the sun then climbed down the stairs guten morgen bitte ich bin georg mattenberg he threw his arms around avery and hugged him heartily then he walked past him rubbing his eyes as if hed just awakened who the hells he manielli whispered avery shrugged and then stared at the door as other men emerged there were five altogether all in their twenties or late teens in good shape but exhausted and blearyeyed unshaven their clothes tattered and stained with sweat its the wrong plane manielli whispered jesus where its the right plane his fellow officer said but he was no less confused lieutenant avery an accented voice called from the doorway a man a few years older than the others climbed out another younger joined him thats me who are you i speak english better as the others i will answer i am kurt fischer and this is my brother hans he laughed at the lieutenants expression and said you are not expecting us yes yes but paul schumann saved us he told a story about how schumann had rescued a dozen young men from being gassed to death by the nazis the american had managed to round up some of them as they fled into a forest and offered them the chance to escape from the country some wanted to stay and take their chances but seven had agreed to leave including the fischer brothers schumann had loaded them into the back of a labor service truck where theyd grabbed shovels and burlap bags and masqueraded as workers hed driven them through a roadblock to safety in berlin where they hid out for the night at dawn he droved us out to a old aerodrome outside of the city where we got on this airplane and here we are avery was about to pepper the man with more questions but at that moment a woman appeared in the doorway of the airplane she was around forty quite thin as tired as the others her brown eyes quickly snapped up everything around her she climbed down the stairs in one hand was a small suitcase in the other a book whose cover had been torn off maam avery said casting another perplexed gaze at his colleague you are lieutenant avery or perhaps you are lieutenant manielli her english was perfect with only a slight accent i well yes im avery the woman said my name is käthe richter this is for you she handed him a letter he opened it and nudged manielli they both read gordon avery and manelli or however the hell you spell it get these people into england or america or wherever they want to go find homes for them get them set up i dont care how you do it but make sure it happens and if youre thinking about sending them back to germany just remember that damon runyon or one of my buddies at the sun or the post would be pretty interested in what you sent me to berlin for now thatd be one hell of a news story esp in an election year its been swell boys paul ps theres a negro living in the back room of my gym sorry williams have the place signed over to him however that works and give him some dough too be generous there is this as well she said and gave avery several tattered pages typed in german its about something called the waltham study paul said the commander should see it avery took the document and put it in his pocket ill make sure he gets it manielli walked to the airplane avery joined him and they looked into the empty cabin he didnt trust us he thought we were going to hand him over to dewey after all and had the pilot land somewhere else before they got here france you think manielli suggested maybe he got to know it during the war no i know ill bet it was switzerland stung that schumann had thought theyd renege on their deal avery called toward the cockpit hey where did you drop him off what where did you land to drop schumann off the pilot frowned as he glanced at the copilot then he looked back at avery his voice echoed through the tinny fuselage you mean he didnt tell you epilogue saturday november a cold night in the black forest two men trudged through the shallow snow they were chilled certainly but they were men who seemed to have a destination in mind and an important task to perform once they arrived purpose like desire invariably numbs the body to discomfort as does the powerful austrian liquor obstler which theyd been drinking liberally from a shared flask how is your belly paul schumann asked his companion in german noticing a particularly pronounced wince on the mans mustachioed face the man gave a grunt it hurts of course it will always hurt mr john dillinger after his return to berlin paul had made a few subtle inquiries at the aryan café to learn where otto webber had lived hed wanted to do what he could to help any of the mans girls hed gone to see one berthe and learned to his shock and joy that webber was still alive the bullet that had punctured the mans gut in the warehouse by the spree had caused serious but not lethal damage during its brief transit through his substantial flesh he had floated halfway down the river in his viking funeral boat before some fishermen pulled him out and decided he wasnt as dead as he looked they got him into a bed and stanched the bleeding soon he was in the care of an old gangring doctor who for a price of course stitched him up no questions asked the later infection was worse than the wound lugers webber had griped they fire the filthiest of bullets the toggle allows in germs but berthe made up for her inability to cook or keep house by being an infinitely dedicated nurse and she spent some months with pauls help getting the german gangster back to health paul moved into another boardinghouse in a forgotten portion of the city far from magdeburger alley and alexander plaza and lay low for a time he did some sparring in gyms picked up some marks here and there in printing plants and occasionally dated local women mostly former socis or artists or writers whod gone to ground in places like berlin north and november square during the first weeks of august he would go regularly to a post office or viewing hall to watch the olympics live on the telefunken or fernseh television sets installed there for those who couldnt get tickets to the games playing the good national socialist with his bleached aryan hair no less he would have forced himself to scowl each of the four times jesse owens won a gold medal but it turned out that most of the germans sitting around him enthusiastically cheered the negros victories the germans won the most gold medals which didnt surprise anybody but the us won plenty and came in second the only shadow over the event paul had been troubled to see was that americas jewish runners stoller and glickman had indeed been pulled from the relay after the games concluded and august moved toward september pauls holiday came to an end determined to make up for his lapse in judgment at the waltham military college he resumed his quest to kill germanys plenipotentiary for domestic stability but webbers weathervane system of civil servants reported some interesting information reinhard ernst had disappeared all they could learn was that his office at the chancellory had been vacated it seemed that hed moved out of berlin with his family and was spending a great deal of time on the road he was given a new title like ribbons and medals paul had learned titles were tossed out by national socialists like corn to chickens ernst was now the state overleader for special industrial liaison no other details about him could be learned did this mean that hed been put out to pasture or were these merely security measures to protect the rearmament tzar paul schumann had no idea but one thing was clear germanys military buildup was proceeding at a breakneck pace that fall the new fighter plane the me manned by german pilots made its combat debut in spain helping franco and his nationalist troops the plane was stunningly successful decimating republican positions the german army was conscripting more and more young men and navy yards were working at full capacity to produce warships and submarines by october even the outoftheway neighborhoods of berlin were growing more and more dangerous and as soon as otto webber was well enough to travel he and paul took to the road how far to neustadt the american now asked not far ten kilometers or so ten paul grumbled god in heaven in fact though he was glad that their next destination wasnt nearby best to put some distance between them and st margen their most recent stop where schupo officers were perhaps just now finding the body of a local national socialist party boss hed been a brutal man who would order his thugs to round up and beat merchants then aryanize their businesses he had many enemies who wished to do him harm but the kripo or gestapo investigation would reveal that the circumstances of his death were hardly questionable it was obvious that he had stopped his car by the roadside to relieve himself in the river and lost his footing on the icy shore hed fallen twenty feet and crushed his head on the rocks then drowned in the fastflowing river a halfempty bottle of schnapps was found beside him a sorrowful accident no need to look further paul now considered their next destination neustadt they had learned would be the site of a speech by one of hermann görings front men the headliner at a miniature nuremberg rally that was currently under way paul had heard the man speak inciting citizens to destroy the houses of jews in the vicinity he called himself doctor but he was nothing but a bigoted criminal a petty man a dangerous man and one who would prove to be just as accidentprone as the party leader in st margen if paul and webber were successful perhaps another fall or maybe he would knock an electric lamp into the bathtub with him there was always the possibility too that being as unbalanced as many national socialist leaders seemed to be the man might be inclined to shoot or hang himself in a fit of madness after neustadt they would hightail it to munich where god bless him webber had yet another of his girls with whom they could stay headlights flared behind them and the two men took to the woods quickly and remained there until the truck passed when the taillights vanished around a bend in the road the men continued on their way ach mr john dillinger you know what this road was used for tell me otto this was the center of the cuckoo clock trade you have heard of them sure my grandmother had one my grandfather kept taking the weights off the chains so it wouldnt run hated that damn clock every hour cookoo cookoo and this is the very road that the traders used to carry them to market there are not so many clock makers now but at one time you would see carts going up and down this highway at all hours of the night and day ach and look there you see that river it feeds the danube and the rivers on the other side of the road feed the rhine this is the heart of my country isnt it a beautiful place in the moonlight nearby an owl called the wind sighed and the ice coating the tree branches tapped like peanut shells on a barroom floor the man is right paul thought it is a beautiful place and he felt within him a contentment as crisp as the dayold snow beneath his boots the most improbable turn of events had made him a resident of this alien land but hed come to decide that it was far less alien to him than the country where his brothers printing plant awaited a world to which he knew hed never return no hed left that life behind years ago left behind any circumstance involving modest commerce a neatly shingled house a bright loving wife playful children but this was perfectly fine with him paul schumann wanted nothing more than what he had at this moment to be walking under the coy eye of a halfmoon with a likeminded companion at his side on a journey to fulfill the purpose god had given him even if that role was the difficult and presumptuous task of correcting his mistakes authors note while the story of paul schumanns mission to berlin is purely fiction and the reallife individuals did not of course play the roles i gave them the history geography technology and cultural and political institutions in the united states and germany during the summer of are otherwise accurate the allies naivete about and ambivalence toward hitler and the national socialists were as i have described them german rearmament occurred very much as i portrayed it though it was not a single individual like my fictional reinhard ernst but a number of men who had the task of making the country ready for the war that hitler had long envisioned there was indeed a place known as the room in manhattan and the office of naval intelligence was the countrys cia of its day portions of hitlers mein kampf were the inspiration for the radio broadcasts throughout the story and while there was no waltham study per se such research was undertaken although somewhat later than i have it in the book by ss troops responsible for mass exterminations known as einstatzgruppen under the direction of artur nebe who had at one time headed the kripo the nazi government was using dehomag cardsorting machines for tracking its citizens in though they were not to my knowledge ever located at kripo headquarters the international criminal police commission which proved to be willi kohls salvation did in fact meet in london in early the organization ultimately became interpol sachsenhausen concentration camp officially replaced the old camp at oranienburg in the late summer of for the next nine years more than political and racial prisoners were held there tens of thousands were executed or died from beatings abuse starvation and illness the occupying russians in turn used the facility as a prison to house some sixty thousand nazis and other political prisoners of whom an estimated twelve thousand died before the camp was closed in as for otto webbers favorite gin mill the aryan café permanently closed its door shortly after the olympic games ended a brief note here regarding the fate of several characters appearing in the story in the spring of as germany lay in ruins hermann göring came to the mistaken belief that adolf hitler was abdicating control of the country and asked to succeed him to görings shame and horror hitler was incensed and labeled him a backstabber casting him out of the nazi party and ordering his arrest at the nuremberg war crimes trial göring was sentenced to die he killed himself two hours before his scheduled execution in despite being the supreme sycophant heinrich himmler made independent peace overtures to the allies the head of the ss and architect of the nazis massmurder programs actually suggested that jews and the nazis should forget the past and bury the hatchet like göring he was labeled a traitor by hitler as the country fell he tried to escape justice by fleeing in disguise but for some reason the persona he chose to assume was that of a gestapo military policeman which meant automatic arrest his real identity was immediately discovered he killed himself before he could stand trial at nuremberg toward the end of the war adolf hitler grew increasingly unstable physically debilitated it is believed he had parkinsons disease and despondent planning military offensives with divisions that no longer existed calling upon all citizens to fight to the death and ordering albert speer to institute a scorchedearth plan which the architect refused to do hitler spent his last days in a bunker complex beneath the chancellory garden on april he married his mistress eva braun and soon after they both committed suicide paul joseph goebbels remained loyal to hitler until the end and was appointed his successor following the führers suicide goebbels attempted to negotiate peace with the russians the efforts were futile and the former propaganda minister and his wife magda also took their own lives after she had murdered their six children earlier in his career hitler said of his military expansion that led to the second world war it will be my duty to carry on this war regardless of losses we shall have to abandon much that is dear to us and today seems irreplaceable cities will become heaps of ruins noble monuments of architecture will disappear forever this time our sacred soil will not be spared but i am not afraid of this the empire that hitler claimed would survive for a thousand years lasted for twelve acknowledgments with
