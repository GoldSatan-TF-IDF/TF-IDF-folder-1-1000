fathers henry greiner and greg miller true servants of god provided the spiritual consolation we so desperately craved but finally crucially this book is dedicated to matthew god love you son watch over us we did our best to watch over you give sorrow words the grief that does not speak whispers the oerfraught heart and bids it break shakespeare macbeth prologue the return of the ancient mariner a wellknown novelist friend i see him seldom but think of him fondly once began a famous book with one of the most arresting passages ive ever encountered the novel was ghost story its author peter straub and this is how he started what was the worst thing youve ever done i wont tell you that but ill tell you the worst thing that ever happened to me the most dreadful thing precisely ive borrowed peters words because they so perfectly express what im feeling the worst thing ive ever done ill leave that troubling question for a different book but the worst thing that ever happened to me the most dreadful thing i can tell you that with absolute certainty indeed with terrible compulsion i find myself driven to describe that ordeal my effort isnt voluntary it comes in torturous rushes distraught i remind myself of coleridges ancient mariner in a frenzy stopping friends and strangers to tell of my woe as if by describing it often enough i can numb myself and blunt the wordsand in so doing heal myself of the cause behind the words the efforts impossible i suspect certainly it didnt work for the ancient mariner after killing a bird of good omen and enduring a consequent nightmarish sea voyage he managed to return to shore forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched with a woful agony which forced me to begin my tale and then it left me free left him free well apparently not for coleridge adds a marginal note that ever and anon throughout his future life an agony constraineth him to travel from land to land since then at an uncertain hour that agony returns and till my ghastly tale is told this heart within me burns im no more free than the ancient mariner to be sure i havent killed a bird of good omen though i recently saw a metaphoric version of such a bird dieand three days later i saw a literal bird very much alive that seemed to be a reincarnation of the departed soul of the first a cryptic reference you bet necessarily so and soon to be explained a mystical experience and along with terror sorrow agony guilt compassion god and redemption its very much a part of my tale for like the ancient mariner my heart surely burns to tell youonce and for all to be done with my tale to exorcise my demons to gain and preserve my faith men fear death as children fear to go in the dark and as that natural fear in children is increased with tales so is the other francis bacon of death fear for almost twenty years as a fiction writer ive focused on terror as my main subject ive always believed as sartre in nausea that real life is so fundamentally boring that we need adventure fiction to help soothe our ennui to take us out of the doldrums of actuality the paradox of course is that if we ever truly experienced a thriller we would find it so terrifying we would wish with all the power of our being to be returned to the safe but depressing boredom of reality t s eliot puts it this way in sweeney agonistes ill carry you off to a cannibal isle nothing to eat but the fruit as it grows nothing at all but three things what things birth and copulation and death id be bored bored i dont think so not me any longer for i have seen real life at its starkest ive learned that copulation and birth have an unavoidable consequence death despite what i used to think and what sartre thought i know this muchthat real life whatever else it might be isnt boring because recently i was overwhelmed by a massive dose of my subject matter i came facetoface with terror and now i have trouble writing thrillers having encountered death i find that to write about it using the conventions of a thriller makes me feel im holding back leaving out deaths grisly secret and yet to include that secret would be to negate the distracting purpose of a thriller so to tell my tale ive compromised most of what youre about to read is fact i still cant believe it happened but god have mercy it did and i feel an obligation to tell it since others have suffered as i and my family have perhaps from our experience and the lessons we strained to learn others will learn and find solace in the aftermath of the loss we endured we took great comfort in harold s kushners when bad things happen to good people but the book youre now reading is different from kushners in many respects for one thing his excellent volume though prompted as was mine by a personal tragedy is a wideranging discussion of crises of faith that he encountered among troubled members of his synagogue for another his book is totally factual however fireflies devotes itself exclusively to one familys tragedy and though almost completely factual it does have elements of fiction not the fireflies the dove and the other mystical experiences i will describe i assure you they did happen still because i wanted to make a statement about grief about faith and the afterlife i imposed a frame of fiction onto fact in an epilogue ill explain where fact and fiction diverge ill also explain my reasons for blending the two and my conclusion will i hope be spiritually rewarding can i see anothers woe and not be in sorrow too can i see anothers grief and not seek for kind relief william blake songs of innocence on anothers sorrow part one to fear to go into the dark now he was old one month shy of his eightyfourth birthday his daughter sarie not so young herself sixtyone stood beside his deathbed in the shadowy raspy confines of an isolation room in intensive care shadowy because the blinds had been closed to ease the strain on his aching eyes raspy because no matter how faint his hearing had become he couldnt fail to register the constant hiss wheeze and thump of the respirator thrusting oxygen down the constricting tube in his throat no doubt there were odorsof medication of his own diseased bodybut hed become so accustomed to the pungent sicksweet acrid smells of the hospital that he no longer detected them basically david thought im all messed up well what do you expect he told himself you learned forty years agocancers nobodys friend and an old fart like you had to run out of resilience some time like five years ago when your wife died but the true erosion of his spirit had begun much earlier with the death of his son of fifteen years on that night forty years ago when the cancer that now soon would kill the father had killed the son the circle was being completed an agony of soul a torture of spirit produced by death would conclude with death matthew the son for whom david had mourned all his life would no longer be an absence beyond toleration no longer a loss so profound that the passage of time intensified instead of mollified the pain grief which smothered and swallowed like a gathering black hole would soon with damnable mercy end death stops all hurt certainly david had tried to console himself with that thought in the first weeks after matthews death at least my dear unlucky sons at rest hed repeatedly tried to assure himself matthews six months of suffering of chemotherapy nausea and blackanddecker chainsaw surgery had mercifully stopped but if matt hadnt gotten the tumor or if the chemotherapy had managed to work if the surgery had been effective hed have survived in that respect matts death wasnt merciful at all it was a vicious trick inflicted on a boy whose strength of character against panic and pain had made him truly already a man death stops all hurt you bet it stops everything including my son david thought and now when its my turn i dont care because ive lived my life such as it was and id have given anything to take matts place because his love for life was greater than mine existence made him laugh and my wonderful doomed son should have had the chance to continue laughing so david thought during his dwindling moments in intensive care in his morphine stupor he couldnt communicate his despair to the nurses who with stoic skill kept watch on his iv pumps urine catheter heartbeat and blood pressure monitors he probably wouldnt have told the nurses anyhow wouldnt have demeaned the purpose that they had managed to find in life their solace in alleviating pain nor could he have told sarie his sweet wonderful child of sixtyone that she shouldnt grieve for his pain and impending death because he didnt grieve for himself the pain didnt matter it was no more than he expected and as far as his death was concerned well that would be a release that over the years hed many times considered granting to himself though for the sake of his loving wife and daughter hed rejected that assault to their sanity sarie stood over him her face contorted with exhaustion sorrow and fear using cloths soaked in ice to wipe his fevered brow just as he and donna had with equal primal stress and devotion wiped matthews brow full circle the daughter become the parent the son become the father and what did it matter love in the end was the greatest hurt to love was to suffer lossthe more profound the devotion the worse the grief the noblest human emotion was fated to end in the greatest hell so david did his best to smile around the irritating oxygen tube crammed down his throat and to squeeze his daughters hand in thanks after all he and donna had raised her to value loyalty and compassion and there was no need at this late date to disillusion her to signal that hed been wrong to warn sarie that love in the end brought loss and pain in his morphine delirium david thought of his dead wife donna and how much he missed her not because she was beautiful as the fashion world knows beauty though for all that shed been beautiful to him and not because shed been perfectly understanding and kind and forgiving god knows shed had a temper and could be maddeningly impatient and obstinate but shed been his companion for sixtytwo years and a coupleif they had the stamina to negotiate a long marriagelearned to make adjustments to compromise and compensate to allow to tolerate what it came down to was that both of them had reached a truce based on mutual protection sympathy and respect human imperfection and dissatisfaction produced a bond of pity and support neither husband nor wife could persist without the others loving help but donna had died as all organisms must in her case from a stroke the fated consequence of lifelong hypertension and how david had grieved and how he had missed her in his lonely bed for the missed pleasure of merely holding her at his solitary dinner table for the absence of a conversation based on threequarters of a lifetime of common memories over a mutually organized meal but for donna death had been a matter of life creeping out its pace and finally reaching its unavoidable close a monumental sorrow but not a universetilting tragedy not the wickedly untimely death of a tortured fifteenyearold son whose talents and good nature had promised to improve the world death when it came to the elderly was understandable a bitter natural order but when a talented goodnatured young man died the cosmos showed its true malevolent identity so david thought as his daughter squeezed his listless hand and his numbed body sank deeper toward oblivion i love you sarie whispered the remaining pride of his life shed had an existence to be envied devoted husband fulfilling career no anguish no serious illness in her or her husband or her children the way it should have been for me david thought for my wife for my son there once had been a year the last before his son had died when everything every element of every day had been perfectly aligned and rewarding in every sense creatively spiritually physically emotionally monetarily perfection and then an accident of the universe had struck a cell gone berserk in the right sixth rib of matthews chest and time had been measured accordinglybefore matthews death and god have mercy after matthews death sarie blessed daughter had managed to adjust and mend but not david and donna effort had become the norm pointlessness the rule even now after so many years david vividly remembered as if he were reading it this very minute as he was dying the eulogy hed written for the son he missed so fiercely the son whose life had ceased with cruelty at fifteen and whod left a vacuum never to be replenished david had written the eulogy the day after matthews death the priest hadnt known matt and confessed he didnt feel qualified to make a consoling statement at the funeral so david whose occupation was words telling stories had mustered the strength to decide that if words were the means with which he identified his place in the world the least he could do would be to use what he did to perform what he was and try to make sense out of natures lack of reason to let outsiders understand matthews ordeal and to strain for a moral lesson alluding to a famous character hed created without ever mentioning the name of the character hed struggled to neither waver nor faint at the funeral while he glanced dizzily toward the urn containing the ashes of his sonand the picture of his robust son in his prime im a storyteller hed read at ten in the morning on tuesday june its all i basically know how to do for the first time in my life i hate to do it though nonetheless im going to tell you a story sometimes life kicks you in the teeth with an irony that a selfrespecting fiction writer would be ashamed to invent so it was that last november i began a new novel with a scene in which the main character seeks peace in a zen buddhist monastery in bangkok where he meditates upon the four truths of buddha life is suffering that is the first of the buddhas truths it was also my first sentence life is suffering as i finished typing those words at threefortyfive on a beautiful thursday afternoon in autumn i turned to glance out my study window and frowned at the sight of my fifteenyearold son matthew staggering across our front lawn he was doubled over his left hand pressed against his right chest i rushed to meet him as he stumbled into the house i cant breathe he said the pain theres something wrong with my chest no doubt i broke several traffic laws speeding to our family doctor really i dont remember a lengthy exam made it seem that matt had pleurisy an inflammation of the lining of the lung antibiotics were prescribed the pain went away but as the buddha says life is suffering during christmas vacation the pain came back not in his chest this time but in his back an x ray revealed that matt had a tumor the size of two fists and so the horror began matt had bone cancer specifically a type known as ewing s sarcoma we hadnt detected it sooner because ewing s is sneaky the pain comes and goes often it isnt at the site of the tumor but rather at various other sites responding to presssure from the tumor for a brief time the explanation for the pain seemed to be that matt had hunched over too long in marathon guitarpractice sessions ewing s is an uncommon form of cancer but when it develops its usually in an arm or a leg in this case the uncommon cancer had chosen an uncommon spot the underside of matts right sixth rib even so ewing s had been known to respond to chemotherapy his chances of surviving were judged to be eighty percent in january he rapidly learned to familiarize himself with the names of arcanesounding drugs vincristine methotrexate adriamycin cytoxan the last part of that chemicals namenot its spelling but the way its pronouncedsays everything toxin these substances were poisons intended to kill the tumor but unavoidably they hurt healthy tissue as well by early february matts long curly hair grown in imitation of his rock music heroes had begun to fall out in huge disturbing clumps that littered his bed and clogged the drain when he took his morning shower its a measure of matts spirit that he decided to cut this ugly process short by having a party in which his friends ceremonially shaved him bald some of them still have his locks his eyebrows and eyelashes were less easy to deal with he let them fall out on their own he never tried to disguise his hairless condition no wig for him he displayed his baldness boldly for all the world to see and sometimes stare at and on occasion ridicule its a further measure of matts spirit that the weakness disorientation and vomiting produced by his medications never slackened his determination to persist at school a straight a student soon was making grades that a few months before would have embarrassed him but he hung in there chemotherapy was infused through an intravenous line a tube surgically implanted beneath the skin of his left chest you couldnt see it but you could feel it and for sure every day matt was terribly aware the tube was present the chemicals didnt take long to be administered an hour for each but their damaging side effects to the bladder required a prolonged irrigation of saline solution to flush the chemicals from his system thus the beginning stages of matts treatment forced him to stay in the hospital for three days every three weeks and to recuperate at home for another three days a small price to pay except that after several applications it became frighteningly manifest that the treatment wasnt working the tumor had continued to grow more aggressive chemotherapy was called for his survival chances were now fifty percent but as the weakness disorientation and vomiting worsened he still didnt lose his spirit he began to think of the tumor as an alien within him a monster whose strength intelligence and will were pitted against his own but ill beat it he would say ill win i want to be a rock star when i get older life is suffering the more aggressive chemotherapy didnt work either his physicians moved from chemicals that under ideal circumstances gave cause for hope to agents that are called investigational that is theyd been used so seldom that permission from the hospitals ethics committee was required before matt could receive them nonetheless of the twentytwo cancer patients whod received them eighteen had experienced dramatic results sounds good but you dont receive investigational therapy unless youre in the twenty percent of patients predicted to die again matt familiarized himself with arcane names ifosfamide mesna vp now in april the length of his stay in the hospital while receiving chemotherapy was five days every three weeks and the hangover from these drugs took another five days between treatments he had only eleven good days if good is a word that applies here for once the treatment worked the tumor shrank fifty percent imagine his elation imagine his equal and opposite distress when the next time he received these chemicals the tumorthe alienadjusted to them and began to grow again surgery was the only option in late may four right ribs and a third of that lung were removed along with the tumor or rather most of it because the alien had spread seeds and to kill them the doctors had to use even more aggressive treatment a pint of matts bone marrow was extracted from his hips a tidal wave of chemicals was infused enough to kill all his white blood cells his healthy bone marrow was returned to him eventually it would produce healthy blood all things being equal he would regain wellbeing the cancer viciously assaulted would be killed but all things werent equal normally harmless bacteria in and on his body bred out of control no longer held in check by his usually vigilant white blood cells they stunned him with a rampant infection known as septic shock the top number of his blood pressure plummeted to forty his heartbeat soared to a hundred and seventy his temperature surged to one hundred and five but he hung in there antibiotics killed the bacteria conscious though struggling against an oxygen tube in his throat he used a trembling finger and an alphabet board to spell frantic words of conversation morphine was used to ease his struggles against the oxygen tube he was last conscious a week ago sunday but even after that he reflexively gripped the hands of sympathizers with unbelievable strength until last saturday evening when after eight days in intensive care and six months of unremitting ordeal something in him wore out life is suffering only matt knows how much he suffered his mother and i his sister his relatives his friends his teachers his nurses his physicians all of us can only guess because he never complained except to ask when am i going to get a break and even then hed add but ill beat this damned thing maybe he did maybe the cancer would never have come back in the end not evil cells but normally innocent ones defeated him as i said at the start lifes ironies can sometimes kick you in the teeth david had trembled at the lectern in the church after another agonized gaze toward the urn containing matthews ashesand the photograph of matthew in his longhaired robust primedavid had dizzily faced the mourners and struggled not to faint what ive just described to you was hard to write and more hard to say but i didnt do it out of perversity out of some horrible need to make you feel my hurt and his mothers hurt and his sisters and that of all the rest of you who were close to him i did it because there were many who saw only the carefree goodnatured happygolucky pose he bravely demonstrated to his associates many had no idea not the faintest notion of what he was going through he wanted it that way and he succeeded he even successfully completed his ninth grade of school his spirit his bravery his humor his determination ought to be models to us all life in the last analysis indeed is suffering but the lesson matt gave us is that pain and disease can destroy us but they need not defeat us the body in the end must die but the spirit can endure david had paused again trembling struggling not to faint through tearblurred eyes hed mustered strength to focus on the swirling words of the text he so fiercely wished he didnt have cause to recite when prolonged unfair disaster strikes the obvious question is why i read in the newspaper about mothers who strangle unwanted newborn infants about fathers who beat their children to death while we wanted so desperately for our own child to live i ask why cant evil people suffer and die why cant the good and pure for matt truly was both populate and inherit the earth if we view the problem from a secular point of view the unwelcome answer is simple disregarding religious solutions were forced to conclude that there is only one cause for what happens in the world random chance accident thats what killed matt a cellular mistake a misstep of nature if so we learn this as well given a precarious existence we ought to follow matts example and prize every instant to make the most of the life weve borrowed to be the best we can the bravest the kindest for at any moment life can be yanked away from us there are those who would have lapsed into hedonism into alcohol drugs and other forms of reckless selfindulgence that was not matts way for he worshipped creativity strumming on his guitar dreaming of a career in music he knew with a wisdom far beyond his years that beauty good nature and usefulness were the proper values but from another point of view a religious one we learn something else life is suffering the great buddha says that was his first truth he had three others suffering is caused by the wish for nonpermanent things all living things die everything physical falls apart that was the buddhas second incontrovertible truth and the third suffering ends when nonlasting things are rejected no person no object no career can finally bring happiness in a world of eventual destruction only eternal goals are worth pursuing which leads to the buddhas fourth and last great truth seek the eternal seek the foreverlasting seek god matt wasnt religious in the sense that he belonged to an organized body of faith he was baptized as a roman catholic he was trained in that religion to the point of what catholics call the sacrament of communion but to him every other religion had value as well he did believe in god he wore a small crucifix as an earring on one of his last conscious days he received what the catholic church used to call the sacrament of extreme unction the final rites what it now calls the sacrament of the sick we know matts body was sick beyond belief but i assure you his soul was wholesome to its depths and im convinced the sacrament spiritually and psychologically eased his passage poor dear matthew how we grieve for him but in addition to his hopes of being a musician he had three final wishes which ill share with you if i die he said i want to be surrounded by a communion of my friends today with love weve achieved that wish for him his second wish if i die he said please remember me with all the tears in my heart son i swear youll be remembered and his third wish i hurt so much he said i want mercy my unlucky wonderful son in a way i can barely adjust to you received that wish also you did gain mercy sleep well gentle boy be at peace well think of you with fondness till we ourselves pass and if there is an afterlifei confess ill never be sure till i find outi know youll forever be in loving tune with us say hello to jimi hendrix for me john lennon and janis joplin all the other departed music greats pal i bet youve got a hell of a band so david had read at his sons memorial service next to him on the altar beside the photograph of a glowing son and an urn filled with ashes had stood matthews favorite guitar a white combination acousticandelectric made by kramer the instrument donna had purchased for matt the day of his extensive surgery waking from sedation after being monitored in intensive care not yet knowing that the cancer had not been fully removed hed been shown the guitar and too weak to hold it had managed a tearful grin of joy his weak voice breaking isnt that beautiful david about to die now forty years later still heard those heartchoking words reverberate through the morphine swirl of his mind his son had survived to play that guitar only four muscleweary times discouraged because his fingers no longer retained their skill in the eulogy david hadnt included the further agonies his son had endured after the chaotic heartbeat respiration temperature and blood pressure that were part of the septic shock matthews kidneys had failed dialysis had been required not the kind in which a machine is used to filter poisons from the blood that type of dialysis couldnt have prevented matts failed kidneys from causing excess fluid to accumulate in his body choosing a different method of dialysis a surgeon had desperately slit open matts abdomen and inserted a tube through which liquid was poured its special properties establishing a correction of blood chemistry by means of a process called osmosis the liquid sucked not only poisons but excess fluid through matts abdominal lining and every hour that poisoned fluid was drained replaced by a fresh solution but the poisons and excess fluid had resisted treatment not leaving his body quickly enough then matthews left lung had collapsed then his muscles had begun to contract from lying motionless for too many days donna and david had put on and taken off his socks and sneakers every hour to prevent his achilles tendons from tightening finally dead bacteria from his septic shock had collected within his heart a chunk of this debris had broken from within the heart and plugged a main artery death after eight days in intensive care had not been from cancer but instead from a heart attack ironies how they kick you in the teeth so david thought as he came closer to death in intensive care even now after forty years he remembered the autopsy report that he and his wife had received dear mr and mrs morrell on behalf of the physicians and staff at the university hospital i extend our sincere sympathy at the loss of your son this letter is to inform you of the preliminary results of his autopsy history of ewing s sarcoma with no gross residual tumor identified detailed analysis reveals no evidence of malignancy davids translation the treatment worked the cancer was cured status post bone marrow transplantation successful healthy blood had begun to generate translation if matthew hadnt succumbed to septic shock hed have been home within a few days on the way to complete recovery endocarditis an inflammation of the lining of the heart with abnormal tissue deposits on the valves of the heart translation debris from the dead bacteria complete blockage of the left main coronary artery translation the effects of the treatment not the disease were what killed him the lungs were heavy in weight and fluid consistent with respiratory distress syndrome the oxygen pumped into matts lungs to keep him breathing would eventually have poisoned his lungs the kidneys were swollen the outer layers were pale consistent with damage due to septic shock if his heart hadnt killed him his kidneys might have the bladder was inflamed and hemorrhagic how much can a poor kid withstand both the stomach and the esophagus had ulcers why not everything else had gone to hell a cerebral aneurysm was present in one of the vessels in the brain an abnormal dilation of the blood vessel he also had small areas of bleeding along the lining of the brain sure the consequence of the septic shock and if the cancer hadnt killed him and the heart attack hadnt maybe with matthews bad luck hed have had a stroke the liver was found to be enlarged might as well throw that in the chemotherapy was extreme all right after the removal of four ribs and a third of a lung he wasnt strong enough to bear any further stress if you have any questions please call the letter concluded sincerely david did have one question how can life be so cruel but the question at bottom was philosophical and an inappropriate response to an autopsy that proved his point empirically things fall apart the center cannot hold watch out for the boogeyman eat your wheaties say your prayers walk around ladders brush your teeth after every meal stay away from the teddy bears picnic and count every second without pain or disaster as a major stroke of luck entropy that was the secret the messiness of the universe as sarie held his weakening hand in intensive care david heard faintly through the wheeze of the oxygen pump and a humming in his ears the words shed recited at matthews funeral how proud hed been of her that day how filled with love the strength and composure shed mustered against intolerable grief had made it possible for her somehow bravely to stand before the mourners at the church and to recite that days gospel a text that with bitter irony happened to be from st matthew sarie repeated it to him now god bless her shed remembered the passage all these years she spoke it again as she had with the same trembling voice combating sorrow so long ago if hed had the strength hed have reached up and hugged her just as he had before the mourners in the church so many years ago when shed stepped unsteadily down from the lectern the words were beautiful come to me all you who are weary and find life burdensome and i will refresh you take my yoke upon your shoulders and learn from me for i am gentle and humble of heart your soul will find rest for my yoke is easy and my burden light comforting thoughts if a person believed but david at best had been an agnostic until three incidents made him suspect there might be a spirit within the universe a greater power than his pessimism allowed the first had occurred one night after matthews death having somehow managed the strength to write matthews eulogy david had staggered to the master bedroom where in a rare gesture of obeisance to a god whose existence he doubted hed sunk to his knees the time was night the room was dark davids eyes were raw with tears hands pressed to his swollen face hed prayed with a fervor that he swore would kill him matthew matthew matthew i want you back son this has to be a nightmare soon ill waken youll be here one day before the septic shock that had ravaged matthews body and eight days later killed him david had used some brief time alone when he and donna werent sharing anxious hours together watching over matthew in the hospital david had driven home to change clothes on impulse based on a twentyyear daily habit hed decided to exercise to run as was his custom to clear his head and sweat tension from his body after four miles the farthest he could manage given his stress and weakness hed staggered into his kitchen sipped a glass of water and collapsed surely while he was passed out on the floor this nightmare of his dear sons death had come to him and he hadnt wakened yet that was the explanation none of this had happened it was a nightmare so hed hoped forty years ago as hed knelt in trembling anguish beside the bed while he squeezed his hands to his face and tears seeped through his clawlike fingers that threatened to tear his cheeks away hed prayed with all the desperation his soul could sustain that he would wake up from his stupor on the kitchen floor and his son would still be alive oh please hed prayed oh jesus please but hed known in a terrifying recess of his remaining sanity that he had indeed revived from his stupor on the floor that he had indeed staggered back to the hospital that his son had indeed suffered septic shock one day later and died eight unimaginably traumatic days after that matthew matthew please come back to me forty years ago in his kneeling paroxysm beside the bed his thoughts flashing through his mind like lasers david had suddenly remembered yet another example of his wonderful sons promising gifts not only the lifeaffirming pulse of music whose throbbing chords continued to reverberate like a neverending tape through davids head but as well a poem one of many this one written during the disorientation and nausea of chemotherapy a poem that matthew had later submitted for an assignment at school fifteen years old with verbal gifts far superior to those of his father who defined himself by and made his living out of words fifteen years old and in a panic at am the boy had wakened donna who slept beside him on a cot in the ivstandfilled room to dictate to her his sudden terrifying insights a poem not linear not rhymed and metered not the singsong unintentional parody of a poem youd expect from someone his age instead a gestalt of fear and memory a jumbled synthesis of reaction to when life was perfect and then collapsed a metaphor of a jigsaw puzzle of each piece having been beautifully assembled and then perversely ripped apart of lost hair fading friends and fractured hopes of the prejudice ignorant people showed toward cancer patients whose bald heads and gaunt cheeks looked like skulls of dreams become tears and parties about to turn into wakes death and a jigsaw puzzle if the poem wasnt perfect it was better than the father could have written at fifteen or maybe could have ever written and if a perceptive reader paid it due attention the meaning was clear the craft matched the content jigsaw remembrance of the days of ecstasy a natural buzz from life was created as every piece of the jigsaw puzzle was prime and in place a sledge hammer chain saw and a rototiller shred through the jigsaw puzzle through the good memories of a lot of cokes and late night burgers a mane of hair a symbol of what you believe in and so many good times gone by gone déjà vu rings strong in your ears but brings not a smile to your face instead tears to your eyes prejudice rears its ugly head social matters become shattered limits are put in place the jigsaw puzzle is slowly destroyed leaving only one piece alone fifteen years old vomiting at am dictating a poem god love you son david had sobbed on his knees hunching over a bed with his fingers like claws scraping into his tearravaged face you are dead im not unconscious on the kitchen floor im here ive just written your eulogy and my existence never content to begin with will be forever empty until my own death a remarkable occurrence took place then fireflies filled the dark bedroom they seemed to blink and yet their light was constant like flaming balls from roman candles but roman candles dwindle in brilliance and flash in a straightline arc whereas these lights zigged and darted zagged and swirled they spun at the same time they soared the room was ablaze with them and david thought of them as fireflies because of their random dashing radiant pattern fireflies splendrous of varying colors but all of equal magnificence rushing with the energy of joy ecstatic a swirling cluster of what david intuited beyond any question were rapturous souls he made allowance for his grief and stress his weariness and shock he wasnt thinking clearly at the moment he readily granted but the brilliant colorful fireflies were spinning and zooming before him so patently real so vivid that he couldnt dismiss them couldnt reject their beauty by denying the exquisite vision allowed to him whether they were a hallucination or a visitation he gave in to them and embraced their rapture of the thousands among their myriad flashing colors of joy he identified one in the cluster who he knew beyond doubt was his son how he was sure he couldnt tell but that he was sure he had absolute faith matthew come to me for no reason he could account for the spinning specks of flying fire reminded him of children in a playground of his son as a toddler laughing and racing among other children and just as matthew when a toddler had been reluctant to leave the exuberance of his friends so the darting firefly no different from the swirling others but who the father knew with total certainty was matthews soul refused to come to his grieving father matthew im telling you get over here but still distracted continuing to revel in incomprehensible gaiety the soul of the son ignored the father matthew dont disobey me i want you back get over here at that responding to the desperate insistence of the father who loved him beyond measure and mourned to the limits of sanity for his sons absence the firefly that was matthews soul soared away from his satisfying companions sped to within a foot of his fathers weeping eyes halted abruptly and hovered for an instant suspended in time dad i want to play at last im having fun the firefly soundlessly said the inaudible words echoing within the fathers head dont you understand i dont hurt anymore im at peace im where i belong im okay youve got to understand that im okay you hurt and im sorry but theres nothing i can do youll have to deal with it i know how much you love me if you didnt grieve thatd mean you didnt love me in that sense grief is good it hurts but its good its a tribute and i love you for it grieve for yourself for your emptiness and loss as long as you understand im okay i love you too and i miss you but its not your time to be with me please if you truly love me dad let me go back and play with a sob that wracked davids soul he nodded and the firefly that was matthew sped back to his swirling lights of friends and with that the vision ended the fireflies disappeared the bedroom returned to darkness kneeling beside the bed sobbing with a greater sense of loss and yet a strange kind of joyous understanding david slumped in exhaustion then slowly wearily stubbornly stood because there were footsteps and voices from beyond the bedroom door friends and neighbors acquaintances come to offer food respects and condolences and their gestures of compassion couldnt be demeaned by being ignored that had been the first of the three signals david received making him suspect there was a mystical property in the universe the second experience had occurred one evening later it hadnt been as dramatic as the first but for all that it had been affecting and in its way profound this was on monday matthew had died on saturday the eulogy had been written and the fireflies had appeared on sunday but now it was monday the evening of what is politely called the visitation at the funeral home in this case the visitation had not involved a view of matthews corpse for david and donna had agreed that a thorough autopsy had to be performed on the frail scarred paintwisted remains of their wonderful son who wasnt matt anymore anyhow examine his body every way you can david had said through scalding tears to the physician who signed the death certificate take him apart learn everything you can perhaps what you discover will save some other poor kids life do so thorough a job that there cant possibly be a public viewing his bodys yours thank you the physician had said we appreciate your understanding sometimes commiseration for the familyand respect for their attitudes toward public viewingprevents us from doing as complete an examination as possible and learning as much as we can some meaning has to come from this david had said so dizzy hed feared hed collapse to keep this from happening again to crush this fucking disease ewing s sarcoma it isnt just cancer its evil its the devil sometimes i think we didnt need physicians we needed an exorcist so there hadnt been a public viewing of matthews remains but not just because of the thorough autopsy for the second reason wasnt scientific but aesthetic a corpse filled with formaldehyde and prettiedup with cosmetics to make the dear departed look lifelike sort of but not really spare me david had thought ashes to ashes dust to dust never mind formaldehyde matthew had already been injected to saturation with too many chemicals so matthew was cremated his fifteenyearold ashes filled a bronze container the size of a coffee grinder according to local law david donna and sarie could have done virtually anything they wanted with the urn they could have taken it home and placed it on the mantel or stored it in the stereo cabinet or opened it and sprinkled matthews ashes onto a flower gardenjust so long as they didnt dispose of the ashes in a public waterway or on public grounds but the mantel and the stereo cabinet seemed too morbidly remindful and the flower gardenfor all its natural appealwould have prevented david from transporting matthews ashes if the family ever decided to move no to keep the ashes in the urn and then to place the urn in a mausoleum was the only acceptable option in a totally unacceptable force of choice at least in that way mother father and sister could be close but not too close to the beautiful son and brother theyd lost the visitation showed mourners the urn next to it a photograph of matthew in his longhaired glorious prime and next to that on a stand matthews seldomplayed kramer combination electricacoustic guitar hundreds arrived one heartbroken wellmeaning youth brought a plastic bag filled with the light brown hairalready falling out from chemotherapythat matthew had told his friends to shave from him the wellwishers the mourners the friends and loved ones at the vigil had been appreciated but emotionally draining at the sight of matthews hair crammed within the plastic bag brought by matthews friend david had nearly fainted but two of davids friends had escorted him from the morticians and driven him to the church where the funeral next day would occur that was where the second mystical experience took place donna and sarie had been going through their own emotional strain sustained by relatives who helped them to the church at nine oclock on a beautiful dusky june night the family had entered the church there were arrangements to be made a funeral to be planned in the end the music the group selected was pie jesu merciful jesus from andrew lloyd webbers sad sublime requiem which he had written in honor of his dead father stooped barely able to maintain his balance if not for the supporting hands of his two friends david had managed to enter the shadowy church as he shuffled up the main aisle his unsteady footsteps echoing off pews and rafters his tearreddened nostrils widening to the redolence of incense flowers and scented candles from that mornings mass an eerie change went through him a strength of solace of wellbeing and reassurance suddenly grew within him for a second time he heard the echoing voice of the firefly it rephrased its words from the night before in the bedroom im okay dad im sorry you hurt but your grief is the proof of your love for me mourn for your loss but dont mourn for me because you cant imagine how happy i am david abruptly straightened he no longer needed his friends to hold him upright with a strength that came from spiritual assurance he approached the front of the church where family and friends who watched him said afterward that he seemed different more than in manner almost as if he had a glow he didnt feel better his grief was as agonizing as before nonetheless he stood straighter he could function for he knew beyond doubt that his son was at peace or in the fireflys word okay that i can handle david thought i can manage to suffer for myself if my son sends a message hes okay i can strain through grief for myself because i dont matter that was the second experience and the third twelve people saw it all were astonished none ever forgot it as a witness later said its getting harder to be an agnostic this is what happened when the funeral service concluded david stood and put his arms around donna and sarie sobbing struggling to muster dignity and not stumble or faint they left the church followed by several hundred mourners that tuesday morning was hot and bright blinking after the shadows of the church david donna and sarie sat in a limousine whose white seemed incongruous yet appropriate because innocencethough deaddid not merit black the mourners remained outside the church in grieved confusion three relatives and two very close friends got into the limousine as well the representative from the mortician brought matthews urn his photograph and his guitar from the church she set the urn on donnas lap then drove the limousine from the church followed by the priest after donna held the urn for a while she handed it to sarie and as the limousine neared the cemetery sarie handed the urn to david it was heavier than he had expected not because of the ashes which for a frail boy had to be slight but because of the bronzepossibly fifteen pounds it was square a shiny deep brown and by now someone had taped a lock of matthews light brown hair to the top on opposite sides of the urn at the bottom two screws secured the lid and what it contained entering the curved gravel driveway of the cemetery david noticed the groundskeeper or whats known as the sexton standing at the open gate the man who david later learned had once been an economics major and had never dreamed hed make a thirtyyear career of overseeing a cemetery got into his car and led the limousine past seemingly endless flowertopped graves toward a mausoleum at the rear of the grounds the mausoleum the only one on the property was not at all like the dingy boxshaped structures you often see in cemeteries instead it was peaked made mostly of lightcolored wood and stone and resembled a chapel its front door was open as the sexton stopped his car ahead of the limousine david donna sarie and the others got out to join him all told counting the sexton and the representative from the mortician there were ten now then the priest arrived and another representative from the mortician and there were twelve i normally keep the mausoleum locked the sexton said but i wanted to ease your grief and avoid any awkwardness opening the door and all that so i could make this as smooth as possible for you later ill give you a key so you can visit your sons remains whenever you like stifled tears a murmur of thanks so the procession of twelve led by david carrying the heavierthanexpected urn stepped into the mausoleum that resembled a chapel inside on the right and left there were niches for coffins and urns but straight ahead were chairs like pews and an organ and a podium the large rear wall was glass from top to bottom with sunlight pouring in and david who entered first his tears dripping onto the urn was the first to see what to call it a startling coincidence a supernormal event what david saw was a bird it flew around the chapel soaring swooping circling flapping in panic recovering from his surprise david turned to look past donna and sarie toward the priest who followed through the open door david who needed a respite from sorrow a mitigation of grief said with bitter irony his humor black thats all we need father the holy ghost but the priest stopped rigidly reacting neither to irony nor to black humor indeed the expression on his face was a combination of shock disbelief and reverence his face paled but david look closer it really is a dove that statement might not make sense to noncatholics in the catholic church the holy ghost is a term that describes gods ability to inspire as well as console and traditionally the holy ghost is symbolized by a dove thats what davidand the priest and donna and sarie and the rest of the twelvewere seeing now a dove not white as in religious paintings but gray its name appropriate a mourning dove socalled because of its dirgelike coo so much like a sob it flapped and swooped and soared my god the sexton said not intending to sound religious im terribly sorry i deeply apologize i left the door open to make it easy for you to come in but i should have thought sometimes a bird flies in if the door isnt closed ill try to get the dove out right now david shook his head his black irony irrepressible and anyway the service was all that mattered no leave it he said scanning the crypts to his right and left this place could use some life the sexton narrowed his eyes youre sure absolutely the sexton and the morticians representatives relaxed david found out later that an accidental interruption of the service a distraction such as the dove sometimes spurred mourners into fits of indignation into accusations about insensitivity and incompetence everybodys different he thought in his own case he welcomed the dove in fact in a strange way he even loved it for its life let it flap and swoop and soar as long as it doesnt hurt itself when matthews in his niche well take care of the dove the service began as yet there was nothing mystical nothing supernormal about the dove the door had for convenience been left open the doveas coincidence can happenhad by chance flown in perfectly explainable not usual but nothing remarkable so far but then coincidence was added to coincidence until for david and the other eleven witnesses in the mausoleums chapel the dove became very remarkable indeed as the dove continued flapping david set the urn on the podium at the front of the chapel he his family and friends along with the sexton and the morticians representatives stepped back to the pewlike chairs they watched the priest put on a vestment then open a prayer book and begin the final liturgy for the dead heavenly father accept this soul of your faithful departed servant throughout the priest kept glancing nervously from the urn containing matthews ashes toward the dove flapping overhead then the next coincidence occurred as the priest neared the end of the prayers the dove which till now had been in a panic suddenly calmed and settled from the ceiling toward a low ledge on the wall of glass the priest held his breath directed an even more nervous look toward the dove and resumed his prayers theres no way to verify what went through davids mind just then he later swore to those in the chapel that he knew what would happen next or at least that one of three things would happen the dove will land on the floor beside the podium that supports matthews urn he thought or the dove will land on the urn itself or the dove will land on my shoulder david knew this as certainly as hed witnessed the fireflies and heard one in particular in the bedroom two nights before as certainly as hed felt an unaccountable repose and heard an echo of the fireflys voice in the church the evening earlier the priest opened a vial of holy water and the first thing david had imagined occurred the dove flew down to the floor beside the podium the chapel became very still the priests voice fell to a whisper as he prayed and sprinkled the holy water over the urn the service came to an end for several instants no one moved david felt strangled after you leave the sexton said his voice soft with respect ill put your sons remains in his niche and then ill remove the dove no well do it right now i beg your pardon i want to be here when the urns put into the niche david said but first ill take care of the dove no you dont understand its in a panic itll be difficult to capture the sexton said davids brotherinlaw added ill take off my jacket maybe we can throw the coat over it and capture it that wont be necessary david said no need to worry the sexton frowned then how are we going to its very simple ill pick up the dove youll what oh sure david said just watch for that had been davids final precognition the dove would let him pick it up impossible the sexton said i told you watch for david was already moving neither fast nor slow but steadily with calm the dove its feathers ruffled in panic darted its frantic eyes right and left toward corridors of escape but remained where it was david stopped and though the dove flapped its wings with brief uncertainty it stayed in place david eased his hands around the dove it didnt struggle david stood and faced his eleven witnesses and now ill set matthew free he carried the dove past the urn past his family and friends and approached the mausoleums sunbright open door outside in the radiance of what otherwise would have been a splendid june morning he smiled at the dove though his tears made the gray bird misty to his eyes matt i hope you meant what you told me the other night with all my love i want you to be okay reluctantly david opened his hands and if the previous eight minutes had been packed with strange events there was one more yet to come for the dove refused to fly away it perched on davids open palms and for fifteen seconds peered at him david almost panicked his thoughts could not be verified anymore than his precognitions could nonetheless he swore that this is what he thought my god when i picked you up i hope i didnt hurt your wings at that the bird soared away its feathers making the distinctive whistling sound of a mourning dove in flight it sped straight out then up ever higher toward the brilliant sky toward the blazing sun and was gone thats it an inner voice told david thats the last sign mattll give you three will have to be enough david felt pain yet joy the significance of the dove having lingered in his open palms he took to be this the extensive surgery that had removed matts four right ribs and a third of his right lung was like picking up a dove and breaking a wing but the dove had been all right and as the firefly had said so was davids son matt was at peace in the days weeks months and years that followed whenever david returned to that mausoleum he scanned the grounds in hopes of seeing the dove praying for another sign from his son but he never saw it he saw robins blue jays and sparrows never any doves that day the sexton unscrewed the glass pane of a twofoot square niche in a wall david handed the urn to donna who handed it to sarie who then handed it back to david who kissed it placed the urn in the niche and watched the sexton replace the glass pane the ritual had ended time was now measured differently before matt after matt as the group left the mausoleum david turned to the priest at the risk of sounding ive got the feeling something spooky happened in there david to tell you the truth i feel a little weird myself the group drove back to the family home where the several hundred mourners had been invited because matthew had asked for a party if he died the largest most animated his parents could arrange with music food soda pop beer and anything else that would make the kind of celebration theyd have had if hed survived a few months before his death matt had prepared a demostration tape of his guitar skills that tape was played a lot that day so was music by matthews favorites the beatles van halen bon jovi crosby stills nash and young and all through the mournful party the priest and everyone else whod been at the mausoleum couldnt stop talking about the dove when you lose a child and you truly loved that child and werent just an indifferent caretaker or that scum of existence a brutalizer you search for some meaning some justification anything to ease your agony you think about god and whether he exists and what kind of god would allow something so heinous as matthews death you think about ultimates about the point of existence and whether theres an afterlife and what it would be like would matthew be waiting when his father mother and sister died would he be the same you question everything you grasp at anything to make sense of what seems to have no sense to find meaning in what you despair might be the ultimate meaning nothingness you seek in all places all cultures you search in all philosophies and faiths reincarnation plato believed in it for that matter a full half of the worlds present population believes in it in the east as the theory goes we struggle through various stages of existence not always human sometimes animal or even plant rising until weve perfected our spirit sufficiently to abandon material existence and join forever in bliss with god a complicated but comforting belief because theres a point to life a payoff certainly its easier to accept than the notion that god tortures us here on earth to punish us for our sins so well be happy with him in heaven in that case how do we explain the death of an infant who couldnt possibly have sinned or the death of a fifteenyearold boy who by all accounts was remarkable and never harmed anyone matthew was a child with a wisdom beyond his physical age at school hed become the envy of his fellow ninth graders because hed been adopted by those in grade twelve he ate lunch with the older students unheard of he went to gradetwelve parties unheard of he gave them advice about the problems in their lives and unheard of the older students heeded his advice there was something about his character his humor his intuition that set him apart uniqueness by definition is one of a kind and matthew by all reports was indeed a breed unto himself at school a type of unfashionable student known as a nerd might be victimized by cruel remarks and equally cruel antisocial jokes but matt would put a stop to it all give him a break if hes truly a nerd if he was born that way then let him be what he is because you werent born so unlucky and if hes a nerd for other reasons because of family problems maybe all the more reason to give him a breakbecause he does have problems matts ability to grasp mathematical philosophical and verbal skills at school was astonishing instinctively with minimal effort perfect grades a presidential scholar in iowa where the test of basic skills is one of the standards of the nation matthew ranked within the top percent of the mostgifted students and he never had to try he budgeted his time for assignments at school as a necessary tedious inconvenience his achievements seemed as effortless and natural as putting a record onto a turntable as remembering trailing clouds of glory do we come from god who is our home wordsworth says the title of his poem appropriate intimations of immortality the transmigration of souls passing from one existence to the next we accumulate in wisdom so that no matter our physical problems our spirit and intelligence grow stronger maybe so david had often thought that matthew was a mature man at eight matts sense of fairness and justice of virtue and honor was astonishing at so early an age he passed through stages more quickly than any child david had ever seen and david had once worked as a counselor to adolescents before his death matt hadunbiddenbeen studying oriental philosophy and its theory of reincarnation could it be that matthews soul had reached its prime and the disease of his body his soul departing from it was like a butterfly leaving a chrysalis had matthews death not been a tragedy but part of the natural order such were the desperate thoughts that a grieving parent used to find solace desperate thoughts nonetheless comforting but they didnt assuage davids loss and after the funeral after the party the torture still hadnt ended because he donna and sarie each day had to enter matthews room itself a black hole of absence to stare at the clothes in his closet the games on his shelves the phonograph records on his bureau the rockstar posters on his wall the last day of school sarie and a friend had gone to matts locker to bring home his bag of notebooks texts and gym shoes sorting through that bag and his closet and his bureau drawers was an agony so extreme that it had to be done in stages a little each day for weeks and months what do you want to save what to throw out how do you dispose of the vestiges of a treasured life matthews tapes and records collected over the years had mostly gone out of fashion his friends didnt want them the posters on his walls came from a culture changing so rapidly that even those purchased six months ago might as well have been sixty years old those posters and rockstar buttons and banners were valueless without the perspective of the mind that had attached significance to them souvenirs have no worth without nostalgia after all theyre meaningless if a memory isnt linked to them so once each week david carried a plastic bag of the remants of a departed life out to the street and walked far from home so he wouldnt see the trash collectors take those bags away old shoes still redolent of matthews smell socks and underwear too personal for anyone else to put on stacks of bank statements five dollars withdrawn on one day seven dollars another day a lifetime of withdrawals until the ultimate withdrawal the useful items matthews clothes were given to goodwill at the last what remained were three albums of photographs showing matthew as he grew to his final year and a pair of slippers shaped like bears feet complete with claws how hed grinned as the nurses kidded him about those slippers when he pushed his iv stand for exercise down the hospital corridor those slipperstoo precious to be discarded their smell of matthew too comfortingwere tacked to a wall in his room and that was that the conclusion of the disposal of what once had been a life except for a final gift one of matthews closest friends had moved far from town several years before each summer theyd taken turns flying to visit one another matts friend had lost his mother to breast cancer and one evening when the boy delightfully sixteen with his life ahead of him had phoned to keep in touch and say how much he missed matt the boy had added that his home had been burglarized all his rockmusic records stolen the next day all of matts tapes and records nearly one hundred of them were mailed to matts friend how satisfying a gift not so much for matts friend though he surely appreciated the package but satisfying for david donna and sarie because they knew how matthew would have been delighted to please his friend what finally remained of matts possessions was the bright white kramer electricacoustic guitar that matthew had treasured more than anything else he owned that precious guitar polished frequently with reverence stayed in matthews room almost like a holy object supported upright on a stand and each day mustering a face to meet the faces that he met david entered matthews room and stroked that guitar for luck and strength help me make it through the day son and especially the night time is the greatest healerso david had been told untrue parents who lose a valued child never get over the dear ones absence as david aged he his wife and his daughter continued to cherish one another a blessing for too often the death of a child produces a split within a family arguments recriminations and divorce except for terrifying anxiety attacks that imitated coronaries and eventually required psychiatric therapy davids health was perversely good his career as a writer prospered the famous character hed created sometimes reviled sometimes revered but never ignored took second place to other of his characters who because of the sorrow david had suffered from matthews death spoke to readers who suffered their own sorrows he prospered he persisted but he did not flourish maybe that was the final irony davids unwanted success could have been a boon to matthew could have eased matthews way through davids contacts into the world of influence so david thought as he lay in a stupor dwindling toward his own death his faithful loving daughter beside him holding his weakening hand in the shadowy raspy confines of an isolation room in intensive care his exceptional wife had died five years before him and hed grieved for her how much so but never the spiritburdening grief hed felt for matthew his wife he knew would understand when matthew had died the world had shrunk everything afterward had been like climbing an endless flight of stairs god heaven reincarnation who knew but now he was near the top of that wearying flight of stairs and hed discover the answer or he wouldnt depending on whether there was an answer or merely oblivion i love you sarie said weak struggling against the oxygen tube in his throat david nodded he knew she understood that he loved her as well he was proud to have been not just her father but her friend you were a gift to me david thought about sarie just as matthew was a gift and its too bad were not all here together years ago i almost killed myself now im glad i didnt because of you dear but now youll have to go on without me the main thing is my death isnt a tragedy my dissolution is part of the natural scheme grieve for me because you love me but dont let my death hold you back persist and maybe one day well meet in rapturous reunion who knows goodbye sweetheart i pray im about to meet matthew ive missed him so much if death is oblivion it wont matter because i wont have the consciousness to know but if sinking ever deeper into the ultimate sleep davids dwindling consciousness managed a final burst of strength as if it were yesterday and not half a lifetime ago he remembered another poem that matthew had written one that david had memorized with a persistence close to mania and could never have forgotten even on the verge of death the poem had been written when matthew was fourteen imagine so young and it represented everything that matts young heart had wanted to be a musician to be in tune with the spheres lowder volume co the guitar rubbing the gentle polish on every smooth contour on the lap knowing every curve as the light shines from it silently strumming on stage a planned metamorphosis takes places as the hours go by and the space is transformed to a concert hall the energetic nemesis has struck the risers are transformed into a stage and black boxes turn into powerful pieces of sound equipment the spring is taut silently strumming backstage while pandemonium sweeps the hall and people crowd the arena as ants flow to a cake the stage is set the instruments tuned and placed the musicians work out last minute kinks as the lights dim striking power chords an intense force hits the spectators energy is released in every form a power rage beyond comprehension fourteen years old and to have written a poem so promising of future achievements gone all lost and gone sinking dimming dwindling and yet and yet in davids mind he seemed to rise above his dying body to float above his soontobe corpse to see his daughter sobbing over him and the nurses rushing toward him raising the bottom of his bed david knew what raising a patients feet meant hed seen it happen to matthew when the nurses raised the bottom of your bed your blood pressure was dropping and you were to use matts words in serious shit so what did it matter davids time had come and he looked forward to it hoping hed reencounter a great love of his life be replenished from his greatest loss in his mind he floated ever higher through the ceiling and higher yet away from the shadows into a brightness drifting toward it toward a door that somehow didnt interfere with the beautiful brightness when davids stepfather had suffered his first heart attack the weary man had wakened to describe a dream in which hed been floating through brightness toward a door i reached the door i knocked and knocked but no one answered three months later when a second heart attack had completed the job maybe the tired man had reached the door and this time his knock had been answered but david didnt need to knock floating to the door he merely turned its knob at once he heard power chords an electric guitar strummed ecstatically david opened the door the brightness increased its glare the strumming chords became more powerful the brightness he saw was caused by fireflies millions of them radiant all around him enveloping silently rejoicing the chords throbbed with greater intensity david peered all around squinting past the fireflies matthew davids joy became frustration matthew doubt became despair the radiant fireflies swarmed around him but he recognized none of them matthew where was matthew part two a power rage beyond comprehension fireflies swarmed power chords throbbed david opened his eyes sunlight gleamed through a window through a swirl he saw a cupboard above him the edge of a sink a stack of dishes about to vomit managing not to he turned his aching head to the left and saw the blur of a kitchen table his movement bumped an object and sent it rolling david strained to clear his vision he recognized the rolling object an empty glass that the turn of his head had sent clinking to a stop against a leg of the table his hair was soaked he lay in a pool of water but his body was drenched with more than water sweat his bare legs arms and chest were slick with perspiration his shorts clung sweatsoaked to his groin and hips what was going on through misty vision he focused on the digital clock on the microwave to the left of the table a calendar the kind you tear a page off each day showed it couldnt be june thursday the eighteenth impossible the last moment hed known had been sometime in march the delirium of morphine and the distracting pain of his mortal illness had made him unsure of the date but without doubt hed entered intensive care in march forty years from now so what was he doing on the floor of the kitchen of a house that hed sold five years after matthews death because he couldnt bear the memories of a year after matthews death intensive care forty years later with tingling feet and hands david raised his head from the floor and peered at his body no wrinkles in his stomach no cancerous gauntness in his chest he was struggling through nausea to stare at the dailyexercised body of a man of fortyfour despite his nausea he felt in the middleaged prime hed known and then lost after matthew had died after matthew had died june eighteenth one day before matthew had contracted the septic shock that eight days later had killed him power chords kept throbbing david squinted through a kitchen archway toward stereo cabinets against a wall in the living room lights glowed on a tape player stereo speakers thrummed he still saw the fireflies but now he realized that they were specks of lights inside his head his dizziness lessened his memory cleared hed spent all night at the hospital sleeping next to matthews bed donna had taken her turn to sleep at home then had come up to the bone marrow ward to trade places with david to give him a chance to go home shower and change his clothes hed arrived home at eleven and decided to exercise to run as was his custom frustration had made him run faster than usual to sweat out his tension but excessive humidity had added to the ninetydegree temperature making it the equivalent of one hundred and three perspiring worse than usual hed stumbled into the house turned on the tape player poured a glass of water raised it to his lips felt dizzy seen fireflies dropped the glass and fainted on the kitchen floor david realized that none of the other things had happened matthews septic shock his eight days in intensive care his eventual death had only been a nightmare caused by unconsciousness due to overexertion and excessive loss of bodily fluid a nightmare gaining more strength david groped to his knees crawled to the table and tugged himself to his feet for a moment he wavered but with both hands on the table he held himself steady the fireflies dimmed sure a nightmare then why had everything hed dreamed appeared so real as if the events of the nightmare had truly occurred and what he now saw was merely an illusion the power chords kept throbbing why if hed merely fainted was he so terrifyingly sure that on june twentyseventh nine days from now his son would die from unexpected complications due to his cancer treatment the tingling in davids arms and legs made him wobble he strained not to faint again something was horribly wrong he recalled the fireflies in his bedroom and the dove in the mausoleum but none of those things had happened yet he knew as if remembering every dismal instant hed endure for the next forty years his future was so clear and detailed that he could not believe those forty years every wretched minute of them could have been crammed into so brief an unconsciousness while unconscious had he imagined the possible course of his life he breathed deeper faster on the verge of hyperventilating or was he remembering his life from the perspective of forty years later his chest felt tight what in gods name is happening in his dream the next events in his life had been that after he wakened from fainting his dizziness had worsened hed been forced to stay in bed until the next day when he felt well enough to return to the bone marrow ward his son had contracted septic shock but none of that had happened at least not yet but would it his dizziness intensified in a rush he pulled a chair from the table and slumped into it he propped his elbows on the table and clutched his head his chest felt squeezed im having a heart attack but he didnt feel a sharp pain down his left arm and his heartthough it rusheddidnt skip or feel stabbed mouth parched tongue swollen he knew he shouldnt move if this was a heart attack but he took the risk and staggered toward the kitchen sink where he turned on the tap bent down and gulped water he shoved his head beneath the faucet and drenched his hair at once he had the vertiginous sensation of floating over an old man in a hospital bed the old mans eyes were closed hooked to lifesupport systems the old man was surrounded by nurses and doctors raising the foot of his bed injecting medications and turning dials on a respirator an elderly woman slumped over the old man sobbing my nightmare drifting down a brilliant corridor he hovered in a radiant doorway fireflies power chords hunched over the kitchen sink david almost threw up man youre in really bad shape youd better go to bed but thats what happened in my nightmare and the next day the septic shock hit matthew and septic shock he suddenly realized hed never heard those words before except in his nightmare but he understood what septic shock meant or thought he did floating from an old mans body hovering in a radiant doorway searching for a firefly among splendrous millions youd better get control david drank more water and turned off the tap grabbing a dish towel he wiped his dripping hair well theres an easy way to convince yourself its all in your head david thought in your nightmare before you staggered to bed you phoned matts room at the hospital you let it ring ten times but no one answered david groped past a window toward the phone on the kitchen wall heart racing he pressed the numbers for matthews room one ring two rings ten rings no one answered he let it ring longer still no one answered feeling suffocated david set down the phone he pressed his back against the wall and strained to keep his knees from collapsing in his nightmare the explanation for the lack of response on matthews phone was that donna had helped matt get out of bed and walk into the ward so matt could reach a bathtub in a room around a corner down the hall again david floated he couldnt ignore his terror he felt so sure of what would happen next that he had to act as if it would happen if he was wrong hed be grateful beyond belief but what if he was right he didnt dare dismiss the possibility that hed been granted the gift hed prayed for in his nightmare to dial back to retreat in time to take the knowledge of the future into the past based on what hed dreamed given what hed learned from his experience with matt in intensive care from conversations with doctors who reconsidered the choices theyd made from conclusions based on the autopsy report he had a precious opportunity to save his sons life the university of iowa s hospital administers to patients not just in iowa city but throughout the state there are other hospitals in the area of course but few are so wellequipped to deal with extreme diseases especially those involving childrens cancer a helicopter is available to fly emergency cases from hundreds of miles away other patientschronically ill but not in imminent danger of deathsometimes spend hours being driven to the hospital for specialized treatment two years before when the demands of writing assignments had forced david to resign from being a professor of american literature at the university he and his family had considered moving to another locale thanks to the famous character hed created and the income he received from bestselling novels about other characters he had the financial ability to live anywhere he wanted after all to work he needed only a word processor and a quiet room he could set up those conditions anywhere los angeles had been a likely placebecause of the movie producers david sometimes worked for new york city or nearby in connecticut had also been an optionbecause hed be close to his publishers but in the end as a consequence of the many business trips he had to take the palm trees he saw in california and the skyscrapers he saw in new york had begun to seem ordinary flying home peering down at the rich black soil and rolling wooded hills of iowa hed gradually decided that the midwest was as exotic as any of the socalled glamorous sites hed visited a friend had once laughed at davids choice of word exotic well attractive anyhow and more important innocent the airs clean there arent any traffic jams ive never had to worry about my children being mugged in the schoolyard i can get anywhere in town in fifteen minutes the people are friendly i like the space the bigsky feeling i guess what it comes down to is i feel at home ive settled even on a practical level the dental and medical care are magnificent medical care another irony for david could never have guessed how desperate he soon would feel about the medical care hed so praised or how fortuitous his choice to remain in iowa city would be patients in the farthest reaches of the state had to travel hundreds of miles for their treatment but davids desperately ill son could be driven to one of the nations finest hospitals within five minutes the family home was only ten blocks away the hospital is huge much larger than most medical facilities even in major american cities the complex stretches over blocks and blocks new buildings are constantly being constructed and some of the sophisticated diagnostic instruments a magnetic resonance imager for example arent available in many areas yes david thought if your son gets a rare form of cancer and the tumor lodges where it almost never doesin a rib instead of an arm or a leg if your son might have the only case of its kind in the nation its a damned wise choice you made in deciding to stay in iowa city these thoughts occurred to him as he pushed away from the kitchen wall with an unnerving sense of viewing everything from a distance he staggered downstairs to shower then stumbled upstairs to his bedroom where he struggled to dress still dizzy he knew he was risking a traffic accident by driving to the hospital but the alternative that of staying in bed till tomorrow as his nightmare had told him he otherwise would was an unacceptable option he had to save matts life driving carefully from the residential area turning left toward the expansive towers of the hospital that it seemed he hadnt seen in forty years he entered a parking ramp where he found a place to leave his porsche near the plymouth voyager his wife had driven to the hospital for a moment he leaned against his car to establish his balance then walked as steadily as he could from the ramp to one of the many entrances to the hospital his mind was playing tricks on him he felt unfamiliar with an institution that hed visited almost daily for the past six months as if he hadnt been here for half a lifetime instead of just this morning pushing open a door he walked along a corridor that hed gone down a thousand times and yet seemed barely to remember he reached a large open area in which chairs surrounded a grand piano that doctors sometimes played during lunch hour plants hung from gleaming mirrored walls and a ceiling four stories high turning right he forced himself along another corridor this too familiar but only as if through a mist he reached an elevator marked g and while it swiftly rose he endured a powerful pressure behind his ears with his hands cupped to his head to reduce the pressure he heard an increasing hum within his brain whats happening to me his arms and legs now tingled so severely it seemed as if electricity stung him the band around his chest squeezed tighter his forehead felt cold yet sweaty at the third floor the elevator door opened he lurched out turned left down another corridor and compelled himself not to waver he even managed to quicken his pace passing patients rooms he reached a nurses station whose design seemed primitive compared to the type hed seen in his nightmare mr morrell how good of you to come back a blond nurse smiled david remembered her and yet it didnt seem from recent conversations instead from long ago come back we were hoping youd give us a visit hows matt doing what do you mean thats what im here to find out but you know he isnt here he left a week ago hes up in bone marrow oh my god david thought i reached the wrong floor i went to where matt always used to get his treatment the pediatrics ward from a childs room he heard the distinctive sound of a nurse gently paddling her hands on the chest of a cystic fibrosis patient clearing fluid helping constricted lungs to breathe of course david said i must have bone marrow i made a mistake i know what you mean matts been on this ward so often i can see how youd come back by habit disoriented david surveyed the rooms along the corridor it seemed that matthew had stayed in every one of them at various times in the last six months forty years ago this ward had become a second home in one room he recognized again as if through a haze a tenyearold girl bald from chemotherapy when first diagnosed shed been riddled with tumors but treatment had managed to cure her nonetheless the patients mother unable to control her revulsion had disowned her daughter never once visiting eventually divorcing her husband in another room david saw an eightyearold boy whose parents had considered his cancer an inconvenience to their routine every three weeks on a friday they drove him to the front door of the hospital let him out and left while he found his way up to the pediatrics ward for chemotherapy he stayed for the weekend vomiting the fear and loneliness in his eyes enough to make david want to strangle the parents who drove back to the hospital on monday and waited while a nurse brought the boy in a wheelchair down to the hospital entrance where she helped him into the car but not us david thought not us donna sarie and i stayed with matthew always never letting him give up hope never allowing him to feel lonely or succumb to despair taking shifts and sometimes all three staying with him at once theyd bolstered his spirits and let him know how much he was loved they were his companions at all hours for his six months of treatment donna and david had probably seen matt more than most parents saw their children in snatches an hour in the morning an hour at night for a lifetime early in matthews treatment a doctor had asked about davids work hows your fiction going any new books restraining his frustration because the doctor was trying to be friendly david had answered my work since matt got sick ive stopped writing right now as long as it takes my job is my son yes david said to the nurse i made a mistake id better get up to the bone marrow ward but you didnt answer my question hows matt doing is he okay the answers too complicated it depends on if you look forward or back what right now hes doing well hes one of our favorite patients you know hes so brave we love his sense of humor so do i believe me so do i for what its worth i think you and the rest of the staff did a wonderful job keep us posted yeah david thought but i hope the message isnt the disaster of my nightmare ill let you know right now id better get up to where i belong to the bone marrow ward toward what david was becoming more convinced was a desperate chance for salvation the bone marrow ward logical simple ingenious and if your case isnt in the right statistics terrifying you dont go there to be treated unless theres nowhere else to go tumors are perversely fascinating in their capacity for evil they may be the only organic substance that left unharmed and given nourishment lives forever in laboratory conditions they survive and survive with matt the initial combination of chemical agents each combination is called a protocol proved ineffective after several administrations of it a second protocol was tried and that too proved ineffective matts tumor became classified as resistant an especially malignant life force the third protocol showed results however the mass shrank percent and surgery which would formerly have killed matt so large was the mass to start with now became possible the surgeon explained that the operation would take eight hours matt would lose the diseased rib and maybe one rib to the top and bottom depending on what the surgeon found the principal risk was that the tumor had grown so close to the spine that in removing the tumor the surgeon might accidentally cut a nerveor else the artery that supplies blood to the spinal cordand matt would be paralyzed what are matts chances of that happening fear made the question a whisper chances the surgeon had responded i do my best i cant give odds what happens to each patient happens to him one hundred percent so matt with utter calmness allowed himself to be prepared for surgery the nurse who took his heartbeat and blood pressure readings was astonished by how relaxed matts vital statistics made him seem david donna and sarie walked beside matts bed as he was wheeled toward the surgical area then the family was told to go to a waiting room the waiting room a horror in itself plenty of televisions and magazines but everyone stares at the floor an eighthour operation and the major risk is paralysis but the surgeon is optimistic and says hes going for total cure so you know when three hours into the operation you get a message to meet with the surgeon somethings horribly wrongand when not one surgeon but three of them join you in a consultation room you know that whatevers wrong its worse than you can imagine we ran into troubles the first surgeon said you dont mean hes paralyzed donna said the second surgeon shook his head not that at all then the surgeons didnt respond for gods sake tell us the tumor may be inoperable what it metastasized the third surgeon said its not just on his rib metastasized when david later repeated that word to friends and business associates he was amazed by how many didnt understand what metastasized meant to spread the tumor had sprouted seeds roots were growing throughout matthews lung no the metastases are so close to the spine i dont think i can get them all the first surgeon said ill probably have to take several more ribs than i hoped the surgeon exhaled and all of his lung david ached the point is if i dont get every offshoot from the tumor several other tumors will start to grow and in areas where i cant operate without killing him hes going to die the second surgeon nodded im sorry you have to be prepared for that possibility but isnt there anything we can do the surgeons glanced at each other the tumors been resistant to chemotherapy the third surgeon said the only thing i can think of is to really give it a dose i mean a humongous dose of chemicals to go for a bone marrow transplant david vaguely recalled having heard the term before but he had no idea what it meant itll take too long to explain right now the second surgeon said the treatments severe much worse than the chemotherapy your sons already received its risky but in many cases especially leukemia patients its been known to work but youve got to make a decision the first surgeon said as soon as i opened matt and saw what i was dealing with i put him on hold dont worry about him for now the respirator and the other machines are keeping him alive but i cant leave him like that very long youve got a decision to make whats the worst thing that ever happened to you how about the worst question you ever faced the options are this the first surgeon said i can leave the tumor as it is i can close matt up the tumor will continue to grow but matt will be able to have a more or less tolerable summer provided he gets enough pain medication he will be dead by the fall donnas face streamed with tears and the alternative david breathed i can go ahead with the surgery take several more ribs than i hoped probably all of his lung leave the parts of the tumor i cant get at close him up and hope that chemotherapy combined with a bone marrow transplant kills the rest but remember the tumors especially resistant the second surgeon said the bone marrow treatment might not work and the treatments extremely severe worse than anything hes already been through he could die from it the third surgeon said he might not even have the tolerable summer hed have if we took the first option and stopped the operation right now i cant keep matt on hold up there forever the first surgeon said ive either got to stop the procedure or get on with it soon how soon are you talking about youve got fifteen minutes to make up your mind and this is a onetimeonly decision you cant change your mind tomorrow or next week matt couldnt survive another exploratory operation of this scope and if the tumor gets any bigger id have to leave much more of it inside him which means the bone marrow treatment would have a great deal less chance of being effective fifteen minutes davids voice rasped as if his throat were packed with broken glass if you just sew him up right now hell die for sure sometime in the fall and if you take out what you can and go for the bone marrow transplant he still might die and youd be denying him a tolerable summer with the transplant his summer would be a distress to put it mildly donna kept weeping sarie seemed about to faint fifteen minutes less than that now the first surgeon said and a onetimeonly decision correct tell me what to do i cant thats why i came down here to speak with you the situations too complicated its up to you to make the choice i cantdavid gasped for breathface matt when he wakes up and tell him we did nothing i couldnt bear the look in his eyes i couldnt bear telling him that he doesnt have a chancethat hes going to die david looked for agreement from donna and sarie cheeks raw with tears they nodded go ahead and cut the sucker out david said get as much as you can we wont give up matthews strong hes proved it before hell prove it again just so we understand each other the second surgeon said whatever happens its extremely important to your mental health that you never secondguess this decision you made it in good faith never reconsider it cut david said get as much of that bastard tumor as you can another waiting room this one outside intensive care matts operation as predicted took eight hours the chief of the surgical team came into the crowded room and found a place to sit across from david donna and sarie his eyes were red with exhaustion he was scheduled to perform another operation within an hour how bad david asked there must have been forty people in the room all afraid for their own friends or relatives eavesdropping unabashedly they waited for the surgeons answer there are no secretsprivacy is impossiblein the waiting room for intensive care actually it went better than i expected the surgeon rubbed his raw eyes david straightened i only had to take four of his ribs and a third of his lung only when it comes to your son and you were told hed probably have a quarter of his body cut away you actually feel a bizarre relief when you learn it was only a fifth then the roots of the tumor hadnt spread as far as not as extensively as i feared the surgeon said thendavid took a breath afraid to askyou actually got it all the surgeon bit his lip no theres a growthit isnt big the size of the tip of my little fingerthat i had to leave against his spine it wasnt just a matter of risking paralysis if i took it id have killed him the other people waiting apprehensively to hear about their friends or relatives listened more intently oh davids voice dropped hed been warned not to hope and yet he had hoped and now he suffered the despairing consequences as i told you no matter how well the procedure went i knew i wouldnt get what i wanted total surgical cure then we go to bone marrow david said matthew was strong david had promised the surgeons that and the degree of matts strength was about to be proven matts surgery had been so severethe most painful there is to recover from the surgeon explainedthat matt had been scheduled for two days of intensive care instead of the usual one nonetheless twentyfour hours later matts tortured body had so responded to postoperative treatment that he could be moved back to his room on the pediatrics ward you were right you sons constitution is remarkable the surgeon said then turning to matt who was conscious though groggy from pain medication he added but matt im afraid im going to have to keep being tough on you i cant let you rest i cant let fluids accumulate in your system youre going to have to stand as soon as possible youre going to have to make your bladder work matt groaned stand as soon as youre able the important thing is you have to pee i dont want to have to put a catheter back into your penis matt groaned again the surgeons pager made a beeping sound from the small black box on his hip a voice announced a telephone number for him to call ill be right back the surgeon said donna sarie and a nurse followed the surgeon out leaving david and matthew alone david hesitated how are you doing son i hurt i bet another pause well lets get it over with matt murmured what if i have to standmatt groanedand pee lets do it now so i can sleep gods honest truth thats what he said and dont be surprised that he could talk much less be able to move maybe in the movies patients are unconscious for days after serious surgery while the actors have meaningful conversations at the bedside but in real life the physicians want you alert as soon as possible in intensive care matt had been conscious enough and alert enough to write notes his mouth had been blocked by a tube driving oxygen into his lungs two hours out of surgery the painll just keep on matt murmured he told me to stand lets do it help me somehow despite the oxygen prongs attached to matts nostrils and the iv tube leading into his arm and the tubes draining blood from an incision that curved from matts right shoulder blade down to his waist then around his waist and up to his right nipple somehow david and matthew got matthew out of bed matt gingerly placed his bare feet on the floor he gasped and wavered while david held him up and at the same time held the iv stand david groped for a plastic urine bottle and supported it under matts penis david waited it seemed forever matts knees began to buckle david gripped his left shoulder more firmly hurry matt im trying the force in matts voice must have been agonizing to him it doesnt want to come then well try another time no matt almost sobbed i dont want another catheter i dont want any more pain dribble the sound so commonplace made davids heart break dribble david felt the warmth of the urine through the plastic bottle he held that warmth was the most intimate sensation hed ever known dribble thank god the dribbles stopped no matthews face contorted with strain thats it cant make myself go anymore tired have to get back in bed twentyfour hours out of major surgery and youre standing peeing youre the strongest bravest person ive ever known im proud of you have to get back in bed i know son just a minute and you can rest david set the urine bottle on the floor eased matt toward the bed and thats when they discovered the huge mistake theyd made when matthews gurney had been wheeled down from intensive care the nurses in the pediatrics ward had raised the bed in his room gripped the sheet beneath him and gently pulled him across from the gurney onto the bed that bed from which david had helped matt to stand had not yet been lowered the mattress was as high as davids chest and matthews shoulders matt couldnt set his hips on the bed and lean back to rest matt wavered close to falling david clutched matts left shoulder released the iv stand and reached for a button to summon a nurse but the button was too far away david couldnt reach the button unless he let go of matt the iv stand started wobbling david grabbed for it matt wavered so fiercely that david couldnt possibly expect him to try to edge toward the button that would summon a nurse the oxygen prongs fell out of matts nostrils the tube that drained blood from matts huge incision stretched taught as matt wobbled matt i dont have the strength to hold your iv stand with one hand and use my other hand to lift you onto the bed i cant stand any longer why did i let myself listen to him twentyfour hours out of major surgery and hes out of bed clutching me the two of us wavering like two drunks trying to dance how could i have been so stupid dad that chair i dont understand can you reach the chair but why do it matthew wheezed pull it over here i think if i can stand on it thats when david knew he wasnt as smart as his son yes david frantically released his hold on the iv stand he grabbed the chair jerked it toward him and desperately regrabbed the iv stand just before it toppled all the while using his left hand to hold up matt do you really think you just keep holding me dad matt strained gasping he raised a foot to the chair david eased him up with a greater gasp matthew raised his other foot to the chair david eased him higher matts hips were now level with the bed he sat clutched davids shoulders and with the most terrible groan david had ever heard lay back in bed david quickly reattached the oxygen prongs to matthews nostrils so cold matthew said at that moment as david pulled a sheet and blanket over his shivering son the door to the room swung open the surgeon stepped in followed by donna sarie and a nurse the call i had to return wasnt important the surgeon said but your mother and sister and i had a good chance to talk as i was saying matt i hate to do this nonetheless i need to keep being tough on you as soon as youre able in a day or so youve got to get out of bed more important youve got to make your bladder work through his pain matt grinned its already taken care of what here david said he stooped and handed the surgeon the plastic bottle of urine the surgeon looked baffled but how did you welldavid glanced with love toward matthewyou might say we went dancing i think the bed could be a little lower wait a second you dont mean you wanted him on his feet as soon as possible david directed another loving glance toward matthew who kept grinning through his pain i promised you my sons as tough as any patient you ever had tough doesnt describe it what do you say to a fifteenyearold boy who stood only fivefeet tall and weighed only a hundred pounds and was totally hairless whose cancer and chemotherapy had made his skin translucent what do you say when he recovers from his minddisorienting sedation after major surgery and realizes the extent of whats been done to him four ribs a third of my lung matts eyes became panicked his next question though so avoided the crucial issue that davids breath escaped him pushed out by pity then i wont be able to play the guitar again matts voice broke i wont be able to keep up my music david said the surgeon took some muscle tissue from your back and grafted in onto your chest where your ribs used to be with some physical therapy you ought to be able to have the strength to hold your guitar later when youve stopped growingif david thought if you get the chance to be old enough to stop growingyoull have another operation not as serious to put a support brace into your chest to replace the ribs you lost you wont have a gap there no deformity youll stand straight as far as your lungs concerned if youd lost it completely you wouldnt be able to breathe sufficiently to play on stage with a band but you only lost a third of your lung you wont run any hundredyard dashes you wont charge up a dozen flights of stairs but youll be able to walk as easily with as little effort as you did before if you dont try to be bruce springsteen and sprint around the stage you still have a chance to be a musician still have a chance matthew sensed the implication he mustered the courage to ask the allimportant question still have a hows my case doing david donna sarie and matts physicians had made a bargain with him from the day of his diagnosis no one would ever lie to him dad my case not so good the surgeon couldnt get it all david held back tears matthew knew that his tumor was resistant to chemotherapy that only once had any combination of chemicals caused a response and even then only a partial one to the best of his information surgery had been his final hope then im going to die matt asked the question as if he didnt understand the meaning of the words as if they were gibberish or a foreign language but all at once he did understand and tears leaked from his eyes im going to die a physician who saw matthew seldom and thus hadnt established rapport with him responded you have to face up to it theres a strong risk you might not survive at the time david thought the doctors response was so cruelly matteroffact that david wanted to grab the man shake him and curse him for his insensitivity but the physician it turned out had been forced to answer that ultimate question so many times in his career that hed finally concluded that the only adequate response was to be direct and objective an unemotional statement of the facts and the fact was that matthew did have to be prepared his chances of survival were narrowing there was a likely possibility he would die butmatthew sobbedi dont want to die no one wants to die the physician said everyone eventually does though when theyre old when theyve lived their lives it doesnt always happen that way matthew sobbed harder im just a kid no pain no catastrophe that david had ever endured compared with the heartbreak matthews next sobbing statement caused no one will remember me david wanted to scream instead he held matthews hand and tried not to let him panic if the worst does happen i promise son you wont be alone and you will be remembered but no ones giving up i told you weve still got a chance david looked with hope toward the physician a bone marrow transplant yes the physician said provided your son meets the requirements requirements the start of another nightmare during matts operation when the surgeons had explained the unforeseen complications of his tumor when a decision had to be made within fifteen minutes there hadnt been time for the surgeons to discuss the conditions required for a bone marrow transplant there were four first the bone marrow transplant unit wouldnt put matthew through the extreme procedure unless there was a reasonable expectation that the treatment would succeed to determine whether matthew was a suitable candidate the physicians had to know second whether the remnant of the tumor that the surgeon had been compelled to leave against matts spine was as small as the surgeon had described third whether the tumor was growing on any other parts of matthews body on his legs and arms for example where ewing s sarcoma customarily struck fourth whether his bone marrow was free of any microscopic evidence of tumor spores if any or all of these latter three conditions gave cause for pessimism all bets are off the physician said time was crucial the sooner the answers were determined provided they were encouraging the sooner matt could be given a bone marrow transplant that quarter of an inch of tumor that for sure was still in his body against his spine would keep growing and if it got much bigger it might resist even the massive doses of chemotherapy with which the physicians would attempt to kill it mentally psychologically emotionally and physically matt had almost reached the limit of what a human being can suffer and withstand but the suffering persisted within fortyeight hours of matts surgery he was wheeled from floor to floor from ward to ward each bump made him cringe in pain each time he was transferred from his bed to various examination tables he groaned and sweated but he never screamed he never panicked he had chest x rays skeletal x rays cat scans magnetic resonance images some of these procedures required him to remain immobile stifling his agony for an hour then his bone marrow had to be tested lying on his good side fighting the excruciating stress on his bad side he gripped davids hand with the force of a wrestler and endured the threaded point of a needle being screwed through each buttock and into each hip bone the needle probed to the very center of each bone and extracted marrow david had no idea what marrow looked like he imagined it resembled bone but as the needle was unscrewed from each hip and its contents pushed onto a microscope slide he saw that bone marrow looked like blood the thickest the darkest hed ever seen the tests were completed the waiting began three days of unimaginably nervetaut waiting while david donna and sarie worked every minute to make matt as comfortable as possible and strained to alleviate his mental alarm hope matthew hope a sleepless son to a sleepless parent at three oclock in the morning is there an afterlife how does a father answer such a question from a son in danger of death david sat up from the cot beside matthews bed he chose his words carefully and each word tasted like salt afterlife i promised id never lie to you the truth is i dont know theres no way to tell i think there is i want to believe there is for sure a lot of people do believe there is but unless they get there theyll never know im pretty sure theres something after death matt said you mean like heaven sort of im confused were all confused so many theories a lot of eastern religions believe that we live many times and that when we die were reborn in a brandnew body ive heard about that whats it called no i remember reincarnation im surprised you know that ive been reading i want more time theres so much i want to learn about youve learned quite a lot already not enough david forced himself to keep talking those eastern religions believe that eventually after several lives we die one last time and go to god i remember but what is it son am i good enough for god that was one question david could answer without a doubt youre the finest person i know the most honest the most fair the most decent by all means youre good enough more than good enough for god i love you dad matt i cant express how much i love you the waiting finally ended the results of the tests came back three physicians and a nurse surrounded matthew on his bed while david donna and sarie waited anxiously in the background this was it the day of judgment and the physicians had such blank faces it was impossible to predict what they would report hurry for gods sake tell us david thought with so many people crowding the room he felt smothered matt your bone marrows clean theres no sign of ewing s sarcoma anywhere else in your body the remnant of tumor on your spine is so small we cant see it on x rays that and the fact that you recovered so strongly from your surgery makes us very much determined to go ahead with the transplant the room became silent david couldnt believe hed heard correctly but matt showed no reaction matt dont you understand youve got a chance david kissed matts forehead a doctor started grinning and theres something else the pathology results on the tumor showed it was necrotic what necrotic another doctor said the tumor was partially dead thats why it shrank after the investigational protocol but then it started growing again sarie said because it got used to those chemicals weve said all along the tumors resistant to treatment but the fact that some of it was dead proves it can respond its not completely resistant before the tumor was huge and the chemicals were given in nonlifethreatening amounts but now with such a small segment left inside and with the massive doses of chemicals well be giving you weve got reason to hope we can kill it yeah matt started to grin but his suffering still continued another operation was requiredto remove a pint of marrow from his hip bones then to implant a tube in the right upper chamber of his heart a match to the one that months ago had been inserted in his left chest for the purpose of making it easier to administer the chemicals in the long run its more painless a physician said with the tubes in place we wont have to keep sticking ivs into your veins david interrupted we understood that in januarywhen you put in the first tube that first tube did its job well but why this second tube why so many tubes the doctors answer seemed vague well sometimes a bone marrow transplant gets complicated the doctor rubbed his neck sometimes we need a few more ways to gain quick access to a patients veins with so much good news david didnt pause to consider this hint about possible disaster his son had a chance that was all he cared about bone marrow is the substance within bones that produces blood if a patient has a resistant disease leukemia for example that attacks the marrow the treatment consists of extremely high doses of chemotherapy accompanied by fullbody radiation the effect of this treatment is in theory full destruction of the disease within the marrow nonetheless without healthy marrow to produce healthy blood the patient will die so healthy marrow has to be inserted into the body this procedure is accomplished by first finding a donor usually a brother or a sister whose marrow is compatible with the patients white blood cells marrow is then extracted from the donor and introduced into the patient if everything works as it should the donated marrow grows within the patient produces healthy blood and the patient is cured sometimes the patients body rejects the marrow and the patient is given marrow from yet another compatible donor if the patient continues to reject donated marrow theres no way to save that patient from the lethal effects of the massive chemotherapy but more often than not david learned the treatment works the miraculous part of the procedure is that while the marrow has to be extracted surgically from a donor its introduced into the patients body through the simple means of pumping it through an iv tube because bone marrow like a homing pigeon somehow knows where to go it enters a vein and flows toward its proper destination the center of bones where marvel that it is it feels at home and god willing multiplies a wonder of nature in matthews case his marrow was not diseased so he needed no other donor than himself the pint of marrow that had been surgically extracted from him was combined with a chemical preservative placed in a plastic bag flattened in a metal tray and frozen much below zero in a liquid nitrogen container that resembled a conventional freezer the advantage of being a selfdonor of returning his own marrow to his own body was that matt didnt risk complications due to biological rejection of foreign marrow whats more since his cancer was localized he didnt have to undergo fullbody radiation as well as the chemotherapy that was the good part but no matter if otherdonated or selfdonated the marrow couldnt enter the body until the blooddestroying treatment was completed and that was the bad part when you receive what a physician calls humongous doses of chemotherapy your blood becomes worthless it has no platelets to enable it to clot if youre injured and start to bleed it has no white blood cells to combat infection it has no red cells to carry oxygen you get the idea each day for seven days as matthew received intravenous chemotherapy monumental lifethreatening doses of it a nurse wrote numbers on a chart on the wall these numbers were in columns and referred to the various vital aspects of his blood and each day the numbers went lower a whiteblood count of six thousand is wonderful but david donna and sarie watched matthews whiteblood count descend to zero thats when a simple ingenious system gets scary someone with a slight case of the flu can contaminate a bonemarrowtransplant patient and instead of giving the patient a mild stomach upset the flu makes him very sick indeed because the patient has no white blood cells to attack the usually mild infection further the bonemarrow physicians cant assume that the patients fever and nausea are merely produced by the flu to guard against other potentially lethal infections they might be forced to administer unnecessary extreme medications before entering matts room david donna and sarie washed their hands thoroughly then put on hospital gowns they interrogated matts visitors to make sure no one had been exposed to even a cold wash your hands put on that gown after seven excruciating days and a day of rest that allowed the deadly chemicals to be purged from matthews body his bone marrow has unfrozen and returned to him cause for joy but matt was fifteen past puberty though the hospital classified anyone under sixteen as a child the preservative in his bone marrow which worked well on children but caused occasional allergic reactions in adults sent his blood pressure soaring to one hundred and seventy his head ached so severely he told david he feared his skull would burst he convulsed his breath because of a peculiarity of the preservative filled his room with the smell of garlic and that made him vomit but medication reduced his blood pressure the headaches and convulsions stopped the garlic stench eventually went away and everyone waited for a zero whiteblood count to climb that was when david took his turn sleeping next to matthew when donna went home to rest when donna returned to the hospital in the morning and david went home to run as was his custom and stumbled into the house couldnt stop sweating filled a glass of water raised it to his lips and suddenly fainted on his kitchen floor time present and time past are both perhaps present in time future and time future contained in time past t s eliot four quartets burnt norton floating his daughter grieving below him hovering his aged body succumbing beneath him forty years later or forty years earlier in a nightmare on his kitchen floor he didnt know he didnt understand rising drifting floating through brilliance a radiant hallway a splendrous door pushing the door swinging open fireflies power chords but where was matthew he had to save matthew part three panic attack david struggled against his dizziness as he rushed from the pediatrics ward the corridor the rooms the administration area the blond nurse hed spoken tothey unnerved him as if hed seen them only recently and yet remembered them from long ago my god whats wrong with me the tingling that had started in his hands and feet had now spread up his arms and legs rushing toward his heart he felt so offbalance he almost leaned against a wall the humming behind his ears so disoriented him he wanted to sink to the floor but he had to keep moving hurry matthew he couldnt explain his fear that tomorrow afternoon his son would contract septic shock and eight days later die from its effects whatever had happened to him while hed fainted david knew what was going to occur he could see it as if each terrifying instant had been seared into his memory lurching around a corner he found an open door to an elevator and rushed inside vision blurry he fumbled to press the button marked the doors hissed shut the elevator surged upward again the pressure in davids skull swelled making him grab his temples he stifled the urge to vomit abruptly the elevator stopped its doors opened he staggered into a corridor not sure which direction to choose but wasnt i here just this morning then suddenly realized he had to turn right down another corridor a man and a woman stared at his unsteady movements he fought not to waver passing elevator f passing elevator e through a gradually clearing haze of memory he regained his bearings turn right he found a door pushed through it and hurried down still another corridor this one lined with rooms in which elderly patients blinked listlessly at game shows on television now youve got to try to eat mr standish a nurse raised a spoon of what looked like pea soup to the lips of an aged bonethin man david hurried farther passed a nurses station pushed through another door and at last he was here at the source of his nightmare the bone marrow ward its safety procedures were meticulous because of the danger of infection the air inside this ward was filtered purified and recirculated every two hours the nurses took off their gowns each time they left a patients room and put on fresh gowns whenever they entered another patients room if a patient wanted to watch a videotape the vcr was scrubbed with disinfectant before it was taken inside the patients room every precaution short of total isolation was maintained and yet and yet david knew that tomorrow afternoon his son would he hurried toward the bin in which the fresh gowns were stored putting one on tying its strings he noticed a worried mother carrying a tray of barely eaten food from her daughters room this woman like the nurse in the pediatrics ward he remembered vividly and yet as if from a great gap in time he tried to smile though his dizziness made the ward seem to swirl and managed to walk a straight line toward matthews room but when he peered through the open door the bed was empty in davids nightmare matt had been helped down the hall and was having a bath right now if that turned out to be true would everything else in the nightmare also come true panic rising david turned and saw the most lovely vision he ever hoped to appreciate not matthew though he would have been vision enough but donna who came around a corner adjusting the ties on her hospital gown and paused as david smiled at her davids smile was broad enough to hurt his cheeks deep enough to squeeze his heart donna who had died in his nightmare at the age of seventynine and who even then had seemed as beautiful as the day he had married her on his wedding day hed been so afraid to give up what he thought of as his freedom even though hed made the commitment to combine his destiny with hers that hed almost fled from the church but hed abided by his commitment and when hed turned from the altar to witness his soontobe wife proceeding with such pride and dignity down the aisle her white gown so magnificent her brown eyes auburn hair and dark oval face so lovely his heart had rejoiced just as it rejoiced now as he stared at her with wonderher experiencewearied features midway between the glowing smoothness hed witnessed on his wedding day and the ashen wrinkles hed seen on the day she died despite the swirling in his brain david walked toward her put his hands on her shoulders and kissed her tenderly on the lips i havent seen you in a while she studied him with welcoming eyes he swore they glowed and he swore something else as eerie as it seemed he felt that she felt she knew that they were gazing at each other with wonder as if a miracle had occurred from a perspective forward of another halflifetime of almost forty years in case i havent told you often enough david said i love you donnas grin was as winsome as when shed been twentyone or seventynine and her humor was as endearing as ever oh hell she said and kept grinning dont bore me deeply david said always you dont know how much i mean always dont i i do know yes inches away they surveyed each others eyes and david was suddenly sure that he saw behind her eyes the same desperate knowledge he had as if they had both returned both been given a second chance a reprieve a miraculous opportunity to reverse the greatest loss of their earthly existence to save their sons life yes always david said deeply and forever i love you donnas grin changed to solemnness and more the epitome of determination i understand believe me yes deeply forever weve got a job to do the greatest job of our lives davids festering question burst from him wheres matt he went for a bath just as in my nightmare david thought dad turning david saw him the interval between extensive surgery and the bonemarrow transplant had permitted sufficient time for matthews hair to begin to grow again matthews scalp was fuzzy with hair he even had the shadow of a mustache but as matt returned from his bath holding his robe together with one hand while he gripped a portable radio in the other he looked flushed his eyes looked dull and he was staggering jesus david murmured he and donna rushed to him matt wobbled about to fall as they caught him almost lost my balance in the almost cracked my head getting out of the tub a nurse said behind him i kept a close watch i held him tight but slipped dizzy matthew said could hardly get out of the nearly hit my head on the sink he gasped need oxygen cant breathe while the nurse took off her gown and put on a fresh one david and donna helped matthew into his room his knees kept buckling they eased him onto his bed then quickly used the sink in the room to wash their hands with disinfectant by then the nurse had joined them washing her hands as well cant breathe matt repeated whats wrong with him donna asked david fought to control his dizziness the effects of the chemotherapy his low blood factors the nurses tone was reassuring nonetheless she frowned checking matthews pulse david hes been like this since you left this morning donna said im worriedmore than usual she had good reason to worry david knew with inexplicable certainty his arms and legs tingled in cold then hot rushes his heartbeats slightly higher than normal for him eightyfive instead of seventy the nurse said thats probably from the exertion of taking a bath and coming back to his room but her frown persisted as she wrapped a cuff around matthews arm and pumped it full of air to monitor his blood pressure need oxygen matthew repeated give it to him david said he probably doesnt need it most likely hes just short of breath from walking back tothe nurse interrupted herself putting a stethoscope to her ears then watching a bloodpressure monitor on the wall behind the bed slightly higher than normal for him normal for matt was one hundred and ten over seventyfive what are the numbers davids voice was strained with urgency one hundred and twenty over eighty well within an acceptable range but look at him hes sick its to be expected after all the treatment hes had when his blood counts start to rise hell feel a lot better my stomach hurts matt said as if you might vomit the nurse grabbed for a plastic basin no matt gasped it burns you might have ulcers from the chemotherapy the nurse explained but hes had six months of chemotherapy donna said and he never had ulcers before because he never had treatment in such large doses oxygen matts chest heaved give it to him david said but i cant why here the nurse handed david a sheet of paper before he went for his bath i took a sample of his bloodto have it analyzed for its oxygen content the computer just printed out the results of the test his blood gases are just what they should be the lab test shows he doesnt need oxygen if i give it to him id hurt him more than help him oxygens toxic to a patients lungs if its administered when he doesnt need it the tingling rushed from davids arms and legs toward his chest his heart beat faster but you said you took the bloodgas test before matt went for his bath maybe he didnt need oxygen then but what if his condition changed in the meantime what if he needs the oxygen now his condition couldnt change that fast the nurse said not without something to indicate the change i just took his temperature its normal davids lungs pumped the swirling in his brain intensified a peculiar kind of swirling not the sort in which the room seemed to spin instead the room remained still while his mind spun again he saw fireflies again he floated down a brilliant corridor again he heard power chords but the fireflies could have been glinting specks behind his eyes and the power chords david suddenly realized that matthews portable radio had been playing heavymetal rock all along my god is this really just a delusion and yet he knew he was sure that matthews weakness and stomach pains were warnings of the septic shock that soon would kill him no he liked this nurse she knew her job she did it well she was sympathetic talented motivated and totally wrong i cant waste time i cant let my son die his pulse thumped faster increasing the humming behind his ears hed hoped to intervene subtly in matthews treatment to point out this or that minimal change in matts condition to maneuver matts physicians into humoring davids increasing concern and taking precautions that they saw no need for given matts presently acceptable vital statistics but now he realized that if he did believe in his premonitions he couldnt keep following the indirect tactic hed chosen he had to insist to do and not just make suggestions to act against the system instead of within it antibiotics david told the nurse he needs them right now give them the nurse stepped backward what are you talking about donna do you understand yes believe me again david saw her in triplicateas a vibrant bride in her early twenties as a dying elderly woman as the middleaged desperate mother she was at presentall equally beautiful each the object of the various lifelong profoundly increasing stages of his love but at the moment he thought hed never loved her more and again he was struck by something behind her eyes a frightened conviction a terrified certainty as if she truly did understand what he was warning about antibiotics matt needs them give them to him now david told the nurse but i told youthe nurse stepped farther backhe doesnt have a temperature his other statistics are somewhat high but well within normal ranges theres no reason to give him antibiotics even if he had an infection which he doesnt wed need to do lab cultures on his blood to learn what kind of infection it was so we could decide what kind of antibiotics would be best to fight the whos the doctor on duty the nurse veered quickly past david her eyes no longer nervous but apprehensive ill hurry and get him no ill go with you donna in the next ten minutes mattll be so weak he wont take phone calls hell send away visitors the friends hes been anxious to hear from hell ask you to turn off his music understand hell start rejecting everything thats important to him yes donna said that same unsettling knowledge behind her eyes i understand do it whatever you think is right im so afraid twice is too many times donna nodded as if she sensed exactly what he meant with a frightened look the nurse left the room david followed in the corridor the nurse whispered to the head physician her remarks attracting a second physician they turned eyes narrowed as david approached the first physician straightened we gather youre having some reservations about your sons treatment fears thats understandable the second physician cleared his throat obviously hoping to avoid an awkward conversation in public youre following the procedure you explained to me i understood the logic of that treatment i agreed david said well good the first physician said then we dont have a problem no david said everythings changed now changed because he feels weak but we told you that would happen davids heart kept pounding yes but something else is going to happen all the early symptoms are there but you dont know it yet because youre not expecting it so youre nothis lungs heavedyoure not interpreting the symptoms i beg your pardon the second physician narrowed his eyes im not interpreting the symptoms the way you would if you knew what was going to happen going to happen the first physician frowned at his colleague the parents of other patients had begun to gather and listen can we go somewhere else to have this talk the second physician said as long as we get this settled theres a conference room down the hall they shut the door to the narrow room that had a blackboard upon which doctors customarily drew diagrams for parents confused about the treatment their child would receive both physicians studied david as if they wished they werent alone with him now we realize youre under stress the first physician said youre worried about your son all perfectly natural but what exactly do you think is going to happen davids legs felt weak he gripped a chair septic shock the second physician narrowed his eyes whered you hear that term something you read youve been doing lets call it wellintended but uninformed research and it makes you nervous never mind how i know im absolutely certain now listen carefully the first physician said whatever books youve been reading whatever outdated texts have made you afraid yes its true theres always a danger of septic shock weve already warned you when a patients blood counts are low theres a risk of infection thats why we take extreme precautions to prevent no you listen carefully though the room stayed perfectly still davids mind revolved your precautions are fine theres nothing wrong with the treatment youre giving him but matthew will get septic shock i cant explain why but tomorrow afternoon hell become infected his blood pressure will drop and what makes you so sure you wouldnt believe me just give him antibiotics now the first physician edged toward the phone the second physician raised his hands in a placating gesture antibiotics is a general description of a wide variety of treatment i understand that different antibiotics have applications to different infections the first physician picked up the phone davids chest felt squeezed stop give me a chance the first physician touched numbers on the phone please the first physician hesitated you need to know the specific infection so you can choose the specific antibiotic to use to attack it so now im telling you as david spoke the words that to anyone but a doctor would have been gibberish as he recalled the words hed memorized from the microbiology report in his dream words that in his present timestream would have been impossible for him to know let alone pronounce he realized that he wasnt crazy his dying vision was fact he had indeed come back for what he told the physicians the words like gravel in his mouth was whatll give matthew septic shock streptococcus mitis staphylococcus epidermidis david couldnt believe hed spewed those chunks out the physicians couldnt believe it either where the hell did you the first physician almost dropped the phone the second physician drew his head back but naturally adapted strep and staph are almost never fatal david shuddered this time they will be his legs buckled the room spun along with his brain he lost his grip on the chair my god hes falling having a drifting toppling heart attack when david struck the floor he couldnt move he felt disoriented helpless his fall which seemed to have lasted forever contrasted sickeningly with the sense he had of floating above his aged dying body he seemed to drop and rise simultaneouslyconflicting sensations that produced such vertigo he could barely muster the strength to blink making these reactions more intense was the added element of fear as if to move to try to stand would kill him through a haze he saw the first physician lunge from the room the second physician knelt beside david checking his pulse after an intervalten seconds a minutethe first physician rushed back accompanied by donna and a nurse his pulse is strong the first physicians voice was an echo no fibrillation ninety acceptable the second physician said no normal for me is davids chest heaved dont try to talk the nurse wrapped a bloodpressure cuff around davids arm donna knelt beside him touching his cheek as the nurse inflated the cuff david saw the fear in donnas eyes the nurse deflated the cuff watching a dial as she listened to a stethoscope pressed to davids arm a hundred and forty over ninety tolerable a little high but not unusual not critical the second physician said no listen normal for me is dont try to talk relax sure easy for you to say david thought the room and his mind aswirl what i told you a minute ago might not be true try not to worry our initial examination isnt conclusive but you might not be having a heart attack then what we dont know weve alerted emergency were sending you down there if it is a heart attack were not equipped to deal with stop the spinning stop the damned room from spinning david im here ill be with you donna said ill stay right beside you no stay with matthew the effort to emphasize his words was excruciating david felt his body being lifted he suddenly found himself in a wheelchair he closed his eyes but the tinglingand worse the swirlingpersisted feeling the wheelchair being pushed he groaned from increasing dizziness pressure accumulated behind his ears he dared to open his eyes and discovered he was in an elevator the doors hissed shut the elevator dropped no at last he moved of his own accord shoving his hands to his ears to stifle the pressure no the elevator jerked to a stop the top of his head seemed about to explode if someone hadnt been holding him hed have toppled from the wheelchair blinding lights a swirling corridor but not the soothing gleam of the corridor in his nightmare this was the hospitals first floor rear section the part that patients and visitors almost never saw and prayed they would never have to see through a spinning maze of twists and turns he was rushed in his wheelchair toward the emergency ward outside a wailing ambulance arrived david concentrated to focus on glass doors that led to a curve in a driveway where attendants unloaded a patient onto a gurney through a blur he saw a nurses station directly across from where the glass doors now slid open the attendants hurrying the patient through davids wheelchair stopped abruptly in front of the nurses station his head tilted forward making him groan a woman peered over a computer screen toward him name she poised her fingers above a keyboard david managed to tell her two rs two is david gasped for breath and nodded the woman tapped the keyboard address its alldavid sweated even though his skin felt coldon file i hurt my shoulder in march he breathed faster i came here then for treatment im in the computer file just a minute the woman tapped the keyboard again she read an address from the screen thats where you live david nodded the woman read the name of an insurance company yes david breathed okay you can take him in the wheelchair hurried forward davids dizziness increased he closed his eyes once more felt the wheelchair turn sharply left and the next time he looked he was speeding toward an examination rooma bed a sink a metal cabinet its shelves stacked with medical supplies the nurse who had wheeled him down from the bone marrow ward stopped and tapped his shoulder theyll take care of you now mr morrell good luck ive got to get back on duty upstairs at once another nurse replaced her can you stand dont know try i have to get you onto the table she gripped his arms and helped him to his feet wobbling he leaned his hips against the table and settled backward she raised a metal bar on each side of the table to keep him from rolling off a male resident came in closing a curtain pulse is ninety the nurse said not critical no listen to me david felt as if a tenpound rock had been set on his chest i tried to explain upstairs he squirmed from the humming pain behind his ears im a runner my heart rates low its normally sixty blood pressureone hundred and forty over ninety the resident shrugged as if to say not critical again you dont understand david shivered it should be a hundred and fifteen over seventyfive its never god that curtain the resident frowned and turned toward the privacy curtain whats wrong with the curtain was decorated with blue wavy lines davids mind not only spun now but wavered in imitation of those lines sickened he closed his eyes again but still saw the wavy lines his breath was so rapid he felt hed just run several miles the top of his head seemed to bulge im going to faint die toppling toward his kitchen floor floating toward the radiant doorway fireflies gleaming behind his eyes power chords throbbing in his head then now later whats happening to me thats what we want to find out the nurse unbuttoned davids shirt the resident pressed pads against davids chest squinting david saw that the pads were attached to wires that led to an ekg machine on a cart the resident flipped a switch on the ekg needles wavered making inky marks on paper the paper rolled from the machine the resident tore off a sheet and studied it yes i found the problem here and another one here and here extra blips your heart theres something wrong with let me see it david gasped what let me see it david reached for the printout the effort to focus his eyes was agonizing no thats not whats wrong with me what are you talking about those blips normal for me normal my ekg relax always looks like this the resident frowned have you had medical training no in that case but ive always had adavid grabbed the sides of the table as it started swirlingright i dont understand right bundle david struggled to complete his statement right bundle branch block the nurse and the resident stared at each other right bundle branch block the resident seemed astonished as if hed never expected a patient to speak to him in technical medical phrases in contrast with davids certainty about the septic shock that would soon kill his sonhave to save himthere was nothing mysterious about his present medical knowledge the phenomenon in his heart had been explained to him years before the heart is a pump and like any other pump it needs an energy source electricity produced by the body nerves like wires control the flow of energy and under normal circumstances this energy flows smoothly from chamber to chamber stimulating the heart to take in and push out blood but in davids case a cluster of nerves a bundle branch on the right side of his heart had deteriorated energy impulses which usually flowed in an orderly fashion had been interrupted and forced to redirect themselves along another branch of nerves taking longer to reach the right side of his heart on a printout from an ekg machine this redirection of energy produced an extra blip within an otherwise normal heart wave pattern the blip was not alarming as long as you knew what it meant and davids condition wasnt considered lethal for twenty years hed run an average of four miles every day and even though he was foolishly a smoker he could finish that run and never be out of breath so whatever was wrong with him he was sure that the bundle branch block hadnt caused it but something was wrong without a doubt pausing often to gasp for air he described his symptoms tingling shivering sweating rapid heartbeat rapid breathing pressure on his chest humming behind his ears swelling in his head and swirling terrible swirling david thought if you had these symptoms what would you guess was going wrong a heart attack you bet thats what youd guess no never mind guess were talking fear okay the extra blips match what youre telling me the resident said a right bundle branch block then whatdavids chest heaved both his lungs and heartis wrong with well do more tests hang on were trying mr morrell well do everything we can to find out the nurse inspected davids right arm his central veins good and thick she stuck an intravenous needle into the vein and extracted blood david felt too disoriented to feel the prick of the needle get lab tests as soon as possible the resident said the nurse rushed away and just then sarie walked in beautiful wonderful sarie as when david had seentoo weak a wordwitnessed donna in the bone marrow ward after three hours of having been away or else half a lifetime davids soul swelled with love again as when hed seen donna upstairs he had the eerie sense of a triple image of sarie as a smoothfaced infant of the glowing twentyoneyearold she now was of the haggard woman who wept beside his deathbed im going crazy david thought thats whats wrong im not sick im nuts and yet and yet why am i so sure of when and how mattll die saries blueeyed blond glow of young adulthood was dimmed with shock i just got out of class i went up to visit matt mom told me yeah despite his rushing heart david did his best to grin mom told you ive got a few problems sarie clutched his hand she said you wanted her to stay with matt so i came down to see im glad you did the pressure in his head swelled making him grimace its good to have you with me someone brushed past the curtain entering the room a woman not a nurse she didnt wear a gown but slacks and a blazer neurologist she finished explaining i understand you collapsed an hour ago an hour ago david would have sworn hed been in the emergency ward for less than ten minutes what are your symptoms the neurologist asked for a second time david described them tingling rapid pressure swelling dizzy humming the resident enumerated davids vital statistics the neurologist frowned theyre not consistent with a heart attack david turned to sarie matt he can hardly move his girlfriend called he didnt have the strength to talk to her its starting david thought the infections building im seven floors below him i can barely move but im the only one who can save him grip my hands the neurologist said what grip my hands david obeyed squeeze them as hard as you can david squeezed until her fingertips turned white good the neurologist took off his shoes and socks then pressed the blunt end of a pen down the balls of his feet his toes curled inward good she tapped a rubber hammer against his elbows knees and ankles his reflexes jerked good stop the damned room from spinning the resident checked davids pulse what the its up to a hundred and ten the neurologist straightened blood pressure up a hundred and fifty over ninetyfive sarie go back upstairs david blurted go back to donna tell her whatever happens to me tell her mr morrell has anything happened to you in the last few days to change your medical i fainted this morning fainted i went out running i came back started to drink a glass of water and you ran in this heat and fainted the resident said youre probably dehydrated no i drank plenty of water after i woke up electrolytes the neurologist said they must be offbalance no david said he understood about electrolytes they were elements in a persons blood that allowed the bodys electricity to flow efficiently through vital organs but if these elements werent present the electricity couldnt flow and the vital organs went into shock the principal electrolytes were potassium and sodium no david repeated i swallowed a potassium pill i put salt on my palm and licked it have you had medical training sarie get back to donna and matt his pulse is up again the resident said a hundred and fifty pressure the neurologist said a hundred and sixty over david felt such swelling in his chest and head such heaving in his lungs that im going to die he said code blue the resident asked despite his delirium david recognized the hospitals signal for summoning maximum help in case of imminent death code blue should i call it in the resident repeated the neurologist opened her mouth her lips forming yes wait his pulse is coming down the resident said a hundred and forty the neurologist rubbed her forehead pressure down a hundred and fifty code blue not yet his pulse is down again the resident said a hundred and thirty pressure down a hundred and forty the room became silent in davids swirling mind the walls seemed to narrow his pulse is down to a hundred the resident said his pressures a hundred and thirty davids delirium began to clear he stared at the cabinet to his right and managed to steady his vision pulse ninety the same as when he came in here pressure a hundred and twenty almost what he says is normal for him the resident shook his head this things like a roller coaster suddenly up then down the neurologist rubbed the back of her neck i dont know labyrinthitis maybe she referred to an infection of the inner ear that affected a persons ability to balance making the patient dizzy no the neurologist corrected herself that wouldnt explain the pressure on his chest mr morrell apart from your fainting spell after running this morning has anything else happened to change your medical condition the last six months have been the same i dont understand she responded to a sudden thought when did you eat last this morning or maybe last night i dont remember you dont remember there isnt always time its been mostly hospital food and hospital food dadsarie clutched davids armtell them tell us what about matthew sarie said whos my son despite his dizziness david told them everything in hesitating gasps all of it a breathless babble the turmoil of the last six months every fearfilled instant mr morrell the neurologist said youve just had a panic attack part four déjà vu of course i feel panicked didnt you listen my son has cancer six months of chemotherapy i watched him lose his hair i held him while he vomited take it easy the resident said i watched him get weaker watched him stagger watched him get thinner they tried every goddamned chemical they thought would work he lost four ribs a third of his lung he had a bone marrow transplant three weeks ago i didnt even know what a bone marrow transplant was they try to relax the neurologist said if i dont do something matts going to die the nurse whod rushed off with samples of davids blood pulled open the curtain entering the room his tests came back the neurologist reached for the computer printout and scanned it the resident peered over her shoulder look at those numbers the resident said amazed you found it david asked you know whats wrong with these numbers indicate youve got the neurologist interrupted the healthiest blood ive seen tested this year cholesterolone hundred and seventynine well below the danger level creatininepoint nine david had never heard of creatinine he was sure the term was unfamiliar to him and yet he recalled his seizure on the kitchen floor this morning a shudder aggravated his tingling creatinine he understood suddenly was an element in blood that indicated how well a patients kidneys were functioning the lower the number the more efficiently the kidneys were filtering poisons from the body how do i know this david thought his was excellent david realized as if hed been taught it many years before an average person had a creatinine level between and over meant the kidneys werent working as hard as they should over meant the kidneys were failing over meant the kidneys werent working at all unless emergency procedures were taken the bodys toxins would accumulate to a fatal level in davids nightmare on his kitchen flooror in his memory floating over his deathbedwhen matthew had contracted septic shock one of the major consequences had been kidney damage the kidneys had shut down totally though temporarily david had been told matthews urine had stopped completely hed been put on dialysis to vent excess fluid and filter toxins from his blood but despite the dialysis matthews creatinine had risen todear godthe lethal level of and even that hadnt been what killed him had would but none of these disasters had happened they were only from davids nightmare and yet he knew tomorrow afternoon matts unexpected septic shock would set them in motion have to get up there have to save the neurologist kept reading the results of davids blood tests sodium potassium chloride electrolytes all normal no sugar problem mr morrell i repeat youve had a panic attack she raised her hands yes i understand youre worried about your son youre afraid for him but thats not the kind of fear im talking about sarie spoke quickly what do you mean the neurologist continued to stare at david for the past six months youve been in a constant state of increasing crisis each stage of your sons treatment has been more prolonged and more extreme extreme every time the damned phone rings you jump your knees get weak of course youre afraid youll hear more unnerving news about your sons condition a worse diagnosis of his pain his horrible pain i dont know how he bears it we tell him hes been through the worst and then something else goes wrong and he needs some other kind of treatment and the worst turns out to be nothing compared to i dont know how he keeps up his strength how can he be so brave he never complains he the pressure behind davids eyes broke tears streamed down his face matts just a kid how can he be so strong youre proving my point the neurologist said after six months of constant chaos your body finally told you it reached its limit imagine if youd almost been in a traffic accident a truck veers toward you forcing your car off the road you manage to stop an instant before you hit a tree whats your reaction your stomach feels on fire your heart races you cant catch your breath in effect youve been having that nearaccident for the past six months i could give you a lot of technical words about neurotransmitters in your arteries and the nucleus locus ceruleus in your brain but basically what it comes down to is your crisis glands have been working constantly to the maximum and youve become used to it you think its normal because for the last six months its all youve known youre so saturated with adrenaline your body cant deal with the chemical effects any longer youre hyperventilating and that makes your heart pump faster and that makes you dizzy of course the dizziness makes you more afraid that in turn makes you hyperventilate more extremely and that in turn makes your heart pound faster and youre trapped in a terrifying worsening selfperpetuating circle the more your crisis glands pump the more they will pump because theyre reinforced by fear a panic attack and if the cycle isnt stopped the ultimate consequence is total physical collapse and possible catatonia the neurologist paused one more thing in a panic attack the patient usually feels tingling only in his hands but you described tingling in your feet as well and that makes this one of the most extreme examples of a panic attack ive ever diagnosed you need rest a lot of it now but my son is under constant professional care in the four hours youve been down here what david thought pulse rising four hours it seemed as if hed been in the emergency ward for only fortyfive minutes in the four hours youve been down here the neurologist continued ive asked for several reports on your sons condition his physicians tell me hes doing fine hes weak but thats to be expected given what hes been through the main thing is hes stable and his treatment seems to be effective no hes going to die should i call for help the resident asked the neurologist studied david maybe we ought to sedate him the resident added no david said no please dont sedate me dont put me to sleep my son the neurologist scribbled on a prescription pad but sleeps exactly what you need your daughter can have this filled at the hospital pharmacy im prescribing valium for you valium whatever youve heard about the drug dont let the name shock you the neurologist said dont give yourself another attack these pills wont knock you out but they will make you groggy youll feel like taking a nap youll wake up calmer rested after your daughter gets this prescription filled i want her to take you home and put you to bed and to make sure you take the medication but my son two days from now youll adjust to the medication youll feel a little slow perhaps but much less excited and youll be able to function by then you can come back and visit your son as long as you dont try to drive in the meantime your wife will be with your son the doctors will supervise him constantly hes in good hands theres nothing to worry about two days from now david thought two days from now but thatll be too late the glass doors hissed open a nurse pushed david in a wheelchair from the emergency ward beneath a concrete canopy in a curve of the driveway where hours earlier david had seen attendants unloading a patient from an ambulance sarie was waiting in her yellow fiesta the nurse stopped the wheelchair opened the fiestas passenger door and eased david inside his every movement remained an effort his vision continued to swirl nonetheless he noticed sarie move a small white paper baga pharmacists green bill was stapled to itoff the passenger seat so he could get in the nurse shut the door get some rest now mr morrell she added to sarie make sure he takes those pills put him to bed as soon as he gets home dont worry sarie said i guarantee my dadll be a model patient sarie put the fiesta in gear then steered around the curved driveway heading toward the emergency wards parking lot the pivot of the car made davids mind reel he wanted to clutch his skull but given what he planned to do he didnt dare alarm his daughter she turned right onto a road that passed several university dormitories and a recreation building students thronged the sidewalks the warm june sun was low in the sky casting shadows david raised his watch squinting at its hands seventhirty in the evening and as near as he could tell hed entered the emergency ward shortly after two oclock he couldnt understand how the time had passed so quickly time he didnt have much time im sorry i took so long coming back sarie said the hospital pharmacy closes at six but i managed to get them to stay open long enough to fill the prescription then i wanted to go back upstairs and see matt i hope you didnt tell him what happened to me when david had collapsed hed been in a conference room with two doctors in theory matthew didnt know about the panic attack no mom didnt tell him either good i wouldnt want to upset him but i took mom aside and told her what the neurologist said was wrong with you moms worried she says you have to take care of yourself david nodded the effort painful mom says she can stay with matthew im supposed to ask a neighbor to bring up a change of clothes for her when we get a chance mom and i will trade places shell come home and see if youre okay oh im okay david said with effort you heard the neurologist im in perfect physical shape he stifled the bitterness in his voice except im terrified but matthews doing fine no he going to stop david thought you cant alarm her you need her help matts going to what sarie asked hes sicker than hes ever been before but thats because the chemotherapy this time was stronger than hes ever received david pressed her hand of course hes bound to be sicker this time forgive me im just a little confused fireflies power chords sarie turned right again more swirling in davids head proceeding down a main road toward an intersection where if they turned left theyd be heading home but if they turned right theyd go back to the hospital not to the emergency entrance in the rear but to one of the entrances along the front that david always used when he went up to stay with matthew sarie dont ask questions turn right but dont ask questions i said i know its the wrong direction itll take us back to the hospital just turn right but im supposed to what about the pills you were ordered to ill swallow them i promise ive got something i have to do first if it works i promise ill take the pills ill go to bed but what do you want to do i cant explain it now just do what i say listen to me im begging turn to the right sarie stared at him youre sure you know what youre doing so sure you cant imagine devotion made her acquiesce okay dad i dont want to get you more upset but i dont want to be irresponsible trust me didnt you tell me never to trust anyone who says that this is different why because im your father sarie had almost passed through the intersection and im your puzzled daughter i hope im not making a mistake trust you okay then dad hang on here we go she jerked the steering wheel toward the right davids skull came close to exploding and drove down the lane that would take them to the ramp where david had parked early in the afternoon now the family had three cars at the hospital davids porsche donnas voyager and saries fiesta the gangs all here david thought bleakly dad that neurologist is going to be pissed at me but im going to love you more thats a wonderful tradeoff dont you think and believe me no matter if you think im going crazy just keep trusting me ive never been more sure of anything i know im right david staggered from the fiesta sarie holding him up as he wavered from the parking ramp strangers frowned at them but what are we doing sarie asked where are we going tell me explain i cant you wouldnt believe me its too complicated but maybe forty years from now well talk about it forty years from now youre scaring me dad with a lot of help from youor god or i dont know what david thoughtwere going to save matt sarie frowned again david went through the entrance he always used again he went down the corridor that early this afternoon had seemed so familiar and yet so distant in time with sarie holding his arm he did his best to keep from wavering to keep from attracting attention they reached the large mirrored room that contained the chairs and the grand piano sarie guided him toward elevator e no david recalled the terrible pressure hed felt descending the elevator toward the emergency ward i cant take elevators anymore we have to use the stairs sarie opened a door beside the elevator davids footsteps echoed as he staggered into a stairwell he peered up toward seemingly neverending stairs that made him think of a mountain keep holding my arm maybe just maybe ill manage this he gripped the railing they started up at each landing david wanted to sit and rest but breathless he fought harder upward dad youll make yourself sicker i dont matter youre not making sense keep holding me the higher david climbed the weaker his legs felt he had a sudden recollection of his nightmare about his death forty years from now and a thought hed had of life being like a steep flight of stairs that got harder and harder to climb as he got older that memory from his nightmare made him stop in distress everything hed done since waking on his kitchen floor had been motivated by his frantic conviction that the nightmare was more than just a fainting spell the scenes from his nightmare depicting how his life would be for the next forty years had been so vivid so real that hed believed in them but now he realized that in none of those nightmarish memories had he suffered a panic attack the day before matt contracted septic shock in none of those memories had he been rushed to the emergency ward in none of them had he and sarie struggled up these stairs was his nightmare really only that just a nightmare the consequence of nothing more than a fainting spell were his premonitions about matthew only the consequence of a vivid dream and too much tension for too damned long what is it dad you stopped whats wrong do you need to sit down i just thought of something maybe the neurologist was right maybe i should go home maybe im being hysterical fireflies power chords wavering on the stairwell he seemed to float above his deathbed and drift through a brilliant doorway no its too real with tingling certainty he understood now why the panic attack and the emergency ward hadnt been in his nightmarish memory why he couldnt recall sarie helping him stagger up these stairs because theyd never happened forty years from now how could he remember what had never occurred what he did remember was that after he regained consciousness on the kitchen floor hed been so shaky so disoriented hed been forced to stay in bed till tomorrow afternoon and when hed finally felt steady enough to return to the hospital matthew had contracted septic shock that day in bed was what had happened in his memory not any of the events of this afternoon and this evening but now the neurologist wanted david to spend the next two days away from matt no ive been given a second chance an alternative to the past somehow for god knows what reason ive been allowed the chance to come back and change the past the more he thought about it the more irrational the notion became and yet hed never felt saner in his life faith he had to believe because if he did go home and spend the next two days in bed if matthew did die from septic shock in that case david would certainly go insane dad are you sure youre okay sarie looked pale youre shaking i just needed to rest for a second come on weve got a job to do david struggled higher they reached the third level sarie started to guide him upward toward the fourth no david said were here open this door but the bone marrow wards on the seventh floor were not going to the bone marrow ward then where are we going theres only one place i remember going to on the third floor the pediatrics ward where matthew had received his conventional and then investigational chemotherapy where david had mistakenly gone instead of to the bone marrow ward at the start of the afternoon the blond nurse was still on duty evidently working a double shift youre back again she looked surprised has something happened have you got good news about matt doctor david gave a name the physician theyd first met when matt was diagnosed is he on the ward the effort to ask the question increased his dizziness i know he makes his rounds this time of the evening is hedavids heart raced the start of another panic attackis he here the nurse frowned at sarie supporting her father he was im not sure if he went home please david breathed find out sit down over here the nurse said no im not sure id have the strength to stand again just find him get him david leaned against a wall the nurse left quickly dad you ought to be at home matts all that matters we have to save him but hes not in any danger danger you dont have the faintest notion its a second chance we can yes the physician david had been hoping to find was suddenly before him what do you mean mr morrell save matt second chance thank god youre still here one of my patients had a complication otherwise id have been home for dinner now whats wrong youre out of breath three questions the physician looked tired but because hed diagnosed matthew and seen him more than any other doctor he had a special interest indeed a special relationship with matthew this physician more than any other david had encountered had sacrificed his medical objectivity had allowed his compassion to surface and to threaten his peace of mind three questions the physician leaned next to david against the wall okay why not suppose you knew that matt tomorrow afternoon at fourthirtysix what are you saying how can you be so specific let me finish suppose you knew that precisely at that time matt would contract septic shock thats the first question i hate to hear the next one and the septic shock would be caused by streptococcus mitis and staphylococcus epidermidis where did you learn those terms the physician studied davids anxious gaze and sighed okay strep in his body and staph on his skin normal bacteria we always have in and on our bodies and our bodies normally keep them in check except matts got a zero whiteblood count so he cant combat them youve asked your second question whats the third how would you stop the septic shock from happening the physician stared at david youre serious do i look like im kidding the obvious answer is antibiotics then do it go upstairs and give matt antibiotics this is all hypothetical please even if it wasnt hypothetical the bone marrow ward isnt my department i dont have authority there then go up and ask someone who does have the authority to do it you really are serious david trembled have you got some reason to be worried has matt got a fever not the last time i heard the pressure behind davids ears increased but he will have at three oclock tomorrow afternoon and theyll give him antibiotics then but it wont be soon enough ninety minutes later hell go into shock the physician pushed himself from the wall i dont understand why youre so sure hell go into shock the way you look this entire conversation im quite concerned about you sarie couldnt stop herself dad tell him you just got out of the emergency ward what my dad had a panic attack hes supposed to go home stay in bed take valium and sarie keep out of this is your daughter telling the truth david nodded then go home and do what youve been told im begging you to humor me why cant matt have the antibiotics now because we dont give antibiotics unless a patient has symptoms at the very least a fever but suppose you knew matt would get a fever and after he got the antibiotics they wouldnt have time to work before the shock set in and killed him we dont know anything of the sort youre upsetthats obvious so im trying to set your mind at ease but whats wrong with giving the antibiotics ahead of time just in case whats wrong with that the physician asked an edge of impatience in his voice because antibiotics are toxic to the body and could make your son sicker than he already is thats one and two if antibiotics are given before an infection starts the bacteria get used to them so if an infection does start the antibiotics are less effective now please mr morrell its late ive tried to be cooperative but ive been here since six oclock this morning my sons going to die why wont anybody listen to me the nurses in the ward stared in davids direction sarie looked distraught the physician cleared his throat his tone became more authoritative at the same time it was strained with a greater effort toward tolerance for what this is worth if it helps any ive been monitoring your sons progress in the bone marrow ward everythings proceeding on schedule and if an infection does develop the antibiotics have already been ordered from the hospitals pharmacy theyre in his room ready to be administered of course we can never be sure what infection might develop but the types of broadspectrum antibiotics theyve got ready for matt are especially effective against strep and staph in that respect at least youve got nothing to worry about david struggled to keep from sinking breathing deeply between bursts of words he forced himself to say unless the strep and staph have already started multiplying and by the time his fever starts his infection will already be out of control he straightened trying to prove he was functional ignoring the pounding in his chest if matthew did die from septic shock by hindsight would you think the only way to prevent his death would have been to give the antibiotics ahead of timebefore his fever started its all hypothetical but what i just described to you giving the antibiotics ahead of time thats the only other way he could have been saved could have we cant predict the future we deal with facts david had learned what he wanted my daughters right i ought to be at home to take my pills and go to bed sarie relaxed i apologize for getting upset david said suddenly anxious to leave no need what pills were prescribed the physician asked valium in a few days youll feel better more at ease i certainly hope so in fact im convinced of it come on dad sarie tugged his arm i confess i feel worn out david said well after six months of what your son and you and your family have been through of course you feel worn out the physician said but matthew more than all of us come on sarie i guess ive been a pain in the ass its just that i feel so helpless cancers a roller coaster the doctor said up and down then up and down exhausting nervewracking at the moment your sons doing fine now its your job to take care of yourself i intend to thanks again david wavered escorted by sarie wait a minute the doctor said im finished for the evening ill walk down to the parking ramp with you no david thought dont come down with us if you do ill have to he glanced at the blurred hands of his watch almost pm time he wasmatt wasrunning out of time in the parking ramp the doctor walked with sarie and david toward the fiesta the doctor waited till they got inside before he moved toward his own car almost as if hed been making sure that david would indeed go home david glanced back toward the hospital no i have to get up to the bone marrow ward as sarie drove from the ramp he felt trapped but he knew hed never be able to convince her to stop and let him out of the car the sun was setting shadows thickened sarie parked in the gravel driveway of davids house she helped him inside took him upstairs made him lie in bed then brought him a glass of water and one of the valium david put the pill in his mouth and raised the glass of water to his lips i feel a little hungry david said what would you like sarie responded eagerly maybe a sandwich tuna fine sarie hurried toward the kitchen david ate the sandwich drank a glass of milk and went to sleep or pretended to because hed never swallowed the pill instead hed tucked it along a cheek and when sarie went to the kitchen hed removed the pill and hidden it he lay in the murky bedroom kept his eyes closed when sarie came in to check on him and struggled to control the swirling in his mind cant go to sleep mustnt let myself dont dare to he heard dim voices indistinct music the television set downstairs he glanced at the glowing numbers of the digital clock on the bedroom bureau tenfiftyfive sarie get tired go to bed waiting was agony groggy he felt himself drifting hovering no he concentrated on matthew on his sons scarred shrinking body on the septic shock that would start at fourthirtysix tomorrow afternoon at midnight he said a prayer of relief hearing sarie turn off the television she came upstairs tiptoed into his bedroom to check on him again then went to her own room he heard her door snick shut at am he took his chance offbalance he staggered from bed managed to dress and peered from his room down the hallway toward saries door no light gleamed beneath it he crept in the opposite direction down the shadowy hallway carpeted stairs muffled his footsteps he slowly unbolted the front door inched it open stepped into the dark and eased the door shut the night was unusually warm for june heavy with humidity streetlights glistened off dew in the grass except for a distant car the only sound david heard was the screech of crickets saries fiesta was parked beneath her window in the driveway he couldnt risk using his spare key to start it for fear of waking her he had no choice he had to walk under normal circumstances the ten blocks to the hospital would have been effortless an easy jog for a man with a twentyyear habit of running four miles each day but at the moment those ten blocks might as well have been ten miles through kneedeep snow nonetheless he had to do it get started he told himself you lazy bastard he stumbled across the lawn across the street and past the grade school his son had attended despite the swirling in his brain his thoughts were lucid at least he hoped so staggering the way i am a police car might stop me he thought i look like im drunk or on drugs i have to use sidestreets the darker the better so what should have been ten blocks turned out to be farther as he took a zigzag route from one murky street to the next he felt lonely helpless and desperate but terribly determined his chest heaved from the pounding of his heart at last he saw a glow in the sky not the morning sun even with his plodding gait it was far too early for sunrise no what he saw was the gleam reflected off clouds of the sprawling complex of the hospital here streetlights were unavoidable he paused beneath a lamppost to study the blur of his watch twenty minutes to three normally he could run a mile in nine minutes and now it had taken him an hour and forty minutes just to walk it on the verge of collapse he leaned against the chainlink fence of a university tennis court and studied the hospital narrowing his vision toward the seventh floor of a brightly lit section to his right the bone marrow ward matthew and if his nightmare was correct a second chance for salvation to reverse the greatest loss of his life suddenly bolstered he released his grip on the fence and walked stolidly forward matthew fireflies power chords he marched to their rhythm he studied the parking ramp few cars insects swarmed around arc lights surrounding the hospital no one was in the area davids six months of coming and going here had taught him how deserted the hospital could be at night with the patients asleep their visitors gone home and the staff reduced it was possible to walk down corridor after corridor and never see anyone that happened now inside the complex the grandpiano room was deserted smothered by silence david considered taking elevator e but the pressure behind his eyes warned him not to he opened the stairwell door beside the elevator continuing to respond to the rhythm of the power chords he proceeded step after relentless step up the stairwell no longer needing his daughters support driven by his nightmare he climbed higher third floor fourth floor the numbers were fuzzy but he kept climbing sixth floor seventh floor at last he stopped and took a deep breath had to from exhaustion he wanted to slump on the stairs and sleep how much he wanted to sleep not yet time enough for sleep when his duty had been completed forty years from now tonight he opened the stairwell door and entered a corridor ten paces farther turning right he proceeded toward the bone marrow ward passing through one door then along a corridor and through a second door he entered it softly silently seeing no one in most wards a nurses station would have been the first thing a visitor saw but in the bone marrow ward the nurses station was out of view around the corner to the left that corner was ten feet farther ahead than the corner to the right and matthews room was just around the nearer right corner that made it possible david had calculated had depended on this made it possible if a nurse didnt happen to prowl for him to shift unseen around that right corner and ease into matthews room it was after am often at this hour matthew woke from nightmares and needed to talk to whichever parent was sleeping in the room with him to express his fears and ease his apprehensions some of davids most intimate and heartbreaking conversations with matt had occurred at this time of night but this afternoon when david had last seen his son matt had been so weak it was doubtful hed waken from his stupor tonight david had depended on that as well so much depended on faith the room was dark matt lay motionless in bed donna slept on a cot in the corner breathing restlessly enduring her own nightmares david shut the door till only a crack allowed light to enter from the outside corridor responding to habit he almost went to the sink to wash his hands but he froze realizing he couldnt make a sound when his eyes adjusted to the dark he stepped toward matthews bed two iv stands supported bottles from which a dark liquid probably platelet concentrate to give matts impaired blood the ability to clot and a clear colorless liquid probably saline solution to keep him from dehydrating were pumped through tubes into iv connections implanted in his chest beside the bed was a cart upon which full syringes lay in a row medications that matt would need in case of an emergency david took the syringes one by one to the light that came through the crack in the door and studied their labels though he knew he shouldnt have been able to recognize their arcane names and understand the effect of each drug he could do so now and that made him more convinced that he was right that his nightmare was more than just a fainting spell the first syringe he examined was labeled carbenecillin the term so close to penicillin obviously named an antibiotic but intuition controlled him for somehow he knew it wasnt the particular antibiotic that matthew needed he examined another syringe gentamicin that too was an antibiotic he realized but again he had the certain knowledge that it wouldnt be effective against strep and staph vancomycin hed found it though why he was sure he didnt know except for the memory of his nightmare instead of a needle the syringe had a blunt point capped with a rubber stopper he removed the stopper held the syringe upright and squeezed its plunger until liquid trickled out guarding against an air bubble entering matthews system he stepped toward matthew and stiffened heart pounding as a shadow blocked the crack of light at the door a nurse it must have been time for her to make rounds to check on the patients assigned to her to administer whatever medications were scheduled donna sighed as if waking up davids chest heaved panic swelling hide ive got to the nurse spoke softly to someone else in the corridor the shadow moved from the crack in the doorway david hurried despite the absence of a needle on the syringe he knew hed have no problem injecting the antibiotic too often hed watched the nurses add medications to his sons ivs the tubes leading into matthews chest had access vents all david had to do was unplug a vent insert the blunt end of the syringe into the port and squeeze the syringes plungerslowly struggling to control his shaking handsuntil all the liquid had entered the tube and drained toward matthews chest twenty seconds later his task was accomplished for better or for worse hed done what he believed in his soul was the reason he was here after forty years his thought was irrational he admitted but so was faith his lingering doubt no longer mattered hed done everything in his power to save his son he shoved the empty syringe into his pocket peered down at matthew wanted to kiss his forehead but stopped the impulse for fear of waking him the resultant conversation would wake up donna and the further conversation would surely attract the nurse whose shadow again blocked the crack of light at the doorway david leaned against the sink his heartbeat thunderous better to confront than be confronted he thought he opened the door held his breath to control his hyperventilation and stepped from the room the nurse was surprised before she could speak david closed the door behind him mr morrell she whispered i didnt know you were up here david took several steps along the corridor gesturing for her to follow guiding her away from the door she hadnt been on duty when hed collapsed this afternoon he hoped she hadnt been told i couldnt sleep he said so i figured id come over to the hospital and look in on matt hes resting comfortably i noticed when i saw him this afternoon he said he felt sick and weak i was worried he still feels sick the nurse seemed puzzled but the thing is he doesnt have a fever he will have david thought tomorrow at pm weve been giving him maalox to help settle his stomach good but maalox wont stop him from getting septic shock david thought i pray to god the vancomycin will i heard you werent feeling so well yourself when you came to see him this afternoon the nurse said david shrugged an embarrassed grin i got a little wobbly too much strain i guess its understandable this has been a long ordeal but as soon as matts blood counts start to rise itll all be over it might be over sooner than you expect david thought if the vancomycin doesnt work i guess id better get going ill see you tomorrow he said the corridor seemed to tilt he needed all his strength to stay upright try to rest she said believe me now i will because theres nothing more i can do he thought and somehow he walked steadily along the corridor passing through a door a minute later he reached the stairwell beside the elevator only to realize he didnt have the strength to descend the stairs and walk back home he staggered along a deserted corridor found a plasticcovered sofa and slumped on it even with his eyes closed he saw wavering lights he clutched his stomach hoping he wouldnt vomit the sofa spun at once the wavering lights exploded into a million gleaming specks he hovered in a radiant doorway seeing fireflies and sank you son of a bitch hands shook him you meddling david was pushed and shoved awake youve been up here so long you think youve got a doctors degree a license to practice medicine david squinted toward sunlight glaring through a corridor window what maybe youll try surgery next david rubbed his beard stubble and managed to focus on the physician hed spoken to last night on the pediatrics ward the physician was livid i tried to humor you i did my best to treat your hysteria with respect and what do you do how do you repay my patience you come up here in the middle of the night and decide youre a candidate for the nobel prize in medicine look at this david saw the blur of an empty syringe i found this in your pocket when the nurse on duty realized the vancomycin was gone she phoned her supervisor the staff looked everywhere then your daughter woke up and discovered you werent at home she phoned your sons room your wifes so upset she might have a panic attack of her own and here i find you sleeping with the damned empty syringe in your pocket what else could i do i had to save him save him you might have killed him i told you antibiotics are toxic if they dont have an infection to fight david jerked upright matts worse no no thanks to you but doctor morrell since thats who you seem to think you are now that youve given him the vancomycin youve forced us to keep giving it at regular intervals otherwise an infection might not respond if we wait till matt possibly does get a fever and then start giving the antibiotic youve forced us into a preventive procedure we hadnt planned to try david sank back onto the couch and exhaled wearily i didnt have a choice you had a choice to let us do our job practicing medicine without a license do you know how serious that is do you have any idea how much trouble youre in you might end up in jail do you think i care if what i did saves my son do you think i care if i do time thats what im trying to buy for matt time well buddy if he dies because of what you did david surged to his feet if he dies how much worse can i be punished startled the doctor stepped back how late is it david asked almost noon give me till three oclock no make it later till fourthirtysix what difference does if matt doesnt have a fever by three and septic shock by fourthirtysix how can you be so specific then call the police press charges and put me away never mind three oclock im about to pick up the phone right now but if im right if the fever hits at three and matts blood pressure drops at fourthirtysix how can you be so specific then forget the police and hope i saved matts life ill ask you one more time how can i be so specific because ive suffered through it before i know whats going to happen and if it doesnt thank god im wrong but im not wrong and everything i described is going to happen matt died once i wont let it happen again my god youre crazy david wavered just give me till fourthirtysix after that do anything you want against me but dont you see the flaw in your logic if matt was about to develop an infection since you gave him the vancomycin the infection wont occur he wont have a fever he wont go into shock david shook his head without the antibiotic the infection would have hit him like a fire storm but believe me dont ask how i know this call it a nightmare the infection will still be strong im praying the drug i gave him will keep the bacteria from raging out of control ive never heard anything like this ive never experienced anything like this you think i didnt realize i could go to jail if i gave him the vancomycin youre that sure of what you did i could have given him the gentamicin and carbenicillin too but i knew they wouldnt work on the staph and strep thatll cause matts infection how in gods name did you know they wouldnt work against staph and strep youve been spending all your time reading medical texts no i cant explain it i just knew theres one way to prove it isnt there wait till three oclockwhen matts fevers going to start the doctor looked startled by davids certainty im appalled by the risk you took disgusted by your irresponsibility he shook his head why on earth am i starting to dont test my patience anymore get lost i dont want to see you till three oclock but listen carefully if what youre so sure about doesnt happen itll be my pleasure to testify against you fair enough more than fair if i didnt like matt so much thats the point though isnt it matt he has to be saved and you dont think weve been trying you and everyone else youve acted perfectly what you dont understand is something you never expected is about to happen what you dont understand is till three oclock i want you out of my sight so i can pretend i didnt find this syringe you dont know how much i thank you thanks what you need now are prayers im praying too believe me david staggered toward an exit davids impulse was to rest in the rear of donnas minivan in the parking ramp but he feared hed fall asleep and fail to wake up before three he also worried that if the authorities started searching for him a logical place to look would be his wifes car so he spent the interval pacing through the parking lot at the universitys football stadium two blocks away pausing often to lean against cars and bolster his strength hed expected the hours to drag but they passed with astonishing speed he returned to the bone marrow ward five minutes before three a crowd had gatheredthe physician in charge of the ward several associates and nurses the doctor hed argued with at noon and sarie and donna the medical personnel frowned as he approached david held his head up the physician in charge of the ward stepped forward he kept his voice low to avoid disturbing the parents of the other patients but his whisper might as well have been a shout what id like to do to you you dont want to hear in your place id feel the same please youve got to trust me got to the only thing ive got to dothe doctor glared at his watchis phone the hospital attorney in a couple of minutes we checked your sons temperature just before you arrived its perfectly normal its not three oclock yet one minute to the doctor said then i guess its almost time you checked his temperature again my pleasure so i can pick up that phone the physician spun and entered matthews room david took two more steps stopped before sarie and hugged her im sorry i tricked you dad i tears trickled down her cheeks why did the simplest reason i can give is i had to he turned to donna sweetheart i know you must think im donna touched his arm david felt as if a spark leaped through him her eyes had a depth that hed never seen in them except yesterday afternoon when hed hugged her after what felt like years instead of hours again he had the dismaying sense that she truly understood but how was that possible if shed come back why hadnt she given matt the antibiotic doubt surged through him okay its three oclock the physician from the pediatrics ward said its time to prove i wasnt a fool to listen to you lets go they entered matts room matts flaccid pallid face was appalling it took enormous effort for him to whisper dad whats going on dont be afraid but they say you gave me all you have to know is i love you the nurse slipped a plastic sleeve onto a metal tube the tube was attached to a box that showed digital temperature readings she slipped the sleeved tube into matthews mouth david sensed the anger and skepticism around him the box was timed to beep in three minutes the silence lengthened the red numbers on the box kept changing starting at zero and climbing toward the timer beeped absolutely normal a physician said his tone a mixture of relief and indignation normal david thought matt should have started a temperature the doctor in charge of the ward braced his shoulders ive got a phone call to make the physician from the pediatrics ward shook his head at david looks like youre not the medical expert you thought you were he didnt add what david guessed he was thinkingand i was foolish to think you might impossibly be right for what its worth david said you cant know how glad i am to be wrong dad wrong about what my imagination got the better of me dont worry at least no harm was done youre safe no harm the doctor in charge of the ward said your imagination might have jeopardized his treatment your amateur medical practice is about to put you in just wait a few more minutes davids momentary doubt was suddenly replaced by a certainty that made him quiver wait for what youve had all the time you deserve i just thought of something if the antibiotics i gave him started to work if they started to subdue the staph and strep which we have absolutely no reason to assume will matts temperature wouldnt start to rise when i expected it wont rise at all you dont understand how strong the infection was was you mean how strong you think the infection might be will be the schedules been delayed david said give me fifteen minutes more just to put me at ease before youve had all the leeway youll get i just took his temperature again a nurse said the doctor stared toward the numbers on the box his temperatures up the ensuing events were so rapid the doctor didnt have time to call the authorities he and his staff were too busy working my stomach matt said it feels worse im going to matt vomited not just vomited spewed the contents of his stomach shot to the end of the bed my god sarie said a nurse scrambled for a plastic basin another nurse grabbed for towels to clean away the vomit donna rushed to help her a doctor lunged for the cart beside the bed grabbing the syringes marked gentamicin and carbenicillin he injected them through matts iv line hes already getting the vancomycin the doctor in charge of the ward said with these others we ought to be able to attack whatever infection hes got he frowned toward david how the hell you knew this would happen the vancomycins the important one keep giving it to him we have been you forced us to inject it on a regular schedule since you gave it to him last night how did you know matthew vomited again explosively a white fluid streaked with red the nurse holding the plastic basin didnt catch all of it donna and the other nurse kept wiping the vomit from matthews sheets sarie rushed to help blood cultures the doctor in charge of the ward said the lab find out what kind of infection hes got an assistant was already in motion inserting an iv needle into matthews left arm he filled several vials with blood staph and strep david said thats what the labll tell you the doctor frowned again toward david not likely since hes already covered for that it could be any number of other bacteria we dont know what the labll tell us this is all a coincidence the fever just happened to start when you said it would believe what you want just save my son matt vomited again another basin get another basin a nurse yelled david grabbed for one off a shelf the color of matthews skin was alarming no longer pale but red speckled with crimson spots tiny hemorrhages beneath his skin with dull swollen eyes matt squinted toward the contents of the basin the nurse held white he groaned why am i vomiting white thats the medication weve been giving you to coat your stomach a doctor tried to sound reassuring but wasnt successful to help prevent ulcers from the chemotherapy but its streaked with red matt gasped am i throwing up blood no one dared to answer david handed the nurse the empty basin hurrying to remove the one matt had filled the exchange occurred just in time matt vomited again a doctor pivoted toward one of matthews iv stands pressing buttons on a pump increasing the flow of saline solution into matts body hes losing too much fluid weve got to keep him hydrated urgent voices overlapped blood pressure check it again whats his temp now the nurse who was helping donna and sarie clean the vomit from the sheets quickly reached for the computerized thermometer at once she realized she couldnt put anything into matthews mouth she groped into a pocket of her uniform pulled out a standard thermometer shook it and wedged it under matthews right armpit just then the smell and sound unmistakable matthews bowels let go davids arms and legs rippled with hot and cold rushes his lungs heaved making his mind spin no please not now i cant have another attack matt needs me added to his symptoms was a dizzying sense of déjà vu in theory he was witnessing these terrifying events for the first time and yet he saw the chaos around him in double focus as if this was the second time hed been here each horror was occurring after he sensed it would hed seen it all before endured it all before from an impossible perspective forty years from now on his deathbed he relived hell even before matthews bowels lost control david reacted as if they already had he grabbed towels off a shelf and raised matthews sheets when what he expected to happen did happen he experienced another eerie shift in time not from the future into the present but from the present into the past for while he used a towel to wipe the excrement from matthew he couldnt ignore that what he did now for his fifteenyearold son was exactly what hed been accustomed to doing when his son was newly born davids soul almost burst with love as he performed without disgust this most intimate of acts im sorry dad you dont need to apologize youve no idea how glad i am to help you ill do anything to get you through this to make you feel better in fact if theres a god i started to do that to help you last night matts red face dotted with crimson formed a weak smile almost the boyish grin david had seen on matt in better times i love you son davids throat ached so much it strangled him he threw a soiled towel into a trash container and used another to continue wiping excrement from matthews hips his temperatures up again the nurse read a celsius number which david knew from experience was the fahrenheit equivalent of a hundred and five more overlapping voices get that temp down ice wet towels compazine settle his nausea increase his saline iv more fluid blood pressure a hundred and thirty over ninety a little high but not alarming easily explained yes the trauma of his vomiting david threw a second soiled towel into a waste container youre right he told the doctors a hundred and thirty over ninety isnt a problem his blood pressure wont go any higher but itll go lower what david glanced toward a swirling clock on the wall somehow more than an hour had passed it was now itll go lower david said i predicted the septic shock would hit at fourthirtysix but the vancomycin i gave him changed the schedule his temperature rose five minutes later than i expected so the shock will hit five minutes later the doctor david had argued with at noon asked god help me i almost believe you fourfortyone less than a half an hour from now is that what youre saying the doctor in charge of the ward stepped close for the record i want to hear this how low will his blood pressure drop forty over twenty down from a hundred and thirty over ninety in less than thirty minutes improbable how i pray youre right the doctor studied matthew his vomitings under control his bowels have stopped voiding i think weve checked whatevers wrong with him david leaned against the wall with due respect youre mistaken but just in case will you phone intensive care tell them you might have to send down no why not theyd want a reason and i cant give them one they dont just jump into action because an anxious father has hunches then ill phone them myself you dont have authority but what if im right intensive care is always ready david stroked matthews feverish forehead so with no other options i guess we have to wait son i know this is all confusing trust me you dad matt grinned sickly when didnt i trust you when i told you not to ride your skateboard down a hill toward traffic matthew breathed i could stop that skateboard on a dime you listened though we never had to find out so listen again if something bad happens to you in the next half hour dont be afraid i wont need to youll want to but ill be here to hold your hand depend on it ill do everything i can to help of course youre my dad just dont be afraid thats your job the most important way you can help hang tough right yeah hang tough david turned so matthew wouldnt see him crying its fourthirtysix a doctor turned toward david temp another doctor asked slightly down a point above normal a nurse said blood pressure down a hundred and twenty over eighty perfect not for him he tends to run a little lower the nurse said the difference is too slight to be bothered about oh therell be a difference david said but your deadlines come and gone another doctor said i told you the first time was just a coincidence he just happened to spike a fever when you said he would and i told you the vancomycin i gave him delayed the schedule ive had enough of this we controlled his infection no everythings back to normal the doctor said now ive got rounds to make well maybe we ought to the doctor from the pediatrics ward cleared his throat it wouldnt hurt just wait a few more minutes and reinforce this mans delusion hes been right so far coincidence just in case though somethings happening a nurse said what his pressures down to a hundred now will you believe me david asked check it again a doctor said down to ninety no i told you david said eighty matt vomited again no dont wait david said give him the dopamine dopamine how did you know thats the drug wed use to raise his pressure you wouldnt believe me give him the seventy do it david yelled cant you see we already are matts body shuddered convulsing sixty an intern injected the contents of a syringe into one of matts iv lines david exhaled panicked he slumped against a wall and now we wait he said and pray in davids nightmare matthews plummeting blood pressure had not responded to the dopamine the pressure had bottomed at forty over twenty almost as low as it can get and still allow the body to maintain vital functions repeated injections of dopamine hadnt raised the pressure david had watched a frantic nurse crank up the end of matthews bed raising his feet helping his blood to circulate trying to compensate for the devastating decrease in arterial pressure david had watched the doctor in charge of the ward phone intensive care david donna sarie a nurse and a doctor had rushed matthews bed down hallways into an elevator two floors below theyd scurried with the bed down other hallways into the ward that made the emergency ward seem primitive as the document david had signed when matt went into the bone marrow ward so vividly put it you have a lifethreatening disease within a year you will surely die unless you receive exceptional treatment a bone marrow transplant has serious risks including infection and david mentally added they dont rush you down to intensive care just to try out the machines in davids nightmare higher doses of dopamine finally raised matthews blood pressure to a barely acceptable level of eighty over sixty a team of trauma specialists waited in intensive care and as soon as he arrived the team snapped instantly into motion david recalled no fewer than eight iv stands with two pumps on each injecting fluids and medications into his son but dopamine has plus and minus effects it raises critically low blood pressure however to do so it must stem the flow of blood to such crucial organs as the kidneys matthews kidneys shut down stopped filtering poisons into the bladder he needed a hole cut into his abdomen a tube was inserted through which fluid was poured in and an hour later drained outto vent the poisons but now he was also on oxygen if given long enough oxygen poisons the lungs fluid accumulates that fluid puts pressure on the heart three organs in trouble and thats not counting the remnant of the tumor in his chest four missing ribs and in davids nightmare matthew struggled against an oxygen tube crammed down his throat finally morphine had to be given to put him to sleep so he wouldnt yank the tube from his mouth just before the tube was inserted and the morphine injected the director of intensive care told david donna and sarie if you need to tell him something nows the time he might not come off the respirator next to david sarie paled what does he mean matt might not come off the respirator it meansdavid couldnt believe he was saying thismatt might die jesus what do you say to your son when the ultimate reality kicks him and you in the teeth youve got five minutes to tell him the last words he might ever hear then whether you said the right thing or not you dont get another chance your character your upbringing your self take charge sarie chose to say i love you matt david chose to be practical dont get panicked fear will increase your shock trust the system ill push these doctors to their limit i promise theyll do everything they possibly can donna said wise donna matt youre a perfect boy a priest in the background said no a perfect man donna kissed her son the tube was inserted the morphine given and that was the final communication except before drifting into a morphine stupor matt unable to speak because of the oxygen tube crammed down his throat pointed with determination toward letters on an alphabet board his trembling finger wavered spelling the gist was clear take this tube out need a root beer and then die he spelled were doing our best a doctor said matt nodded his eyelids fluttered he slept the final communication five days later his injured lung collapsed but it reinflated giving cause for hope three days later his heart became infected his blood pressure plummeted and this time nothing on earth or in heaven no medicine no prayers would help in davids nightmare but now heartbroken desperate for a second chance david stared at the nurse taking matthews temperature its back to normal blood pressure a doctor asked up ninety over sixtyfive hes coming around another doctor said there the doctor in charge of the ward turned to david a false alarm pressurea hundred over seventy i repeat the doctor said a false alarm i watched you david said you were afraid but believe me you couldnt have been as terrified as i was what i did last night when i gave him the vancomycin was irresponsible i saved my sons life in davids nightmare one of the bitterest ironies had been that as matthew had worsened in intensive care his recently transplanted bone marrow had started to multiply producing healthy blood four days after the onset of his septic shock matts whiteblood count rose from zero to eight hundred not strong enough to fight infection but under other circumstances encouraging as a rule a white count of one thousand is considered the minimum safety level the next time matts white count was tested it had risen to sixteen hundred and the next time thirtytwo hundred when he died from heart arrest his white count was over six thousand if he hadnt contracted septic shock his healthy blood would have permitted him to be released from the hospital the day of his death to be sure there would still have been dangers the devastating chemotherapy had temporarily destroyed his immune system for several months hed have been susceptible to such normally nonlethal diseases as chicken pox which hed already had and acquired an immunity to but which in his present weakened nonimmune condition could have killed him to guard against that danger hed have been forced to stay at home his visitors restricted to those who had no illness and hadnt been exposed to any illness even then his visitors would have been required to put on hospital face masks just in case when school started in the fall matt couldnt have attended but instead would have studied through correspondence courses but eventually by christmas say his immune system would have reestablished itself and he could have gone out in public resuming a normal life in time a brace would have been implanted in his chest to compensate for his missing ribs because hed lost a third of his right lung hed have been short of breath on occasion but not enough to incapacitate him a small price to pay for having survived of course hed always have suffered the fear that his cancer had not been cured that one day the tumor and its excruciating pain would return but as the autopsy of davids nightmare indicated no trace of malignancy was discovered the devastating chemotherapypossible only because of the bone marrow transplanthad been effective the alien that matt so loathed and wanted killed had been defeated now because matts septic shock had been averted davids eerie déjà vu was restricted only to the no longer ironic increase of matts white blood count matts vital signs remained at a normal level his appetite increased his only complaint was that he couldnt wait to go home wed like that too a doctor said but after what happened on friday we want to be cautious its been a week now matt youre doing fine i think by sunday if you can be patient two more days youll be on your way matthew raised his thumb in a victory signal david felt so elated he didnt care about the indignant looks a few doctors still directed toward him and the legal problems hed be facing for having interfered with medical procedure yes the hospital attorney had been called but david didnt object after all parents cant be allowed to behave as if theyre licensed to practice medicine under normal circumstances anyhow but since his nightmare since david had awakened on his kitchen floor nothing in his experience had been normal his dizziness remained though his heartbeat and breath rate were under control his dizziness was more like floating and periodically when he closed his eyes he still saw fireflies at unusual moments hed turn toward matthews radio to reduce its volume only to realize the switch was off and yet he heard power chords he and donna continued to exchange what he felt were uncanny knowing glances as if she understood the miracle that had happened and didnt dare break a spell by referring to it a spell precisely david felt he was under a spell none of what had happenedhis panic attack his struggle to convince the doctors his am injection of vancomycin matthews recoverynone of it seemed real he couldnt believe his luck but he kept seeing fireflies he kept hearing power chords the need to stay close to matthew became an obsession your sons doing fine a doctor said go home for a couple of hours get some rest ill go home when my son does the doctor frowned at davids haggard features hey im okay david said im just so glad hes alive i want to be near him to its hard to explain enjoy him you explained it perfectly once hes home ill sleep for two days you deserve it so do my wife and daughter none of us could have survived this without each other all of us give you credit no matthew deserves the credit i dont know how he stayed so brave then saturday came saturday the day in davids nightmare when matthew died in intensive care davids dizziness made him feel that his feet floated off the floor the fireflies brightened the power chords intensified im losing my mind david thought that has to be it i cant imagine another explanation im cracking up from relief after six months of hell but if david was cracking up why despite his sense of floating did his thoughts seem so clear something was wrong from all appearances not with matthew but logically something was wrong okay lets assume i fainted from running when i shouldnt have when the temperature was too high david thought so i fell on the kitchen floor had a nightmare that matt would die and woke up with the certainty i could save him because i knew exactly when and what would kill him does that make sense do you believe in precognition ive never believed no put it another way ive never experienced it before a phone call you felt would come and then it did on occasion coincidence but you did save matthews life when the lab tests came back they said his infection was due to strep and staph and only vancomycinnot the other two antibiotics you could have givenwould have been effective against those bacteria coincidence you dont believe that no youre right i dont believe that i knew more than i could have then whats your explanation as davids sense of floating increased and the fireflies brightened and the power chords nearly deafened him he repeated im going crazy or yes or or i really am think it dying forty years from now and if i believe that i belong in the psychiatric ward but if you did come back i wont consider it but if theres a logical problem right yeah a massive logical problem i cant be in two places at the same time if somehow i came back to change the past then the future has to be changed as well and i cant be dying forty years from now then you either had a nightmare or im dying in the future you mean the present remembering the past wishing with all your heart you could change it but the past cant be changed and on schedule at pm on saturday june a chunk of debris from the dead staph and strep collected in matthews heart plugged a major artery and caused cardiac arrest it happened in an instant the monitors attached to matthew wailed sudden straight lines and zero readings and davids heart succumbed to its minor imperfection the electrical blockage that had never bothered him till now in the future which is to say the present how long is an instant in eternity could it last ten earthly days david whod been hovering in the brilliant doorway abruptly shot forward at last released finally at peace no longer tortured by the greatest grief of his life his wifes fatal stroke in late age he could understand though he missed her fiercely but his sons death at fifteen his dear unlucky wonderful son who embodied optimism who exuded good nature who believed in being useful and could have contributed so much to a troubled world that death david had never adjusted to until now after forty years at the instant of davids own death with a vague sense of his beloved daughter weeping over his corpse david rocketed through the radiant doorway it seemed hed been held in suspension not for a microsecond but for agonizing days until whatever held him back suddenly snapped and longaccumulating thrust him toward the mystery toward fireflies and power chords toward one of the fireflies rushing to greet him dad the word was soundless just as their loving embraceso long postponedwas bodiless but david had no doubt son i love you this was heaven epilogue the refrain of the ancient mariner since then at an uncertain hour that agony returns and till my ghastly tale is told this heart within me burns thus we end as we began with agony and compulsion but what exactly have we been through what did you just read as i said at the start this book is fact with a layer of fiction but how much of each youve got a right to know ninety percent of the events have been described as accurately as i can remember them but memory like reality or perhaps the two are the same can be illusory so to verify my recollections of the mostly factual events and conversations ive just described i asked several persons who were with me to read this manuscript and compare it to what they perceived to make suggestions for alterations where appropriate for accuracy those suggestions were followed as a further test for accuracy i referred to hospital records and a lengthy diary that my wife maintained throughout matts ordeal but what are the facts everything i described did happenexcept for the obvious im fortyfour years old thus at the age of eightyfour i didnt have a deathbed vision that took me back forty years to try to save my son i didnt anticipate the staph and strep that would give my son septic shock i didnt become an amateur doctor sneak into the hospital in the middle of the night and give my son vancomycin i didnt head off the infection that sent matt from the bone marrow ward to intensive care where after eight days of suffering he died from heart arrest everything that happens from the moment i wake up on my kitchen floor is invented but everything in my nightmare during the fainting spell all the specifics of the disaster im trying to avert god have mercy actually took place examples on thursday one day before matt contracted septic shock did i foolishly run when the temperaturehumidity index was one hundred and three and subsequently collapse on my kitchen floor yes but while in the book i forced myself to go to the hospital in response to a nightmare of precognition in reality i staggered to bed and had to stay there until the next day when i managed to get to the hospital two hours before matt went into shock the initial medical explanation for my fainting spell was dehydration and an imbalance in the electrolyte components of my blood ie loss of sodium and potassium but fluids sodium and potassium didnt make me feel strong again and didnt take away my dizziness in fact when matt was rushed to intensive care friday evening my disorientation worsened on saturday after his kidneys failed and a hole was cut into his abdomen a tube inserted fluid poured in and drained out to vent his poisons i had the unnerving sense that the floor was tilting the flashing red numbers on his monitors made my heart rush in rhythm with them when i leaned against a wall it felt wobbly as if id fall through it on sunday morning when matthews lungs began to accumulate fluid from too many hours on the respirator i finally collapsed the doctors fearing id suffered a heart attack rushed me to the emergency ward where a team of specialists couldnt find anything seriously wrong with me stress and exhaustion they diagnosed but i realize now because of subsequent medical treatment that what i endured was a panic attack in this book i moved the panic attack back from sunday to thursday and made it a part of my imagined eightyfouryearold dying vision the attack i assure you was real indeed several months before when matts chemotherapy kept producing no results my wife experienced a similar attack in her case vomiting was an extra symptom dizzy helpless with a terrifying headache rising blood pressure and heartbeat she had to be rushed from a supermarket to the emergency ward where her chronic hypertension made the doctors suspect she was having a stroke the results of tests made them reconsider their diagnosis and conclude that my wife had labyrinthitis an innerear infection that upsets balance produces nausea and makes a victim so disoriented he or she swears that death is moments away valium was prescribed for seven days my wife had to walk with a cane it is possible that my wifes labyrinthitis was a panic attack ill never know but i certainly had one and many others later did matthews surgeons interrupt his eighthour operation three hours into it to tell donna and me that his tumor might be inoperable that we had fifteen minutes to make a lifeanddeath decision whether to close him up right now allow him a relatively painless summer and wait for his death in the fall or whether to take out his ribs and however much of his lung then go for the trauma of a bone marrow transplant and hope he survived for a long productive life you bet that happened until that time it was the worst day of my life though there were many more horrible days to come did i see fireflies in the darkness of my bedroom the night after matthew died yes did i experience a sudden inexplicable sense of peace when i entered the church the night before matts funeral as if his spirit was telling me to grieve for myself but not for him because in the fireflys word matt was okay you bet but those twoi hesitate to call them mysticalsensations can be accounted for on a subjective level a skeptic would say that i saw what i wanted to see that i felt what i needed to feel i wouldnt argue till recently ive always referred to myself as an agnostic another word for hedging my bets for saying im not sure about such ultimate matters as an afterlife and god not sure but not unsure either straddling the fence lets wait and see god could exist maybe not the thing is though i did see the dove in the mausoleum reread my description of it in part one it did behave in one of the three ways i mentally predicted youll have to take my word for those predictions but the fact is in front of twelve witnesses the frantic dove suddenly settled to the floor as the priest completed the final rites over matthews ashes the dove did allow me to pick it up i did say and now ill set matthew free i did carry the dove outside the mausoleum and when i opened my hands the dove formerly panicked did refuse to fly away until i thought dear god i hope it isnt hurt and at that point a voice in my head said dad im all right and the dove flew away you can doubt that my subjective reactions were mystical experiences but what isnt open to doubt is that the dove was there and behaved as ive described a chain of coincidences perhaps but how many coincidences do there need to be until you finally grant that something extraordinary far beyond probability took place in my own case i know i reached that limit i started to slip off the fence i began to wonder if the fireflies in my bedroom and my sudden sense of peace in the church were as subjective as a skeptic would claim i took a step away from agnosticism toward well lets put it this way ive got this friend he and his wife after a yearlong lull in our relationship showed up at the hospital the day after matt contracted septic shock they needed just one look at donna sarie and me to realize how helpless we felt how much we required support in the worst of matts illness i used to be so preoccupied i couldnt remember the last time id eaten or slept and this was when i was having what i didnt know were panic attacks my friend and his wife would force donna sarie and me to eat food theyd brought to the hospital theyd compel us to take turns going back to their home to lie down and try to rest compassionate is too weak a word to describe their behavior i hasten to add that some socalled friends whod stayed in close contact in the year before matts illness fled from us as if we had the plague the moment they heard matt had dreaded word could the disease be contagious we dont want our children to get it dare we say it cancer anyhow these friends whom we hadnt seen in a while who suddenly showed up and exemplified the generosity of good samaritans were with my family my wifes sisters and my brotherinlaw when we left the funeral and went to the mausoleum to deposit matthews ashes they were present during the incident with the dove standing in the background staring i later learned in astonishment now understand my friend is not religious but this is what he later told me he turned to his wife and whispered can you believe this is actually happening look at that dove look at how it waits while david picks it up and look at how many people are seeing this thirteen people it cant be were all so many just imagining this did you catch the error ive mentioned several times that there were twelve of us in the mausoleum donna sarie myself two of donnas sisters my brotherinlaw the priest the cemeterys sexton and two representatives from the mortician plus my friend and his wife count them twelve but that day in the mausoleum my friend saw thirteen and to this day no matter how often i count the witnesses with him he still says he saw thirteen and his wife who counted with him that day in the mausoleum agreed with him thirteen a shadowy figure among the crowd but a figure who wasnt there who or what as my friends now say its getting harder to be an agnostic im not claiming we saw a column of flame and im not claiming my son was so special that if there is a god we received a sign but something holy and unusual happened in that mausoleum the priest who blessed matthews ashes had twenty years of experience in his vocation at our home at the gathering after the mausoleum this seasoned professional of the spirit couldnt stop telling the hundreds of mourners about the dove he based several sermons on it whenever i saw him afterward he kept talking about the dove the mortician in charge of matthews dispositionanother veteran not of the spirit but of the soulless fleshsaid in all her experience shed never seen anything like would never forget the dove make of the dove what you will but ive been through hell so now im willing to believe in the opposite willing i said but ive got a good reason to grant that possibility to be more specific ive got a reason to want to believe more about that later why did i write this book the truth is i didnt have a choice it would have been impossible for me not to write it ive never felt more compelled to put words onto paper i guess you could call this a form of selfpsychoanalysis something horrible happened to my son and by extension to my wife my daughter and me the worst thing the most dreadful thing im still trying to figure it out to come to terms with it to vent my emotions in the months ive been writing these pages i could barely see the keyboard because of the tears that blurred my eyes then why not quit why torture myself because even though its torture this book is also an act of love in my mind im still at the hospital holding matts hand stroking his forehead trying to assure him theres hope i cant give him up hes been dead for months and yet each day i study pictures of him how i wish wed taken more photographs i caress his slippers i strum his guitar but my mental images of him are becoming cruelly less vivid one day theyll be a blur like my keyboard so while hes still fresh in my mind i write about him even if the events i describe make my soul ache because i want to make him permanent if only on paper after his surgery when matt was told he still had a remnant of the tumor and would probably die he murmured but no one will remember me i promised he would be remembered and as long as these pages exist and someone reads them he is remembered but isnt that being merely sentimental in the first place theres nothing wrong with being sentimental that emotion and others such as compassion set us apart from animals they make us human but in the second place no im not being merely sentimental there are lessons here truths they tumble through my mind children are a gift throughout these pages ive maintained that matthew was a special child his verbal and musical skills his intelligence his good nature were extraordinary everyone liked him everyone recognized his unusual potential i truly believe that if hed lived he would have made our world a better place or is that fatherly pride i dont want to nominate matt for sainthood he was special but he wasnt perfect he and i had discussions about curfews and other household rules but yes i wasamproud of him and thats my point every parent ought to have pride in his or her child because every child is special by virtue of being a child from when matthew was diagnosed in early january until he died in late june for those six months his mother his sister and i were with him almost constantly not always as a group and not between treatments when matthew found the strength to go to school but then his treatments lasted longer and his sessions at school became shorter and our family grew even tighter for the last eight weeks of his life matts home was the hospital and one or all of his family was with him day and night when you think about it the average parent sees his or her schoolage child for an hour or two at most each day in the morning when the familys getting organized and in the evening when settling down at supper then at bedtime during the intervals everyone goes a separate way but we saw matt every hour during his final six months and in particular his final eight weeks we spent more time together than an average family does over a lifetime maybe that closeness was a backhanded compensation for the pain and terror matt and by extension the rest of us endured maybe donna sarie and i got to know matt better than we ever normally would have and to love him with greater intensity maybe six months or even eight weeks can be a lifetime maybe its not how long but how well in the eulogy i wrote for matt i described how i read in the newspaper about mothers who strangle unwanted newborn infants about fathers who beat their children to death while we wanted so desperately for our own child to live i asked why cant evil people suffer and die why cant the good and pure for matt truly was both populate and inherit the earth theres a writer i admire andrew vachss to date his novels are flood and strega read them i admire him for two reasons first because his sentences are strong his stories make me turn the pages but the second reason i admire him is that he became a novelist out of frustration because he wanted a broad audience to get the message of what he considers his true profession hes an attorney who deals with childabuse cases some time ago i wrote a rave review of strega for the washington post he was kind enough to send me a letter of thanks not for the review but for emphasizing the message of his books not for my writing he said but for my work after matts death he phoned to convey his sympathy i cant tell you how sorry i am he said truly it breaks my heart but for what its worth if this helps ive seen so many dead battered children at least your son had this privilege he died knowing he was loved i started to cry but somehow kept talking your days must be hell dealing with these scum who treat children like sacks of garbage no my days are victories i feel as if i save the lives of more children each year than most doctors do in emergency wards tomorrow i go to trial against a fourthgeneration incest case and man i cant wait to put those perverts out of society abused kids are pows establishing them with a decent family is like ending a war child abuse intolerable unforgivable children are precious to be cherished i always knew that believe me that knowledge has been reinforced cancer i used to be afraid of it not anymore because it once was an unknown enemy but now its horribly familiar and whats familiar isnt as fearsome as the unknown a few days ago one of matts doctors came to visit i told him what i was writing i expressed my concern that someone afflicted with cancer might be advised not to read this book the doctor shook his head in disagreement matts cancer was rare and it chose a rare sitea rib instead of an arm or a leg as near as we can tell though we cured it he died because of an infection of a type that almost never happens a biological accident whatever hes still dead david listen based on the autopsy results i have to believe matt would have survived from the cancer youll hate me for saying this your son was unlucky rare cancer rare site resistant to chemotherapy finally responded shrank but metastasized surgery got most of it chemotherapy combined with a bone marrow transplant got the rest of it but a biological accident killed him what we learned from matthews death takes us a step ahead in curing ewing s sarcoma whats that got to do with whether a cancer victim should read this book your son god bless him may have been the only victim in this country of that rare cancer in that rare site and he stared it bravely in the face he went all the way with it successfully except for the septic shock if matt could stare that rare cancer in the face imagine the inspiration he can provide to victims of much more common cancers of malignancies we usually can cure he provides an example if matt could be brave given the worsening complications he stoically accepted maybe hell show others how to fight their illness david you know weve had successes even with ewing s youve spent six months in the cancer ward youve seen patients go home some didnt there are no guarantees what im saying is panics an enemy too but matt didnt panic so finish the book and if civilians read itnot a doctor like me and a veteran like youmaybe they wont be so ignorant about chemotherapy and how its administered and why a patient goes bald and what the chemicals do and why and how and what and so today ill finish the book and maybe some readers will find it frightening but maybe other readers will learn but why did i write this book as i did so a portion of it was fiction in a paradoxical way the fictional portions too are fact i never believed matt would die to his final hours in intensive care i remained convinced that hed survive after his death i still could not accept it sure the doctors came out to the waiting room and told us he was dead donna and sarie saw the body i was on the verge of another panic attack physically incapable of standing of going into his room they described how pathetically lifeless matts scarred bruised corpse looked finally out of pain there must be a soul donna said because without it he didnt look the same he just looked empty donna explained how the intensive care staff prayed along with her and sarie over matthews corpse then of course there was the autopsy the cremation and the funeral but even when we deposited the urn containing matts ashes into the crypt i still did not believe matt was dead this isnt real i thought this cant be happening its a nightmare ill wake up and mattll be fine for days afterward and especially the nights i used to pray for the terrible hallucination of matts death to end the only reason i was able to sleep is that i couldnt wait to wake up and discover matts death had been only a vivid nightmare each morning as my consciousness focused id feel a surge of hope then realize that the nightmare hadnt ended the hallucination hadnt faded and id plummet back into despair but still id keep saying this cant be real that was one of my reactions another was my utter conviction that if matts death impossibly was real there had to be a way to reverse what had happened to go back in time and save him i truly believed that i thought if i concentrated hard enough i could turn the clock back i spent many hours praying for a miracle for a time warp for a chance to leap into the past and somehow keep matt alive throughout matts treatment the doctors had given us detailed explanations about his disease and how they were trying to fight it after matts death the doctors gave us equally detailed explanations about what had killed him about the staph and the strep and the septic shock every stage of matts treatment had been based on logic but a biological accident destroyed him in case he developed a fever a wide range of antibiotics was ready to be administered and those antibiotics were given right away the instant his fever started to rise the infection was killed but the shock the infection caused had been too strong for his weakened body in hindsight the only way to have tried to save him and i emphasize tried because thered have been no guarantee the effort would have worked would have been to administer the antibiotics before the fever started to get a head start on the infection before it developed with the devastating swiftness of a fire storm but as a doctor explained antibiotics are toxic when they dont have anything to fight bacteria can get used to them so if an infection does occur the antibiotics arent effective in other words prematurely administered antibiotics might have made matthews condition even worse still given the fact that matt died anyhow those antibiotics if given before he seemed to need them were all that might have saved him if might such despairproducing qualifiers thats what cancer patients die from but ifs if only this had worked or that hadnt happened if i believe that matthews doctors did everything in their power to try to save him i understand how unorthodox it would have been for them to administer antibiotics before his symptoms demonstrated a need for that kind of treatment im not criticizing i want to make that clear and i also want to make it clear that parents of cancer victims shouldnt try to be doctors or think they know better than medical experts it isnt even wise to go through medical texts because those texts are often outdated especially in terms of cancer research which constantly develops new techniques of treatment but i keep telling myself this cant have happened it isnt real matt didnt die and i keep telling myself those antibiotics were his only chance so finally i wrote this bookto tell you what happened to my son and at the same time to dramatize my sense of unreality am i still in a faint on my kitchen floor has all of this been a nightmare will i wake up to discover that matt didnt die and i didnt write this book i pray so or am i dying forty years from now recalling the greatest loss of my life still trying to find a way to bring matt back anythings possible because as far as im concerned the impossible happened to matt thats what i meant when i said that even the percent of fiction in this book is paradoxically true because my fantasy dramatizes two phenomena of griefthe sense that its all a nightmare and the need to go back in time and make matters right my final scene in which matthew dies in while david dies forty years later and their souls as fireflies surge blazing toward each other illustrates something else i said i mentioned im falling off the fence of agnosticism im starting to believe in god and an afterlife because i need to because i so desperately want to see my son again believing in god gives me a hope can faith be far behind is there no pity sitting in the clouds that sees into the bottom of my grief shakespeare romeo and juliet ive been told that the loss of a child you loved is among the worst agonies a human being can suffer a subjective statement of course and i certainly dont want to get into any contests about grieving my stepfather died eight years ago that hurt me a lot one of my wifes sisters died the following year and that hurt a lot those were my only experiences of powerful grief until now but those two painful losses cant compare to my present agony i shudder at the thought that i might survive my wife for the moment though lets grant the statement the loss of a child you loved is among the worst ordeals a human being can suffer the promise of youth destroyed the potential for zest and goodness torn away the unfairness of it all and you miss the kid so much there have been days when i didnt think i could survive the pain i contemplated suicide what stopped me is that a month to the day after matthew died my daughter found the body of a friend whod shot himself to death hed placed a towel beneath his head before he pulled the trigger to minimize the blood i couldnt put sarie through more torture i couldnt bear forcing her to attend the funeral of her father so i survive day by day and the thoughts that help me are as follows the world is based on entropy the messiness of the universe physicality is imperfect disintegration and random chance are the rule if you have a good day count yourself lucky and if you wonder how god could cause something so devastating as the death of your son youd better rephrase the question because god didnt cause your sons death the chaotic nature of the world did god is perfect the world is not you could say that god should have done a better job when creating the world but perfection cant create itself it can only create a lesser version you could also say that god should have intervened to prevent the death of your child but that would be a miracle and no one has a right to expect a personal miracle i remember praying for a miracle when matt was close to death i tried to make one of those bargains that elisabeth küblerross refers to in her books about the nature of death and dying but i couldnt think of a reason for god to help me instead of all the other troubled souls in this world i finally thought id found an argument that couldnt be refused dear god i prayed just as youre supposed to be a father to me and to love me as your son so please identify with the love i feel for my son please help my son because your son is asking you the prayer didnt help but im not bitter that it wasnt answered after all i was trying to make a deal and maybe thats the wrong thing to do to try to make a deal with god maybe if id believed in him totally before matt got sick maybe if id had faith in him to start with and not just now matt would have lived well thats another issue the miracle did not occur and god neither caused nor took away my sons cancer because the nature of the universe he created doesnt permit his intervention thats why theres a heaven i want to believe because its a goal a step up from the chaos of earth if you believe in original sin you understand why the worlds imperfect and why god tests us instead of intervening but if you dont believe in original sin compassion ive said that matt believed in the value of good nature if everyone every day showed good nature to everyone else most of societys problems would disappear recently an editor acquaintance called me and paraphrased a quotation from a book whose title he no longer remembered from the start of human history theres been so much pain and suffering the stars should have stopped in their tracks my acquaintance ought to know hes suffered twice my tragedy two of his children have died i dont know how he keeps going but my acquaintance i keep using that word because i see him but once a year and thats what impressed mehe wasnt a friend and yet he was phoning me spoke only briefly about his own tragedies he said he was calling because hed heard about my sons death and he wanted to tell me how deeply it filled him with sorrow compassion if you think about it every person you know every friend every stranger in every building you pass will one day and perhaps even now have a devastating personal loss my acquaintance exemplified what we have to do show our compassion we have to say im filled with sorrow for what youre suffering we have to weep for the pain of our fellow mortals youve probably seen those bumper stickers that ask have you hugged your kid today you bet and our fellow sufferers the letters of consolation my family received not only from friends but sometimes from strangers were powerfully helpful they showed my wife my daughter and me that we werent alone that someone cared that shoulders were there to lean on lately ive found that ive been hugging people a lot and until matthews death i wasnt what youd call a touchy person i hug them impulsively and it seems to help me and them feel better about the day about persisting in this tenuous universe life is suffering i said in matts euology quoting the first of the great truths of buddha lets face up to that and show the best of our human qualitiesnot intelligence i think thatll doom us if nuclear weapons and worldwide pollution are any evidence of our stupid cleverness not intelligence but compassion what else have we got to depend upon except each other if someone you know has pain tell him or her youre sorry dont keep a distance be human theres another aspect of grief i need to talk about its physical effects ive described my collapse while matthew was unconscious in intensive care ive dramatized my experience in the emergency ward where cardiologists and neurosurgeons tested me and finally explained that id succumbed to stress and exhaustiona frightening condition though i hadnt yet learned that fear exactly described my symptoms three weeks after matthews death at nine oclock on a wednesday night i sat in a lazboy chair to watch a tv program id been anticipating an episode in a brilliant thriller from britain called edge of darkness i use the world thriller in a qualified sense at the beginning of this episode there was nothing thrilling going on scenes were being set characters established but the show was a distraction and i was grateful for anything that might help take my mind off matthews death suddenly i felt a tingle in my feet in hot and cold rhythms it rushed up my legs soared through my abdomen and reached my heart as ive said im a runner because of that physical conditioning my normal heartbeat is sixty at once it beat faster i checked my pulse it had risen to ninety with equal abruptness it raced beyond my ability to check it i hyperventilated i convulsed i felt as if id just run a fast five miles my guess is my pulse was now a hundred and fifty and then the spasms hit my head and as donna raced across the room to try to help me i managed to say im having a heart attack im going to die you cant imagine my terror and you cant imagine how quickly this incident occurred a minute ago id been fine now i was heaving in my chair and sure i was dying as quickly the spasms dwindled my heart rate went down my breathing returned to normal but i was so shaken by the experience i couldnt function for two days thats when i decided i needed more medical advice through the grace of a doctor friend i was able to interrupt a cardiologistinternists hectic schedule and be examined this kind man took three hours to check me thoroughly to be prudent he even ordered sophisticated heart tests known as echoandsonograms when he concluded he told me i was one of the healthiest persons hed ever examined no theres something wrong with me i insisted my head i think i need a cat scan maybe ive got a tumor maybe if the doctor who knew i wouldnt mind his sense of humor said oh i think youve got something in your head all right but a cat scan isnt going to find it you think im nuts i think youve been having classic panic attacks you need to see a psychiatrist now to me a psychiatrist meant psychoanalysis and since im a fiction writer i worried that he might misinterpret my ability to imagine and suspect i was having delusions but the result was quite the contrary the psychiatrist listened for ninety minutes as i babbled about my supposed heart condition and my sons death and finally he told me with compassion that he concurred with the cardiologists opinion i was suffering classic panic attacks in lay terms my emergency defense systemexemplified by my adrenal glandhad worked so hard before and after matthews death that it wouldnt turn off now for no apparent reason but with obvious subconscious prompting it was kicking into gear when there wasnt an emergency so here i am on four tranquilizers and a sleeping pill each day i havent had further panic attacks though i do hyperventilate on occasion but im learning how to subdue that if youre suffering from grief and youve endured the symptoms i just described dont assume theyre panic attacks dont be an amateur physician have a medical exam because your heart might indeed be infirm but if the diagnosis does turn out to be panic disorder your condition can be controlled youll still grieve theres no cure for that but at least you wont have panic to add to your terrible sorrow yesterday my sons principal physician came to see me he brought matts final autopsy report it proves that the fantasy you just read isnt possible even if i did have precognition i couldnt have saved my son he was sicker than i feared the debris from the dead bacteria that plugged his heart and killed him was only one of many things wrong with him the debris had also plugged an artery to his brain causing major cerebral damage if matt had survived the septic shock hed have been mindless at best in addition he had fungal and yeast infections throughout his body they would have been fatal as well a brain aneurysm hed had from birth could have ruptured and killed him at any time but most significant of all the final autopsy on a microscopic level revealed that matts cancer wasnt cured malignant cells lingered on his spine at this moment my wife my daughter and i would be back with him in intensive care but now in addition to suffering indescribable pain hed have been paralyzed no cure possible the only mercy death my prayer was answered dear god just as youre supposed to be a father to me and to love me as your son so please identify with the love i feel for my son please help my son because your son is asking you matt died as best as possible the worst yet the best because at the moment what i formerly thought was the worst would be only the start of something far more horrible a slower more painful death i grieve how much it hurts but im at peace because im convinced at last that my son was doomed nothing could have saved him but father god it hurts winter is come and gone but grief returns with the revolving year percy bysshe shelley adonais cycles circles dates numbers anniversaries on november when matthew was six in the midst of an evening birthday party donna suffered a miscarriage she lost what would have been our third child this child had not been planned but we anticipated it lovingly i made two urgent callsto donnas doctor who told us to rush to the hospital and to a friend who agreed to race to our house and allow matts birthday party to continue ironically this friend was also present when i picked up the dove in the mausoleum after matts funeral the miscarriage occurred when the fetus was three months old we never asked what sex it was or what caused its spontaneous abortion but thereafter whenever donna and i celebrated matthews birthday with him we also mourned for the unknown child who did not survive gestation now on november which is rapidly approaching well mourn twiceover for that unknown child and for a son we knew so well and will forever miss june the date of matthews death since then on the twentyseventh of each month we light a candle at pm the moment he left us christmas will be hard so will new years and thanksgiving will be most bitter dates and cycles mental tombstones but this is what i most dread last winter was mild here in iowa it snowed almost never but in early january when matthew was diagnosed and received his first chemotherapy i remember one evening how i stared out a window of his hospital room outside the arc lights reflected off glimmering snow i turned to matt whod just finished vomiting and told him its snowing he murmured yeah i bet its pretty you always liked snow remember how we used to walk in it and build snowmen i wish i could build one now you will next year were in this together well see you through this next year well walk in the snow cant wait me neither i said but matts not here now and im still waiting for that first snow that will be the hardest time not november or the twentyseventh of each month or thanksgiving or christmas or new years no that first snow will be the worst but as hard as ill have to force myself ill walk in it and build a snowman ill try to believe in god ill try to have faith that ill see my son again ill remember the sudden peace i felt in church that night before his funeral ill recall the dove in the mausoleum ill pretend i hear matts guitar its power chords blasting from his bedroom window and as the snowflakes melt on my face blending with my tears ill imagine those flakestheyll glisten from streetlights ill imagine those snowflakes are fireflies june september afterword look homeward angel so much has happened in the twelve years since i wrote those final words where to begin the dove the memory of it continues to give me comfort as does my discovery after completing fireflies that what my family my friends and i experienced that morning in the mausoleum was not unique my first hint of this came in a letter from father andrew greeley who responded to a manuscript of fireflies i had sent him in addition to being a priest and a bestselling novelist father greeley taught at the university of chicago s social science research center studies there demonstrated he wrote that experiences of the type i described had happened to fortytwo percent of the population the figure rose to sixty percent when applied to widows and widowers our society is so closeminded on the subject that many who have these experiences dont want to let others know about them for fear of being ridiculed he pointed out but perhaps my book would console these people letting them know that they arent alone he was certainly right that they arent alone after fireflies was published i gave interviews across the country and was astonished by how many people came to me with personal stories that paralleled mine with the dove the phone calls and letters were equally plentiful no other book by me has received so many responses thousands yet in a way they were one and the same various birds animals and insects had behaved like the dove as i tried to understand i came across an observation by the psychologist carl jung who noted that when humans are in a crisis they sometimes experience a phenomenon called synchronicity in which psychological states are mirrored by physical events these events usually involve objects that have deep universal symbolic significance emotions and events that have no causal relationship match so directly and powerfully that to claim the parallel between the inner and the outer world happened by chance is inadequate what i learned is that there is a lot of it going around the following are some versions of synchronicity that stay vividly in my mind a novelist friend lost his adolescent son in an accidental hanging the boy had refused to eat what was being served for dinner after a family disagreement he stormed to his room and pretended to hang himself expecting to shock his parents and receive sympathy when they came upon the staged scene the ruse went terribly wrong what they found instead was his corpse when i heard i immediately phoned my friend to tell him how sorry i was in passing i asked whether anything unusual had happened after the boys death unusual he asked what do you mean oh i dont know i said not wanting to lead him anything out of the ordinary now that you mention it he paused as if unsure i would believe him there was something my wife and i had our son cremated we went up into the mountains and sprinkled his ashes over a ridge when we walked back along the trail a group of deer came out of the trees and stopped in front of us this wasnt synchronicity true in the wilderness deer normally avoid humans but not always sometimes on a hike ive come across deer and they look at me with as much curiosity as i look at them the event didnt have the meaningful coincidence factor that jung wrote about any more than the appearance of a rainbow would have rainbows appear all the time but doves dont normally behave in the manner i described there has to be something outside common experience my friend must have heard the hesitation with which i said yes that sounds unusual im not explaining this very well he said as you know my wifes legally blind she shouldnt have been able to see those deer but as long as they stood there she could and then they stepped back into the forest and my wife stopped seeing again yes another account that stays with me was told in a letter and involves a couple whose son brad died when he was twentyone brad liked to write poems the best of which was about the sorrow that resulted from killing a dragonfly the poem was read at his funeral afterward a neighbor who had herself lost a child gave the family a pamphlet water bugs and dragonflies how to explain death to children the story was beautiful the mother wrote to me it told of water bugs crawling along the bottom of a dark muddy pond every now and then one of them climbed the stem of a lily pad and disappeared they eventually made a pact that the next water bug to disappear would come back and tell the others where it had gone one day a bug crawled up reached the pad shed its ugly shell sprouted wings and became a beautiful dragonfly it soared off delighting in the suns warmth and freedom remembering its promise it tried repeatedly to dive into the water but its wings wouldnt allow it to go through the obvious moral is that our loved ones assume new forms and so cannot come back to tell us where they have gone after death not long after reading this parable the mother went out to the familys mailbox where what she described as the most beautiful creature she had ever seen soared toward her there was no doubt that it was a dragonfly but it didnt have the thin body and narrow bluegreen wings that she was used to this one had a wingspan of at least eight inches its body was thick like a butterflys its color was a patchwork of deep purple and pale lilac that glistened and reflected the sun it dove toward her barely missing her head it bounced off the car antenna it bounced off the garage door it twirled it lunged it did flips the sight was so amazing that it reminded her of the blue angels aerial acrobatics team she had seen earlier in the summer the experience went on for ten minutes and what most delighted her was that the dragonfly looked like it was using its wings for the first time it reminded her of a childs first experience on a twowheeler weaving and crashing into trees she laughed sharing its joy inwardly hearing the words look at me ma im so happy im having a ball dont feel sad for me eventually the dragonfly disappeared into the trees the mother went into the house and stared out the window hoping to see it again nothing happened for five minutes until she said bradley if thats you please come back whereupon the dragonfly zoomed past the window as the mother carefully explained the family lived five miles from the nearest body of water they had lived there for twenty years and had never seen a dragonfly in the area but after brads death an identical dragonfly put on a similar demonstration for her husband her other son her younger daughter and another married daughter who lived ten miles away the mother herself never got to see that dragonfly again a similar account came from a mother whose twentyfiveyearold son jeff died from a brain tumor he had told his sister that his body was only a cocoon and that soon he would be a butterfly the symbolism was clear butterflies are graceful and beautiful and represent a change from one kind of life to another but as far as the mother was concerned the symbol soon became much more when after jeffs death her husband was washing jeffs car the family couldnt bring itself to sell the vehicle and a large black and gold butterfly perched itself on a bush at the side of the driveway staying there for an hour the rest of the family approached watched and took photographs all the while the butterfly didnt move its black and gold colors reminded them of the iowa hawkeyes a football team to which jeff had been fiercely loyal amazing everyone the pattern on its back and outspread wings was a huge smile throughout the coming summer it returned often sometimes it showed up at jeffs grave buzzing the mother when her troubled thoughts brought her there to talk to her dead son as autumn approached her husband was again working in the yard when he came running into the house and told her to hurry outside the butterfly had collapsed in midair and died at his feet at the same time a second black and gold butterfly flew upward into the sky in her letter the mother noted the further symbolism the fallen butterfly not alive but always with her and the flying butterfly soaring upwardfreeto a better place she and her husband had never seen two comparable butterflies together before they never saw any again accompanying the letter was a photograph of the butterfly a wide black and gold smile on its back spreading magnificently onto its wings as many accounts of this type as i received i still wasnt prepared for what i learned when bill and judy guggenheim wrote to me in response to fireflies influenced by elisabeth kublerrosss seminars on death and dying they had embarked on a sevenyear study of what they called afterdeath communication eventually collecting thousands and thousands of accounts comparable to mine their research and numerous examples of these incidents were eventually published in their book hello from heaven in essence the accounts have the same tone and substance as those i just mentioned and in every case the message is basically the same i love you and i miss you youre hurt and im sorry but everythings all right with me now im okay given how widespread the phenomenon is what are we to make of it jung merely described it he didnt explain it so were on our own a skeptic would say that its wishful thinking that grief prompts people to impose a hopeful message on any strange event that happens along the viewpoint cant be dismissed and yet having been on the receiving end of one of these events i can only say that sometimes truth is a matter of having been on the spot of having seen for oneself could it be that in some people the power of grief is so extreme that it can influence exterior events and make a bird an animal or an insect behave in a way that gives reassurance emotion over matter or could it be that there is a universal force a spiritual one that underlies all things and that responds to our own spirit behaving synchronistically with it when our need is great im referring to the overwhelming transcendental spirit that emerson and thoreau wrote about and that van gogh depicted in his paintings a sense that inside and outside psyche and matter are one in this regard the greatest poem was written by einstein emc energy equals mass times the speed of light squared everything in the universe is identical but in a different form connected on a primal level theres no way i can prove this notion but it works for me the dove has made me feel that the world is full of infinite possibilities if we can merely as e m forster said connect with it an incident comes to mind it happened in the spring of almost three years after matthews death in new york city after a long period of having been unable to write i had finally found my way back to the word processor in manhattan for meetings with my publisher about the publication of a new novel the fifth profession i had gone out for evening cocktails with my editor when he went home i decided to see a broadway show the musical has long since faded from memory but what happened afterward is as clear to me as if it were occurring now the show ended around eleventhirty i emerged into the noise glare and chaos of times square in the rush of traffic there was no point in trying to find an empty taxi so i started to walk to my hotel which was one block east and ten blocks north but i managed to get only halfway across times square when the mother of all panic attacks hit me youll remember how they debilitated me when matthew died unfortunately they didnt stop on no predictable schedule and for no apparent reason they would strike at the worst of times dizziness headache chest pains rapid breathing racing heartbeat sweaty palms rubbery legs the symptoms of a heart attack and a stroke assaulted me simultaneously forcing me to sit on a curb that i barely reached before the traffic light changed and cars surged past me stay calm i tried to assure myself youll soon feel good enough to get to your feet but the attack didnt pass if anything it got worse my heart was racing so fast i couldnt count the beats the pain in my chest felt as if a wrestlers arms were around me squeezing me into greater dizziness everything about me became gray but i could see well enough to know that junkies were sitting on each side of me and that three street kids were interested in what might be in the wallet of a helpless manmewearing a burberry overcoat and checking a rolex watch the hands of which my blurred vision showed to be at half past twelve good god while id been sitting on the curb trying to muster my strength calm my heart and catch my breath an hour had flashed past the junkies and the street kids took a keener interest in me too weak to ask passersby for help and who would have paid attention in the din of times square on a friday night i was suddenly in a lifethreatening situation an easy victim flanked by predators i managed the most determined action of my life by wavering to my feet one step after another i started through the crowd my pose of confidence convincing enough that the junkies and the street kids fell behind but the panic attack was worse than when it had started my chest tighter my heartbeat fiercer my vision grayer fear as much as weakness now prevented me from stopping someone to ask for help how did i know that my plea wouldnt signal how defenseless i was to someone ready to take advantage i wasnt even sure id be able to get the words out i had a nightmarish vision of being taken to bellevue keep walking i told myself get to the hotel that became my mantra get to the hotel one step after another in a fog i managed to reach sixth avenue under a streetlight i looked at my watch dismayed to discover that another half hour had flashed past it was now one am i searched the avenue for an empty taxi all were occupied i had the unnerving conviction that even if an empty taxi approached the driver would take one look at my unsteady condition and speed onward ten blocks i told myself thats all i have to go earlier in the day i had walked that distance in fifteen minutes now as the blocks stretched ahead of me they seemed like miles another group of street kids assessed me i forced myself onward two blocks and thirty minutes later i found myself aiming toward the next streetlight after hanging on to it i wavered toward the next one im sure i looked drunk at onethirty in the morning on what was now an almost deserted sixth avenue i was so debilitated by my swirling mind and racing heart that i feared i was going to collapse but if i did i kept warning myself there was a good chance that after the street predators finished with me i would never wake up i started to pray but not to god to matt im in trouble son i need help as i plodded toward another streetlight i prayed harder matt this is serious i need your help in my desperation i suddenly had the sense of a small figure putting an arm around my right side supporting my unsteady weight years later as i write this i can still feel the palpable presence leaning against me holding me up the help being given to me was so strong that i didnt need to grab each streetlight and try to catch my breath i was now able to aim toward the end of the block and the end of the next one the sense that matthimself frail and thin from his operationwas holding me up was uncanny then i turned the corner toward the hotel and as abruptly as the sense of him had come it left i was on my own again managing the last few unsteady steps to the hotel inside the clock on the wall showed five to three i dont offer that story as a version of synchronicity it wasnt as far as im concerned matt was holding me up helping me along but he wasnt visibly there no meaningful coincidence of the inside and the outside occurred i cant prove anything extraordinary happened the point is something else the sense that i have each day in less dramatic ways usually that my son is with me i was raised a roman catholic in grade school the nuns used to talk to us about guardian angels at the time i thought of it as a pleasant notion now i think of it as much more often when i feel overwhelmed with cares and i cant think of a solution i ask matt or my dead mother or two writers now deceased who were father figures to me philip young and stirling silliphant to find me an answer almost always i receive it a skeptic would call this a psychological device that happens to work without having a spiritual basis i cant prove anything this is a book about candor and faith all i know is whenever i need help and ask for it im not alone the butterfly i referred to brings to mind another source of help one that my wife and i found extremely comforting because a butterfly was once one life form that became a beautiful other it is the symbol for the compassionate friends the worlds largest selfhelp organization for bereaved parents siblings and grandparents a friend recommended that we go to a meeting dazed wondering how on earth the group could help us apart from letting us know that we werent alone we nonetheless went and experienced one of the most meaningful evenings of our lives the meeting took place in a basement room in an iowa city hospital the corridors seemed so mazelike that we had trouble finding the place a process metaphoric of our lives coffee and cookies awaited us as did a group composed of about onethird kindly welcomers and twothirds silent participants whose downward gazes and stunned gray faces gave an idea of their psychological shock before the evenings speaker was introduced the groups leader asked everyone to sit in a circle then give his or her first name and say something about the child they were mourning donna and i were twothirds around the circle i braced myself not sure that i would be able to get my voice to work when i tried to describe what had happened to matt in my compartmentalized world i assumed that nothing worse could have happened to any child but as each person spoke i was shocked into a greater perspective i learned about children who had died in every way imaginable crushed burned poisoned drowned stabbed shot hit by cars falling from cliffs seldom dying instantly most of them suffering some parents had lost more than one child some grandparents had lost their children and their grandchildren as the litany of anguish went around the room i found myself thinking good lord these people are really in rough shape i belatedly realized that after donna and i had finished speaking those across from us would be thinking the same about us the effect of the meeting was to make us realize we werent alone but far more we were overcome with sympathy and sorrow for those around us we were taken out of ourselves and taught to care about others just as others in the room learned to care about us the compassionate friends a perfectly descriptive name we went to numerous meetings after that and the painful process by which we began to be functional again would have lasted a lot longer if it hadnt been for the friendship we found at those sessions to someone who has suffered the trauma of losing a child a grandchild or a sibling i cant think of a more helpful step that person can take than to get in touch with the local chapter of the compassionate friends its phone number is and its web site is wwwcompassionatefriendsorg the panic attacks finally lessened but not until nine years after matts death meanwhile anxietypanic disorder has been widely reported in the media millions of people suffer from the diseasemore each year it seems and yet there continues to be a wide misperception about it as someone said to me your son died a long time ago and youve got a successful career as a novelist so what on earth do you have to be anxious or panicked about the answer is that years of stress or a single overwhelming incident can so weaken the bodys ability to handle tension that the smallest amount can cause the brain to trigger the release of stress chemicals the effect on the body is similar to what someone would feel if suddenly confronted with a maniac jumping out of an alley swinging an ax in the latter case the rapid heartbeat and heaving chest are appropriate spontaneous defensive reactions that the mind uses to urge the body to defend itself or race out of harms way but with anxietypanic disorders the chemicals that trigger a fightorflight response are in undue proportion to the minor incident that caused the stress or else theyre released when there isnt any apparent stress at all ive had panic attacks walking down a street going up an escalator eating a hamburger watching tvin just about any benign situation i can imagine sometimes it was because the defective valve in my brain dumped stress chemicals into me for no other reason than that it was faulty other times it was because an unconscious association stimulated a massive stressful flashback to matthews death my treatment was a combination of visits to a psychiatrist and a drug called xanax part of a class of drugs known as benzodiazepines xanax a cousin of valium works by affecting the ability of neurotransmitters to relay stress messages put simply the drug stops the brain from sending out panic signals its an effective drug it works the trouble is its side effects include foggy thinking and short termmemory loss these inadvertent results arent good for anybody but for a writer theyre disastrous one reason i wrote little for two years after matts death is that id get to the middle of a sentence and not be able to remember how it began or how it was supposed to end so the task became to use as little xanax as possible while struggling to come to terms with matthews death and get the broken part of me to heal the trouble is xanax is addictive i later discovered that only about a third of the people who take it for a considerable period of time ever manage to stop theres a phenomenon called rebound if you take enough of it your body gets so used to it that when you reduce it with intentions of stopping altogether you reach a point where your body says wait a minute whats going on i need that stuff where is it in other words youre addicted and when you try to stop you experience withdrawal a stress that weakens the already weakened stress valve youve been trying to repair the consequence is a panic attack caused not by the original trauma but by reducing the treatment for the trauma what a mess i started with four milligrams of xanax a day i reduced it to three and a half waited reduced it to three waited two and a half two one and a half one and bang i had clusters of panic attacks that forced me back to taking four milligrams of xanax a day i went through the process six times before i finally overcame the effects of withdrawal dont misunderstand if someone close to you has died and youre suddenly overwhelmed by panic attacks the two frequently go together theres nothing wrong with taking xanax if a psychiatrist prescribes it ill say it again a psychiatrist preferably one with experience in grief counseling anxietypanic disorder is an emotional illness with physicalpsychological causes a family doctor can temporarily treat the physical part by prescribing what amounts to a tranquilizer but if the psychological causes arent also addressed the source of the problem will never be solved and the risk of getting hooked on medication is high indeed not everyone who needs counseling requires drug therapy in that regard psychotherapists theyre not physicians can be as helpful as psychiatrists and if they conclude that a drug like xanax would be helpful they can get a psychiatrist to prescribe it ive met many people so impaired by panic attacks that they need counseling but for various reasons they refuse to use that resource their motive is often fear of what people will think if word gets out that theyve been to a psychiatrist or a psychotherapist this attitude goes back to an intolerant time when various emotional and physical diseases depression and cancer among them had a social stigma my response is this anybody who thinks less of someone for getting psychiatric help isnt anybody whose opinion has any value in the first place a further excuse for not getting help is the notion what do shrinks know its all fake im as smart as they are theres an old joke that an attorney who tries to represent him or herself in a court of law has a fool for a client the same applies to anyone with an emotional disorder who thinks that he or she can handle it without the help of an expert im proud to say i spent three years going to a psychiatrist once a week to start then once a month my panic attacks had so aggravated my despair that i contemplated suicide several times and i credit the psychiatrist for saving my life after a fouryear respite the panic attacks returned and without a second thought i immediately sought more help what does a good psychiatrist or psychotherapist know that the patient doesnt plenty i still have a bottle of xanax in my medicine cabinet but knowing my illness better and knowing about alternative methods of treatment breath control and biofeedback for example ive learned to use the drug the way i would an aspirin to subdue a headache the last time i had the prescription refilled i was pleased to discover that thirty pills of onemilligram strength which i break in half had lasted me two years in the meantime believing that knowledge is power i continue to educate myself about the disease there are many good books on the subject but for me the most useful is the anxiety disease by dr david sheehan a former director of anxiety research of the department of psychiatry at massachusetts general hospital if you know someone who has suddenly become a victim of panic attacks get that person this book if you yourself are the victim do what dr sheehan tells you sometimes when i feel an attack coming on and i dont know which is going to kill me first the coronary or the stroke i reread several wellthumbed chapters of the anxiety disease and remind myself of the true nature of the attack im having thats often enough to calm my symptoms when i was a professor of american literature one of the novels i most enjoyed teaching was thomas wolfes look homeward angel its one of the few classic american novels that isnt pessimistic wolfe embraced everything in life its tragedies as much as its triumphs managing to find all of it ennobling the epigraph to the novel im condensing it somewhat announces its theme naked and alone we came into exile in her dark womb we did not know our mothers face from the prison of her flesh have we come into the unspeakable and incommunicable prison of this earth remembering speechlessly we seek the great forgotten language the lost laneend into heaven a stone a leaf an unfound door where when o lost and by the wind grieved ghost come back again judged only on its tone this passage might not seem optimistic but in the context of the book it is powerfully so wolfe says that we existed in another state before we were born its not such a radical idea plato had several things to say about this so do most eastern religions we come into exile birth and spend the rest of our lives trying to remember where we came from the lost laneend into heaven anything in this existence a stone a leaf is worthy of study because it might be the trigger that frees our repressed memory and allows us to recall the perfect existence from which we were separated if were alert we should always be looking for the unfound door that will take us back to where we began the angel of the title is our soul the home it is looking for is the ideal existence above this illusory physical one from that ideal world we once knew something calls to us our ghost our spirit to return by the wind grieved ghost come back again i find this theme eerie and profound it addresses the loneliness that even the most optimistic of us feel at the same time it gives us an answer to that loneliness by urging us to grasp every aspect of life no matter how insignificant something might seem or how painful it might be because all experience leads to an understanding that takes us to a higher level and an even higher one after that eventually to the perfection from which we came thats a hard notionto accept the grief that comes our way lord do i know but i keep thinking of that universal spiritual force i mentioned earlier the overwhelming transcendental spirit that emerson and thoreau wrote about and that van gogh depicted in his paintings whitman said it well i wish i could translate the hints about the dead young men and women and the hints about old men and mothers and the offspring taken soon out of their laps what do you think has become of the young and old men and what do you think has become of the women and children they are alive and well somewhere the smallest sprout shows there is really no death and if ever there was it led toward life and does not wait at the end to arrest it all goes onward and outward nothing collapses and to die is different from what any one supposed whitmans words are basically what look homeward angel is about life doesnt begin and end like energy it only changes its form in the years after matthews death constantly remembering my vision of the fireflies i have come to think of life at its ultimate as a speeding point of light and that matthew has been translated into one of those points wishful thinking perhaps but one of the lessons i took away from this horrid experience is that as long as i refused to accept matthews death my mind and my body rebelled oh i admitted that he was dead but i kept fixating on the past on events before he died telling myself how wonderful life had been before he got sick and life indeed was wonderful back then by virtue of being life but my refusal to put my mind in the present was a form of denying that he was dead another american novel i enjoyed teaching this one pessimistic is john barths the end of the road in it a character observes that reason and logic cant account for the world theres no ultimate reason for cleveland stadium to seat a specific number of spectators that number could have been more or less the number it does seat just happens to be the way things are theres no reason in the long run why italy shouldnt be shaped like a sausage instead of a boot but that doesnt happen to be the case the world is everything that is the case and what the case is is not a matter of logic why is gold yellow why is there one moon why are there two sexes no necessary reason things just turned out that way why is matthew dead same answer but as long as i refused to accept what was the case i was in terrible shape one day about four years after his death i surrendered i stopped dwelling on the past i accepted the present the aftermatt present the day i came to terms with the fact that life would never be as it was that it had changed and transformedthat was the day i began to heal because i came to believe in what wolfe and whitman had written about all goes onward and outward nothing collapsesand to die is different from what any one supposed emc but i had another reason for thinking about wolfes look homeward angel its hero is eugene gant a version of wolfe the novel depicts his preadult experiences including the death of his brother ben one of the most famous deaths in american fiction in the books climax eugene is about to leave his hometown of altamont north carolina in real life asheville and to embark on the continuing great adventure of his life wolfes point is that every life its pain and glory is an adventure eugene stands to the side of the town square and has a kind of mystical vision in which he sees himself in the equivalent of a filmic double exposure multiplied by thousands every version of himself at every age crisscrosses the square to eugene s continuing astonishment multiple versions of his dead brother also appear chronicling bens life in the square eugene rushes to him and calls him a ghost which ben denies but i saw you die eugene objects ben replies that he isnt dead that he isnt a ghost then what are you eugene insists adding you are dead or do men die its a whitmanlike moment followed by bens asking eugene what he expects to find by going away eugene s answer is myself he says that he hopes to find himself in the larger world but where is the world he wonders to which ben replies nowhere you are your world a new significance of the title now presents itself look homeward now means to look inward as well as outward that the inside and the outside reflect on each both leading us to the ideal otherworld from which we came these thoughts were on my mind when after matthews death my wife and i started having multipleexposure visions similar to what eugene saw in the town square to us iowa city was so synonymous with matthew that virtually every street and principal building reminded us of him gave us images of him the library the record stores the movie theaters the ice cream shop the pizza parlors the grade school down the street the junior high a few blocks away i can still see him coming down the steps of that school where i picked him up to drive him to the hospital for more chemotherapy in spirit he peopled the area but the memories were a bittersweet refusal to accept the aftermatt present to deal with what was the case so finally in donna and i decided that we had to move on iowa city had been a wonderful home for twentytwo years we had raised a family there we had also lost a son there the city represented a lifetime now somewhere else we were going to attempt a new one look homeward angel but where to go one thing was certainthe landscape would have to be different from the lush rolling hills of iowa ocean or mountains were obvious alternatives by chance we watched a pbs show called this old house which depicted the distinctive adobe pueblo architecture of santa fe new mexico i later wrote about this moment in a novel extreme denial an appropriate title given my former psychological state the flatroofed sprawling houses with their thick walls deeply recessed windows and rounded corners were so unusual that we felt we were looking at buildings in another country their claycolored stucco blended wonderfully with the orange red and yellow of their highdesert surroundings mountain foothills were covered with junipers and piñon trees the mountains themselves were rich with aspen those mountains called to us in april on my fortyninth birthday which symbolically i thought of as my fiftieth we spent a long weekend there we found ourselves so captivated by the areas mixture of hispanic native american and anglo cultures that four months later in the most impulsive decision of our lives donna and i moved to santa fe where as donna described it we began act three in an amazing spiritual setting the northern new mexico light has long been a favorite of painters we learned to look inward and outward while equally important living now matt is still with us literally just before leaving iowa city we went to the mausoleum asked the superintendent to unscrew the glass plates that sealed matthews urn in its niche the memory of the dove was certainly with me that day and drove home with the urn in donnas arms he and three cats made the thousandmile car trip with us hes on a bookshelf in a small office off the living room sometimes sentimentally i put on a jimi hendrix cd for him but its a good kind of sentiment not a looking back but an acceptingjust as i look fondly and not painfully at the beautiful white acousticelectric guitar we gave him shortly before he died and that he was never able to play its in a corner of the tv room i often put my hand on it as i go past just as i touch matts urn when im near it in the office having made peace with matts death feeling him with us donna and i move on theres a lot to move toward after working as a book publicist sarie eventually married she has a daughter age fourwhich in case you miss the point means that were grandparents what a delightful child natalie is but then thats one of the themes of this bookall children are delightful adults sometimes need to be reminded of that how i worry that something might happen to her but thats out of my control just as matthews cancer was everythings an act of faith we have to accept what is the case take the bad with the good load it all aboard and do our damnedest to move on a hard lesson but ive had a lot of years to learn it and i learn it anew with each passing day
