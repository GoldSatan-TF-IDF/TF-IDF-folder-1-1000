laurell k hamilton a stroke of midnight the th book in merry gentry series to j who holds my hand and my heart who helps me play in the darkness but not to live there acknowledgments to all my friends both writers and nonwriters who love me still even though most phone conversations have begun lately with hello stranger hope to see more of everyone this next bit chapter i hate press conferences but i especially hate them when ive been ordered to hide large portions of the truth the order had come from the queen of air and darkness ruler of the dark court of faerie the unseelie are not a power to be crossed even if i was their very own faerie princess i was queen andaiss niece but the family connection had never bought me much i smiled at the nearly solid wall of reporters fighting to keep my thoughts from showing on my face the queen had never allowed this much of the human media inside the unseelies hollow hill our sithen it was our refuge and you dont let the press into your refuge but yesterdays assassination attempt had made allowing the press into our home the lesser evil the theory was that inside the sithen our magic would protect me much better than it had in the airport yesterday where id nearly been shot our court publicist madeline phelps pointed to the first reporter and the questions began princess meredith you had blood on your face yesterday but today the only sign of injury is your arm in a sling what were your injuries yesterday my left arm was in a green cloth sling that matched my suit jacket near perfectly i was dressed in christmas yule red and green cheerful and it was that time of year my hair was a deeper red than my blouse my hair is the most unseelie part of me sidhe scarlet hair for someone who looks good in black not the gold or orangey red of human hair the jacket brought out the green in two out of the three circles of color in my iris the gold circle would flash in the camera light sometimes as if it truly was metallic the eyes were pure seelie sidhe the only part of me that showed that my mother had been of the golden court well at least half i didnt recognize the reporter who had asked the question he was a new face to me maybe new since yesterday since yesterdays assassination attempt had happened in front of the media on camera well wed had to turn away some of the reporters because the big room wouldnt hold more id been doing press conferences since i was a child this was the biggest one id had including the one after my father was assassinated id been taught to use names for reporters when i knew them but to this one i could only smile and say my arm is only sprained i was very lucky yesterday actually my arm hadnt been injured in the assassination attempt that got on film no my arm had been hurt on the second or was that the third attempt on my life yesterday but those attempts had happened inside the sithen where i was supposed to be safe the only reason the queen and my bodyguards thought i was safer here than outside in the human world was that we had arrested or killed the traitors behind the attempts on me and the attempt on the queen wed damned near had a palace coup yesterday and the media didnt have a hint of it one of the old names for the fey is the hidden people weve earned the name princess meredith was it your blood on your face yesterday a woman this time and i did know her name no i said i smiled for real as i watched her face fall when she realized she might be getting just a oneword answer no sheila it wasnt mine she smiled at me all blond and taller than i would ever be may i add to my question princess now now madeline said one question per its okay madeline i said our publicist turned to look at me flipping off the switch at her waist so her microphone would not pick up i took the cue and covered mine with my hand and moved to one side of it madeline leaned in over the table her skirt was long enough that she was in no danger of flashing the reporters down below the dais her hem length was the absolute latest of the moment as was the color part of her job was paying attention to what was in and what was out she was our human representative much more than any ambassador that washington had ever sent if sheila gets to add to her question then they will all do it that will make everything harder for you and for me she was right but tell them that this is an exception then move on she raised perfectly plucked eyebrows at me then said okay she hit the switch on her mike as she turned and smiled at them the princess will let sheila ask another question but after that youll have to keep it to the original rule one question per she pointed to sheila and gave a nod thank you for letting me add on to my question princess meredith youre welcome if it wasnt your blood yesterday then whose was it my guard frosts the cameras flashed to life so that i was blinded but the attention of everyone had moved behind me my guards were lined up along the wall spilling down the edges of the dais to curl on either side of the table and floor they were dressed in everything from designer suits to fullplate body armor to goth club wear the only thing that all the outfits had in common was weaponry yesterday wed tried to be discreet about the weapons a bulge that ruined the line of the jacket but nothing overt today there were guns under jackets or cloaks but there were also guns in plain sight and swords and knives and axes and shields wed also more than doubled the number of guards around me i glanced back at frost the queen had ordered me not to play favorites among the guard shed gone so far as to tell me not to give any long lingering glances to one guard over another id thought it was an odd demand but she was queen and you argued with her at your peril but i glanced back after all hed saved my life didnt that earn him a glance i could always justify it to the queen my aunt that the press would think it strange if i hadnt acknowledged him it was the truth but i looked because i wanted to look his hair was the silver of christmastree tinsel shiny and metallic it fell to his ankles like decoration but i knew that it was soft and alive and felt oh so warm across my body hed put the upper layer of his hair back from his face with a barrette carved from bone the hair glittered and moved around his charcoalgrey armani suit that had been tailored over his broad shoulders and the athletic cut of the rest of him the suit had also been tailored to hide a gun in a shoulder holster and a knife or two it had not been designed to hide a gun under each arm or a short sword at his hip with a leather scabbard strapped tight to his thigh the hilt of a second sword rode over his shoulder peeking through all that shining hair he bristled with knives and frost always had other weapons that you couldnt see no suit was designed to cover that much armament and hold its shape his jacket couldnt be buttoned at all and the guns and sword and one knife glinted in the cameras flash cries of frost frost filled the room while madeline picked a question the man was another one i didnt know nothing like an assassination attempt to attract the media frost how badly were you hurt frost is a little over six feet and since i was sitting down and the microphone was adjusted to my height he had to lean down way down with a weapon of any kind he was graceful but bending low over that mike he was awkward i had a moment to wonder if hed ever been on mike before then his deep voice was answering the question i am not hurt he stood back up and i could see the relief on his face he turned away from the cameras as if he thought hed get off that easily i knew better but wasnt it your blood on the princess his hand was gripping the pommel of his short sword touching his weapons unnecessarily was a sign of nerves he leaned over the mike again and this time he bumped my bad shoulder with his body i doubted the press saw such a small movement but it was too clumsy for words for frost he braced a hand flat against the table steadying himself he turned eyes the grey of a winter sky to me the look asked silently did i hurt you i mouthed no he let out a sigh and leaned back to the microphone yes it was my blood he actually stood back up as if that would satisfy them he should have known better he had been decorative muscle for the queen at enough of these over the years to know that he was being a little too concise at least he didnt try to go back to his spot behind me this time a reporter i did know simon mccracken was next hed covered the faerie courts for years frost if you are not hurt then where did your blood come from and how did it get on the princess he knew how to word the question just right so we couldnt tapdance around it the sidhe dont lie well paint the truth red purple and green and convince you that black is white but we wont actually lie frost leaned over the mike again his hand pressed to the table hed moved minutely closer to me close enough that his pants leg touched my skirt his sword was almost trapped between our bodies that would be bad if he had to draw the weapon i looked at his hand so big and strong on the table and realized his fingertips were mottled he was gripping the table the way you grip a podium when youre nervous i was shot he had to clear his throat sharply to continue i turned my head just enough to see that perfect profile and realized it was more than nerves frost the queens killing frost was afraid afraid of public speaking oh my i have healed my blood covered the princess when i shielded her from harm he started to stand back up but i touched his arm i covered the mike with my hand and leaned in against him so i could whisper against the curve of his ear i took in a deep breath of the scent of his skin and said kneel or sit his breath went out so deep that his shoulders moved with it but he knelt on one knee beside me i moved the microphone a little closer to him i slid my hand under the back of his jacket so that i could lay my hand against the curve of his back just below the side sweep of the big sword sheath when fey are nervous any fey we take comfort from touching one another even the mighty sidhe feel better with a little contact though not all of us will admit it for fear of blurring the line between royalty and commoner i had too much lesser fey blood in my veins to worry about it i could feel the sweat that was beginning to trickle down his spine madeline started to come closer to us i shook my head she gave me a questioning look but didnt argue she picked another question from the throng so you took a bullet to protect princess meredith i leaned into the mike putting my face very close to frosts touching carefully so i didnt get makeup on him the cameras exploded in bursts of white light frost jumped and i knew that was going to be visible to the cameras oh well we were blinded vision blurred in bursts of white and blue spots his muscles tightened but i wouldnt have known it if i hadnt been touching him hi sarah and yes he took a bullet for me i said i think sarah said hi princess back but i couldnt be sure since i still couldnt see well enough and the noise of so many voices was too confusing id learned to use names when i knew them it made everyone feel more friendly and you need all the friendly you can get at a press conference frost were you afraid he relaxed minutely against me into the touch of my hand and my face yes he said afraid to die someone yelled out without being called on frost answered the question anyway no madeline called on someone who asked then what were you afraid of i was afraid meredith would be harmed he licked his lips and tensed again i realized hed used my name without my title a faux pas for a bodyguard but of course he was more than that every guard was technically in the running to be prince to my princess but we were sidhe and we dont marry until were pregnant a nonfertile couple is not allowed to wed so the guards were doing more than just guardingmy body frost would you give your life for the princess he answered without hesitation of course his tone said clearly that that had been a silly question a reporter in back who had a television camera next to him asked the next question frost how did you heal a gunshot wound in less than twentyfour hours frost gave another deep shouldermoving sigh i am a warrior of the sidhe the reporters waited for him to add more but i knew he wouldnt to frost the fact that he was sidhe was all the answer he needed it had been only a through and through bullet wound from a handgun and no special ammunition it would take a great deal more than that to stop a warrior of the sidhe i hid my smile and started to lean into the mike to help explain that to the press when the sweat along his spine suddenly stopped being wet and warm it was as if a line of cold air swept down his back cold enough that i moved my hand away startled i glanced down at his big hand on the table and saw what id feared a white rime of frost was drifting out from his hand i thanked goddess that the cloth on the table was white only that was saving us from someone noticing they might notice later when they went back over the camera footage but that i could not help i had enough to worry about without thinking that far ahead in a way this was my fault id accidentally brought frost into a level of power that hed never known it was a blessing of the goddess but with new power comes new responsibilities and new temptations i moved my hand from under his jacket to cover his hand with mine as i spoke into the reporters puzzled murmur i was braced for his hand to be as icy as that slide of power down his back but surprisingly his hand wasnt nearly that cold the sidhe heal almost any injury i said the frost was spreading out the edge of it caught the microphone and began to climb it the mike crackled with static and i squeezed frosts hand he saw it then what his fear was doing id known it wasnt on purpose he balled his hand into a fist but with my hand on top of his my fingers entwined with his i did not want anyone to notice the frost before it melted i turned my face toward his and he faced me there was a snow falling in his iris like a tiny grey snow globe set in his eyes i leaned in and kissed him it surprised him because hed heard the queens admonition about not showing favoritism but andais would forgive me if she gave me time to explain shed have done the same or more to distract the press from unwanted magic it was a chaste press of lips because frost was that uncomfortable in front of all these strangers plus i was wearing a red lipstick that would smear like clown makeup if we did a tonsilcleaning kiss i saw the explosion of the cameras like an orange press against my closed eyelids i drew back from the kiss first frosts eyes were still closed his lips relaxed almost open his eyes blinked open he looked startled maybe from the lights or maybe from the kiss though goddess knows id kissed him before and with a great deal more body english did a kiss from me still mean that much to him when wed kissed so many times i couldnt count them all the look in his eyes said yes more clearly than any words photographers were kneeling as close to the front of the table as the other guards would let them get they were taking pictures of his face and mine the frost had melted while we kissed leaving only a light wetness around our hands it barely darkened the white cloth wed hidden the magic but wed exposed frosts face to the world what do you do when a man lets the whole world see just how much your kiss affects him why kiss him again of course which i did and this time i didnt worry about clown makeup or the queens orders i simply wanted always to see that look on his face when we kissed always and forever chapter we had red lipstick smeared over both our faces but we were sidhe and one of the lesser powers we possessed was glamour a little concentration and i simply made my lipstick look perfect though i could feel it smeared around my mouth i spilled the small magic across frosts face so that he looked as he had before and not like hed laid his face into a pot of red paint and rubbed back and forth it was illegal to use magic on the press the supreme court had declared that it infringed on the first amendment freedom of the press and all that but we were allowed to use small magic on ourselves for cosmetic purposes after all there was no difference between that and regular makeup or plastic surgery for celebrities the court wisely didnt try to open that particular can of moviestar worms i could have worn glamour instead of makeup in the first place but it took concentration and id wanted all my concentration for the questions besides if there was another assassination attempt the glamour would go and the queen was just vain enough that shed ordered me into makeup just in case i guess so that if the worst happened id look good dead or maybe i was just being cynical maybe she simply didnt trust my abilities at glamour maybe i told frost that hed answered enough questions for one day and it was a feeding frenzy of frost frost there were even a few rude enough to shout out questions like is she good in bed how many times a week do you get to fuck her gotta love the tabloids especially some of the european ones they make our american tabloids look downright friendly we all ignored such rude questions frost took his post behind me against the wall i could feel the small magic around him if he walked too far from me the glamour would break but this close i could hold it not forever but long enough to get us through this mess madeline chose one of the mainstream newspapers the chicago tribune but his question made me wonder if wed have been better off answering the tabloids i have a twopart question meredith if i may he was so courteous i should have known he was leading up to something that wouldnt be pleasant madeline looked at me and i nodded he asked if the sidhe can heal almost any wound then why is your arm not healed im not fullblooded sidhe so i heal slower more like a human yes youre part human and part brownie as well as sidhe but isnt it true that some of the noble sidhe of the unseelie court are concerned that you are not sidhe enough to rule them that even if you gain the throne they will not acknowledge you as queen i smiled into the flash of lights and thought furiously someone had talked to him someone who should have known better some of the sidhe did fear my mortality my mixed blood and thought that if i sat on the throne i would destroy them that my mortal blood would take their immortality it had been the reason behind at least one maybe both of the extra attacks yesterday we had an entire noble house and the head of another imprisoned now awaiting sentencing no one had briefed me on what to say if the question arose because no one had dreamt that any sidhe or lesser fey would have dared talk to the press not even to hint i tried for halftruth there are some among the nobility that see my human and lesser fey blood as inferior but there are always racists mr oconnel he said mr oconnel i said do you believe that it is racism then madeline tried to stop me but i answered because i wanted to know how much he knew if not racism then what mr oconnel they dont want some mongrel halfbreed on their throne now if he pushed it hed look like a racist reporters from the chicago tribune dont want to look like racists thats an ugly accusation he said yes i said it is madeline stepped in we need to move on next question she pointed to someone else a little too eagerly but that was all right we needed to change topics of course there were other topics that were almost as bad is it true that a magic spell made the policeman shoot at you princess meredith this from a man in the front row who looked vaguely familiar in the way that onair personalities often do the sidhe do not lie we make a sort of national sport out of almost lying we can lie but if we do then we are foresworn once upon a time you were kicked out of faerie for that the answer to the question was yes but i didnt want to answer it so i tried not to lets drop the princess guys ive been working as a detective in la for three years im not used to the title anymore i wanted to avoid having anyone ask who had done the spell it had been part of the attempted palace coup we were so not sharing that a sidhe noble had caused one of the police helping to guard me to try to kill me madeline picked up her cue perfectly calling on a new reporter with a new question this is quite a display of sidhe muscle princemeredith the woman smiled when she left off the princess i was hoping they would like that and i didnt need the title to know who i was is the extra muscle because you fear for your safety yes i replied and madeline moved us on it was a different reporter but he repeated the dreaded question was it a spell that caused the policeman to shoot at you meredith i drew breath not even sure what i was going to say when i felt doyle move up beside me he leaned over the microphone like a black statue carved all of one pieceblack designer suit black highcollared dress shirt shoes even his tie of the same unrelieved blackness may i take this question princess meredith the silver earrings that traced the curve of his ear all the way up to its point flashed in the lights contrary to all the faerie wannabes with their cartilage implants the pointy ears marked him as not pure high court as something less something mixed like me his black hair was anklelength and he could have hidden his deformity but he almost never did his hair was pulled back in its usual braid the diamond stud in his earlobe glittered next to my face most of his weapons were as monochrome as the rest of him so it was hard to spot the knives and guns darkness on darkness he had been the queens darkness her assassin for more than a thousand years now he was mine i fought to keep my face as blank as his and not let the relief show be my guest i said he leaned down to the microphone in front of me the attempt on the princesss life yesterday is still under investigation my apologies but some details are not ready to be discussed publicly his deep voice resonated over the mike i saw some of the female reporters shiver and it wasnt fear id never realized he had a good voice for a microphone i think he like frost had never been on mike before but unlike frost it didnt bother him very little did he was darkness and the dark isnt afraid of us were afraid of it what can you tell us about the assassination attempt another reporter asked i wasnt sure if the question was directed at doyle or me i couldnt see his eyes through his wraparound blackonblack sunglasses but i swear i felt him look at me i leaned into the mike not much im afraid as doyle says its an ongoing investigation do you know who was behind it doyle leaned into the mike again i am sorry ladies and gentlemen but if you insist on asking questions that we are not free to answer for fear of hindering our internal investigation then this press conference is over on one hand it was neatly done on the other hand hed said a bad wordinternal so it was sidhe magic that bespelled the policeman a woman yelled shit i thought doyle had caused it he tried to clean it up by internal i meant that it involves princess meredith the potential heir to queen andaiss throne it does not get much more internal than that especially not for those of us who belong to the princess he was deliberately trying to distract them into asking about my sex life with my guard a much safer subject madeline cooperated by picking one of the tabloid reporters for the next question if anyone would fall for sex over internal politics it was the tabloids they swallowed the bait what do you mean you belong to the princess doyle leaned in closer to the mike close enough that his shoulder brushed against mine it was very subtle and very deliberate it would probably have been more eyecatching if frost and i hadnt played kissyface first but doyle knew how to play to the press you had to start slow and give yourself someplace to go hed only started playing to the media in the last few weeks but as with everything he learned quickly and did it very well we would give our life for her the secret service are sworn to give their life for the president but they dont belong to the president the reporter emphasized the word belong doyle leaned closer to the mike forcing him to put one arm against the back of my chair so i was framed in the curve of his body the cameras exploded so that i was blind again i allowed myself to lean in against doyle partly for the picture and partly because i liked it perhaps i misspoke doyle said with all my christmas brightness framed against his blackness are you having sex with the princess a female reporter asked yes he said simply they actually almost sighed as a group in eagerness another woman said frost are you sleeping with the princess doyle stepped back and let frost come up to the mike again though i would have preferred keeping him away from it he was brave and he came and bent over the mike bent over me but frost wouldnt play for the cameras his face was arrogant and perfect and showed nothing even though his grey eyes were bare to the cameras glare he always said he thought it was beneath us to play to the media but i knew now that it wasnt arrogance that made him not play it was fear a phobia if you will of cameras and reporters and crowds he leaned over stiffly and said yes this shouldnt have been news to any of them publicly id returned to faerie to seek a husband the sidhe dont breed much so the royals get to marry only if they get pregnant first the queen and i had explained this at another press conference when i first visited home but shed kept the guards away from the mikes and there was something about the guards admitting it on mike that excited the media almost as if it was dirtier because they were saying it are the two of you having sex with the princess at the same time no frost fought not to frown we were lucky the reporter hadnt asked if they slept together with me because that we did the fey sleep in big puppy piles its not always about sex sometimes its about safety and comfort frost stepped back to the wall stiff and unhappy the reporters were yelling even more sexual questions at him madeline helped us out i think our killing frost is a little shy at the mike boys and girls lets pick on someone else so they did they yelled out names and questions to the men one or two of the guards onstage had never been paraded in front of the media at all i wasnt certain that adair or hawthorne had ever seen a television or a movie they were in fullplate mail though adairs looked like it was formed of gold and copper and hawthornes was a rich crimson a color no metal had ever been adairs was metal hawthornes just looked like metal though i couldnt say what it was made out of something magical they had both chosen to keep their helmets on adair i believe because the queen had shorn his hair as a punishment for trying to refuse my bed hawthornes hair still fell in thick blackgreen waves to his ankles i had no idea why he kept his helmet on they must have been roasting in front of this many electric lights but having decided to wear the helmets theyd wear them until they fainted well adair would i didnt know even that much about hawthorne they knew what a camera was because the queen was fond of her polaroid but beyond that and indoor plumbing technology was a stranger to them i wondered how they felt about being thrown to the lions their faces would show nothing they were the queens ravens they knew how to hide what they felt thankfully no one yelled their names probably because no one knew who they were madeline finally picked a question and a victim for them brad you had a question for rhys the reporter stood up a little taller and most of the others sat down like disappointed flowers rhys how was it being a real detective in los angeles rhys was on the far end near the edge of the dais he was the shortest of the purebred sidhe only five and a half feet tall his white curls fell to his waist capped with a creamcolored fedora with a slightly darker band the trench coat he wore over his suit matched the hat he looked like a cross between an oldtime detective with better fashion sense a male stripper and a pirate the stripper came from the pale blue silk tshirt that clung to his muscular chest and washboard abs the pirate came from the fact that he wore a patch over one eye it wasnt affectation but to save the press from seeing what was left after a goblin had torn out his eye laid scars down a boyishly handsome face the remaining eye was three rings of blue he could have used glamour to hide the scars but when he realized the scars didnt bother me hed stopped bothering he thought the scars gave him character and they did rhys had always been a huge film noir fan and the reporter clearly remembered that i liked her better for it he put one hand flat on the table and the other across my shoulders as he moved into the mike similar to what doyle had done but rhys knew how to play to the camera better because hed been doing it longer he took off the fedora and shook his hair out so it fell around his shoulders in thick white curls i loved being a detective in la was it like in the movies someone asked sometimes but not very much i ended up doing more bodyguard work than actual detective work the next question was interesting there were rumors that some of the stars you and the other guards protected wanted more body than guarding that was a hard one because a lot of the clients had asked or indicated a willingness for sex the men had either ignored the invitation or said no so technically the answer was yes but if he said yes then all the semifamous or even famous for whom rhys had bodyguarded would be in the tabloids tomorrow and it would be our fault our former boss jeremy grey deserved better than that from us so did our clients and the right kind of clients would stay away from greys detective agency and the wrong kind would come and be disappointed i leaned into the microphone and said suggestively im afraid that rhys was too busy bodyguarding me to bodyguard anyone else that got me laughter and distracted them all we were back to sex questions about us and those we could answer is rhys good in bed yes i said is the princess good in bed very see easy questions rhys have you ever shared a bed with the princess and one of the other guards yes then the reporters started working together the first reporter tried to ask who with but madeline said hed had his question the next reporter she picked asked rhys who did you share the princess with he could have tapdanced around that one but he chose truth because why not nicca the cameras and attention turned to nicca like lions spotting a newly wounded gazelle this particular gazelle was six feet tall with deep brown skin and rich chestnut hair that fell to his ankles thick and straight held back only by a thin copper diadem he was naked from the waist up except for the rich gold silk suspenders that graced his chest and caught the faint yellow pattern in the brown of his suit pants he had two mm guns in the front of his pants because no one could figure out how to get him in a shoulder holster or how to strap on his armor or his swords without damaging his wings they towered above his shoulders and a little above his head they swept out and down to his calves so that the edges of them almost brushed the floor they were huge moth wings as if a halfdozen different kinds of giant silk moths had had sex one dark night with a faerie only two days ago the wings had been a birthmark on the back of his body but during sex the wings had suddenly burst forth from his skin and become real the back of his body was now one smooth brown piece he moved to join us while the cameras made us go blind again rhys stayed with me as nicca stood beside us towering over us both he looked out at the crowd his face puzzled he wasnt accustomed to being front and center for the queen or me nicca do you really sleep with the princess and rhys he bent over toward the mike so he was on one side of me and rhys was on the other the wings fanned out above my head yes he said then stood back up the cameras clicked and reporters shouted questions until madeline picked someone how did you get wings good question unfortunately we didnt have a good answer you want the truth i asked were not sure nicca what were you doing when the wings appeared when nicca knelt back over the wings flexed so that for a moment i was backdropped against one of them i couldnt see anything but flashes having sex with meredith the reporters did everything but giggle like junior high school kids the american reporters and some of the european had never quite gotten used to the fact that the fey as a whole dont see sex as bad so admitting to sex with someone unless it makes your lover uncomfortable isnt bad or scandalous was rhys with you yes technically rhys had been beside the bed not in it but nicca didnt see a reason to quibble was anyone else in the bed with you and the princess when it happened yes that was nicca and very sidhe you either distracted with a story that had nothing to do with what was asked or you answered exactly what was asked and absolutely nothing else nicca wasnt good at stories so he stuck to truth who someone yelled nicca glanced at me and he shouldnt have the glance was enough to let the reporters know that he wasnt sure i wanted him to tell the name shit most sidhe women do not like admitting that theyve fucked a lesser fey but i wasnt ashamed the reporters would make more of that one glance than there was to make damn the trouble was that sage wasnt on the stage he wasnt sidhe and his own queen had demanded him at her side besides our queen didnt want him onstage with me in andaiss own words oral sex fine but he doesnt get to fuck you no demifey no matter how tall is sitting on my throne as anyones king so sage got to stay out of sight which made this moment even more interesting the other third or would that be fourth i said with a smile isnt onstage today hes not certain he wants the media attention is he going to be one of your lovers and potential kings no which was the truth why not someone else shouted out i wouldnt have answered it but nicca did hes not sidhe oh hell that started another frenzy of shouted questions i leaned into nicca and asked him to go back to his piece of wall on the dais rhys went back to his section on the edge where he could watch the crowd he was trying not to laugh i guess it might as well be funny but nicca had to stay away from the mike from now on i wasnt ashamed of what id done with sage but i wasnt sure how much of it my aunt wanted me to explain to the media she did seem embarrassed about it madeline finally found a question that she thought i would be able and willing to answer she was wrong which of them is the best in bed meredith i fought not to glance at madeline what was she doing taking that question she knew better look at them all how could anyone choose just one laughter but they didnt let it go you seemed to have a preference for frost earlier princess it wasnt a question so i didnt answer it another reporter asked fair enough princess but if not just one who are your multiple favorites that was trickier everyone that ive had sex with is special to me in their own way truth how many have you had sex with i leaned into the mike gentlemen if you would just take a step or two forward rhys nicca doyle and frost moved forward only three extra men stepped away from the wall galens skin was almost as white as my own but in the right light there was an undercast of green to that paleness his curls were green in any light except in the dark where they looked blond he had cut his own hair just above his shoulders leaving only one thin braid to remind me that once it fell to his ankles of the men of faerie only the sidhe were allowed to grow their hair long galen had cut his hair voluntarily unlike adair or amatheon who stood next to him amatheons rich red hair had been frenchbraided so that the reporters would have a harder time realizing that his hair only touched his shoulders now hed given in to the queens order sooner than adair had the fact that cutting the mens hair had been a punishment a humiliation that persuaded them to do as the queen bid said how very odd it was that galen had done it on his own he was the youngest of the queens ravens only seventyfive years older than me among the sidhe it was almost like being raised together id thought that open handsome face was the perfect face since i was fourteen or maybe younger it was galen that i wanted my father to let me be engaged to but he had chosen another that engagement had lasted seven years but there had been no children and in the end he had told me i was too human for him not sidhe enough it had made me wonder even more why my father wouldnt let me have galen in the first place he turned lovely green eyes to me and smiled and i smiled back he was as armed as any of them with blade and guns but there was a softness to him that most of the others had lost centuries before either he or i had been born hed give his life for me and would have when i was a child unlike the rest of them but as a politician he was something of a disaster and that could be fatal in the high courts of faerie someone touched my shoulder i jumped and found madeline with her hand over my mike she leaned in and whispered youre staring at him lets not repeat the frost incident shall we she stepped back with a smile already for the press hitting the switch at her waist i had to keep my face turned away from the crowd because i was blushing i didnt blush much and by human standards it wasnt too dark sidhe skin just doesnt flush the way human skin tones do of course keeping my face away from the cameras meant that galen could see me some days its only a choice of embarrassments not an escape from them madeline was saying princess meredith is getting a little tired we may have to cut this short guys sorry there was a general outcry and a renewed flash of cameras which was bad because galen came to me he knelt in front of me beside my chair and was tall enough that from the shoulders up he was still clearly visible to them he touched my chin so gently with just the tips of his fingers it made me look at him it made me forget that we were both in profile to the cameras he leaned his face closer to me making me forget that we were onstage i leaned in toward him and his hand cupped the side of my face that made me forget everything else i have no explanation for it wed shared a bed for months he was a disaster politically and showing him this much favor in front of everyone could endanger him but i wasnt thinking that when we kissed i wasnt thinking anything and all i could see was the pleased look on his face the look in his eyes hed loved me since i was seventeen and that was in his eyes as if nothing had changed and no time had passed the queen had ordered me not to show favoritism she was going to be angry with me with him with us but after frosts little incident as madeline called it what was one more it was bad and still i kissed him still i wanted to kiss him still for just a moment the world narrowed down to galens face his hand against my skin and his mouth on mine it was a soft chaste kiss i think because he knew if he kissed me too hard id lose my hold on the glamour that kept frost and me from looking like lipstick casualties galen drew back and his eyes held that soft surprise that they did sometimes as if he still couldnt believe he was allowed to kiss me allowed to touch me id caught the same look on my face in the bedroom mirror a time or two do we all get a kiss the voice was deep and held the rough sloughing of the sea barinthus moved toward us in a swirl of his hair the color of oceans the turquoise of the mediterranean the deeper medium blue of the pacific a greyblue like the ocean before a storm sliding into a blue that was nearly black where the water runs deep and thick like the blood of sleeping giants the colors moved and flowed into one another so that the actual where and what his hair looked like was everchanging like the ocean itself hed once been a god of the sea id only recently discovered that he had been manannan mac lir but that was a secret now he was barinthus a fallen god of the sea he moved gracefully across the stage all near seven feet of him his eyes were blue but with a slit pupil like a cat or a deepsea animal he had a second clear membrane that could close over his eye when he was underwater and would often flicker when he was nervous it flickered just a touch now i wondered if anyone in the crowd of reporters knew how much it cost this very private man to have suggested a kiss and make himself the target of all these cameras galen had realized hed misbehaved because he showed me with his eyes that he was sorry unfortunately his face wasnt that hard for anyone to read including the reporters the queen had said no favorites our behavior was going to force me to try to prove i had none after what galen and i had just done that was going to be difficult a lot of the men standing with me would have played for the cameras and it would have cost them or me nothing barinthus was not one of them hed been my fathers friend and by american standards we hadnt had sex not even by bill clintons standards if id been him i would have stayed against the wall but he held to a higher standard of truth even than most of the sidhe i looked up at barinthus and with me sitting and him standing it took awhile to get all the way to his face if you like i kept my voice light and my face pleasant barinthus and i had never kissed and the first kiss should not be on film it was rhys who saved the day if barinthus gets a kiss then so do i doyle said to be fair we all should barinthus gave a slight smile i would bow to the larger need and take my kiss in private galen and frost have already had theirs rhys said and as galen went back to his place in line rhys pretended to box his ears barinthus did a very graceful bow and tried to slink back to his place but that wasnt happening a reporter asked lord barinthus have you decided to go from being kingmaker to being king no sidhe would have called him kingmaker to his face or queenmaker either but the media well he couldnt box their ears he knelt beside me rather than lean into the mike kneeling down his head was about even with mine i doubt i will stay with the princess as a permanent member of her guard why not i am needed elsewhere truth was that before queen andais had accepted him into the unseelie court after the seelie court kicked him out barinthus had to promise that he would never accept the throne here not even if it was offered hed been manannan mac lir and the queen and her nobles all feared his power so hed given his most solemn oath that he would never personally sit on our throne he bowed to the room in general and simply went back against the wall he made it clear that he was done with questions for the day kitto the halfgoblin sidhe had already moved back to his place he was only four feet tall and that made a lot of the media try to portray him as childlike he was old enough to remember what the world was like before christianity was a religion but his appearance made the media uncomfortable his short black curls pale skin and sunglasses made him look ordinary in his jeans and tshirt the queen didnt have a designer suit to fit someone so short there hadnt been time even for the queens seamstress to make those kind of alterations he got away with hugging his section of the wall princess meredith how will you choose your husband from among all these gorgeous men a reporter was asking the one who gets me pregnant wins the prize i said smiling what if you are in love with someone else what if you dont love the one who gets you pregnant i sighed and didnt fight the smile slipping away i am a princess and heir to a throne love has never been a prerequisite for royal marriages isnt it traditional to sleep with one fiancé at a time until you either get pregnant or dont get pregnant yes i said and cursed that anyone knew our customs that well then why the marathon of men if you had the chance wouldnt you i asked and that got them laughing but it didnt distract them would you marry a man you didnt like just because he was the father of your child our laws are clear i said i will marry the father of my child no matter who it is another reporter asked that is our law what if your cousin prince cel gets one of his female guards pregnant first then according to queen andais he will be king so its a race to get pregnant yes where is prince cel no one has seen him in nearly three months im not my cousins keeper in fact he was in prison for trying to kill me one too many times and for other crimes that the queen didnt want even the court to know he should have been executed for some of them but shed bargained for her only childs life he was to be locked away for six months tortured with the very magic he had used against sidheancestored humans branwyns tears one of our most guarded ointments it was an aphrodisiac that worked even against someones will but more than that it made your body crave to be touched to be brought he was chained and covered in branwyns tears there were bets around the court that what little sanity hed been born with would not survive it the queen had given in to one of his guards only yesterday to let the woman slack cels need save his sanity and suddenly i had not one but two no three attempts on my life and one on the queens it was more than a coincidence but the queen loved her son madeline was back in front of me looking at me are you all right princess sorry im getting a little tired did i miss a question she smiled and nodded im afraid so they repeated it and i wished id missed it again do you know where your cousin the prince is hes here in the sithen but i dont know what hes doing this exact moment sorry i needed off this subject off this stage i signaled to madeline and she closed it down with a promise of a photo op in a day or two when the princess was fully healed a tiny faerie with butterfly wings fluttered into camera range this was a demifey sage whom id slept with could make himself human tall but most of the demifey were permanently about the size of barbie dolls or smaller the queen would not be happy about the little faerie fluttering in front of the cameras when there was press in the sithen the lesshumanlooking stayed away from them and especially away from cameras or faced the queens wrath the figure was a pale bluepink with iridescent blue wings she fluttered through a barrage of flashbulbs shielding her eyes with a tiny hand i thought shed land on me or maybe doyle but she flew the length of the stage to land on rhyss shoulder she hid herself in his long white curls she whispered something in his ear using his hair and hat as a shield rhys stood up and came to us smiling doyle was standing beside me but even that close i couldnt hear what rhys whispered to him doyle gave a small nod and rhys left the room ahead of us with the tiny fey still tangled in his hair i wanted to ask what could be important enough for rhys to leave early in front of the press someone shouted rhys why are you leaving rhys left the room with a wave and a smile doyle helped me stand then the rest of the guards closed around me like a multicolored wall but the reporters werent finished doyle princess whats happened what did the little one say the press conference was over we got to ignore them it might have been wise to give them an excuse but doyle either didnt think we needed to bother or he didnt know what to say there was a tension in his arm where he touched me that indicated that whatever rhys had said had shaken him what does the darkness fear my wall of brightcolored muscle marched me down the steps and out when we were in the hallway clear of the media i still whispered modern technology was a wonderful thing and we didnt need some sensitive microphone picking us up whats happened there are two dead bodies in one of the hallways near the kitchen fey i asked one yes he said i stumbled in my high heels because i tried to stop but his arm on mine kept us all moving what about the other he nodded yes exactly is it one of the reporters did one of them go wandering frost leaned in from the line of men it cannot be we had spells that would make them unable to leave the safe path inside the sithen doyle glanced at him then explain a dead human in our sithen with a camera beside his hand frost opened his mouth then closed it i cannot doyle shook his head nor can i well isnt this going to be a disaster galen said we had a dead reporter in the unseelie sithen and a mass of live reporters still on the premises disaster didnt even begin to cover it chapter i d seen more violence in the courts than in all my years as a private detective in los angeles but id seen more death in la not because i was included in murder casesprivate dicks dont do murder cases at least not fresh onesbut because most of the things that live in faerie land are immortal by definition the immortal dont die very often i could count on one hand how many fresh crime scenes the police had called us in on and still have fingers left over even those cases were because the grey detective agency could boast some of the best magic workers on the west coast magic is like everything else if you can do good with it some people will find a way to do bad with it our agency specialized in supernatural problems magical solutions it was on the business cards and everything id also learned that all bodies are an it not he not sheit because if you think of the dead body as a he or a she they begin to be real for you they begin to be people and they arent people not anymore theyre dead and outside of very special circumstances they are just inert matter you can have sympathy for the victim later but at the crime scene especially in the first moments you serve the victim better by not sympathizing sympathy steals your ability to think empathy will cripple you detachment and logic those are your salvation at a fresh murder anything else leads to hysterics and i was not only the most experienced detective in the hallway i was also princess meredith nicessus wielder of the hands of flesh and blood besabas bane besaba was my mother and my conception had forced her to wed my father and live for a time at the unseelie court i was a princess and i might one day be queen future queens do not have hysterics future queens who are also trained detectives arent allowed hysterics the problem was that i knew one of these bodies id known her alive and walking around i knew that she liked classical literature when she was cast out of the seelie court and had to come to the unseelie court shed changed her name as many did even among the seelie they changed their names so they wouldnt be reminded daily of who and what they had once been and how far they had fallen she called herself beatrice after the love interest in dantes divine comedy dantes inferno she said im in hell i might as well have a name to match id taken world literature as one of my forced electives in college when i finished the class i gave most of my books to beatrice because she would read them and i wouldnt i could always buy extra copies of the handful of books that i actually enjoyed beatrice couldnt she couldnt pass for human and she didnt like being stared at i stared at her now but she wouldnt mind she wouldnt mind anything ever again beatrice looked like a delicate humansize version of the tiny demifey that still clung to rhyss hair once beatrice had been able to be that small but something happened at the seelie court something she would never talk about and she lost the ability to change sizes shed been trapped at around four foot two and the delicate dragonfly wings on her back had been useless the demifey do not levitate they fly and in the larger size their wings cant lift them blood had formed a wide dark pool around her body someone had come up behind her and slit her throat to get that close to her it had to have been someone she trusted or someone with enough magic to sneak up on her of course they had also needed enough magic to negate her immortality there werent that many things in faerie that could do both what happened beatrice i said softly who did this to you galen came up beside me merry i looked up at him are you all right i shook my head and looked down the hallway to our second body out loud i said ill be fine liar he said softly and he tried to bend over me tried to hold me i didnt push him away but i moved back now wasnt the time to cling to someone according to our culture i should have been touching someone but the handful of guards that had come to la with me had only worked at the grey detective agency for a few months id been there a few years you didnt huddle at crime scenes you didnt comfort yourself you did your job galens face fell a little as if id hurt his feelings i didnt want to hurt him but we had a crisis here surely he could see that so why as so often happened was i having to waste energy worrying about galens feelings when i should have been doing nothing but concentrating on the job there were moments no matter how dear he was to me that i understood all too well why my father had not chosen galen for my fiancé i walked toward the second body the man lay just short of the hallways intersection with another larger hallway he was on his stomach arms outspread there was a large stain of blood on his back and more of it curling down along the side of his body rhys was squatting by the corpse he looked up as i approached the demifey peeked out at me through rhyss thick white hair then hid her tiny face as if she were afraid the demifey usually went around in large groups like flocks of birds or butterflies some of them were shy when on their own do we know what killed him yet i asked rhys pointed to the narrow hole in the mans back knife i think i nodded but they took the blade with them why because there was something special about the knife that might give them away or they simply did not want to lose a good blade frost said he took the two steps that moved him from the big corridor to the smaller one hed been coordinating the guards who were keeping everyone away from the crime scene i had enough guards with me to close off both ends of the hallway and id done it when wed arrived the hallway had been protected by floating pots and pans courtesy of maggie may the chief cook for the unseelie court brownies can levitate objects but not themselves for some reason shed gone with doyle to see if she could get any more sense out of the scullery maid who had found the bodies the fey was having hysterics and maggie couldnt decide whether the woman had seen something that frightened her or was simply upset over the deaths doyle was going to try to find out he was hoping the woman would react to him as if he were still the queens darkness her assassin and tell him the truth out of fear and habit if she were just scared he would probably frighten her into having a fit but i let him try i could play good cop after hed played bad id sent barinthus to tell the queen what had happened because of all of the men he had the best chance of not being punished for being a bearer of such terrible news the queen did have a tendency to blame the messenger possibly rhys said just habit you use the blade you retrieve clean it and put it back in its sheath he pointed to a smear on the mans jacket he wiped the blade off i said rhys looked at me why he i shrugged youre right it could be a she i didnt hear doyle come down the hallway but i knew he was there a second before he spoke he was running when they threw the blade i actually agreed but i wanted his reasoning truthfully i wanted not to be in charge of this mess but i had the most experience that made it my baby what makes you say he was running he started to touch the mans coat and i said dont touch him he gave me a look but said you can see where his coat is raised on this side that the wound in his shirt does not line up with the coat as it lies i believe he was running then when they retrieved the knife they went through his pockets moved his coat around ill bet they didnt wear gloves most would not think about fingerprints and dna most here will be more worried that magic will find them than science i nodded exactly he saw something that scared him rhys said standing up he took off down this way to try and outrun it but what did he see what made him run there are many frightening things loose in the corridors of our sithen frost said yes i said but he was a reporter he came looking for something odd or frightening perhaps he saw the lesser feys death frost said you mean he witnessed beatrices murder i said frost nodded okay say he witnessed it he ran they threw a blade killed him i shook my head almost everyone carries a knife most of them can pin a fly to the wall with one it doesnt limit our suspect pool much but beatrices death limits it rhys gave me a look that was eloquent should this be discussed where the new guards whom we didnt entirely trust could hear us theres no reason to hide it rhys you cant kill the immortal with a knife but shes dead it needed a spell a powerful spell and only a sidhe or some few members of the sluagh could have done it the queen forbid the sluagh to be out this night simply to be seen while the reporters are in our sithen would raise suspicion the sluagh were the least human of faerie the nightmares that even the unseelie fear they are the only wild hunt that is left to us the only frightening group that can hunt the fey even the sidhe until they are caught sometimes they kill sometimes they only fetch you back for the queen the sidhe fear the sluagh and its threat was one of the reasons to fear the queen id agreed to bed the king of the sluagh to cement an alliance with them against my enemies it was not widely known in the court that i had made the bargain there were sidhe even lesser fey who would think it a perversion i thought of it as a political necessity beyond that i tried not to dwell too much on the mechanics sholto their king the lord of that which passes between was halfsidhe but the other half hadnt been even close to humanoid i shook my head i dont think a member of the sluagh could have hidden themselves enough to wander about the sithen tonight not with all the spells we had on the corridors to keep everyone boxed into that one tiny section just as the reporter should not have been able to leave the area frost said he had a point let me say what were all thinking even the guards who dont want to think it a sidhe killed beatrice and the reporter that still leaves us with several hundred suspects rhys said the scullery maid is very frightened doyle said i cannot tell if she is afraid in general or about something specific so you scared her i said he gave a small shrug i did not do it on purpose i looked at him i did not meredith but peasblossom took it ill that the queens darkness had come she seemed to think id come to kill her why would she think the queen wanted her dead rhys asked i had an idea an awful idea because queen andais would hate it i didnt say it out loud because though the new guards knew as well as we did that a sidhe had done this they probably wouldnt be thinking what i was thinking in that moment andais had saddled me with several men i did not know and a couple who i outright didnt trust the awful thought was what if it had been prince cels people what if the maid peasblossom had seen one of cels people leaving the scene of a double homicide shed never believe that the queen would want her to tell anyone the trouble was that i couldnt see what cel or anyone serving his interests would gain from killing beatrice the reporter seemed accidental just in the wrong place at the wrong time youve thought of something rhys said later i said and let my eyes flick to the backs of the men just a foot away from us yes doyle said yes we do need some privacy we should hide the body said one of the men at our backs amatheons hair in its tight coppery red french braids left his face bare but nothing could leave it unadorned for his eyes were layered petals of red blue yellow and green like some multicolored flower it often made me a little dizzy to meet his gaze as if my own eyes rebelled at the sight of him gazing out at the world with flowerpetal eyes his face was squarejawed but slender so that he managed to be both strongly masculine and vaguely delicate at the same time almost as if his face like his eyes couldnt quite decide what it wanted to be the reporter will be missed amatheon i said we cant just hide his body and hope this will all go away why can we not why can we not simply say we dont know where he has gone or that one of the lesser fey saw him leave the sithen those are all lies rhys said the sidhe dont lie or did you forget that in all those years you hung around with cel amatheons face clouded with the beginnings of anger but he fought it off what i did or did not do with prince cel is not your business but i know that the queen would want to hide this from the press to have a human reporter killed in our court will ruin all the good publicity she has managed to acquire for us in the last few decades he was probably right on that last part the queen would not want to admit what had happened if she even suspected that i suspected that one of cels people was responsible shed want to hide it even deeper she loved cel too much and always had the fact that amatheon had suggested disposing of the body made me wonder even more if cels interests were somehow behind this amatheon had always been one of cels supporters cel was the last pureblood sidhe of a house that had ruled this court for three thousand years amatheon was one of the sidhe who thought me a mongrel and a disgrace to the throne so why was he here to compete to bed me and make me queen because queen andais had ordered it when he refused the honor she made certain that he got her point her painful point that she was ruler here not cel and amatheon would do as he was told or else part of the or else had been to cut his kneelength hair to his shoulders still long by human standards but a mark of great shame for him shed done other things to him things more painful to his body than to his pride but he hadnt shared details and i didnt really want to know if beatrice were the only one dead then i might agree i said but a human is dead in our land we cant hide that yes he said we can you havent dealt with the press as directly as i have amatheon was this reporter alone when he came here to the sithen or was he part of a group that will miss him right away even if he came alone he will be known to other members of the press if one of us had killed him out in the human world we might be able to hide who did it and let it be just another unsolved crime but he was killed here on our land and that we cannot hide you sound as if you are going to tell the press of his death i looked away from his confusing eyes he reached out to touch my arm but frost simply moved in the way and he never completed the gesture you will announce it to the press he sounded astonished no but we have to contact the police meredith doyle started to say i cut him off no doyle he was stabbed with a knife well never figure out whose blade did it but a good forensics team might there are spells for tracing a wound to the weapon that made it doyle said yes and you tried those spells when you found my fathers body in the meadow you did your spells yet you never found the weapons that killed him i did my best to make those words empty to have nothing in my head with them my fathers death like the capital of spain just a fact nothing more doyle drew a deep breath i failed prince essus that day princess meredith and you you failed because it was sidhe that killed him it was someone who had enough magic to thwart your spells dont you see doyle whoever did this is as good at magic as we are but they wont know modern forensics they wont be able to protect themselves against science onilwyn stepped away from the guards he was blockier than any of the other sidhe tall but stocky and yet he always moved with grace as if hed borrowed his movements from someone more slender his hair fell in a long wavy ponytail over the back of his black suit and white shirt black the queens color and prince cels color a very popular color here at the unseelie court his hair was a green so dark it had black highlights his eyes were pale green with a starburst in the center around his pupil you cannot mean to bring human warriors into our land if you mean human policeman yes that is exactly what i mean to do you will open us up to that over the death of one human and the death of a cook do you think the death of a human is less important than the death of a sidhe i looked him straight in the face and was happy to see that he realized his faux pas i watched him remember that i was part human what is one death even two over the damage it will do to our court in the eyes of the world he tried to recover and it wasnt a bad job of it do you think the death of a cook is less important than the death of a nobleman i asked ignoring his attempt to fix things he smiled then and it was arrogant and so very onilwyn of course i believe that the life of a nobleborn sidhe is worth more than the life of a servant or a human so would you if you were pure sidhe then im glad that im not pure sidhe i said i was angry now and i fought not to have it translate to power not to start to glow and raise the stakes of this fight this servant whose name happens to be beatrice showed me more kindness than most of the nobles of either faerie court beatrice was my friend and if you have nothing more helpful to add than class prejudice then im sure that queen andais can find a use for you back among her guards his skin went from pale whitish green to just white i felt a swift burst of satisfaction at his fear andais had given him to me to bed and if i didnt bed him he would suffer so would i but in that moment i wasnt sure i cared how was i to know she meant anything to you princess meredith consider this my only warning to you onilwyni raised my voice so that it carried down the hallwayand for the rest of you who dont know me onilwyn assumed that the death of a servant meant nothing to me some of the men at the far end turned and looked at me i spent a great deal of time with the lesser fey while i was at court most of my friends here were not among the sidhe you made it plain that i was not pureblooded enough for most of you you have only yourselves to blame then that my attitude is a little more democratic than usual for a noble think upon that before you say something as foolish to me as onilwyn just did i turned back to the guard in question and let my voice go lower bear all that in mind onilwyn before you open your mouth again and say something else equally stupid he actually dropped to one knee and bowed his head though i think that was to hide the anger on his face as my princess bids so i do get up and go stand somewhere farther away from me doyle told him to go to the other end of the hallway and he went without another word though the starbursts in his eyes were glittering with his rage i do not agree with onilwyn amatheon said not completely but are you truly going to bring in the human police i nodded the queen will not like it no she wont why would you risk her anger princess he seemed to be truly puzzled by that i would not risk her anger again for anything or anyone not even my honor he had been one of the sidhe who had made my childhood hellish but lately id seen another side to amatheon a side that was frightened and vulnerable and helpless i always had trouble hating people who showed me they could feel pain too beatrice was my friend but more than that she was one of my people to rule a people is to protect them i want whoever did this i want them caught and i want them punished i want to stop them from doing it to anyone else the reporter was our guest and to kill him like this is an insult to the honor of the court itself you dont care about the honor of the court he said and i watched him struggle to understand me no not really he swallowed hard enough for me to hear it there is no ones death that i fear not even my own enough to bring the human policemen down into our home why do you fear the police i do not fear them i fear the queens anger at inviting them in no one gets to kill people i have sworn to protect amatheon no one you are not sworn not yet you have taken no oath for this court you sit on no throne if i do not do my utmost to solve these deaths to protect everyone in this sithen from greatest to least then i do not deserve to sit on any throne you are mad he said and his eyes were very wide the queen will kill you for this i glanced back at beatrices body and i thought of another body so many years ago the only reason she hadnt hidden my fathers body from the press is that they found him first miles away from the faerie mounds cut to pieces they found him and took pictures of him not only were his bodyguards too late to save his life they were too late to save his dignity or my horror the police had done some investigating because he was killed off our lands but no one had helped them they had not been allowed inside any of the faerie mounds they had been forbidden to question anyone they had been stopped before they began because the queen was convinced we would find who had done this terrible thing but we never did i will remind my aunt what she said when my father her brother was murdered what did she say he asked it was doyle who answered that we would find who had killed prince essus that the humans would only hinder us in our search i looked at him and he met my gaze this time i will say to her that the humans have things the sidhe cannot hide from that the only reason to keep the police out is if she does not want these murders solved merry rhys said id put it a different away if i were telling her he looked a little pale himself i shook my head but you arent princess rhys i am he smiled still pale i dont know i think id look cute in a tiara i laughed i couldnt help it i hugged him then youd look adorable he hugged me back you will discuss this with the queen before telling the press or contacting the police right yes and just the police were going to try to get the press out of here first he hugged me tighter thank the consort i drew back from the hug and said im determined rhys not suicidal youre hoping she loved her brother enough to feel guilty amatheon said and the fact that hed grasped that made me think better of him something like that i said she cares for no one except prince cel he said i thought about that you might be right or you might be wrong will you wager your life on that he asked not wager no but ill risk it are you so certain that you are right about the queen no but i am right about what we need to do to find our murderer i am right about that and im willing to tell the queen so he shuddered i would rather stay here and guard the hallway if you do not mind i dont want anyone with me whos more afraid of the queen than of doing whats right oh hell merry then none of us can come rhys said i looked at him he shrugged all of us fear her but i will go with you frost said and me galen said do you need to ask doyle said it was adair who finally spoke for most of them i think this is foolishness though honorable foolishness but it does not matter you are our ameraudur and that is a title that i have not let pass my lips for many years ameraudur meant a war leader who was chosen for love not bloodline ameraudur meant that the man who called you this would give his own life before he saw yours fail it was the word that the welsh had used for arthur yes that arthur it was the term that some of my fathers men had used for him i didnt know what to say because i hadnt done enough to deserve the title not yet i havent earned such a title from you adair or from anyone do not call me so you offered yourself in our place last night princess you took the might of the queen herself upon your mortal body seeing you draw magic against her was one of the bravest things ever i saw my oath on that i didnt know whether to be embarrassed or try to explain that it wasnt brave that id been afraid the whole time you are our ameraudur and we will follow you wherever you may lead to whatever end i will die before i let another harm you you cant mean that amatheon said i agreed with amatheon do not give your oath to keep me from harm adair please if you must give your oath to save my life but not all harm but it was as if i wasnt there for him or for amatheon in that moment i was the object of the conversation but that was all she saved us last night adair said she saved us all she risked her life to save ours how can you stand there and not give her your oath a man without honor has no oath to give amatheon said adair put his mailed hand on the others shoulder then come with us to the queen regain your honor rediscover your oath she took my courage with the rest i am too afraid to go before her with such news a single tear glittered down his cheek i looked at the despair in his eyes and said the only thing i could think of i will try for guilt to allow this her guilt over never solving her own brothers murder but if guilt wont work then i will remind her that she owes me the life of her consort and her pet human it is not always wise to remind the queen she owes you a debt doyle said no but i want her to say yes doyle if she says no then its no and i need it to be yes he touched my face i see in your eyes a haunting i see in your eyes your fathers death like a weight of injustice on your heart i closed my eyes and let my cheek rest against the warmth of his hand his hand was worn from centuries of sword and knife practice it made his hand seem more real more solid more able to protect some sidhe those pure enough that they couldnt get calluses thought it a sign of impurity racist bastards with doyle touching me i could let myself remember that awful day its funny how your mind protects you i saw the bloody sheet and the stretcher i held my fathers hand cold but not stiff not yet i had his blood on my hands from touching him but it wasnt him it was just cool flesh that feeling of terrible emptiness when i touched him was like going into a house that you thought would be full of people you loved only to find it empty and even the furniture taken you walk from room to room hearing your footsteps echo on the naked floors your voice bounces back from the empty walls where the lines of beloved photos still show like the line around a body at a crime scene he was gone my tall handsome amazing father he was supposed to have been immortal but there are spells to steal even the life of a god a onceuponatime god if i poke at the memory of that day too hard try to make myself remember too much it isnt my fathers body or blood that i remember it is his sword one of his guards laid it in my hands the way you lay a flag at a military funeral the hilt was gold inlaid carved with a tree on either side cranes danced around the tree and sometimes there were tiny carved bodies hanging from the branches of that tree bleeding across the gold literally the little sacrificed people could bleed onto the sword hilt the sword hilt was bare that day cool to my hands the branches of the trees empty of little sacrifices because the biggest of all had already been made the hilt was leather set with gold and i spent much of that day with my face pressed to it i breathed in the scent of good leather the oil that hed used to clean the sword and over all that was the scent of him he had carried that sheath next to his body for centuries and the leather had absorbed the smell of his skin i could touch the hilt and feel where even this magical metal had shaped to the constant use of his hand i had slept with that sword for days huddled around it as if i could still feel his hand on it his body near it i swore on the hilt of my fathers sword that i would avenge his death id been seventeen you cannot die of grief though it feels as if you can a heart does not actually break though sometimes your chest aches as if it is breaking grief dims with time it is the way of things there comes a day when you smile again and you feel like a traitor how dare i feel happy how dare i be glad in a world where my father is no more and then you cry fresh tears because you do not miss him as much as you once did and giving up your grief is another kind of death i was thirtythree now sixteen years had passed since i slept beside my dead fathers sword the sword had simply vanished about a month after his death it had gone the way of so many of our great relics as if without essus his sword could find no hand fit to wield it so the sword chose to fade and vanish into the mists perhaps the great relics do not choose to go perhaps goddess calls them home when they have done their work or perhaps she calls them home until someone comes again that is fit or suited for them i felt that small swell of warmth and comfort that was the voice of the goddess that tiny quiet voice that lets you know youve thought a smart thing or asked the right question i would try to use guilt to get andais to agree to allow me to call in the police i did not have much faith in her ability to be emotionally blackmailed but she still did not know that one of the greatest relics of the faerie courts had returned the chalice the one that mankinds wishes had changed from a cauldron of plenty into a golden cup had returned from wherever it had been it had come to me in a dream and when i woke it was real the chalice had been one of the great treasures of the seelie court and one reason to keep its reappearance a secret was that the seelie might try to reclaim it the chalice went where it would and definitely had a mind of its own i was almost certain that it would not stay at the seelie court even if we allowed them to take it back and if it kept disappearing there and reappearing here the seelie would think wed stolen it or at least accuse us of it because if the chalice simply found them unworthy that was not something that king taranis would ever admit no my uncle would blame us but never himself and his shining throng if guilt and family connections could not sway the queen then perhaps the knowledge that the chalice had come to my hand would i still hoped someday to know who had killed my father but the case was cold sixteen years cold for beatrice and the reporter though the case was literally still warm the crime scene was fresh the suspect list wasnt endless rhys said a few hundred as if that was a lot id helped the police in a few cases where almost the entire population of los angeles had been suspects what was a few hundred to that we could do this if we brought in modern police work we could get them they wouldnt be expecting it and they wouldnt know how to protect themselves against it it would work all right i was percent certain it would work only a fool is percent certain when it comes to murder either about committing one or solving one both can be equally dangerous and hazardous to your health chapter the queen stood in the middle of her room wrapped only in a fur and her own long black hair one bare slender shoulder and the curve of her neck showed white and perfect above the ruffled grey of the fur i would have said the fur was wolf but no wolf that walked the earth today was ever so huge she made certain that we all had a good view before she turned her head and looked full at us charcoal storm grey and the pale whitish grey of a winters sky were the colors of her eyes in three perfect circles of color around her pupil those same colors spread through the fur framed her face and made her eyes look bigger than i knew they were richer in color it took me a moment of staring into those eyes to realize she had some eyeliner helping to emphasize all that grey and black and white elegance it occurred to me for the first time that i could do with glamour what she had to do with makeup i had never seen the queen do small personal glamour i wondered if she could or had she lost that power along with so many others i kept my face very still empty of my speculation i was about to be in enough trouble without questioning her magical abilities oh yes that would have guaranteed some very special aunt and niece bonding time or should i say some very painful bondage time i liked pain but not nearly as much as aunt andais did well meredith i see that you have brought more trouble upon us i opened my mouth to begin the speech id prepared in my head as we walked down the hallway now i swallowed the words because if she planned on blaming me for the deaths even indirectly i was sunk not only would i not be having the police to help me solve the crime i would most likely be bleeding before i left this room there is a saying in the unseelie court you visit the queen at your peril what sense of misguided justice had made me forget that i dropped to one knee and my guards followed my lead dropping like graceful dangerous flowers around me doyle and frost were with me but wed left rhys in charge of the scene he would have come but after me hed done the most actual detective work in los angeles adair had come and hawthorne in their colored armor galen of course he would never have let me walk into such danger without him usna had surprised me and i think doyle by insisting that he come with us it wasnt that we doubted his braveryhe often took foolish chances just to amuse himself i think it had something to do with the fact that his mother had been transformed into a cat when she had him and his father was well a cat it gave usna a very unique perspective he was every inch a sidhe male except that his long hair and pale body were decorated with large patches of red and black like a calico cat id left nicca behind because his beautiful new wings looked so fragile i could not bear to see her shred them as some punishment to me the moment i realized that that was why id left him behind i knew that i had halfexpected her to find a way to be angry with me about all this she had to be angry with someone and id always been a favorite target when i was younger but only when my father was not at court never when he was close enough to interfere after his death things had been worse in so many ways answer me meredith the queen said but her voice didnt sound angry she sounded tired i am not certain how to answer you aunt andais i am not aware that i did anything to bring on the deaths of beatrice and the reporter beatrice she said and she started walking toward me toward us her pale feet were bare except for the silvergrey polish on her toes her legs were long and slender where they pulled free of the fur she had no thighs to speak of the sidhe women are the perfect models for this era they have no curves and its not due to dieting the sidhe do not have to diet they are simply supernaturally thin even for a sidhe woman andais is tall six feet as tall as most of her own guards she stood with all that height over me leaving one leg artfully bare and bent so that the line from upper thigh to toe was graceful and framed by the charcoal grey of fur who is beatrice i would like to have thought she was toying with me but she wasnt she truly did not know the name of her own pastry chef she knew her head cook maggie may but beyond that i doubted she knew any of the kitchen staff she was queen and there were layers of servants and lesser fey between her and someone like beatrice if i had not been here to say her name no one else would have known it that made me angry i fought to keep it from my voice as i answered the fey that was killed your pastry chef her name was beatrice my pastry chef i have no pastry chef her voice was thick with scorn i sighed the unseelie courts pastry chef then she turned and whirled the fur around her like a lightweight cloak it would have been so heavy i would not have had the strength to move it like that i was stronger than a human but i was not as strong as pureblooded sidhe i wondered if shed done that little movement to remind me of that or just because it looked pretty she spoke with her back to us but all that belongs to the unseelie court belongs to me meredith or did you forget that i realized that she was trying to pick a fight with me shed never done that before shed struck out in anger with someone else or with me shed tormented me because it pleased her she argued with me if i disagreed with her or argued first but she had never tried to start a fight with me i didnt know what to do i have not forgotten that you my aunt are queen of the unseelie court yes meredith remind me that i am your aunt remind me that i need your blood to keep my family on the throne i didnt like the way she worded that but it hadnt been a question so i didnt try to answer i stayed kneeling and mute if you had been strong enough to protect yourself yesterday there would not have been reporters in my sithen there was the first warm edge of anger in her voice it was my duty to keep the princess safe doyle said i reached out to him with my good arm before i could stop myself but he was just out of reach i shook my head do not bring her anger upon yourself i tried to tell him with my eyes our duty frost said from the other side of me i looked at him and gave him exasperated eyes if she was determined to be angry i did not want that anger to fall upon them both it wasnt just that i loved them i needed them if we had any hope of solving this mess and keeping me alive despite some very determined enemies i needed my captain of the guard and his lieutenant she was suddenly in front of me again and i hadnt seen her move either she had clouded my mind or she was simply that fast even tugging along that much fur she knelt in front of me in a pool of fur and glimpses of white flesh you have stolen my darkness from me meredith you have thawed the heart of my killing frost my two best warriors taken away as if by a thief in the night i licked suddenly dry lips and said i did not mean to take anything that you valued aunt andais she touched my face gently it made me wince not because it hurt but because id feared it would hurt yes meredith remind me that i neglected my darkness and my frost she caressed my face with her fingers and the back of her hand neglected so many things that were mine her hand cupped my chin and began to squeeze she could crush the bones of my body into splinters i can feel the glamour girl drop it let me see what you are hiding i dropped the glamour on me and on frost so that the lipstick smeared across our faces she raised me to my feet using my chin as a handle it hurt and it would probably bruise she raised me faster than i could stand only her harsh grip kept me from falling the men stood with me i did not bid you stand she yelled at them they stayed on their feet i could not look away from her to see exactly what they were doing but this was about to go badly barinthuss deep voice came from farther into the room he must have been standing there the entire time and i hadnt seen him it takes a commanding presence to make you not see a sevenfoottall mostly blue demigod andais was that commanding presence with her hand bruising my chin forcing me to meet her grey gaze from inches away she was more than commanding she was frightening queen andais meredith has done nothing but as you have bid her silence kingmaker she had glanced back at him when she yelled and i realized that she must have made him kneel because i could not see him in that part of the room she turned back to me and her eyes shone as if there was light behind them it was like watching the moon behind grey clouds pushing light up through the colors of her eyes but the eyes themselves did not truly glow it was an effect i had never seen in any other sidhes eyes then what is this smear of red on her mouth and on the face of my killing frost she let the fur shed wrapped herself in fall to the floor as she put her thumb against my mouth and rubbed hard enough that i had to fight not to make a small pain sound there was still enough lipstick left to stain her white thumb she stood there nude and pale and frightening if she was beautiful i could not see it andais often stripped before she tortured people so she wouldnt ruin her clothes her nudity did not bode well i finally realized that she intended to get angry about me playing favorites in front of the media she was going to throw a fit and punish me for kissing frost instead of dealing with the murders displacement is a fine coping mechanism but this was not sane no logic would save me all the arguments that i had prepared were dust before her incomprehensible anger do you think that i give orders simply to be ignored i spoke carefully around her grip on my chin i had to distract the cameras she let me go so abruptly that i stumbled doyle caught my arm then took me into the circle of his arm putting me farther from her and closer to the middle of the men i couldnt argue with the precaution she was not acting like herself andais was temperamental and a sadist but she never let either interfere this badly with the business of her court we had a dead human reporter and cameras still in the faerie mound it was an emergency and we needed to act swiftly to minimize the damage no matter what choice we made even if the choice was to hide the bodies and act as if it hadnt happened it needed to be done quickly the more people who knew the secret the less chance of keeping it if the police were going to bring in forensics for the crime scene every minute contaminated the crime scene every second might be losing us some clue madeline told me that our frost had lost control in front of the cameras she paced a tight circle then turned back to look at frost it was as if any target any problem was better than addressing the murders did she think cels people had done this was that why she didnt want to decide on a course of action was she afraid to find the truth afraid of where it would lead are the reporters gone then i asked softly they were about to file out all nice and neat she said and her voice was rising as she spoke and paced naked and dangerous until one group realized they were missing a photographer a photographer she screamed the last word how did he break through the spells that were supposed to make it impossible for him to leave the guarded areas she didnt seem to be asking anyone in particular so no one answered was there a camera found she asked and her voice was almost normal yes my queen doyle said would it have pictures of the crime perhaps doyle said well need to send the film out to be developed i said have we no one of faerie who could do it for us no my queen what else did you find on this reporter we havent searched the body thoroughly i said why have you not searched the body thoroughly she asked and the edge of near hysterical anger shadowed the last word i swallowed and let my breath out slowly it was now or never doyles hand squeezed my arm as if he was saying dont but if i were ever to be queen andais would have to step down for me she was immortal and i was not so she would always be a presence in the court i had to get some control between her and me now or i would never truly be queen never truly be safe from her anger there are clues on the body that a scientific team could find the less we touch it the better the science will work what are you babbling about meredith doyle squeezed my arm tighter do you remember what you said when my father was killed she stopped her pacing and looked at me her eyes were wary i said many things when essus died you said we were not to allow the human police inside the faerie mounds that no one was to talk to them or answer their questions because we would find the assassins with magic she stood very still and gave me unfriendly eyes but she answered i remember those words we failed with magic because the assassins were as good or better at magic than those who bespelled the wounds and the body she nodded i have long thought that among my smiling court my toadie nobles the murderer of my brother sits i know that meredith and it is a small constant torment that that death went unpunished as it is for me i said i want to solve these murders aunt andais i want the person or persons responsible caught and punished i want to show the media that there is justice in the unseelie court and we are not afraid of new knowledge and new ways you are babbling again she said crossing her arms under her tight firm breasts i want to contact the police and bring in a forensic team a what scientists who specialize in helping the police solve crimes in the human world she was shaking her head i do not want the human police tramping through here nor do i but a few policemen and a few scientists just a few just enough to gather evidence all the sidhe are royal titled they all have diplomatic immunity so technically we can dictate to an extent how much police involvement we allow and you think this will catch whoever did this i do i stepped a little away from doyle so i wasnt huddling against him whoever did this is worried about magic tracking them down but it will never occur to them that we would use forensic science inside the land of faerie they will not have protected against it and in fact they cant protect against it not completely what do you mean by that we even the sidhe shed skin cells hairs saliva all of it can be used to trace back to the person science can use a smaller piece than is needed for a spell not a lock of hair but the root of a hair not a pound of flesh but an invisible fleck of it you are certain that it will work certain that if i allow this intrusion this invasion of our privacy human science will solve this crime i licked my lips i am certain if there is evidence to find they will find it if she said and she started pacing the room again but slowly quietly this time if means you are not certain if means dear niece that you may bring all this upon us and the murderer may go free if we bring in the police and they do not solve the reporters death it will undo all the good publicity i have acquired for us in the last two decades i think it will work but either way the media will be impressed with your willingness to allow the modern police into your faerie mound no one has ever done that not even at the golden court she glanced back at me but she was moving slowly toward barinthus he was indeed kneeling at the foot of her bed on a black fur rug you think we will gain media points over taranis and his shining people i think this will show that we meant no harm to anyone and that such things are not tolerated among the unseelie contrary to all those centuries of dark talk she stood in front of barinthus now but still spoke to me you truly believe that the media will forgive us allowing one of their own to be murdered simply because we invite in the police i think some of them would slaughter their own photographers on altars with incense and prayers to get a chance at covering this story clever meredith very clever she turned to barinthus then she stroked her hand down the side of his face like youd touch a lover though i knew she had never taken him to her bed why did you never try to make a king of my son unless barinthus and the queen had been having a very different conversation the question seemed out of nowhere you do not want me to answer that question queen andais he said in his deep sighing voice yes she said still stroking his face yes i do you will not like it i have not liked many things of late answer the question kingmaker i know that if my brother essus had been willing you would have had him kill me and put himself on the throne but he would not slay his own sister he would not have that sin on his heart still you thought he would be a better king than i a queen didnt you dangerous questions barinthus said again you do not want the truth my queen i know the truth of that question ive known that for centuries but i do not know why you never looked to cel he approached you after essus died he offered to help you slay me if you would help put him on the throne early i think all of us across the room held our breaths in that moment i had not known this the looks on everyones faces around me said that most of them had not either only adair and hawthorne behind their helmets were still hidden from their surprise i warned you of his treachery barinthus said yes and i had you tortured for it i remember my queen her smile did not match her words but then neither did the constant caressing of his face and shoulders when meredith came of age you turned to her if she had had the magic she now possesses since her stay in the lands to the west you would have offered her what you offered essus wouldnt you you know the answer my queen yes she said i do but cel always had the power to be king why did you not put him on the throne why did you foster a halfbreed mongrel of a princess over my puresidhe son do not ask me this he said she slapped him twice hard enough to stagger him even on his knees hard enough to have blood spill from his mouth i am your queen damn you and you will answer my question answer me the last was screamed into his face barinthus answered her blood flowing from his mouth you are a better queen than cel will ever be a king and what of meredith what of my brothers child she will be a good queen a better queen than cel a king yes he said and that one word dropped into the silence of the room like a stone thrown down a great height you know it will make a sound but only after a very very long fall the sound came with her words meredith you will do nothing with barinthus that will chance you being pregnant by him nothing is that clear yes my voice sounded strained and hoarse as if id been the one screaming contact the police do what you think best i will announce to the court and the media that you are in charge of this little problem do not bother me with it again do not report to me unless i ask it now go all of you get out we went all of us even barinthus we went and were grateful to go chapter i called major walters of the st louis police department who had been in charge of our security at the airport the day before i called from the only land line phone in the unseelie sithen the phone was in the queens office which always looked to me like a black and silver version of louis the fourteenths office if he had liked going to goth dance clubs for the dissipated rich it was elegant dark expensive and exciting in that chillupyourspine way modern but with a feel of the antique nouveau riche done right it was also a little claustrophobic to me too many shades of black and grey in too small a space as if a goth curtain salesman had persuaded them to cover every inch of the room with his wares the phone was white and always looked like bones on the secretarys black desk or maybe thats just me projecting i did not understand the mood of the queen tonight id asked barinthus as we walked to the office if shed given him any clues as to why she was behaving so oddly and hed said no no clues why was i calling the st louis police when the faerie lands are technically in illinois because major walters was the current police liaison for the lands of faerie and the human police once upon a time a few hundred years ago thered been an entire police unit assigned to us why because not everyone in america agreed with president jeffersons decision to bring the fey to this country the local people who were going to be close to us were especially upset they didnt want monsters of the unseelie court coming to live in their state at that time st louis was the closest major city with a working police department so even though we were technically located in illinois police problems had been sent to missouri and st louis they got the joyous duty of protecting us from the angry humans and also walking the perimeters of our lands so we couldnt sneak out and wreak havoc if the courts of faerie hadnt come with a sizable bribe for several different branches of government and certain powerful individuals we might have never made it into this country no one wanted to mess with either court after the last great humanfey war in europe wed shown ourselves entirely too powerful for comfort what no one really understood about usfrom jefferson on down to the yelling mobwas that a line of human police wasnt really going to keep the fey any fey from leaving the area what kept them inside and behaving themselves were threats and oaths to and from their respective kings and queens but the police did keep the humans from harassing us gradually when nothing bad happened the police presence was reduced until they left altogether and we only called on them when they were needed as the local humans realized that we mostly wanted to be left alone we had to call on our private police less and less soon the police assigned to us had other jobs in other areas of the police force until they were needed for faerie duty as it came to be called come up to present day and the unit had become a single detective or officer the last time hed been used was my fathers death but since that had been on governmentowned farmland the locals had been cut out twice once by the feds and once by us all right by the queen id have taken a platoon of soldiers into the mounds if i thought they could have caught my fathers killers after the liaison was so ineffective with my fathers murder i thought the post had been abandoned but id been wrong doyle had found out that major walters was still our liaison the last remnants of a unit created by thomas jefferson himself wed also never had anyone as high a rank as major in the job major walters had volunteered for the job because the last person to have it had also done our security at press conferences and that had landed walters predecessor a large salary as chief of a big corporations security executives like to be guarded by someone whos guarded royalty it adds a certain panache to the résumé doyle had even learned that walters had a very well paying job lined up i wondered how the big corporation felt about walters after yesterday it looks great on your résumé to guard royalty but not so great to let them get injured on your watch nope probably the executives would be a little nervous about being guarded by someone who let princess meredith get shot at by one of his own officers humans believed in magic but not as an excuse for screwing up no they liked to blame someone not something walters would be needing to recoup hed need to redeem himself in the public eye though my guards and i knew that hed had no chance to prevent what had happened the humans wouldnt accept it the major had been in charge hed take the fall it was simply how they thought christine my aunts secretary was petite wellendowed and more plump than was the fashion in her day shed been perfect her blond hair curled over her shoulders and her youthful face was eternally beautiful one of our noblemen had lured her away centuries ago but hed grown tired of her to stay in faerie she needed to be useful so she learned shorthand and computer skills she was probably one of the most technologically savvy people in either court she suggested that we call the bureau of human and fey affairs logical i suppose but they were more useful for social difficulties or diplomatic problems if you want something done dont call a politician or a bureaucrat call a cop i took a deep breath said a little prayer to the goddess and dialed the number the secretary had given me he answered on the second ring your highness he said he must have had caller id not exactly i said princess meredith actually his first words had been professional his next held the hint of suspicion princess to what do i owe this honor in fact he sounded positively hostile you sound angry at me major walters the newspapers say you dont trust my men to keep you safe that human cops arent good enough for your guard detail i hadnt expected him to be so blunt he was more cop than politician i can only say that i never even hinted to the media that i doubted your men then why were we barred from the second press conference hmm that was a sticky wicket you and i both know that it was a spell that made your officer shoot at me correct yeah our unit psychic found the magical remnants on him im safer here in the sithen but your officers wont be someone did a spell in a building of metal girders and beams with technology all over the place put that same spell caster inside the sithen inside faerie with no damper of metal and technology on them and your officers would be in even greater danger of being bespelled what about the human reporters arent they in danger of being bespelled they arent armed i said they cant do that much damage so we just arent up to your standards is that it he was angry and i wasnt sure why the queens secretary must have caught enough of the conversation to give me a hint she flashed the headline of the st louis post dispatch police fail to protect the princess oh major walters ive just been shown a newspaper my apologies for not understanding the effect this situation was having on your life i was a little too preoccupied with my own being in danger i dont need your apologies princess i need my men to be good enough to protect you at public events how much crap are you getting about what happened are they trying to scapegoat you thats not your business he said which was almost as good as a yes i think we can help each other major how you sitting down yeah and that one word was not happy i told him the briefest version i knew about the reporter and beatrice and that the queen had given it to me to clean up there was utter silence on the other end of the phone for so long that i finally said major you still there im here he said in a hoarse voice im sorry that being on faerie duty has just gotten so horribly complicated im sorry that it is screwing with your plans what do you know about my plans i know you want to be chief of security at a certain place of business when you retire early next year i know you took the job as liaison to us for your résumé i know that letting me get shot at probably didnt win you any points at your soontobe new job you know a damn lot for a princess i let that go not sure if it was compliment or insult but what if i show plainly that i have utter confidence in you major walters what do you want from me the suspicion was thick enough to walk on i want a crime scene unit down here ive got the crime scene itself isolated but i need science not magic on this one didnt you just lecture me about my men being in danger from enchantments if we came into your place yes thats why i want only you the csu and maybe one or two others tops my guards can protect you individually from magic if you are a small enough group the entire department is being crucified in the press especially the st louis press i know that now lets show them that princess meredith and her guards dont believe all that bad press i do have confidence in you major walters you and a good forensic unit how about it major do you want to play or do i leave you out of this i can pretend i didnt call and just start with the chief of police why didnt you start with him walters asked because youre my police liaison i respect that title youre who im supposed to call besides youre almost more motivated than i am to solve this case what makes you say that dont be naïve major walters the department is taking heat theyll hang someone for it and it will most likely be you let me show the department that you still have my trust and theyll back off theyll be desperate to solve this second violent episode and have someone to punish theyll fall all over themselves to give you anything i ask for you seem to know how it works politics is politics major and i was raised in the thick of it i sat on the edge of the desk and tried to get my shoulder to loosen up the injured muscles had tightened sometime during the interview with the queen funny that but now my arm ached and that wasnt funny at all of all the things i missed with being part human not healing instantly was one of the biggest envies i had i need a cop major walters not a politician i need someone who understands that my crime scene is aging even as we speak that valuable evidence may be getting contaminated right this minute i need someone who will worry more about solving this mess than the political ramifications of it i think youre that man and now that your political star runs beside mine you are doubly motivated what makes you so sure of that what makes you think i wont cut my losses and run for the hills i thought about that and said the look in your eyes yesterday at the airport when you were angry with having to share leadership with barinthus the fact that you showed anger to me now on the phone rather than trying to toadie to me i wasnt sure with a rank as high as major but youre more cop than politician walters and if you knew how little i like politics youd know what a compliment that is you seem pretty good at politicking for someone who doesnt like the game im good at a lot of things that i dont enjoy major walters as im sure you are silence again if we dont solve this my ass is grass and no amount of confidence shown in me by you or anyone else will save it and if we solve it i said he laughed a deep chuckle then ill be the departments shining star and the executives will be climbing over themselves to give me an even bigger salary yeah are you my man or do i pretend that i didnt make this call im your man i smiled good you start making calls and get me some csu out here as soon as possible what do i tell the chief about why youre letting us into your precious faerie land he asked oh yeah he was definitely a better cop than politician explain that whoever did this has diplomatic immunity but we are allowing this investigation to happen out of our mutual desire for cooperation and justice you want the bastard who did it dont you yes i said you probably dont remember mei was just another uniform keeping the crowd backbut i saw you the day your father died they gave you his sword if id had any doubts that id called the right person that one sentence took them away out loud i said yes yes they did catching this bad guy wont catch your fathers killer that is a very insightful remark for a man ive only met twice well ive been the uniform on faerie duty off and on my mistake but it was still insightful uncomfortably so sorry sometime after weve caught this guy and if faerie princesses have drinks with lowly police majors ill tell you why i became a cop it was my turn to be insightful you lost someone and they didnt catch the bastard who did it you knew that already he sounded accusatory no i swear i didnt then that was a hell of a guess lets just say that those of us who bear a particular wound recognize it in others he made a humph sound then sort of growled yeah i guess we do what will you be doing while i make phone calls and get everyone out there ill be questioning witnesses you know itd be nice if i were there for the questioning most of the fey who may have witnessed anything are ones who almost never travel outside of faerie theyre a little shy around humans especially humans in uniforms they all remember the last great humanfey war that was almost four hundred years ago he said im aware of that ill never get used to it what how you guys look so young but you remember this country before my greatgreatgreatgrandfather took a boat here not me major im just a poor mortal girl poor my ass he said ill let you know if we learn anything thats useful from the witnesses id like to decide whats useful and whats not then hurry up major but i do not promise that any fey will talk to you i cant even promise that youll be in the room when i question everyone some of them will simply not talk to the human police then why am i coming so that when the press follow us around we can stand shoulder to shoulder and show that you are helping solve this case and bring the officer who shot at me with you why in the name of god because his career is ruined unless he gets a chance at this too wont he be a danger to you well give him a charm to help bolster his psychic shields if i think hes too fragile for the duty ill let you know and well escort him out why do you care what happens to one young uniformed cop because he could have gone his whole career and not ever had anything like this happen to him if hed only stayed away from the faeries the least we can try and do is minimize the damage ill make calls now but you puzzle me princess meredith youre almost too nice to be true he hung up i put the phone back in its cradle too nice to be true my father had taught me to be nice first because you can always be mean later but once youve been mean to someone they wont believe the nice anymore so be nice be nice until its time to stop being nice then destroy them i wondered if hed taken his own advice that summers day or if hed hesitated because someone facing him had been his friend i would have given a great deal to find the person in question and ask him chapter there was another phone call i wanted to make i looked at christines smiling pleasant face and said can you wait outside for a moment christine she blinked big blue eyes at me but took a deep breath stood up rustled out her full skirts and left without a word i couldnt tell if id offended her but then she was always hard to read that she could smile and smile through everything the queen did in front of her always made me wonder about her did she enjoy the queens little shows or did she not know what else to do with christine gone i was left with doyle barinthus and usna frost galen hawthorne and adair were at the door to make sure we werent interrupted besides the office just wasnt large enough for all of us not comfortably anyway i trusted everyone but usna i didnt know him well enough to trust him usna wait out in the hall i said he gave me a little smile but he didnt argue he just hesitated by the door do you want me to send someone else to take my place i thought about it and said galen he gave a little bow then opened the door and told galen to come in galen looked a question at me as he closed the door behind him im going to call gillett galen was shaking his head im not sure thats a good idea who is gillett barinthus asked he was one of the federal agents who investigated prince essuss murder doyle said i dont know why im surprised that you remember that but i am i said doyle looked at me and his face was unreadable dark and closed to me gillett was the most persistent of all the human investigators i nodded yes he was youve been in touch with him doyle asked more like he kept in touch with me doyle i was seventeen and he seemed to be the only one who wanted to solve my fathers murder more than he wanted to obey the queen or his superiors doyle took in a lot of air and let it out slow and galen knew of this yes galen said and it never occurred to you to tell your captain that the princess was keeping in touch with a federal officer it made merry feel better and just after essus died id have done anything to help her feel better and after that doyle asked they exchanged cards twice a year that was all doyle turned his dark gaze to me i shrugged then wished i hadnt because it hurt he sent me a card every year around the anniversary of my fathers death i sent him a yule card how did no one notice this doyle asked the queen didnt care enough about me to pay attention and you paid attention where the queen told you to you all did he rubbed his eyes with thumb and forefinger how badly does your arm hurt it aches he took in air again then let it out slow you need to rest princess youre not mad at me or galen i said youre angry with yourself for not knowing this yes he said with the tiniest edge of anger when my father died what other guard could i have trusted but galen did you not trust me barinthus said i looked at him my fathers closest friend you were almost as distraught over his death as i was barinthus i needed someone who was touched by grief but not consumed by it galen was that person for me i reached out to galen and he took my hand as if it were the most natural thing in the world if you could marry where your heart lies doyle said i fear what it would do to the court i looked at him trying to see behind his careful face i squeezed galens hand and drew him in against me once doyle would have been correct once it was galen in my heart and no other but that was before i grew up enough to understand what it would mean to be at my side it was a dangerous place to be a treacherous place to be i hugged him not because he was the only name written across my heart now but because he no longer was a part of me was saddened by that and another part of me was almost relieved i understood what my father had known decades ago for galen the title of king would be a death sentence i needed someone hard and dangerous by my side not gentle and placating i looked into doyles face as i held galen to me did doyle not know that my hearts list had grown larger and that his name was on that list the way he was acting he seemed jealous or envious or angry he was hiding his emotions so well that i couldnt decide what emotion he was hiding just that it was something strong that he didnt want to share even being able to see that much meant the darknesss legendary control was slipping im going to call gillett i turned back to the phone and since i had only one good hand i had to let go of galen he kept himself touching the back of my body his body insinuated against me he fit against me as he always had as if hed been born to be there if all id ever wanted in my bed was gentle lovemaking then galen would have been wonderful but wed had months in bed to discover that his idea of passion and mine did not match he did not understand my desire for roughness or pain or just simply being a little more forceful galen gave me pale uncomprehending eyes when i asked certain things i dialed gilletts number by heart though his number had changed over the years id always had to memorize it for fear of someone caring enough to look through any address book i might have i could have saved my worry doyles reaction had shown plainly that no one had been paying me that close attention it was a little sad and a little frustrating so much wasted effort in hiding from people who werent even looking i waited for gillettes cell phone to ring id promised him that if anyone else ever died in circumstances similar to my fathers id let him know these werent really that similar but a promise is a promise i felt half silly and half excited as if somehow just being able to make this one call would change things i was over thirty but part of me was still seventeen and wanted justice i should have known better by now he answered gillett hey i said merry yes are you all right over the years hed become protective of me as if he felt some debt to my dead father to keep me well if he only knew but i hadnt shared all the attempts on my life the endless duels that made me flee faerie for years and let everyone think i was gone for good this was the first time i had spoken to him since id resurfaced a little worse for wear but im fine i thought theyd killed you too three years ago why didnt you call because if youd spoken my real name near a darkened window the queen of air and darkness would have known the sound of our conversation would have traveled back to her it would have endangered you it would have endangered anyone he sighed over the phone and now youre princess again and looking for a husband but you didnt call up just to chat did you have you heard something a rumor that the reporters left the faerie mound but are now all gathered in the parking lot the press conference is over so why are that many national and international media types hanging around in the middle of a cornfield in illinois i told him the broad outline of the problem i can be there with a team in less than no no team ive already got a few police coming with a forensic unit you can come but you cant bring dozens of agents with you this happened inside the sithen not on federal land this time we could help you maybe or maybe there would just be more humans to get injured weve got a dead reporter thats bad enough we cant afford to have an fbi agent get killed by one of us weve talked about this for years merry dont cut me out now my fathers murder is sixteen years old it is secondary here raymond the priority is the new deaths hearing your voice now im not sure that would be the case for you you dont trust me he sounded hurt im in line to the throne now raymond the good of the court outweighs personal vengeance and what would your father say to hear that from you his daughter hed say that i had grown wise hed agree with me i was wishing i hadnt called him i realized that special agent raymond gillett was part of a childs wish i couldnt afford that kind of wishing not anymore i was suddenly tired and my arm ached from shoulder to wrist i turned and leaned against the desk half sitting on it it forced galen farther away from me and that was fine he kept his hand playing lightly on the edge of my thigh moving the skirt back and forth as he petted me it was comforting and i needed the comfort doyle was looking at me and something in his eyes softened his face i had to look away from the kindness i saw there i wasnt sure why such a look from him made my throat grow tight dont come gillett im sorry i called merry dont do this not after almost twenty years when weve solved this one if im still alive and still have the carte blanche in this area ill call you and we can talk about you coming down but only if its about my fathers death you dont think the fbi might be helpful on a double homicide i dont know what weve got here gillett if we need something fancier than the local lab can handle ill let you know and maybe ill answer the phone and maybe i wont as you like i said and i struggled not to let my voice show how tight my throat felt how hot my eyes were but think on this gillett did you start all this with a seventeenyearold child because you felt sorry for me or because you were angry that the queen cut you out of the investigation was it pity that moved you a desire for justice or simply anger youd show her youd solve the case without the queens help youd use essuss daughter to help you it wasnt like that then why are you angry with me now i shouldnt have called you but i gave you a promise a childs promise to call you if ever a similar murder happened it isnt similar in detail but whoever did it has similar magic at their call if we solve this it may get us closer to finding my fathers murderer i thought youd like to know merry im sorry its that the murder has been eating at you all these years i said yes he said ill call you if anything pertinent comes up call me if you need better forensics than the locals can give you i can get you dna results that they can only dream of i had to smile ill be sure to let major walters know that the fbi has such confidence in the locals he gave a dry little laugh im sorry if i made this harder for you i tend to get a little obsessed goodbye gillett bye merry i hung up and leaned heavier on the desk galen held me against him careful of my hurt arm why didnt you let gillett come down i raised my face and looked at him i searched that open face for some hint that he understood what had just happened his eyes were green and wide and innocent i wanted to cry needed to cry id called gillett because the murders had raised ghosts for me not real ones but those emotional pains that you think are gone for good until they just rise again to haunt you no matter how deep you bury them doyle came to me i watch you grow more worthy of being queen every day meredith every minute he touched my good arm lightly as if not sure i wanted to be touched at that moment my breath came out in a sharp cry and i threw myself against his body he held me his arms fierce and almost painful he held me while i cried because he understood some of what it had cost me to let go of childish things barinthus came up to us and put his arms around us both hugging us to him i glanced up and found tears running down his face you are more your fathers daughter in this moment than you have ever been galen hugged us from the other side so that we were warm and close but i realized in that moment that galen like gillett was a childs wish they held me and i wept crying didnt cover it i wept the last of my childhood away i was thirtythree years old it seemed a little late to be letting go of childish things but some wounds cut us so deep that they stop us stop us from letting go from growing up from seeing the truth i let them all hold me while i cried through barinthus cried too i let them hold me but part of me knew that galen and only galen didnt understand what was happening hed been my closest confidant among the guards my friend my first crush but hed asked why didnt i let gillett come i cried and let them hold me but it wasnt just my fathers loss i was mourning chapter i cleaned off the remnants of the makeup that i hadnt cried away got the lipstick that still looked like clown makeup off and even gave frost a makeup cleansing cloth so he could do his own face we were clean and neat and presentable when we started back to the crime scene i felt hollow inside as if a piece of me were missing but it didnt matter walters would be here soon with the csu team we needed to have finished the questioning of the witnesses before then in case they said something that we didnt want the human police to know i wanted justice but i also didnt want to make the bad publicity worse by sharing some dark secret with the human world doyle stopped so abruptly that i ran into him he pushed me farther back into galen and usnas suddenly waiting arms as if hed given some signal that i had not seen with doyle and adair in front and galen and usna suddenly very close on either side of me i could not see what had frightened everyone barinthus hawthorne and frost were bringing up the rear they had turned to face back down the hall as if they were worried about someone sneaking up behind us what was happening what now i couldnt even manage a drop of fear im not sure it was bravery so much as exhaustion i was simply too tired emotionally and physically to waste the adrenaline on fear in that second if wed been attacked im not sure i would have cared i tried to shake it off this feeling of desolation i called doyle what is it barinthus answered the queens ravens are in the hall blocking our way i guess being seven feet tall does give you a better view i realized then that my guard feared almost every sidhe right now they were right one of the sidhe had committed murder and i was in charge of catching the killer wonderful id just given someone else a reason to want me dead but what was one more adair moved to the center of the hallway to hide me behind his armored back as doyle moved down the hallway barinthus answered my question before id even thought it doyle is conferring with mistral mistral was the master of winds the bringer of storms and the new captain of the queens ravens hed taken doyles place when it became clear that doyle wasnt coming back to his old job whats happening galen asked and his voice held enough anxiety for both of us usna bent over me sniffing my hair you smell good keep your mind on business galen said looking up the hallway toward where doyle had gone he had a gun out held down along his leg if id been choosing between sword and gun id have made the same choice when i first came back to faerie guns were outlawed inside the mounds but after the last few attempts my aunt had decided that my guards and hers needed all the help they could get so our men could carry guns if they knew how to use them doyle and mistral had been the judge of who was competent to carry and who wasnt some guards treated guns the way others treated the idea of carrying around a poisonous snake it might be useful but what if it bit you usna had a short sword in either hand pointed both directions up and down the hallway his grey eyes which were the most ordinary thing about him physically were keeping watch but his face was pressed against the top of my head he put first one cheek than the other against my hair he was looking down each end of the hallway as he did it but he was also almost scent marking me catlike and inappropriate for the situation if hed thought like a human but it was usna and i knew that he was aware of everything in the hallway even while trying to put the scent of his skin against my hair i found it oddly comforting galen did not usna stop it a soft sound somewhere between a purr and a growl sounded from the other man you worry too much my little pixie and you dont worry enough my little kitten but galen grinned as he said it we all felt a little better for usnas teasing quiet both of you frost said from behind us they shut up looking a little sheepish but happier usna stopped trying to rub his face against my hair which meant hed done it almost more to tease galen than to tease me doyle was taking too long if something had gone horribly wrong barinthus or adair would have warned us but it was taking too long the unnatural calm was beginning to slip away from me on tiny cat paws of anxiety i had a license to carry a gun in california i also had a diplomatic waiver that pretty much covered me anywhere anytime on the basis that my life was in danger often enough that being armed was a necessity i had guns but andais wouldnt let me go into the press conference armed i was a princess princesses did not protect themselves they had others to do that for them i thought the idea archaic and shortsighted and downright ironic coming from a queen whose claim to fame had been as a goddess of battle standing there with galen and usna pressed against me with the others like a wall of flesh around me i vowed that the next time i left my room id be armed doyle returned and adair gave him room to pass then moved back to the center of the hallway like some golden wall i realized that adair was being just that a wall of flesh and metal to keep death from me hed said i was his ameraudur another echo of my fathers ghost for he had been the last ameraudur among the royals of either court to be called ameraudur held more honor than king because the men chose you and followed you through love the kind of love men have shared with one another on battlefields as far back as time can see oaths bound a guard to risk his life for his charge queen or princess but ameraudur meant he did it willingly it meant that coming back from a battle alive with his leader dead was worse than death a shame that he would never live down two of my fathers guards took their own lives for shame of letting their prince die to lay your life down for your ameraudur was the highest honor seeing adair standing there so straight so proud so ready to die made me think about my new title made me afraid of it i did not want anyone dying for me i had not earned it i was not my father and never would be i could never ride into battle with them and hope to survive how could i be their ameraudur if i could not do that doyles dark face was empty for me whatever he thought about adairs new pet name for me he was keeping it to himself his face was so empty now that the only thing i was certain of was that i wasnt in immediate danger other than that he could have worn the same expression for anything i wanted to yell at him to show me what he was feeling but he spoke before i could lose that much control the queen sent them to fetch you back when you are finished with your murder business as she worded it vague enough that they cannot fetch you immediately doyle gave a small wry smile and shook his head in truth mistral is now in charge of the crime scene what galen and i asked together did the queen rescind her offer to meredith barinthus asked are mistral and the queen now in charge of this murder no doyle said rhys thought of a different spell to search for our murderer he wished to chase this new magical clue down but needed someone to keep the crime scene safe when mistral and the others came he put them to guard the hallway that was rashly done frost said knowing rhys he got mistrals oath usna said and once you have mistrals oath you have his honor he would not break it not for all the joys of the summerlands doyle gave one sharp nod i trust mistrals honor as i do my own he looked at me and something passed over his impassive face but i couldnt decipher it months in my bed weeks in my body and i could not read the look in his eyes he has requested an audience with you princess he says that he has a message from the queen we do not have time for this frost said i agreed but i also knew that ignoring messages or messengers from the queen was not wise we left her less than an hour ago what could she want you said a deep voice behind them doyle looked a question at me and i gave a nod at a gesture from doyle adair and he parted like a curtain to reveal mistral his hair was the grey of a sky that promised rain held back from his face in a ponytail i had only a glimpse of his storm cloud grey eyes before he dropped to one knee and gave me only the back of his head it was the first time that another sidhe any sidhe had voluntarily showed me such respect i stared down at the broad sweep of his shoulders in their tight leather armor and wondered why hed done it get up mistral he shook his head sending his grey hair like a fall of water down his back barely held in check by the leather thong that held it at the nape of his neck i owe you this at the very least princess meredith i had no idea what he meant by that i looked at doyle he gave a small raise of an eyebrow a slight turn of the head his version of a shrug why do you owe me such a bow i asked he raised his head just enough so he could roll his eyes at me if i had dreamt that you would take one look from me so seriously i would have been more careful of you princess my oath on that i knew what he meant then for it had been the look of contempt on mistrals face the night before that had helped me be brave enough to confront andais when she was in the grip of an evil spell a spell that had made her slaughter her own men and be a danger to anyone near her it had been a very clever assassination ploy mistral had told me with his eyes alone that i was just another useless royal and he hated us all it wasnt the hatred but the uselessness that had moved me to action because i agreed with him in that moment i had decided that i would rather die than see them slaughtered are you so certain one glance from you was what moved me forward i meant it to be a joke but id forgotten how long it had been for some of the queens ravens since theyd had a woman joke with them he lowered his face quickly his voice uncertain and uncomfortable i am sorry princess i presumed too much my kidding had not only fallen flat but embarrassed him id had no idea my words had such power over mistral i touched his bowed head the queens ring on my right hand mark of her rulership her first gift to me and an artifact of power my fingers brushed his face a breath before the metal of the ring did he turned those stormgrey eyes up to me his lips parted as if he meant to speak but the metal touched his skin and there was no time for words i knew that our bodies still stood and knelt in the hallway inside the unseelie court i knew it because id had this happen before when the magic of the chalice and the ring combined but to mistral and me we were on the top of a hill that was crowned by a large dead tree i had seen this hill this tree in one form or another in dreams and visions mistral knelt before me with my hand cupping his cheek he put his hand over mine holding my touch against his face as he gazed around at the plain that spread out as far as the eye could see it was green and lovely but strangely empty what have you done princess not me i said he gazed up at me and there was puzzlement in his eyes i dont understand look at the tree he turned with his hand holding mine now rather than pressing it to his face the tree was a huge blackened thing its bark crumbling in the growing wind the first time id seen the tree so dead it had had a large cleft in the center this tree did not it had taken me a while to understand that the tree wasnt real or the hill neither were any place a map could get you the tree represented the goddess and the power of faerie the hill was the hill we stood at the center of the world but the center of the world changed at the thought of the gods in this moment this was the center and mistral and i stood at that center we stood hand in hand while the wind blew across the sky the wind smelled of apple blossoms and rosessweet and clean and good i heard a voice on the flowerscented wind or perhaps it was merely a thought mistral did not seem to hear it so perhaps the voice was only for me kiss him the wind said kiss him let him taste the chalice but the chalice is not here i thought the wind said you are the chalice oh of course it made perfect sense in that moment though i knew that later it might not make any sense at all mistral i said and the wind grew stronger sweeter at the sound of his name he looked at me and there was a hint of fear in his eyes had it really been that long since he was touched by the goddess yes the voice in my head said it had kiss me mistral i said his gaze searched my face who are you i am merry he shook his head even as he let me draw him in against my body i realized that my arm was not injured in this place of dream and vision i slid my arms around the smooth strength of his back over the leather of his armor his hands slid around my waist but he was still shaking his head no you are not the princess i am but i am more that is true my voice had taken on that echoing softness that id heard before like listening to someone elses voice in your own ears what are you he whispered drink of the chalice mistral the flowerscented wind wrapped around us like invisible arms binding us until our bodies were pressed as close together as we could manage with clothes on he held me but he was afraid and fear is not a good aphrodisiac for most people the queen has never understood that his face bent toward me but his body was tense and he tried not to bend closer the wind pushed at him forced his head downward i understood in that moment that he was once the master of the winds bringer of storms once he had controlled it all as a man controls a horse but now mistral was the horse who was being ridden and he didnt like it mistral fought against the push of the sweet wind he fought to move his body away from mine but the wind was like chains and the best he could do with all that strength was keep his mouth just above mine keep himself just out of reach why do you fight when this is what you want the voice said using my lips you cannot be the chalice you cannot be the goddess she cast us out long ago if i am not real then you cannot kiss me you cannot be real you were always my doubting thomas mistral kiss me kiss me and discover the truth whether your doubts are real or whether i am real the wind pressed so tightly that it was hard to breathe kiss me the voice came from my mouth and echoed through the wind and the drowning scent of blossoms his mouth touched mine and the moment it did he stopped fighting he gave himself to the kiss with his lips his mouth his arms his body the wind was only wind again but mistral did not notice he picked me up in his strong arms his hands pressing me against his body one hand gripped my ass an almost crushing grip that brought a small sound from my mouth that sound seemed to urge him on the kiss had been thorough before but it had had a certain gentleness to it now he kissed me as if he would climb into my body through the opening of my lips he kissed and ate with teeth at my mouth biting and holding my lower lip until i cried out for him the smell of flowers was gone and the wind smelled like ozone every hair on my body raised in goose bumps mistral drove us to the ground with him on top i wasnt certain if it was to protect me or to press the swollen front of him against my body but we were on the ground a second before a jagged white blast of lightning fell from the clear sky and struck the dead tree bolt after bolt fell from the sky hammering the tree and with each strike the dead bark fell revealing fresh pale bark underneath mistral covered my body with his shielding me as the lightning furrowed the earth on either side of the tree even as it shook the dead away until at last the tree stood naked and new and alive the broken snaggled branches began to grow longer fuller and buds formed on the end of those branches blossoms spilled out white and pink and the scent of apples was thick and sweet her voice came to us at the end of the vision go now my doubting thomas and shake the dead away from the quick we came back to the hallway with mistral still kneeling before me my hand on his face my hurt arm in a sling there were more of mistrals men on the other side of us but doyle and barinthus were keeping them back i doubted much time had passed but i heard barinthus say the princess brought me back into some of my power with only a touch would you take that chance away from your captain simply because you do not understand what is happening mistral smiled up at me a fierce baring of teeth his eyes boiled black with storm clouds so that he looked blind he was suddenly on his feet my hand still gripped in his he jerked me against his body so hard it jarred my arm and drove a small moan of pain from me a sound came from his throat and deep in his chest a sound that started as almost a purring but ended in the low bass growl of distant thunder he ran his fingers through my hair pulling a fistful sudden and tight in his hand it was a small sharp pain but it was just this side of being too tight too much he stared down at me his face filled with a raw naked lust something separate and primeval like darkness and light that divine spark that thrust into the first dark and brought life that power was in mistrals hands in the press of his body hard and eager even through the prison of his leather he felt so big so thick against the front of my body the press of him the strength of his hands made me shudder against him he tightened his grip on my hair forcing me to fight my bodys reaction or cause myself real pain my body wanted to buck and fight against his grip but hed given me a choice control myself or hurt myself he knew the game did mistral the feeling of being trapped of being helpless against his strength his lust and what my body needed was almost overwhelming my eyes shuttered closed at the effort of not struggling in his harsh grasp he whispered against my face and i could not focus enough to see him do you want to ride the storm his breath was hot against my skin his voice promised no gentleness no compromise i knew the kind of sex he was offering and the thought of it tightened things low in my body drew another small sound from my throat yes i whispered yes the roll of thunder echoed down the hallway shuddering between the stone walls the sound seemed to vibrate out of his body and into mine as if my body were a tuning fork struck against the rim of some great metal cup his voice growled against my skin with the taste of thunder in it good he said and forced me to my knees chapter mistral held me on my knees my head immobile in his grip as his other hand undid the front of his pants just watching him do it made my body react so strongly that i might have fallen to all fours if he hadnt held me up most of my lovers wouldnt let me go down on them because that wouldnt get me pregnant oral sex wouldnt make one of them king to my queen and they would not waste seed on any other part of my body id offered it as a part of foreplay but most had refused even that for fear that i would bring them and a chance would be wasted i was left begging for the touch of them in my mouth mistral was not worried about being king or making me pregnant in this moment he simply wanted me with no plan no agenda only his own longdenied need that he would think first of pleasure and second of politics made me love him just a little my skin began to glow softly that faint dance of magic underneath my skin traveled up his hand and into his body a faint white radiance started underneath his skin like light reflected around a corner not the fullout shine of my skin but something fainter less sure of itself i wondered if his glow had always been so hesitant his body spilled out of his pants he forced my mouth down on the long thick shaft and i sucked long and hard on him it threw his head back bowed his body and light burst from his skin cool white fire blazing inside him so that for a moment my eyes were dazzled if i had not held him in my mouth felt his hand like a comforting pain in my hair i would have believed that he had become light and power and magic and had no true substance at all but he shoved that wide and very solid piece of himself so far down my throat that breathing became an issue i liked my men large but i liked breathing more i began to fight against his hold my body starting to struggle to breathe i pushed at his body and his hand relaxed drawing my mouth down his thickness until i could draw breath around the tip of him i expected him to draw the rest of the way out of my mouth but he didnt he kept the tip of himself just inside me when id drawn enough air i ran my tongue delicately underneath the rim of his foreskin where it stretched tight across the hardness of him it made him shudder from the hand in my hair to the flesh in my mouth to his hips under the press of my hands his body emerged from the radiance in edges an outline of solid lines melting out of the brightness his hair had burst its leather ribbon and fell around him like a fall of white light it was as if the rest of his body thrummed with light and power except the part i held in my mouth maybe i couldnt have held him inside me if it all glowed like something carved of power he shoved himself deeper into my mouth but i was afraid that he would shove too far as he had before i distracted him with just an edge of teeth it made him hesitate and let me pull myself to the end of him again i edged my tongue gently but firmly farther underneath the skin than i had before so that i could lick inside that taut skin and the top of the shaft at the same time it made him shudder and writhe above me he looked down at me and his eyes were wide and wild with the sensation of it wind began to play down the hallway and his white shining hair flared in that wind a nimbus to frame his body the wind grew until it streamed down the hallway in both directions and i realized it was mistral my hands slid to his pants and i pulled carefully on the leather fastenings until i could touch the soft skin of his testicles they were loose enough that i could tease the skin between them and roll them in my hands like delicate balls of tender flesh i forgot my earlier fear and drove myself down the shaft of him struggling to hold the width of him in my mouth hed gotten harder which was more difficult to swallow but it was worth the effort worth it to rest my mouth against those tender bits of skin and flesh until i could lay the circle of my lips against the solid vibrating warmth of his body touching even that much of myself to the shining center of him left my lips tingling and as i drew myself back down the length of him it was as if that shivering power followed me as if the touch of my lips had somehow allowed it to flow down this last length of his body i gave a final flick of my tongue and when i drew him out of my mouth he did not fight me he gazed down at me with those wild eyes and light flashed through them it took me a second to realize i was seeing lightning lightning flashed through mistrals eyes then came the first distant breath of ozone like a storm that hadnt quite reached us yet but the scent of it rode the wind and promised great and terrible things he made a sound low in his throat and thunder growled down the hallway in answer my skin shone as if the moon had climbed inside me and was trying to melt out through my skin we painted shadows along the walls he dragged me to my feet by hair that had bled to red light and i knew that my eyes were a blaze of green and gold like christmas lights caught behind snow he turned me sharply in against the wall so that only my hands against the stones kept me from hitting facefirst he kept his hand in my hair but the other hand slid under my skirt until his fingers found the edge of my panties he balled his hand into the satin and i had a breath to brace before he ripped them from my body the violence of it staggered me and only his hand in my hair kept me against the wall i realized that i was using my hurt arm and it didnt hurt anymore my hands pressed into the cool stone of the wall as mistral pulled my hips against his body he moved between my legs but not inside me the feel of him hard and solid sliding between my thighs made me cry out but he was more than a foot taller than i there was no way to have intercourse with me facing the wall not unless someone brought a box for me to stand on he shoved himself against me sliding all that hard length across the most intimate parts of me the feel of the head of him gliding back and forth across the sweetest of spots started that heavy warmth building between my legs it wasnt just the softness of his skin and the hardness of his erection but the power the power acted as a sort of vibration against my body i realized that if he didnt stop soon hed bring me i both wanted him to and didnt would my orgasm bring his before hed shoved himself up inside my body did i want him to spill himself across the outside of my body or deep within i was still hesitating when mistral made the choice for me he jerked me back from the wall by my hair so hard that i stumbled he steadied me with his other hand on my arm as if he hadnt meant to be quite that rough he put me on my knees and released his grip on my hair it made me fall to all fours on your back he said his voice hoarse and followed by an echo of thunder between the stone walls i want you on your back i started to roll over but it wasnt fast enough for him his hands found my hips and rolled me onto the stone floor he put his hands beneath my buttocks and pulled me forward my knees bent with only my jacketcovered back touching the floor lightning flashed in his eyes so bright that it flickered around us like a strobe of light it left my eyes dazzled and when i could see clearly again he was pushing himself against the opening to my body his skin his hair everything was white with light and power the only color left to him was the storm sky color of his eyes between lightning strikes he pushed himself inside me using his hands to hold my body where he wanted it the feel of him entering me fluttered my eyes closed parted my lips and made me raise my hips up to meet his body he shuddered inside me and when i opened my eyes he still had half his length to go his fingers had tightened painfully on my body he held me immobile with just his hands on the cheeks of my ass dont help me he said in a voice that was almost lost to a growl of thunder if you help i wont last and i want to last i want this and he squeezed his fingers tight enough to make me cry out to last i nodded because i didnt trust my voice he tried to shove himself inside me in one last movement but he hadnt made enough room he had to fight for it pushing hard and deep with his hips to work his width up inside me he seemed to fill up every inch of me as if i couldnt have held another piece of him he almost drew himself out of me then again that slow hard push inside the feel of him filling me was too much he brought me screaming back arching before hed made me open enough for him to truly do what he wanted i thought it would bring him but when my pleasure passed he was still hard and firm between my legs but the orgasm had done one thing i was more open he finally had room to truly thrust and he knew what to do with the room he let me slip to the floor but i kept my legs up knees bent and he stayed propped up on his arms hands flat on either side of me i watched him go in and out of my body as the twin glows of our power grew bright and brighter id always described my glow as moonlight but this was more like sunshine my hair and eyes reflected around us like burning blood and emeralds and gold that had gotten so hot they melted into light mistral found his rhythm and it was hard and fast and deep he did it as if he could have done it all night i smelled ozone the hairs on my body stood to attention and the air squeezed tight around us i felt that warm building of pressure between my legs and just as it rolled over me spread through my body he thrust one last time inside me i knew in that instant that hed been gentle before because it was deep enough that it drove me up off the floor screaming i dug my nails into his arms half in pleasure and half in pain lightning cracked down the hallway in both directions it didnt exactly come out of mistrals body but it came from the glow of him his body shuddered inside me and the lightning crashed down the hallway thunder beating against the stones as if the force of it all would bring the walls down around us and i didnt care i was trapped under the force and power of his body blinded deafened by the explosion of his magic my body became light became magic became pleasure i forgot that there was skin to hold me bones to move me i simply was the pleasure when i was aware of my body again the weight of mistral was collapsed on top of me he was still inside me but not as hard or solid he had thrown those wide shoulders to the side so i wasnt suffocated under the bulk of him i could feel his heartbeat thudding through his body as he fought to regain his breath his hair was its usual grey and his skin back to its normal slightly offwhite not as pure a color as my own the armor on the one arm i could see was torn and blood showed through i tried to raise my hand to touch the damage but i couldnt make that much of my body move yet a movement in the hallway beyond us made me turn my gaze to where doyle and the others had been standing doyle was kneeling beside the far wall dazed most of the others were flat on the floor some immobile frost got to all fours as i watched shaking his head as if to clear his senses rhys came around the corner with kitto in tow he drew his gun obviously thinking it had been an attack i couldnt blame him sex doyle said in a hoarse voice sex and magic he cleared his throat sharply and tried again the goddess and consort have blessed us all shit rhys said and we missed it galens voice came heavy with afterglow he was flat on his back and the front of his pants was stained dark it sort of hurt i dont like my sex that rough i heard groans from the other side of the hallway and i could turn my head now mistrals men were all flat on their backs some were struggling to sit up adair tried to climb to his feet against the wall and fell over with a metallic clatter there was a black burn mark across the front of his armor goddess save us someone said in a voice hoarse with pleasure she just did mistral moved slowly so he could raise up enough to gaze down at me he smiled and his eyes were the blue of spring skies with fluffy little clouds floating through id never known there was a sky that peaceful inside his eyes hawthorne sat up in his green plate mail propping his back against the wall he too had a black burn mark across his chest the next time you plan to call lightning warn those of us wearing metal mother of gods that hurt and felt good another voice said hawthorne dragged his helmet off showing a pale face and his dark green hair braided to fit under the helm he nodded and felt good he looked at me and for just a moment in the triple colors of his eyespink green and redi saw a tree a tree on a hill and that tree was white with blossoms he blinked and it was just the colors of his iris again i remembered the vision and how the lightning had cleared away the dead from the tree had we cleared away the old wood here had we done more than give them pleasure and pain time would tell for now we had a double homicide to solve the police were on their way and we hadnt even started to question the witnesses i said a little prayer goddess can we slow down the magical revelations until after we solve the murders or at least until we get presentable for the police i didnt get an answer not even that warm pulse that lets me know shes listening which i took for a no it wasnt that i didnt understand that bringing the magic back to faerie was important maybe more important than solving murders but i did not want the human police to find us spread around the hallway like an orgy gone horribly wrong someone moved at the far end of the hallway the person who sat up was female decidedly female even under the armor she took off her helmet and gasped at the air her curly black hair was cut very short which was different from last id seen her but the face was still biddy she was one of cels guards halfhuman and halfunseelie sidhe even though shed never been a fan of cel shed once belonged to my fathers guard and when cel coopted many of my fathers guards she was trapped in the turnover what was she doing here a shadow formed over her face and flowed down the bright silver of her armor the shadow held a figure a tiny figure a baby like some dark ghost coiled in front of her the ring on my finger was suddenly warm against my hand as if someone had breathed across the metal i gazed down the hallway still trapped under mistrals body biddy sat at the turn of the hall that was farther than the hallway to the kitchen i shouldnt have been able to see her this clearly from this angle but she stood out to my gaze as if she was outlined in something more real than the rest of the figures in the hallway mistral whispered above me do you see it i whispered back i was going to ask you the same thing a child he said a baby i said go to her quickly for the vision will not last somewhere in this hallway is her match the father of that shadow child what is that in front of biddy galen asked hed raised up on his elbows mistral raised himself off of me go to her meredith go to her before the magic of the ring fades he pulled me to my feet with his pants still undone hurry the tone in his voice made me start down the hall unsteady on my feet in the high heels the sex had been too good for my legs to be steady i stumbled and had to catch myself against the wall hands steadied me and i looked down to find hawthornes hands on my hips are you all right princess i nodded yes i gazed down the hallway at that solid shadow in front of biddy i felt as if that phantom child was whispering to me whispering im here other hands touched me as i stumbled and hurried a handful of the others could see the shadow child their hands seemed to push and hurry me as much as catch me the ring was like a warm weight on my hand heavy with pressure the pressure of a spell building building to a great conclusion i had to be touching biddy before the spell burst i wasnt sure how i knew that but i was absolutely certain that the ring needed to be against her skin before the spell finished something would be lost if i failed biddy had struggled to her feet though her trigrey eyes were a little unfocused and she leaned heavily against the wall i found my legs could move as the pressure built in the ring like some warm living thing against my skin i was running full out and biddys eyes were wide and frightened she couldnt see the spell but she knew something was wrong i reached for her hand and she reached automatically out to me her hand wrapped around mine just as the spell burst over us it was as if the world held its breath as if time and magic stopped and there was a moment where biddy and i stood outside of all of it there was no sound not even the hush of my own pulse she stared at me eyes huge with fear or something i couldnt feel the spell wasnt for me i was merely the vessel for it i had no idea what was happening to biddy i knew it didnt hurt and that it was good but what she heard in that moment must have been for her ears alone the goddess spoke to her and i held her hand let the magic take her while i was in silence because i simply didnt need to know sound came back with an audible pop the change in pressure was real enough that we staggered when the magic released us our hands convulsed around each other as if the touch of flesh was all that kept us from falling her eyes were wide her skin pale with shock biddy was tall broadshouldered and wearing the remnants of her armor her gauntlets and her helmet and other pieces lay scattered around her as if shed begun to shed the outer covering long before i reached her she was dressed in bits of armor and the padding that even the sidhe must wear under such things her short hair was in disarray from the helmet and the magic that had put her against the wall she was still lovelynothing could take that away from herbut id seen her look better still the way the men in the hallway looked at her youd have thought no woman had ever been more desirable than biddy was in that moment their faces held a soft wonderment as if they saw something i did not some vision of female loveliness that left them speechless and immobile literally stunned by what they saw or felt the magic was not for me because if id been as besotted with biddy as they all seemed to be i couldnt have looked down the long corridor until i came to the right man for a moment i thought it was doyle and the thought squeezed my heart tight but it was simply that his face did not hold the stunned look of the rest in fact his face looked suspicious as if he was trying to decipher what he was seeing or smelling for he scented the wind as i watched frost was immobile against the wall but his face too did not hold the wonderment he seemed angry sullen his usual self galens face was as lost as any of the other mens i realized that mistral too was seeing whatever i was seeing because he had started down the hall ahead of my gaze as if he saw things too i wore the ring but he had been part of the magic that had brought this to life he paused by doyle and frost and looked back at me as if to make certain i saw them i wasnt certain why it was important to him but he nodded as if satisfied when he saw me see them rhys stood at the end of the hallway his face was sad but not enthralled i looked at each of the men in turn with that same hyperfocus that i had seen in biddy earlier the magic was looking for something kitto crouched at rhyss feet as if he had been struck down by the magic but his face held the same wonderment that the other mens did i thought i was looking for someone who wasnt affected but it was mistral who showed me that i was looking for the man who was most affected not least mistral stopped before the colored glow of niccas wings he held his hand out to the stillkneeling man nicca took his hand but his face now that i could see it looked blind to mistral to anything but what he saw in biddy his face had never looked more beautiful than it did in that moment a delicate almost feminine beauty that was usually disguised behind broad shoulders and a sixfoot warriors frame in his sleep he could be soft and as gentle as he truly was but awake he always had to be more mistral drew him to his feet and nicca was suddenly himself awake and moving with the smooth strength of his bare chest and the huge wings like a shining colored frame for all that gentle beauty i admit that for a moment or two i felt regret regret that i would lose him that he would never again grace my bed but that selfish impulse was drowned in a feeling of such warmth such peace that i couldnt regret it not truly what i saw on his face as mistral led him toward us was what id felt in the bed with him he was too gentle for my tastes and far too gentle for the queens the only thing he would ever have done as king was die i looked at biddys face and saw in her eyes what i saw in niccas each of them saw the whole world in the eyes of the other and it was a nice safe beautiful world the four of us stood at the end of the hallway women on one side men on the other i expected biddy or nicca to reach out to the other but they were immobile mistral and i clasped their hands together that shadow child that i had seen at first was back but it wasnt a phantom now i saw a smiling face with niccas warm brown eyes and biddys black curls i saw their child laughing and real as if i could have touched the round baby curve of his face i pressed my hand and the warmth of the ring into their flesh and mistrals big hand covered mine we bound their hands together with magic and the tears that i shed i saw their child and knew that he was real and all we had to do to make that vision flesh was let them be together it was as if mistral read my mind if the queen will allow it i blinked up at him as we drew our hands away and let nicca and biddy embrace for the first time they kissed a melding of body and hands and they drew back from that first kiss with laughter i frowned up at mistral the tears still not dry on my cheeks the ring is alive again its what she wished life is returning to the courts he shook his head and he looked so sad she wants her bloodline to rule the courts more than she wants the courts to thrive if that were not true she would have made different choices centuries ago doyles deep voice came to me as he walked to us mistral is right i frowned at both of them shell demand that nicca stay in my bed until what i get pregnant they exchanged glances then both nodded their solemn expressions were too well matched for my comfort at the very least mistral said i looked at nicca and biddy oblivious to our worries they touched each other as if theyd never seen a man or woman before with light wonderment as if they couldnt believe that they were allowed to touch this person in just this way i sighed and it was as if wind trailed down the hallway the magic was still there still heavy with promise just behind my heartbeat just underneath my skin i could feel it but as strong as it was it was also fragile i realized that the ring like the chalice had chosen to leave or chosen to fade it had decided that we didnt deserve its magic anymore if queen andais did not allow biddy and nicca to be together the magic was quite capable of leaving again for good of leaving us to die as a people for the gods only give so many second chances before they search for some other people to bless we had a second chance and i didnt want andais to throw that chance away i spoke out loud without meaning to if id known wed be this deep in metaphysical wonders i might not have called in the police i shook my head and tried to think of a way around the queens obsession with her bloodline and mine nothing came to mind i have an idea rhys said im not sure youre going to like it though gee rhys with an opening like that how can i resist tell me your idea if you told the queen you wanted both nicca and biddy in your bed at the same time she might let that go yes doyle said she might she has done it often enough herself he turned solemn black eyes on me it would make her think better of you i frowned better of me in what way more like her he said she searches in you for signs of herself signs that you are truly blood of her blood frost was nodding i do not like it but it would amuse her it may work if biddy agrees i said looking at the happy couple to be together after the ring has bound you mistral said you would do anything anything to be with your true love the sorrow in his eyes was something visible tangible i did not have to ask to know that once the ring had found his true love and somehow he had lost her fine then i said thats settled frost touched my shoulder then dropped his hand as if he wasnt allowed to i took his hand in mine held that gesture against me it earned me a sad smile i know you are not a lover of women it is good of you to take biddy into your bed night after night until they are with child i squeezed his hand one time together and they will be with child i am certain of that even the queen wont divide them if theyre pregnant andais knows you are not a lover of women doyle said she may insist on watching i sighed then shrugged so be it doyle and frost both gave me a look meredith frost said will you truly be part of her entertainment i want them together frost and if i have to include myself in it the first time and let the queen watch so be it when will you make your offer to the queen doyle asked after weve questioned the witnesses and gotten the police safely inside the sithen and only if she objects to them being a couple on their own i smoothed my short skirt down i was going to need underwear the police tend to discount your authority if you flash them i think most of us need to freshen our clothing doyle said i couldnt help it i glanced down at his groin it was hard to tell in the dim light of the sithen he gave that masculine chuckle black is a wonderfully concealing color frost flashed his grey jacket open just enough to show a stain grey is not i looked at them are you saying the magic brought everyone in the hallway everyone who was standing here rhys said we missed the fun by moments there were other voices up and down the hallway agreeing or bemoaning the paler colors they had chosen to wear we cannot all go freshen our clothes at the same time doyle said some of us must stay here and work the human police are on their way and this has taken much of our time i wasnt wearing a watch no one was because watches and clocks ran oddly inside faerie so oddly that telling time by them was useless how did anyone know where to be and when they approximated and we spent a lot of time being fashionably late fine divide everybody into shifts for a change of clothes and could someone get me fresh underwear mistral held up my ripped panties i dont suppose these would be very useful i am sorry that i damaged them he held them out to me im not sorry i said and pressed his hand back around the satin a pleased look filled his eyes replacing the sorrow his hands convulsed around the bit of satin i noticed that hed found time in all the fuss to tuck himself back inside his pants may i keep it as a sign of my ladys favor i nodded you may he raised his hand to his face in an oldfashioned salute but the look in his eyes made me shiver he turned with a smile to get his men on their feet and give them their duties frost had turned away i caught his arm what is wrong nothing im going to go change but he wouldnt look at me frost had a tendency to be moody if id had more time i would have asked more questions but the humans were coming and we were out of time i promised myself that if he stayed sulky id find out what was wrong i was hoping it was some momentary mood and nothing more doyle said let him go hell need a little time to adjust i frowned at him adjust to what doyle gave a smile that was more sad than happy later if you still need to ask i will explain but now we have very little time to question our witnesses you have called the police into the sithen princess and we must prepare he was right but i wanted to know what had i missed it couldnt be just about sex with mistral theyd all seen me have sex with others but if not that then what i shook my head smoothed my short skirt and put it from my mind we had a crime to solve if the goddess would give us enough free time to do it i couldnt seem to control the wild magic that was returning to us but i could at least pretend to control the murder investigation though the tight feeling in my stomach told me i didnt have much control over either chapter some of the men went to clean up others went to await the police at the door to the sithen because they would never find their way in on their own the door moved and it didnt like strangers only magic could hold the door open for mortal step that had never crossed its threshold before when we had divided everyone up we found we were missing someone onilwyn hadnt been in the hallway he hadnt gone with rhys so he hadnt returned with him he was simply gone hed been cels creature for centuries i did not like that he had gone missing just after such a major magical happening it made me think hed gone to tattle to his true master or whoever was bearing tales to cel in his prison cell we threaded our way between the two bodies that were still waiting for the police when we were close to the large kitchen door i heard shouting and barking maggie mays accent was thick because she was angry you are a blaguard tree man that you are get out of my kitchen her little terriers were doing their version of shouting right along with her im trying a mans voice yelled we got to the door in time to see a castiron skillet the size of a small shield smash into onilwyns back it staggered him and other pots and pans drove him to all fours pans of copper and stainless steel flashed their polished brightness as they hit his body but it was the deep black castiron skillets in their various sizes that were beating him down cold iron has been proof against faeries for a very long time the sidhe may rule faerie but cold iron still hurts maggie may stood in her kitchen surrounded by a storm of pots pans ladles spoons forks and knives like an evil metal snow globe with her small brown figure as its centerpiece the ladles joined the attacks of the pots and pans onilwyn was now flat to the floor arms over his head for protection three faerie terriers were darting in and out to nip at him the plumpest dog had sunk teeth into his boot top and was trying to shake it to death his sword lay on the floor by the large black stove if youre going to attack a brownie never do it on their home turf shes gone bogart galen said over the crashing of metal i looked harder at her face all brownies have skulllike faces because they have no nose just nostrils but if their faces look like evil grinning skulls then they have gone evilbogart brownies can thresh a field of wheat in a single day or build a barn overnight think of that much power turned destructive insanely destructive they still tell stories in a lonely part of scotland border country of a laird who raped and murdered a local girl he didnt realize her family had been adopted by a brownie the laird and all his household were cut to pieces maggie may was not quite a bogart but she was working up to it no doyle said not bogart not yet but we must find a way to distract her before the knives join the battle seems a shame rhys said i agreed but true bogarts are part of the sluagh the evil host not true unseelie court anymore maggie deserved better no matter how i felt about onilwyn rhys shouted maggie may its rhys you sent for me remember the spoons swirled in to join the ladles which left only the heavy iron forks big enough to turn a side of beef and the knives we were running out of time i said the only thing i could think of that might shock her into listening aunt maggie what happened to upset you the pots began to slow like a swirl of heavy snowflakes brought to rest by a gentle wind that wind laid them in neat lines on the heavy wooden table what d ye say she asked and her voice was thick with suspicion i said aunt maggie what happened to upset you she frowned at me im not aunt maggie to you girl you are my greatgrandmothers sister on my mothers side that makes you my greataunt maggie she still looked unhappy but nodded slowly and said aye that be true but you are a princess of the sidhe whatever your blood be or be not the sidhe donna acknowledge us why not i asked she rubbed her hairy fingers across her noseless face and frowned harder princess meredith ye needs be more careful of who you be talkin in front of she looked at onilwyn who was getting painfully to his feet there was blood on his pale skin yes he is cels creature but cel knows my bloodlines the sidhe know only what they wish to know about the blood that runs through their veins as she calmed her accent began to vanish her voice was cultured and midwest nowhere like a news anchor shed cultivated that voice by talking on the phone to other faerie terrier fanciers across the country and the world you couldnt get a new breed of terrier recognized by the american kennel club if no one could understand what you were saying to them denying my heritage wont change what i am i said it wont make me one inch taller or look one bit more royal sidhe mayhaps maggie said smoothing her hands down her shapeless dress but it is not brownie blood that will put you on the throne i reached over to the big castiron skillet where it lay on the table i wrapped my hand around its cool metal handle it was inert under my hand just metal to me i lifted the heavy skillet changing my grip until i had the balance of it but its brownie blood that helps me do this her eyes narrowed at me aye or human or human i agreed onilwyn swayed and collapsed back to his knees if hed been human he would probably have been dead what set you and your dogs on him i asked two of her terriers had come to her feet but the plump one still growled at onilwyn i realized the dog wasnt fat she was pregnant the bitch was so full of puppies that she waddled when she finally went back to maggies call dulcie went to sniff his foot maggie said she growled at him a bit she would nae have bit him her thin strong hands balled into fists she seemed to be controlling herself with effort he kicked her and her full of puppies he kicked ma dog my first memory was of being in a small dark cupboard with squirming puppies one puppy was more than my lap could hold a huge dog sat by the thin line of light of the curtains that covered the front of our hole the silky fur of the faerie terrier puppies and that alert dog is still an utterly vivid memory my father once told me what i at around eighteen months didnt remember my father and barinthus had both been called away so my father had left me with maggie may the queens steward had come unrepentantly to check on some dish for that nights banquet if the queen knew my father hid me in the kitchens it would no longer be a haven for me id crawled into the cupboard with the puppies and their mother as i often did i was very gentle with them even then maggie had told me once when the steward came she just closed the drapes hiding both me and the puppies the steward didnt believe it hid just puppies so he tried to peek and the mother dog bit him she protected her puppies and me to this day the scent and feel of the terriers was a comforting thing to me i dont know what i would have said or done to onilwyn about his behavior because he decided for me rhys and galen both yelled dont i sensed doyle and others moving but i was next to the kneeling onilwyn as he raised his hand and called his magic pointing it at maggie may i didnt think i just reacted my hand was still wrapped around the iron skillet i hit him full in the face with as much strength as i had in one arm im not as strong as a fullblooded sidhe or even brownie but i can punch my way through a car door and not hurt myself i did that once to discourage a wouldbe mugger blood flew from around the skillet a bright surprised scarlet spray he collapsed to his side moaning softly his nose looked like a squashed tomato and there was so much blood it was hard to tell what other damage id done to his face there was a thick silence in the room i think i surprised everybody including myself rhys shook his head squatting down by the fallen man you really dont like him do you no i said and realized that the thought of letting onilwyn touch me was repulsive hed been one of my main tormentors when i was a child i still hated cel and some of his cronies enough to feel nothing but a sense of utter satisfaction at the ruin of onilwyns face it wasnt like he wouldnt heal the little terrier he had kicked came up to him growling she sniffed his blood then sneezed sharply as if he smelled bitter she turned her back on him and dug her feet into the floor throwing blood into the air a dominant defiant gesture the dog went back to her mistress and the two other dogs so the three of them sat in a smiling buttwriggling row at maggies feet maggie may was grinning at me with strong yellow teeth showing oh ah you be kin i nodded and handed the bloodied skillet to her yes yes i am i smiled at her and she laughed a great roar of laughter she wrapped her arms around me hugging me tight it surprised me for a heartbeat but then i hugged her back just as tight here was someone else who wasnt touching me to gain anything she hugged me because just because hugs for no reason just because were nice and lately i wasnt getting enough of them chapter a high ringing sound came we all looked around the room but there was nothing to account for the sound it came again it was as if the finest crystal goblet were being struck with metal so that it made that high ringing belllike tone only the best crystal makes rhys was unsheathing his short sword i left crystall in charge outside with the police he held the naked blade up before his face you rang crystalls face appeared dim and pale in the blade rhys i am unsure how to proceed whats wrong rhys asked i think that we need someone here who is more conversant with modern police and modern politics rhys shook his head i didnt ask what you needed i asked whats wrong as far as i can ascertain the humans are arguing about who is in charge in charge of what everything crystall said they seem to have no clear hierarchy it is like a game of too many princes rhys sighed ill be there as soon as i can crystall i am sorry rhys but none of us here spend much time outside the land of faerie its all right ill be there rhys wiped the blade clean with a movement of his hand he looked at doyle i didnt think we needed someone more modern with the police i should have do not apologize doyle said simply fix it rhys gave a bow and went for the door he walked past me but it was something on the other side of the room that attracted my attention i saw something over maggie mays shoulder movement the curtain under the sink where id hidden as a child fluttered something was behind that piece of cloth something bigger than a small dog adrenaline rushed through me so hard and fast that my fingertips tingled with it i had assumed that someone had searched the area for the killer had i assumed wrong i broke the hug with maggie may with a squeeze fighting to control my face and body i wanted to alert doyle and the others without alerting whoever was hiding doyle was just beside me as if id given myself away by some hesitation or movement he opened his mouth but i touched his lips with my fingers he took the hint he stood mute before me and did not ask what id feared not out loud with his dark eyes he asked what is wrong but not out loud i glanced using only my eyes behind me i tried for the angle i wanted but wasnt certain hed understand he knelt by onilwyns moaning form and said why did you leave us onilwyn why did you come ahead to the witnesses the only answer was a soft bubbling moan doyle positioned himself so he could see the sink area while he questioned the fallen man i fought not to look behind me doyle leaned in close to onilwyn are you saying a brownie and a halfhuman princess have struck you such a blow that you are brought low he made no sign that i could see but galen called out peasblossom mug come out and talk to us he walked around the table and for a moment i thought the two little fey had been the ones hidden under the sink and i was simply too suspicious i turned to see him go to the open cabinets above the sink area mug the pale blue fey that had come to fetch rhys and another tiny winged figure were peeking out from among the teacups it was mugs voice high and twittering like the song of birds made human speech that answered we feared maggied forget us in her anger galen green knight he was by them now gazing up at them so you hid among the teacups unless she was bogart for good shed not bust up the good china no she wouldnt mug walked carefully out from between the cups and flittered sky blue wings to flutter down to galens shoulder i remembered mug now shed been a pet once of one sidhe or another but when her last master had grown tired of her maggie had invited her into the kitchen so she could earn an honest living and not have to cater to the whim of one of the large ones large one was an insulting term used by the lesser fey for the sidhe mug had come to the kitchen about the time i left faerie peasblossom on the other hand her i knew i called to her peasblossom theres no need to hide frost had moved up on the other side of the sink from galen who was chatting away with the tiny blue fairy on his shoulder shed cuddled close to his neck hands as delicate as pale blue petals stroking along the bareness of his ear mug had a real thing for sidhe men id never asked nor wanted to speculate what pleasure she and her masters had gotten from each other she was smaller than a barbie doll and more delicate looking i did not need the visuals i was able to look at them and keep an eye on the curtain without staring at it galen gave us all a reason to look in that direction frost said come down little one so we may question you the tiny face scooted back among the good china like a mouse ducking back into its hole her voice was like the sighing of the wind a delicate spring breeze that warmed the skin and made you believe that the flowers merely slept under the snow and were not dead her voice brought a smile to my face before i had time to think glamour i dont remember your voice being so sweet peasblossom galen said im frightened she said as if that explained it maggie may translated when the demifey be scared they use what defense they have their glamour i said aye she said she was watching us all with narrowed eyes she knew something was up come little one frost called and even extended a hand like youd offer a perch to a bird i fear you killing frost as i fear the darkness the voice said from among the cups do you fear me peasblossom i asked quiet for a moment or two then no no i do not fear you then come to me i said and held my hand out to show i preferred a less intimate perch for her you will protect me from the darkness and the killing frost she asked i fought the urge to smile it took concentration to fight off that pleasant sound touching would make it harder still but i wanted her away from the sink area she was a civilian and if whatever was under the sink fought i didnt want any civvies in the line of fire come peasblossom i wont let them hurt you you promise doyle interrupted she cannot promise for we do not know you are innocent innocent she said her voice rising with her fear the wind clanging among chimes innocent of what darkness he stayed kneeling by onilwyn who had not risen to bait or answered questions he was either that hurt or feigning it is but a step from finding a body to pretending to find a body that you put there i frowned at him no wonder hed scared her he gave me a calm flick of his eyes as if he saw nothing wrong with what hed said peasblossom was moaning in terror hysterical the illusionary wind was not warm now but cold with that icy threat of storm on its edge the teacups rattled with her frantic attempt to shove herself tighter against the back of the cabinet i had to raise my voice to be certain she could hear me i promise that neither frost nor doyle will harm you doyle said merry as if id surprised him silence from the teacups then in a very neutral voice you promise yes i said i didnt think she was guilty of anything but just in case id promised only that frost and doyle would not harm her if she took that to imply that id promised her none of my guards would harm her that wasnt my fault i was sidhe enough and fey enough to split the difference with her and not feel guilty every fey from least to greatest knew the kind of games we all played to lose meant you were careless your own damned fault she eased around the china cup and came to the edge of the shelf she was one of the rare demifey that had skin like a humans her hair was dark brown falling in waves around her face only the delicate black lines of antennae ruined the perfect doll look that and the wings she flicked across her back her dress looked like it was formed of brown and purple leaves though when she stepped off the shelf the leaves moved like cloth she flew toward me and a glance from doyle made me move farther away from the table farther away from the curtain one of the other guards called maggie may could you come here for a moment i think if she hadnt been suspicious shed have argued but she let herself be called out of the line of danger peasblossom adjusted her angle to follow me and put delicate feet on the palm of my hand her feet were not as baby soft as sages had been but her weight was like his heaver than it should have been as if there was more to her than a dollsize body and butterfly wings ivi and hawthorne moved in front of me so my view was blocked but they were offering their very bodies as shields to keep me safe i could not protest ivi whispered i hope i get to fuck you before you get me killed hawthorne smacked him in the chest with his mailed fist he made an oof sound then i heard cloth rip and the shouting begin peasblossom darted to my shoulder hiding in my hair screaming wordlessly and in terror such a small creature to make so much noise i heard the men yelling but what they yelled was lost to peasblossoms shrill screams the broad bodies of the guard kept me safe but also hid the action from me so i was left unknowing unseeing and could only trust that nothing too bad was happening i took it as a good sign that the guards were still merely standing in front of me and didnt feel the need to hide me between the floor and their bodies things werent deadly yet peasblossom clung to my hair and jacket shrieking right next to my ear i fought the urge to grab her and stop the screams i was afraid id crush her wings and with beatrices death i was no longer certain what would and would not heal on the lesser fey i put my hand between her and my ear but jerked it away because something pricked me like a thorn or pin she stopped screaming and started apologizing apparently id caught my fingers on her rosethorn bracelet my fingertip held a minute spot of blood doyles deep voice cut off peasblossoms babbling apology why were you hiding from us a rough male voice said i wasnt hiding from you i was hiding from him i tried to peer around adair and hawthorne but when i tried to move around them they moved with me blocking my view and keeping me safe i called doyle is it safe hawthorne adair let the princess see our prisoner prisoner the rough voice said princess theres no need for that there was something vaguely familiar about the voice the two guards moved and i was finally able to see the hairy smallish figure frost and galen held between them he was a hob a relative to the brownie harry hob hed worked in the kitchens off and on for years off when maggie may caught him drunk on the job on when he could control himself he was only about three feet tall and covered in so much thick dark hair that it took a minute to realize he was naked why are you afraid of onilwyn doyle asked i thought hed come to kill me the way he killed my bea i think we all took a breath and forgot to let it out did you see him do it doyle asked his deep voice fell into the silence like a stone thrown down a well we waited for the stone to hit bottom but it was onilwyns voice that came first i did not his voice was thick not with emotion but with blood and the broken mess of his nose i did not know her well enough to kill her he struggled to his feet and with no prompting from anyone adair and amatheon took his arms as if he were already a prisoner in that moment i knew i wasnt the only one who disliked onilwyn he kept protesting his innocence in that same thick voice that sounded like he had a very bad head cold but i knew it was his own blood he was choking on silence doyle said not a yell but his voice carried all the same onilwyn was silent for a moment until harry hob said i saw onilwyn cut him off he lies harry made himself heard then bellowing loud enough to shake the cups on their shelves i lie i lie it takes a sidhe to be a liar inside fairie doyle stepped between them motioning them both to silence hob did you see onilwyn kill beatrice he turned at a sound from onilwyn if you interrupt again i will have you dragged from this room onilwyn made a sound then spat blood on the kitchen floor maggie may stalked toward him with a small iron pot in her hand no maggie doyle said well have no more of your bogarting bogarting why darkness if you think that was bogarting you must never have seen a true bogart there was something threatening in her golden eyes dont force me to have to ban you from your own kitchen maggie may yo wouldna dare he just looked at her and the look was enough she backed off muttering under her breath but she put the pot down and went to the far corner her dogs boiled about her feet like a furry tide doyle looked back to harry hob now once more did you see onilwyn kill beatrice or the reporter if not to finish the job then why did he come ahead of you all into the kitchen why not ask him that doyles voice was low and almost evil sounding with an edge of a growl i ask you one last time harry if you do not answer me straight and simply i will let frost shake you until some answer falls out ah now darkness no need to threaten old harry old harry is it doyle smiled you cant claim age here not among us i remember you as a babe harry i remember when you had a human family and farm to tend harry scowled at him a look as unfriendly as hed given onilwyn no need to bring up hard memories darkness he sounded sullen then answer me straight and no one here need know how you lost your place you wouldna tell harry said give me truth harry hob or i will give you truth you dont wish shared harry scowled at the floor he looked somehow diminished and more delicate than he should have held between the two tall guards maybe he was playing for sympathy but if so he was playing to the wrong audience doyle knelt in front of him staying on the balls of his feet one last time harry did you see onilwyn kill beatrice andor the human reporter the andor had been a nice touch because without it harry would have room to wiggle if hed seen only one murder but not both he answered still staring at the floor no no what doyle asked harry looked up at that his dark eyes glittering with anger no i didna see the tree lord slay my beatrice or the human then why did you hide from him i did not know he was hid there maggie may said mayhaps darkness it was na the tree lord he first hid from very good doyle said acknowledging it with a nod of his head he stood and asked maggies question why did you hide yourself harry i saw him and he used a nod since his arms were still held to point at onilwyn who was also still being held we waited for him to say more but he seemed to think hed said enough doyle prompted him and why should the mere sight of onilwyn make you hide thought he was her sidhe lover didno i i couldnt help it i laughed harry gave me a dirty look im sorry hob but onilwyn doesnt think even i am pureblooded enough i cant imagine him having a completely nonsidhe lover thank you princess onilwyn said in that still thick voice i gave him the look he deserved and said it wasnt a compliment just the same he said i am grateful for the truth who but her sidhe lover would come here alone harry asked good question i said and looked at doyle he gave a small nod and said why did you abandon us onilwyn i had no interest in watching the princess perform with someone else the queen cured me of voyeurism a very long time ago none argued with that but doyle asked so you came ahead to begin questioning the witnesses on your own without either of your captains or even your officers permission you all seemed busy and even with the broken nose the sarcasm came through loud and clear you didnt hit him hard enough merry galen said and my gentle knight had a decidedly ungentle look on his face did you come ahead to seek answers or to hide them doyle asked i was not the lover of anyone and i would most certainly not risk the queens mercy for anything less than a sidhe the disdain in his voice was thick enough to walk on did any of the rest of you know that beatrice had a sidhe lover doyle asked maggie may said no ive told all mah people that you leave the big ones alone only grief comes of it so if beatrice had taken a sidhe i said shed have hidden it from you ah most like i looked to the dainty blue figure that was almost hidden behind galens neck mug galen had to say the princess is asking you a question mug shed been too busy playing in the curls at the back of his neck to pay attention to anything else she wasnt stupid but id seen her like this before as if the touch of a sidhe was intoxicating to her she peered around his neck her wings flicking nervously what she asked did beatrice have a lover that you know of she pointed to harry him did she have a sidhe lover i asked mugs eyes went wide a sidhe for a lover beatrice she shook her head if i had known i would have asked her to let me touch him beatrice would never have told mug peasblossom said i looked for her and found her perched on the pots that hung from hooks on the near wall did she tell you she did who was her sidhe lover harry asked voice eager none us said anything because it was one of the things we all wanted to know she wouldnt tell me said he made her promise not to tell anyone or he would break off the relationship why would that end the relationship doyle asked unless frost said it unless he was a royal guard who would risk death by torture for less than sidhe flesh amatheon said i gave him an unfriendly look i do not deserve that look princess it is only truth i started to argue but hesitated i had had lesser fey lovers in los angeles and it had been wonderful but but i had craved other flesh once you have had the full attention of another sidhe all else was truly lesser i wanted to argue with amatheon but i could not not and be truthful i will not argue with you amatheon i said because you cannot he replied he kept his grip on onilwyn but his attention seemed all for me i acknowledged the truth of it with a nod but if not a guard galen asked then why would he care if others knew of his relationship with beatrice i looked at him searching his face for any hint that he knew how naïve that question was but there was nothing in his face that said he understood anything mug cuddled in against his neck and spoke for most of us that is so sweet what galen asked a fair few dabble among us lesser folk maggie may said but few wish to acknowledge us publicly galen frowned why not amatheon said have you been living in the same court as the rest of us galen shrugged almost unseating mug he helped her catch her balance by holding up his fingers so she could catch herself love is too precious to be ashamed of if i hadnt already loved him i would have in that moment you are right my friend doyle said but that is not always how our free brethren feel about such things arrogance such arrogance to be ashamed of that which the rest of us would give so much to have adair said who would admit to bedding something with wings onilwyn said good enough to fuck but not to love maggie may asked some of the men would not meet her gaze doyle had no trouble meeting those hard golden eyes was harry hob her lover she nodded aye mug and peasblossom answered together yes doyle turned back to harry its not every hob who gets to share a mistress with a sidhe mistress nay i loved the girl how did you feel about sharing the girl you loved with another beatrice had broken up with harry peasblossom said but we was back together harry said peasblossom acknowledged that was true she had broken up with the sidhe he said dumped a sidhe for you mug said and laughed a high twittering sound dont you laugh at him mug maggie may said sometimes love is more than a magic or grand power did you know that beatrice had let harry go i asked aye and that shed taken im back too if shed broken with him doyle said why did harry expect him down in the kitchens beatrice said he wanted her to do awful things for him shed agreed at first then changed her mind what kind of awful things doyle asked she wouldna tell me said it was so awful no one would believe it of him we were unseelie not seelie which meant we were willing to admit most of what we wanted what could be so terrible that it wouldnt be believed what perversion that beatrice had turned from it in fear her sidhe lord had demanded one last meeting to try and persuade beatrice to reconsider i begged her not to meet with him why did you fear for her safety doyle asked no not that if i had ever dreamed such a thing i would never have let her meet him alone harry replied then why didnt you want them to meet i was jealous werent i i feared hed win her back goddess help me but all i could see was my jealousy doyle must have given some signal for frost and galen let go of harrys arms he stood there rubbing the arm that frost had held and you hid when you saw onilwyn because you thought he was her lover we thought hed come back to kill harry peasblossom said if shed have told anyone the secret it would have been harry i told him to hide if you feared only onilwyn why didnt you come out when you knew we were all here doyle asked would you want anyone to know that you hid stead of fight the man you thought had killed the woman you loved did i want the darkness or the killing frost to know i was such a coward tears gleamed in his eyes i didna know meself i was such a coward onilwyn doyle said the real reason you came ahead he opened his mouth had to clear his throat sharply before he said truth then i know the princess loathes me with this many men at her beck and call she could keep me from her bed for some time i wanted to touch a woman again i thought if i found some clue helped solve this mess it might help my cause i stared at his bloody face those angry eyes he met my gaze why dont i believe you i asked his eyes were angry and sullen in the bloody mask of his face would i admit such weakness to you if it were not true i thought about that for a second or two you hate me too i said i would do near anything to end this need princess whatever i felt once the chance to slake this thirst outweighs whatever loyalty i thought i held we stared at each other and i didnt know what i would have replied because suddenly doyle said do you smell that chapter doyle sniffed the air and a moment later i smelled it too fresh blood i moved toward him what do you smell darkness maggie may asked he put his hand to his sword and the other men were suddenly unsheathing weapons i dont think any of them had smelled what we had but they trusted doyles instincts its all right he said but he unsheathed his sword and that didnt comfort anyone in the room when he had the blade completely free of its sheath blood welled on the naked blade as if the sword were bleeding harry stumbled back away from him and that dripping sword i couldnt blame him peasblossom screamed and mug hid her face against galens neck goddess save us frost said what is it cromm cruach doyle said it took me a second to realize he was using rhyss original name when hed been a deity cromm cruach red claw as i watched the blood drip on the scrubbed kitchen floor i began to understand where the name may have come from maggie may said cromm cruach aye well what does he say the blood formed letters on the floor dont you carry any nonmagical weapons oh doyle said and i swear he looked almost embarrassed may i borrow a kitchen knife maggie may she narrowed her eyes at him but nodded aye he took one of the long wickedlooking chopping blades and laid a finger down the flat of the blade the silver of the blade fogged instantly rhyss face shone in the shiny surface do you know how much blood ive had to waste trying to get you i did not think i was carrying only enchanted blades and again i had the rare treat of seeing doyle shamefaced at not thinking of something whose blood did you use galen called mine i heal now but it still hurts to do it and its totally freaked the cops out how many additional men do you need doyle asked im not sure it all depends on how many of the police merry lets into the sithen i went to stand by doyle so rhys could see me better how many police are there counting the local cops or the feds rhys asked feds i said you mean fbi yep i didnt call them into this they say you called an agent gillett i called him but not to invite the fbi well agent gillett called the local contingent of feds and invited them to the party he told them or implied that you wanted federal help are you calling to ask if the feds get to come inside not exactly im calling because the area around the faerie lands is federal property and the feds are trying to tell the locals they have no right to be here please tell me youre exaggerating i said his image blurred for a moment before i realized hed moved his head im not exaggerating we have a major minesbiggerthanyours contest starting out here can you put the head agent on no do you have any idea how many times i had to cut myself to get enough blood on the blade to write that message none of them are going to come near this blade if you want to talk to the humans you are going to have to pick a more mundane method of communication though i dont think a phone call will do it what do you suggest doyle asked get the princess out here because shes the one who made the calls what little credibility i had with them vanished into the bloodsoaked snow theyre afraid of me now he sighed hard enough that it fogged the blade for a moment id forgotten that look in a humans eyes it was a part of being cromm cruach that i didnt miss forgive me for making such measures necessary doyle said the princess and i will be there soon see you then and the blade went back to just brightly polished metal your agent gillett misunderstood you i think i shook my head he didnt misunderstand he hasnt seen me in person since i was eighteen or nineteen hes reacting as if im still that person he hopes to push his way into this investigation doyle said i nodded you dont want to make the feds angry at us galen said theres a chance that the local police lab might need a little more help with something they find tonight he began walking to me forcing mug to raise her face and adjust her balance it was a good point a good clearheaded point i smiled and went to him and touched his face i touched the cheek opposite the one mug sat by always looking to make peace he laid his hand over mine pressing it against his cheek just to keep as much of it as i can i went up on tiptoe and he bent down so i could lay a gentle kiss upon his mouth mug made a sound not a bad sound almost a yummy sound like she liked being this close to both of us give us room mug i said she pouted but flew off i let myself lean into him for a moment let his strong arms wrap around me if we lived in different times gentler times galen would have been perfectif peace was truly what we were after but it wasnt not exactly what will you do about the fbi doyle understood that i wasnt going to do exactly what galen had suggested ill go introduce myself to the local agent and give him a message to take back to gillett and what will that message be he asked that im not a child anymore and he cant manipulate me like one frost frowned you invited human science into our sithen to help solve these murders that is all well and good but i know enough of their system to agree with galen we cannot afford to alienate them completely because we may need them later i said frost nodded yes it was rare for galen and frost to agree so completely which meant they were probably right i will do my best not to offend the fbi but if we go out there and appear weak they wont leave and they will delay everything we do not have time for everyone to play turf wars and besides this is our turf then let us go make that point to the authorities doyle said both local and federal he actually offered me his arm and i took it feeling the solidness of muscle underneath the leather of his jacket i realized then that my winter coat was still back at the airport unless someone had thought to rescue it i was going to need something to wear out into the december cold i wondered whose coat id borrow we sent onilwyn to find a healer i still didnt know whether to believe what he had said had he come ahead of us to curry my favor or had he something else in mind something more sinister or maybe i was just looking for an excuse not to have sex with him maybe or maybe onilwyn had earned my distrust chapter doyle and frost escorted me back to my room for fresh clothes and warmer ones i dont know whose cloak ii borrowed but it fit me the hem barely brushing the floor of my room the fur was cream and amber and a gold that was almost auburn it was truly beautiful but i felt about it the way i usually felt about fur coats i thought the fur would have looked better on the animal it belonged to id actually tried to argue that i wanted a leather coat or something out of wool but since it had been centuries since the sidhe had had domestic animals of their own wool and leather were in short supply besides frost assured me that when it was killed they had eaten it what was it i asked id never seen anything with fur quite this color troll he said i stopped petting the fur id never seen a troll but i knew they were a type of fey and though not the brightest they still had culture were still people thats not exactly an animal thats more like cannibalism he never said it was an animal doyle said you did shall we go the police are waiting if i have a problem wearing animal fur didnt it occur to either of you that wearing something made out of what amounts to one of us would bother me even more frost sighed and settled back into a huge black chair which unfortunately matched the new decor the queen had put in my room it looked like a set for a gothic porn movie or a funeral where the corpse was going to get a little too much attention i killed the troll the fur is a trophy i dont understand your problem with wearing it frost looked ghost pale against the black leather chair and strangely decadent in his fur coat his anklelength silverfox coat had made it back from the airport it made me think that the leather coats had gone missing because no one was certain who they belonged to and the fur stayed because who else but one of my men would have a fulllength fur coat that would fit over a set of shoulders that broad i turned to doyle it would be like wearing a persons skin for a coat doyle grabbed my arm his grip was bruising and his face held the anger that his hand pressed against my flesh you are a princess of the unseelie court you will rule us someday you cannot show this much weakness not if you expect to survive his black eyes held bits of brilliant color like psychedelic fireflies there was an instant of vertigo and then i was on solid ground in my snow boots and i could look into his eyes and not be swayed if hed done it on purpose it might not have been so easily cast aside but it was his anger that brought his power not his will anger is easier to avoid than force of will frost had pushed to his feet doyle it is not such a large problem as all that he sounded uncertain and i knew why this was doyle their captain the immobile unfeeling darkness he did not have fits of temper ever doyle jerked me close to his body and i felt the creeping line of energy as his power began to unfold he snarled into my face wont wear the skins of our honored enemies the police await us our men stand in the cold and you dont like your coat such delicate sensibilities for someone who just fucked a stranger on the floor in front of us all i stared at him openmouthed too astonished to do or say anything doyle frost came to stand near us his hand moving toward me as if he would take me away from the darkness but he let his hand fall back because frost like me wasnt certain what doyle would do if he tried to wrest me from him he was behaving so unlike himself that i was afraid and i think so was frost doyle threw his head back and screamed it was a sound of such anguish such utter loneliness the sound ended on a howl that raised the hairs on my body he released me abruptly and half threw me against frost frost caught me and turned me so that his broad shoulders were between me and his captain doyle collapsed to the floor in a pool of black leather his braid curling like a serpent around his legs it took me a moment to realize that he was sobbing frost and i looked at each other neither of us had a clue as to what was happening to our stoic darkness i moved toward him but frost held me back and shook his head he was right but it made my chest tight to hear such broken sounds coming from doyle frost knelt beside him and laid a white hand on doyles dark shoulder my captain doyle what ails you doyle covered his face with his hands and hunched over until his hands were nearly flat to the ground he curled in upon himself and his voice came thick with tears and thicker with anger i cannot do it he raised up on hands and knees his head hanging down i cannot bear it he looked up and grabbed frosts arm much as hed grabbed mine almost pleading i cannot go back to what i was here i cannot stand at her side and watch another take her i am not that strong or that good frost nodded and drew the other man into his arms he held him tight and fierce and the face he showed to me was raw with sorrow i had missed something something important something had happened not just to doyle but to frost as well this was not his typical moodiness this was mourning but what did they mourn what has happened i asked doyle shook his head pressed into frosts shoulder she doesnt understand she doesnt know what it means what fear was beginning to tickle my stomach march up my spine my skin was cool with the beginnings of dread frost looked at me and i realized that there were unshed tears glittering in his eyes the ring has chosen your king meredith what are you talking about i asked mistral doyle said raising his head so i could see his face the ring has chosen mistral and i cannot let him have you i stared at him what are you babbling about there is only one way for my king to be chosen and i am not with child are you certain of that frost asked his face was so calm empty of the emotional turmoil i would have expected from him it was almost as if with doyle fallen to pieces he had to hold himself together better than was his wont yes i mean i thought about what hed said its too early to be certain doyle shook his head hard enough that his heavy braid rustled against the leather the ring has never come to life for any of us you have never had such sex with any of us what else could it mean but that he is the rings choice i dont know but in the face of his pain i didnt know what to say i looked from one to the other of them their belief was plain on their faces i looked at them huddled together light and darkness entwined and my chest was tight it was suddenly hard to breathe the room felt hot and close if i was pregnant from mistral i would lose them both of them i would be bound to mistral and i would be monogamous to him and him alone the sex had been good maybe great but it was just sex and i dont love him the moment i said it i knew it was a childs plea a childs wish a queen does not marry for love doyles deep voice held the edge of tears but wait i thought the ring found your true love your perfect match it does frost said nicca and biddy are completely gone on each other i said they look at each other as if there is no one else in the world they both nodded frost said it was always thus with the ones the ring chose but mistral and i are not looking at each other that way you did not see his face afterwards doyle said i did as did i frost said i waved it away i was the first sex hes had in centuries and it was magical sex powerdriven sex that is heady stuff any man would look at me that way but it was lust not love frost frowned at me doyle just stared as if his emotions had emptied him i certainly dont feel that way about mistral frost looked positively suspicious you do not truly i shook my head if the ring had chosen him then id be in love with him right frost nodded i do not feel that way about mistral how can you not want what we saw in the hallway doyle asked in a voice that had gone almost empty of emotion as if it had all been too much for him it was great but has it occurred to either of you that maybe the sex was that magical because it is the first time i have had sex inside faerie while wearing the ring doyle blinked and tried to focus i watched him fighting off the despair that was trying to numb him frost spoke for them both you have had sex inside faerie with one of us surely i shook my head i do not believe so and if i have i wasnt wearing the ring even in los angeles i often didnt wear the ring during sex because the power was too unpredictable doyle said he looked up at me were we fools to lock it away the ring on my finger pulsed once as if squeezing my hand i swallowed hard and nodded the ring thinks so doyle rubbed at the tear tracks on his skin you truly do not love mistral no you could still be pregnant he said the ring does fertility but it does more than that frost said if meredith does not love mistral then perhaps he is not the match for her does he think he is i watched doyle collect himself gathering all that dark reserve most likely i know that rhys does for he said so frost said does galen he was much besotted with the rings power the men that were besotted will most likely not be thinking that clearly only you rhys doyle and mistral himself did not seem drunk with power mistral was a part of the magic rhys did not appear in time but why the two of you they looked at each other and it was frost who spoke and doyle who would not look at me the ring has no power over you if you are already in love if it is true love doyle said and then he did look at me and i almost wished he had not his eyes held the pain that he had let me glimpse the pain that must have begun to grow when none of them had made me pregnant in los angeles i looked at the two of them and for the first time i realized that if it was a choice between the throne or losing these two men i wasnt certain what i would choose i wasnt certain i was queen enough to sacrifice that much but as long as cel lived he would see me dead and i could not give the rest of faerie to him even if he swore to leave me and the ones i loved alive i could not give my people over to him he made andais look sane and kindhearted i could not give us over to cels sadism i was too much my fathers daughter to do it but i stood there and felt the world sink down to nothing at the thought of losing doyle and frost i thought of something and said so the fact that galen was besotted means that he is not in love not true love they looked startled glanced at each other then both nodded i think the youngling would argue frost said but yes that is what it means i tried the thought that my sweet gentle galen would be in someone elses arms and the thought did not fill me with regret in fact it filled me with a certain peace to know that somewhere out there the ring would find him someone so that he would not mourn me i smiled why do you smile doyle asked because the thought does not hurt i went to them and touched fingertips to both their faces the thought of losing the two of you that is like a wound through my heart i cupped their cheeks but was careful not to touch frosts face with the ring i wanted to touch them without the magic interfering doyles skin was actually warmer than normal for humans had been since the night hed rediscovered he could shapeshift into animal form frosts skin was a little cooler than normal for humans it wasnt always so but often he felt cool to the touch id first noticed it in los angeles after he too had found some of his godhead through the chalices power i held them hot and cold light and dark and wondered if there truly was a man in faerie who would make me forget them and turn loveblinded eyes to someone else i valued this love that we had built slowly over weeks and months it had taken effort and trust and i knew that even if all the magic in the world died i would still love them and after what they had shown me tonight i thought they would still love me as well i moved their faces until they touched so i could lay a kiss half on one and half on the other i bent over them with my face between theirs i whispered the truth against the silk of frosts hair and the warmth of doyles skin to have you in my bed for the rest of my life i would give up faerie the throne all that i am or all that i might be doyles arm found me first but frost followed and they pulled me to my knees enveloped me against their bodies pressed me hard and safe against them doyle spoke with his face pressed to the top of my head if there were anyone else worthy of the throne i would let you he laid his cheek against my hair his grip was almost painful in its fierceness for the scent of your hair on my pillow i would trade my life but i have served this court too long to give it into the hands of cel frosts hands trailed down my body idly tracing the edge of my hip under the pants id put on the stories the princes guards have told he shivered hands convulsing against my body i pushed away enough to see their faces i thought the guards were too terrified of cel to tattle on him doyle pulled me in against them again but turned me so that i half sat and half lay against their laps some of the princes guard have access to human newspapers and magazines doyle said they have noticed that your guards seem to be having a much better time than either the queens ravens or the princes cranes i still cant get used to hearing them called cranes that was my fathers bird his guard many of them belonged to essuss guard frost said he held my hand in his they were simply given to cel after essuss death were they given a choice i asked at the time the least of my worries had been my fathers guard for had they not failed him had they not allowed him to be killed now i wondered how many of them would have dropped their vows as royal guard if theyd been given a chance doyle cupped the side of my face brought my attention to his face it was your sending for the other men last night that has sent some of cels birds to speak to us about life under him why did that loosen their tongues it showed that you cared for all your guard not just the ones you like such caring is not something the cranes have seen in many a year i could feel frosts body shudder against mine i thought what we endured by the queens hand was bad enough he shook his head such stories we cannot give the court over to him meredith doyle said i believe him truly mad being imprisoned and tortured isnt going to improve that i said no he said tell her the rest frost said doyle sighed you remember that the queen allowed cels need to be slacked by one of his guards i nodded yes and that night there was an attempt on both my life and the queens yes but we are still not absolutely certain cel ordered it it could simply have been those loyal to him moving in desperation to rescue him before he goes so mad that everyone sees him for what he is you think the nobles would refuse to follow him if he tried to do to the court what he has done to his guard yes doyle said i settled back in the curves of their bodies fur and leather what has he done no meredith doyle said perhaps later when we have the luxury of time and hours to go before we would sleep none of it is comforting bedtime stories we have a murder investigation trust me we wont see sleep for hours i said what you need to know doyle said is that he has fixated on you fixated how i asked they exchanged another look doyle shook his head but frost said she needs to know doyle then tell her why must i always be the bearer of such news frost blinked at him and fought not to show on his face what he and i were thinking we hadnt known that bringing bad news bothered doyle he had been the queens darkness and the darkness could speak hideous truth and be unmoved or so it had seemed it was as if the one outburst had stripped doyle of some part of himself frost said as you will then he looked down at me he called one of the women guards by your name and swore that if his mother is so determined to have you with child it will be his seed in your body i looked into that handsome face and wanted to ask if he were joking but i knew he was not it was my turn to shudder i would rather die im not certain he would care doyle said softly what do you mean by that one of the lesser fey died during one of cels rapes doyle sighed again and a look came into his eyes i hadnt seen oftenfear he liked that she died during the sex he continued to rape her corpse until her body became quite decayed i felt the blood drain from my face or so his guard say frost said you saw their eyes do you truly believe they lied frost let his breath out in a long sigh and shook his head no he bent over me hugging me burying me beneath a spill of silver hair i am sorry meredith but we felt you needed to know i was afraid of cel before i said be more afraid now doyle said someone like that cannot be handed the keys to the unseelie court especially now that power seems to be returning to us with power we are more dangerous too dangerous to be given over to a madman power returns because of meredith frost said yes but once power is reborn in the sidhe it will be like a gun it will not care how it is used the goddess may abandon us forever if the power is misused i said i thought as much but think of the damage we could do before she took back her new gifts we sat on the floor and contemplated new possibilities for even larger disasters doyle hugged me tight then stood up and shook himself like a dog he settled the leather coat around his tall frame and said i thought to keep the news of cel and his new madness until after we had brought the police inside but he slid the dark glasses over his eyes so that he was the tall dark inscrutable darkness only the silver shine of his earrings gave him color we will escort you to the police and the fbi i am sorry for losing control as i did princess and for delaying us further i let frost help me to my feet one fit in over a thousand years i think youre overdue doyle shook his head it is my fault that rhys and the police are waiting in the cold inexcusable i touched his arm but it was hard muscle encased in leather as if he could not allow himself any softness i dont think its inexcusable if she comforts us again we will be even later frost said doyle smiled a quick flash of teeth it is nice to be comforted instead of punished he held up the fur cloak please just for now we will find something else more to your liking but just for now i still didnt like the idea of wearing the cloak but after what id just heard about cel and his guard it seemed a lesser evil i allowed him to put the cloak around me how does it look i asked the wall quivered like a horses skin when a fly lands doyle shoved me behind him frost already had his sword naked in his hand doyle aimed a gun at the rock wall a full length mirror surrounded by a gilt frame floated up through the stone shining in the darkness of the room i peered at it around doyles body my pulse in my throat where did that come from doyle still had a gun pointed very steadily at the bright surface i do not know almost all the fey could use mirrors to make a sort of phone call doyle and some of the other sidhe could travel through mirrors we stood waiting for a figure to appear for something terrible to happen but the mirror just hung on the wall as if someone had put it there to be a mirror and nothing more the tip of frosts sword lowered doyle glanced at us why did it appear who sent it frost stepped closer to the mirror meredith look at yourself in the mirror doyle looked skeptical but he moved so i could see myself the red and gold of the fur went well with my hair and skin and brought out the gold in my eyes with the hood up i looked delicate and a little ethereal like something between a victorian christmas card and a barbarian princess well a small barbarian princess now thank the sithen for the use of the mirror and say you no longer need it i frowned at him but did as he suggested thank you for the mirror sithen i do not need it right now the mirror stayed on the wall as if it had always been there please sithen a mirror could be used to harm her please take it away frost said it felt as if the very air shrugged then the wall quivered again and the mirror began to sink back into the wall when the wall was empty stone once more i let out a breath i hadnt realized i was holding are you saying the mirror appeared because i asked how i looked hush frost said then he nodded now that doyle said is interesting the sithen hasnt answered to whims since frost stopped as if trying to think how long long enough my friend that i too am not certain when the last time was so is this good i said or not good doyle said but dangerous frost added doyle nodded i would be careful what i said aloud from now on meredith an idle comment could have grave consequences if the sithen has truly returned to that much life what do you mean the sithen is a living thing but it does not think like any living thing i have ever known it will interpret what you say in its own way you ask how you look and it gives you a mirror who knows what it might offer you depending on what you said what if i yelled for help would it do anything useful i asked i do not know doyle said i have heard of it giving you objects you asked for but never touching people but there are enchanted items locked within its walls things that simply vanished some theorize that they did not go back to the gods but inside the very walls there are things that i would not want appearing before you without more help than this more help than you and frost he nodded i started to ask what object could possibly be so dangerous that the killing frost and the queens darkness could not keep me safe but i didnt one disaster at a time it was almost as if something wanted to keep us here tonight distracted by one semiimportant event after another i shook my head enough we are leaving now rhys and the police are waiting when we stepped out the door we were in the main corridor just inside the outer doors my room should have been three levels down and nowhere near this area the guards waiting to accompany us were staring at us as we walked out galen said that door wasnt there before no doyle said and he got everyone in formation with me in the center hidden once again behind a phalanx of guards i would have said men but at least three of them were female including biddy she and nicca would probably be useless in a fight they were still too magic befuddled but we were afraid to leave them behind i was almost certain that without someone to stop them they would have sex and until i cleared it with the queen that was an automatic death by torture for both of them doyle did make them stop holding hands he thought the police might get the wrong idea cathbodua and dogmaela had joined our little band i suddenly had three women in my personal entourage who might have owed more allegiance to cel than to me doyle made some noises about me needing ladies in waiting and wouldnt it be useful if they were also trained warriors but i knew the real reason we took them with us because the queen might at any moment change her mind and demand them back into cels service we took them out into the snow to meet the police because they were safer with us than without us chapter i didnt see the police but i heard them a rumble of deep male voices sound carried so much better on those still bitterly cold nights my cheeks were stinging and my breath had fogged and frozen in the fur of the hood barinthus had kept me warm on the walk to the faerie mounds after the assassination attempt but i walked on my own power now the snow was knee high for me and my boots didnt quite keep it from soaking into the knees of my jeans i tried to call the feel of the summer sun to put inside my shield and help keep back the cold but it was as if i couldnt remember what summer felt like the moonless night was clear with a thousand stars flung across the darkness like bits of glittering ice diamond glints across black velvet i focused on the fight to lift one foot then the next and struggle through drifts that the taller sidhe walked through effortlessly it was undignified for a princess to fall on her face but it took effort to keep from doing it i suppose that struggling through the snow wasnt exactly dignified either but that i could do nothing about but it was biddy who stumbled nicca caught her before she hit the snow i heard her apologize i dont know whats wrong im so cold stop all of you stop i said everyone obeyed some of them looking out at the snow fingers near weapons it was galen who asked whats wrong merry are biddy and i the only ones here with human blood i think so i tried to conjure the feel of summer sun and i couldnt remember what it was like doyle had worked his way back to me what is wrong check biddy and me for a spell a spell that attacks only human blood he pulled off one of his black gloves and put his hand just above my face not touching skin but searching my aura my shielding my magic he growled low and soft but the sound raised the hair on the back of my neck i take it you found something he nodded then he turned to biddy who was half fainting in niccas arms i am sorry doyle i am truly better than this it is a spell he told her and lifted off her helmet to lay his hand above her face he handed the helmet to nicca and turned to me unable to hide the spark of angry color in his eyes he was fighting down his power raised by anger anger at himself most likely for letting yet another spell slip under his nose we had some truly subtle spells being worked on us one of us would have noticed something big but such small spells were harder to guard against it is tied to mortal blood it simply sucks at your energy and fills you with cold why is biddy more affected than merry nicca asked he was covered completely in a thick cloak except for his wings they were held tight together as if they would stay warmer that way and maybe they did he was warmblooded moth wings did not change that i answered him shes halfhuman im less than a fourth human if it is seeking human blood shes got more than i have are the human police affected hawthorne asked doyle put his hand back over me and this time i felt a warm pulse of magic shiver over my shields it is like a contagion it was put on either biddy or the princess then jumped from one to the other if we do not remove it it will spread to the police i looked up at him speaking with the warmth of his magic against my skin like breath what would it do to fullblooded humans it made a warrior of the sidhe stumble in the snow she is disoriented and would be useless in a fight frost was staring off into the darkness he and another fringe of guards were all staring out into the cold night his voice carried to me is this the beginning of a more overt attack who would be so bold as to attack the human guards amatheon wondered aloud hed been eager to come out into the cold anything to be farther away from the queen i think but i remembered again that he had been cels creature for centuries did a few acts of honor and kindness erase centuries of allegiance and as close to cel as he had been he had to have witnessed some of the horrors the female guards spoke of didnt he i made a mental note to ask him later with doyle and frost at my back onilwyn was inside the faerie mound because he had not recovered from the beating maggie may and i had given him cold iron forces even the sidhe to heal human slow him i did not trust at all amatheon i was beginning to trust was i wrong to trust him of course the question itself meant i didnt trust him not really who indeed i said and fought not to look at him not to let him know with body language that i wondered if it was him either i betrayed myself or he felt insecure because he said i will make any oath that i did not know of this you said you were a man without honor adair said a man without honor has no oath enough doyle said we will not squabble amongst ourselves not this close to the humans doyles right we will discuss this later i raised my face up to him and said can you remove it so that biddy and i do not infect the police i can then do it and let us get this done you sound angry galen said i am tired of whoever is doing all this tired of these games it is a good sign in a way doyle said i looked at him what do you mean it means our murderer fears the human police fears they may find him where our magic has failed he stuffed his gloves in the pocket of his coat and slid my hood off so that the cold air spilled around my face i shivered i am afraid i will have to make you colder before i am done i nodded get this off of me and i will warm myself he pushed my cloak back the cold rushed in stealing the shell of warmth that the cloak had made i fought not to shiver as he spread his hands over me not touching even so much as my clothing but caressing just above my body his power shivered over my aura and it felt as if he scooped something off of me almost like flicking an insect off my skin he raised his hands upward cupped as if he truly held something he called that sickly green fire to his hands it was the painful flame that id seen eat along a body it could cause death if you were mortal or excruciating pain and madness in the immortal now he used it to burn away the spell that had clung to me rhyss voice came from behind us whats wrong he had a gun naked in his hand but held along his body so the police probably wouldnt see it from a distance he saw the green light and said what is it with a new urgency in his voice what am i not sensing galen answered him someone put a spell on merry on both the human bloods frost said it would have been contagious to the human police doyle said the green flame vanished leaving the night a little darker he turned to biddy where she half sagged in niccas arms let her go nicca she will fall only to her knees in the snow it wont hurt her doyles voice was surprisingly gentle nicca still held her against him his wings flared out once then clamped tight again its all right nicca biddy said in a soft voice a little breathy doyle will help me it was hawthorne who came to him and began to gently draw him away from her let the captain help your lady nicca allowed himself to be drawn away but when biddy collapsed into the snow he moved to catch her and only hawthorne and adair on each side kept him from grabbing her before her knees hit the snow rhys gave a soft whistle that would have done bad things to our nice policemen yes doyle said as he knelt in the snow his greatcoat spreading out like a pool of darkness against the white he passed his hands above biddy much as hed done me but he hesitated close to her belly that someone could lay such a thing on her while she wore this much metal he shook his head it speaks of great power or mixed blood i said those of us with a little human or brownie or a few other things can handle metal and magic better than a pureblooded sidhe his mouth twitched thank you for reminding me because you are exactly right can you trail it back to its owner i asked doyle cocked his head to the side the way a dog does when it is puzzled by something yes his hands tensed above biddys body i can remove it but i can also add magic of my own and force it to fly back to its owner you mean not just track it but make it run back home rhys asked yes you have not been able to do that in a very long time frost said but i can do it now doyle said i can feel it in my hands my stomach all i have to do is remove it and add my power at the moment of its release it will be a chase to keep up with it but it will work who will go with you frost asked i must stay with the princess agreed i will go usna said no dog can outrun a cat doyle gave him one of those fierce smiles done i too will go it was cathbodua once a goddess of battle now a refugee from cels guard her cloak was formed of black feathers so that it sometimes seemed as if her fine black hair was part of the cloak and if you looked at her from the edges of your eyes her hair looked as if it were made of feathers she was cathbodua battle scald crow and though diminished in power she was still one of the few in the courts who had kept her original name rumor had it that she had not been as abused by cel for he feared her dogmaela who stood in armor next to her had been nicknamed cels dog because she was given every awful task he could find she had publicly denied him sex and hed never forgiven her cathbodua had done the same thing and not suffered overly much for it there was something about her standing there in the snow all black and feathered with some air of power that would give a braver man than cel pause you think you can keep up birdie usna said she gave him a smile cold enough to freeze the smile from his face dont worry for me kittycat i wont be the tail end of this race usna made a catlike growl remember who the predator is here birdie her smiled widened and filled her eyes with a fierce joy me she said us doyle said keep her safe frost i will oh dont mind me rhys said im not fast enough to keep up and apparently i cant be trusted with the safety of the princess help her with the humans rhys doyle glanced at cathbodua and usna are you prepared cathbodua said i am ready usna said always doyle turned back to biddy this may hurt do it she braced herself hands in the snow doyle flexed his hands so that they looked like black claws against the silver of her armor biddy let out a sharp breath his magic flared even through the shields that i held in place to keep me from being overwhelmed by the magic of faerie her aura her metaphysical armor flared like a flash of light that covered her body doyle plunged his hands into that flare of light and came out with a round ball of light but the light wasnt the clean yellowwhite light of biddys aura it was a dark sickly yellow with an edge of orange flame to it doyle cupped his hands more closely around it until the flickering of the orange flames spilled out from between his fingers he stood carefully as if he held a very full bowl of very hot soup he stepped around biddy and the other guards spilled away so that there was nothing between him and the mounds but empty snow usna and cathbodua moved up on either side of him usna undid his long cloak and stood dressed mostly in leather his breath fogging in the cold his face eager eyes shining with anticipation cathbodas face was like pale marble perfect beautiful and cold far from flinging her cloak off she gathered it more tightly around her i realized that her breath did not fog in the cold i had a moment to wonder why then doyle flung his hands skyward and the flame was now a bird a falcon made of red and orange flame it flashed shining wings once twice to gain altitude doyle undid his long black cloak and let it fall to the snow he undid his weapons and flung them all to the snow the falcon beat its wings twice more and stared down at us all with eyes made of fire an arrogant look as if to say you will never catch me then it was gone streaking like some handsized comet flaming into the night doyle was simply gone i know he ran but it was like trying to watch darkness fall you never really saw it happen he was a tall dark shape loping over the snow cathbodua was with him though she didnt seem to be running it was almost as if the long feathered cloak floated above the snow and she with it usna trailed them both but not by much his multicolored hair shone in the starlight sparkling like colored snow as he ran graceful and full out behind them he has his work cut out for him rhys said yes frost said you cannot outrun the darkness and anger travels on the very wind dogmaela said anger i made it a question she is the scald crow she is the dissatisfaction that drives men to quarrel she starts the fight then feeds on it biddy said as nicca helped her to her feet she did once frost said but that is no more you think not dogmaela said cathbodua still enjoys a good quarrel make no mistake about it killing frost she grows bored with so much peace this is not peace frost said perhaps she said but it is not battle either lets hope not rhys said and now children lets go talk to the nice policemen before they freeze their badges off badges dogmaela said is that some new slang for balls rhys grinned at her and when we walk over there they will all get their badges out and flash them at the princess frost and i both said rhys at the same time dogmaela said what an odd custom she was a literalist with almost no sense of humor rhys was going to hurt himself with this one i explained the truth to her as we all walked over to the parking lot she gave him a dirty look he smiled at her like a lascivious angel behave yourself i told him under my breath i have behaved myself he said softly when youve talked to the head fed youll think i was a saint why because hes not bleeding i looked at him and tried to decide if he was teasing me too his face said no how bad could one fbi agent be as the old saying goes we were about to find out chapter the police all flavors stood in the december cold maybe some of them had been in their vehicles trying to stay warm and only got out when they saw us coming but somehow they had the feel of people whod been standing around in the cold for a while if it wasnt for us then why werent they in their cars in vans with the heaters on because their chiefs were standing out in the cold you didnt sit in a nice warm car while your officers stood ankle deep in snow wed had the parking area cleared off but apparently snow had blown back across the surface i recognized major walters by the broadshouldered square of him and his height the man he was standing almost toe to toe with was shorter by at least five inches and no one i knew but id have bet good money he was fbi and the way he was yelling at walters probably the head fed when id told special agent raymond gillett not to come i hadnt specified that he not send the feds i would remember to be more specific if i ever spoke to him again rhys tried to get their attention but it was frosts voice that cut across the squabbling princess meredith nicessus he announced the words echoing over the cold still air they stopped in midargument and turned to us in surprise almost as if theyd forgotten i was coming then they both started trying to talk to me at the same time i held up my hands letting them slip out of the cloak gentlemen gentlemen please one at a time they both tried to be the one at a time i settled it for them major walters why are you still here at the parking lot why havent you come to the door i smiled as i said it even with my eyes he jerked a thumb at the smaller man he wont let us step a foot off the parking lot says its federal land and that makes this case his i turned still smiling to the fed in question and you are special agent john marquez and he actually bowed its an honor to meet you princess meredith i tried not to laugh the bow was overdoing it i wish i could say the same special agent marquez he looked up puzzlement on his darkly handsome face have we done something to offend you your majesty i shook my head majesty is only for the ruler and im not it yet i called major walters and asked him to bring down his people but i did not call the fbi so im a little puzzled why you are here faerie land is federal land princess that makes these crimes our jurisdiction as ive pointed out to the major here ah but technically its faerie land and neither of you has any jurisdiction here marquez smiled condescendingly but you called for police help and since the mounds are on federal land that means us i shook my head only if we ask for your help until that moment its our business he shook his head you did ask us princess special agent gillett got your call and he referred it to our local office id figured as much but it was still disappointing to know it for certain i made the call to gillett out of courtesy and for old times sake i realize now i was wrong to have called him at all but we are here now and we have forensic facilities that the local st louis police cant match a woman broke away from the knot of locals she had blond hair that was a little too perfectly yellow to be real and human dark glasses cut a pretty face so that it took you a moment to notice her eyes were large and longlashed im dr caroline polaski head medical examiner for st louis county and i take exception to that you cant compare your lab with ours marquez said i did my internship with you so yes actually i can internship then you werent good enough to make the grade she gave him a very unfriendly look check your own records i left because my husband got a better job here and i got offered the run of the place at your shop id have been someones flunkie because you werent good enough to be head of our shop marquez said this was getting us nowhere stop it i said they looked at me you want to know who is in charge here thats what all the arguing is about correct polaski and marquez nodded walters just looked at me i smiled thats an easy question ladies and gentlemen i am marquez gave me a look that even in the dim light said plainly that i was a little girl and shouldnt try to play with the big boys now princess your call for help indicates that you dont think you and your people are capable of handling a double homicide i am in charge of this investigation agent marquez i am glad for your offer of assistance and i will gladly accept but let there be no confusion among any of us i let my gaze take in walters and the medical examiner i am in charge and anyone who has a problem with that doesnt step one foot onto our land marquez argued as id expected him to you are not an officer of any kind princess no offense but this investigation needs more than just a private detective in charge of it my private detective license isnt valid outside of california agent marquez then you have no legal standing to take control i stepped into him so fast and unexpectedly that he actually took a step back before he caught himself i looked up at him inches taller and let him look into the delicate oval of my face framed by all that soft fur no legal standing marquez i am princess meredith nicessus the only person who outranks me here on this land is the queen of air and darkness herself you and your people are here on my sufferance and i think ive suffered enough you cant mean that youre going to send us all away because i hurt your feelings goddess he had an attitude not at all im going to take major walters and his people with us and let them do their jobs and when they cant handle it and you need our help you may not get it princess and we might need their help i hoped not but we might i had an idea i turned to walters do you have a cell phone he looked a little uncertain but he held it out to me can i make a longdistance call on it who are you going to call washington dc walters took in a deep breath be my guest i dialed a number that id had the queens secretary get for me before we came out here id hoped not to use it but id seen enough territorial disputes in la to know that the feds and the locals could do more harm to an investigation than good if they got into a serious pissing contest marquez was making this one serious after hearing my initial greeting and request marquez said you are not calling the president of the united states no i was on hold im not marquez frowned harder at me a womans voice came on the phone and i said mrs president how good to talk to you again marquezs eyebrows went up id first met joanne billings when her husband was a senator theyd come to my fathers funeral and their regrets had seemed the most sincere of the political people there that day after that senator billings and his wife had made several visits to faerie and i realized that joanne billings was a faeriephile my father had not raised me to ignore a political advantage and besides i liked joanne she was openminded about the unseelie courts unfavorable press and made a point of talking us up in a positive light when she could we exchanged holiday cards and i made certain she was invited to my official engagement party the one for public consumption she had actually visited me at college once without her husband just to see how i was getting along and by that time she and her husband were trying to get the young vote pictures of her with americas faerie princess didnt hurt i understood that and didnt think badly of her for it i had even invited her to my graduation and they had both come wed gotten photo ops together one of the last things id done before vanishing from faerie and the public eye was to appear onstage with them at a couple of rallies we exchanged small talk then she said i assume you didnt call at this hour for a social reason no i gave her the briefest sketch of the situation she was silent for a second or two what do you need from me i explained some of what marquez had said and added and he threatened that if i didnt let him in now he would make certain the fbi didnt help us later if we needed their expertise to solve the crime could you talk to him for me she laughed you could have called the diplomatic service talked to your ambassador you could have called a dozen people but you called me first you did call me first didnt you yes i said she laughed again and i knew she liked that i had called her first i also knew she liked that i hadnt asked her to talk to her husband put him on the line she said and her voice had already taken on that cultured almost purring edge that it had on radio or television i handed the phone to marquez he looked a little pale around the edges his end of the conversation was mostly yes maam no maam of course not maam he handed the phone back to me managing to look angry and sick at the same time i think hell behave himself now she said thank you very much joanne when youve finally picked a husband you better invite me to the engagement party she was quiet for a second then said i am sorry about what happened with griffin i saw the tabloid photos he gave to the reporters i have no words to say how sorry i am that he turned out to be a such a bastard im okay about it good for you and you will get an invitation to the engagement party and to the wedding she laughed again with honest delight all of faerie decked out for a wedding i can hardly wait thank you joanne we hung up and i turned to marquez is there anything else you wanted to know special agent marquez no ive had about all i can stand tonight thank you very much princess meredith he said and gave me a look that said id made an enemy gee an enemy that wouldnt try to kill me it was almost refreshing you and your lab will be available if we need your expertise i asked keeping my voice neutral i promised mrs billings we would be great i said then turned to major walters he was trying not to look pleased and failing he practically beamed at me local police spend a lot of time getting their hats handed to them by the feds for once the shoe was on the other foot and walters was enjoying it he waited until wed walked out into the snow with a circle of my guards hiding us from the feds before he burst out laughing a man of iron selfcontrol chapter it was frost who placed his hand against the snow covered hill and called the door the opening appeared with a peal of music that made all the policemen smile even major walters it was the door to faerie all humans go through smiling but they dont always come out that way inside this hollow hill was a human who was going out in a body bag the door stretched wide and bright though i knew the light was actually dim it looked bright because wed been walking in the snowy dark the police hit that dimly lit hallway and made exclamations of surprise cops do not show surprise at least not those who have been on the job awhile cops are the best ever at jaded tiredness boredom been there done that didnt want the tshirt one of the uniforms said oh my god the colors are so beautiful the walls were grey and empty there was no color major walters stared up at those bare walls as if he saw something indescribably beautiful all their faces showed delight wonderment some oohed and aahed as if they were watching fireworks the guards and i looked at empty grey walls rhys did you forget to use the oil on the nice policemen the reporters didnt need it he said how was i to know that hardboiled police and forensic scientists would be more susceptible to faerie magic they should not be frost said what do you mean i asked the queen gave vials of oil to the guard as a precaution in case the reporters became befuddled by the magic that is intrinsic to the sithen but it was merely a precaution the main hallways of the sithen have not affected humans in this way for more than fifty years well i said looking at the humans who were gazing around them as if the hallway were a carnival midway whatever is causing this we need it to stop or they are useless to us they cant do policework like this did a spell cause it arzhel asked as he pushed the dark fur of his cloak back from a face framed by thick brown curls that spilled down to his knees that thick mane of fur was held back from his face only by a silver circlet he was dressed in hardened leather armor sewn here and there with silver his body under the armor was tattooed with fur much as niccas had been with his wings the tattoo was so real that it made you want to pet the fur that was not there his face and most of the front of his body was bare and pale and as moonlight like my own skin it made the brown and gold of the fur look darker by contrast with his armor and cloak he could almost have passed for a human except for the eyes they were a reddish brown a color that could have been human but wasnt they werent sidhe eyes either but those of an animal of some kind id found a picture in a book once a twopage closeup of the eyes of a bear staring at the picture i knew id seen those eyes in arzhels face it is not a spell frost said we would feel it arzhel nodded have you searched for it i have as have i said crystall his voice like chimes in the wind he was still hidden behind his white cloak use the oil on them i said ears eyes mouth hands the works arzhel asked the works the princess means to make certain they can function completely unaffected by the sithen rhys said undoing his trench coat and taking a small stoppered bottle from the inner pocket of his suit jacket he worked the stopper out of the dark clay bottle then stood in front of dr polaski he asked her to take her glasses off but it was as if she couldnt hear him and maybe she couldnt he took her glasses gently off her face she blinked at him as he touched one eye just below the brow that you may see truly he said she jerked back from him then stared around at the walls she covered her eyes with her hands oh god oh god whats happening to me let me do the other eye and youll feel better rhys said just keep them closed until im done he had to push her hands down from her face but she kept her eyes closed he touched the other eyelid and said to see truly he pushed her hair back from her ears and traced the oil down the curve of one ear and then the other with the words that you may hear truly the music stopped she said and tears began to seep out from her closed lids he touched her lips so you may speak truly of what you find he put her hands palm up so you may touch and be touched truly he knelt and traced the tops of her snowsoaked boots so you may step truly and know what lies before you he stood in front of her and laid the last touch to her forehead so you may know and think truly he did more than just touch there there he laid a protective symbol for a moment i saw the flare of magic trace the cool spiral and circle on her forehead then it sank into her skin she blinked and looked around her as if she didnt quite know where she was what the hell was that welcome to faerie dr polaski rhys said and handed her back her glasses frost handed me a bottle doyle gave me his for he does not need it i took the offered bottle and wondered where doyle had gone and what he had found i would feel better if doyle or the others would contact us as would i frost said as he began to lay oil on walters i turned to the only other woman in the group she wasnt that much taller than myself which was one of the reasons i chose her when i took off the cloth cap it revealed straight brown hair tied back in a ponytail a little worse for the sock cap shed been wearing her eyes were a solid medium brown the face was a delicate triangle pretty enough but id been too much around the sidhe of late she looked unfinished to me as if her hair or eyes needed a different color to make her real i told her close your eyes she didnt hear me but it wasnt the walls she was staring at she was watching frost while he touched major walterss face i finally touched her eyes just above her open lid and she flinched away from me dr polaski can you help her hold still i asked she was one of the csu not the police polaski came to us and said carmichael this will help close your eyes and let the princess touch you carmichael seemed strangely reluctant but she did what her boss said to do she shivered under my fingers like a nervous horse skin jumping she got calmer by the time id done her hands and she seemed calm as i touched the tops of her hiking boots below the wet of her jeans when i raised up to trace her forehead her voice seemed normal id prefer a cross as the symbol she said a cross wont work i said tracing something much older on her forehead those brown eyes opened to look at me while i did it what do you mean a cross wont work we arent evil carmichael just other contrary to popular myth holy symbols wont stop our magic any more than holding up a cross would stop a blizzard from harming you oh she said and looked a little embarrassed i didnt mean to offend you its all right the church has tried to vilify us for centuries but if youre ever in need of protection from faerie id advise turning your jacket inside out instead of a prayer a prayer cant hurt but the coat turning will probably be more effective i finished the last curve of the design and stepped back from her why does turning your jacket inside out help most in faerie see only the surface change your surface and the magic has trouble finding you why she asked well it doesnt work if the person knows you really well and has never tried to deceive you never tried to deceive youwhat do you mean never tried to appear to be other than they are oh she said again i watched delight vanish from the other humans faces as the oiling was completed one policeman said i think i liked it better before now its just grey stone where does the light come from polaski asked no one really knows i told her i thought this oil was supposed to make everything look ordinary carmichael said it is i said then why is he still so damned beautiful she pointed at frost i smiled at his face going cold and arrogant it didnt make him one bit less attractive goddess had made it impossible for him to be anything else maybe ordinary is the wrong word i said the oil helps you see reality carmichael shook her head he cant be real his hair is metallic silver not grey not white silver hair cant be silver its the natural color of his hair i said should the rest of us be offended rhys asked maybe you should be ivi said but she hasnt seen most of us out of armor and cloaks he pushed the hood of his cloak back and drew off the muffler that had hidden most of his face ivis face was a little thin for my tastes and i knew his shoulders werent wide enough for me but the pale green of his hair was decorated with vines and ivy leaves as if someone had painted his namesake on his hair when the hair was free it looked like leaves blowing in the wind as he walked his eyes were the startling green of emeralds i guess if you havent been raised around people with multicolored eyes the vibrant green of his eyes was worth a stare or two carmichael seemed to think so because her gaze went to him as if she couldnt help but stare crystall swept his own cloak back to reveal hair that caught the dim light of the hall and turned it into rainbows as if his hair were a clear prism that shattered light into colors his skin was whiter than mine a white so pure it looked artificial he flung the lesser white of his cloak back over one arm and that arm was bare i had a moment to wonder what he was wearing under the long cloak and above the boots that i could see his arm shone in the light like white metal a gleam that no true flesh ever held the womans gaze went to him again as if she could not help herself stop it all of you i said leave her alone i am doing nothing to her frost said i looked at his arrogant face and knew he believed that knew that some part of him never understood how handsome he was not really the queens centuries of rejection had left their scars on our killing frost i patted his arm and turned to rhys since she seems less impressed with you and arzhel one of you gets to shepherd her through faerie me too galen said i looked at him he gave a wry smile she isnt drooling over me either which one of us do you want to assign to her rhys was shaking his head watching carmichael look from one to the other of the men the look on her face was somewhere between a kid overwhelmed in a candy store or a small animal surrounded by predators half eager yet half afraid you choose rhys youre in charge of guarding the police while theyre inside not frost hes in charge of guarding me until doyle gets back the words made me wonder again where my darkness was and where his spell had led him it was as if frost read my mind because he said i will send someone to see where he is i nodded galen he said find out where doyle is and what he has discovered i almost protested if doyle usna and cathbodua were all outgunned then galen was not enough to tip the balance or so i feared i actually took a breath to say something but galen turned to me with a smile that wasnt entirely happy its okay merry ill do whatever needs doing to bring him back safe to you i opened my mouth and he touched his fingers to my lips shhh he said and leaned in to lay a kiss where his fingers had laid their warmth you showed the world how you feel about me thats enough i dont have to own your whole heart he left us at a jog hand on his sword hilt the thin braid of his hair bouncing against his back galen i said but he didnt look back and then the hallway turned and he was gone a feeling of foreboding came over me prophecy had never been my gift but now i was suddenly so afraid i couldnt draw a good breath i grabbed frosts arm he shouldnt be alone something bad something bad is coming frost didnt argue adair crystall go with him the moment the other two men vanished around the corner the panic eased i could breathe again and something heavy dropped into my other hand the one that was still hidden under the furred cloak i grasped the heavy metal stem of the chalice i let go of frost and put both my hands under the cloak to help hold the heavy cup id never realized how heavy it was until that moment power is a burden are you all right rhys asked i nodded yes yes i did not want everyone in the hallway to see what i held but i also knew that if my panic was true it was because the chalice had warned me i had meant to tell the queen that the chalice had come to me but the time never seemed right to tell her all right she never seemed sane long enough to have a metaphysical and political discussion now the chalice had materialized in my hand and that usually meant it had an agenda something it wanted at this moment something i needed to do if it had just wanted to help galen it wouldnt have been heavy in my hand the chalice was quite capable of helping out magically without materializing so why was it here now what was about to happen the tightness between my shoulder blades said something bad i took a deep breath and used my cloak and frosts coat to give him and rhys a flash of gold metal under my cloak rhyss eye went wide and frosts face went even more arrogant more angry rhys turned surprise to that joking half smile that he wore when he wanted to hide what he was thinking it had taken me months to realize what that smile meant it was ivis voice full of laughter and with an edge of that joking that hid so much oh my ivi said and i knew that hed seen it too i half expected him to tell the rest of the hallway what hed glimpsed but he didnt he just looked at me with that surprised laughter all over his face as if he had beheld some wonderful private joke hawthorne and amatheon stood to either side of him and they said nothing amatheons pale face had gone bloodless inside the hood that he had kept in place to hide his beauty from the woman his flowerpetal eyes went wide but i doubted anyone but myself and frost could see his face past the hood hawthornes reaction or even if he had seen was hidden behind his helmet what is wrong arzhel asked amatheon said nothing i simply was not aware the princess was gifted with prophecy that is all his voice sounded a little breathy but otherwise normal maybe even a little bored you do not survive in the high courts of faerie by giving things away we are the hidden people and most of us earn that name arzhel put his head to one side as if he wasnt entirely certain he believed amatheon but he said nothing i did not know arzhel that well but i was certain hed never guess that i held the chalice under my cloak carmichael approached ivi the way youd sneak up on a statue in an art museum afraid to touch it compelled to run your hands down the smooth hard curve of it afraid someone will tell you to stop carmichael dr polaski said carmichael she touched the other womans arm but she might as well have been touching the wall for all the good it did her rhys choose someone other than ivi to watch her i said rhys grinned and moved himself between the womans hesitating hand and ivis body andais would have ordered me i like a queen who delegates shes not queen yet ivi said the bright green of his eyes still held that flash of humor that had covered his surprise whats wrong with her walters asked hed gone to help polaski taking carmichaels other arm she didnt fight them but she didnt look away from the men either shes elfstruck rhys said elfstruck walters said but that takes sex with one of you right normally i said but our history is littered with people who caught a glimpse of us in the woods and spent the rest of their lives fascinated with the fey i sighed at the looks on most of the faces that were suddenly turned to me my oath that it never occurred to me that any of you would be that susceptible to faerie the princess is right amatheon said it has been centuries since ive seen any human so overwhelmed by merely entering the land he spoke for them but his face was all for me and frost who was standing behind me amatheons face tried to ask a dozen questions that his words only hinted at if he hadnt seen this reaction in centuries what had changed id known that power was returning to the sidhe but i hadnt understood what that would mean for the humans i had so blithely invited inside what had i done and was it fixable she has to leave i said now polaski looked at me what did you people do to jeanine nothing absolutely nothing i swear it some humans are more affected by faerie than others rhys said but its usually not police or anyone thats seen too much of the harsher side of things if youre too jaded you just dont believe in faeries anymore he said it with a smile but he was having trouble not showing how worried he was i could tell or maybe i was simply projecting carmichael is new polaski said shes good but shes mostly a lab monkey a look of anguish and guilt came over her face i didnt know not to bring her we didnt know either i said its not your fault it just never occurred to any of us that anyone would be this affected by just coming through our door is this permanent walters asked i looked at the men ive only heard stories of this kind of thing so honestly i dont know i looked at the men gentlemen can you answer major walterss question truthfully absolutely truthfully ivi asked i nodded he answered with a mocking smile but i knew that the mockery was more for himself than anyone else then i am not certain what is so damned funny nothing ivi said absolutely nothing i admit to enjoying the ladys fascination because i never thought to see such instant obsession on an womans face again the humor leaked away to show some of the sadness that underlay most of ivis humora sorrow like some deep wound that cut through whatever he had once been so that all that was left of ivi was that biting humor and that sorrow that is sick polaski said his face showed that he had one other emotion left to him arrogance and how would you feel doctor if once upon a time you were so beautiful that men wept as you walked down a summers lane and then one day they no longer seemed to see you at all a flower may be beautiful all on its own but a person is never truly beautiful unless someone elses eyes show him that he is beautiful walters called over one of his uniformed officers take her back to the lab get her away from the beautiful people miller go with them take jeanine home polaski said but dont leave her alone stay with her all night when the sun comes up she may be okay i raised eyebrows at polaski i read up on some of the things that can go wrong when dealing with your people nothing i read cautioned against bringing in new people or i would have left her at the lab the innocent have always been more susceptible to us hawthorne said shes never been in love i said and was surprised to hear myself say it but she wants to be polaski gave me a funny look how did you know that i shrugged using my fingers to keep the cloak closed over the chalice ivi bent close to her face be careful what you wish for little one you may get it and not know what to do when you unwrap the bow again the words were laced with sorrow jeanine carmichael began to cry leave her alone polaski said i am leaving her with sorrow doctor not lust not happiness not beauty i am making as certain as i can that when she wakes tomorrow she will remember sorrow like a bad dream i wish that she remembers nothing that will send her seeking us again youre disturbing did you know that polaski asked ivi gave that mocking smile you are not the first to say it though i believe the last woman phrased it differently she said i was disturbed polaski looked at him as if she couldnt decide if he was joking or telling another bitter truth chapter we waited for the police to return to us after escorting their befuddled colleague away the hallway should have been a short trip but that long expanse of grey stone had grown longer and now there was a curve that hid the door from view the entrance to the sithen never changed i believe the sithen wishes us to have some privacy frost said the chalice under my cloak grew warm against my skin i let my breath out in a sigh and simply nodded i did not like the chalice appearing like this it amplified magic and wed had some very strange and powerful things happen between the guards and myself when the cup was present it was almost as if the chalice didnt want to leave me alone to solve the murders the cup pulsed so hard that it made me gasp hawthorne reached to steady me but frost caught his hand and gave a small shake of his head too dangerous in the open with the humans coming back so soon some things we did not want to explain to the police some things we couldnt explain to anyone if everyone in the hallway had glimpsed the chalice it would have been a quicker conversation but we had guards with us who had been standing where they could not see so we talked around it ivi began im all for solving the murders but i also think that we should be trying to make the princess queen instead of playing copper a pulse of power shot from the chalice along my skin it raised the hair on my body and collapsed me to my knees frost and hawthorne kept everyone else from touching me what is wrong with the princess dogmaela said and why do you not want us touching her this from aisling who was still hiding behind his hood and muffler so that only the spirals of his eyes showed hed been one of the queens men and never mine before or even now his eyes were not the three rings of color common among the sidhe but a spiral painted in lines of color with his pupil at the heart of the design as a child id once asked him how he could see out of them and he had smiled and replied that he did not know frost hawthorne and i exchanged glances all the other guards looked at me where i knelt and waited waited for me to make up my mind the sweet scent of apple blossoms filled the air and that sense of peace that could come when you worshipped filled me i wasnt certain it was a good idea but i got to my feet and flung my cloak back revealing the chalice in my hands that isnt dogmaela began it cannot be aisling said but it is ivi looked at me with a seriousness that the laughter did not touch he shook his head youve had it since you arrived back at the courts havent you i nodded how dogmaela asked how it came to me in a dream and when i woke it was real several of them were shaking their heads ivi grinned suddenly you fell to your knees when i said we should be trying to make you queen instead of playing copper the chalice pulsed between my hands and my body reacted to it for an instant my skin glowed white my hair was a crimson halo around me and my eyes glowed green and gold so that for a heartbeat i saw the color out of the edges of my vision the power vanished as instantly as it had come leaving my pulse thudding in my throat hmm that was fun ivi said you just want to fuck her dogmaela said and she made it sound like a dirty thing an unusual attitude among any fey yes ivi said but that doesnt make me wrong the police will return soon i said my voice still a little breathy from the power rush and once they return the investigation will take all your attention frost said whatever we are to discuss it must be now i looked up at his face so carefully arrogant are you saying i should take time out of solving a double homicide to have sex hawthornes quiet voice came i am sorry that beatrice and the reporter are dead but ivi is correct in one way my life and the lives of my fellow guards will not change if these murders go unsolved prince cel becoming king will change a great many things he removed his helmet exposing his wavy hair held back by braids and the green pink and red of his eyes he was lovely but all the sidhe were lovely id never really thought of how he compared to the other men it was as if id never really seen him before never noticed that he was fair of face broad of shoulder even by sidhe standards frost made a motion that caught my eye meredith are you well his hand hovered just over my shoulder as if he wanted to touch me but was afraid to i dragged my gaze from hawthorne and i was suddenly dizzy is it the chalice hawthorne frost said and the one word was enough i did not try to bespell her i merely thought about how much i desire to have what mistral had in the hallway not just the taste i had i cannot blame you frost said with a sigh but the fact that your desire turned into magic so easily means you gained more from the hallway than just a taste of pleasure as much as i desire an end to my celibacy aisling said the chalice sits before us how can you talk of anything else your needs must be paler things than mine hawthorne said amatheon finally spoke as if to himself the chalice returned to merediths hand how can this be i looked up at him watched the struggle in his flowerpetal eyes you mean that the chalice would never return to the hand of some mongrel halfbreed like me he swallowed so hard it looked as if he were choking on years of prejudice yes he said in a voice that was a harsh whisper he fell to his knees as if some great force had knocked him down or he had lost the strength in his legs he gazed up at me and the many colors of his eyes glittered in the light not with magic but with tears forgive me he said in that same harsh whisper as if the words were being torn from his throat forgive me i didnt think it was me he was begging forgiveness of the chalice moved toward him my hands held it but it was not my will that moved it he buried his face in his hands i cannot his broad shoulders began to shake and i knew he was crying i let go of the chalice with one hand so i could touch his shoulder he sobbed and threw his arms around my waist clutching me so hard and sudden that i half collapsed against him the chalice touched the back of his hair and that was all it took i stood in the middle of a huge barren plain amatheon was still pressed to my waist his head buried against my body i wasnt certain that he knew anything had changed i smelled apple blossoms again and i turned toward the scent the hill that i had seen over and over again in vision stood in the distance i could see the tree on top of it the tree that mistral and i had stood beside while lightning struck the ground i had seen the plain but never stood upon it amatheon raised his head from my body so that he could look up at me the movement of his head brushed the lip of the cup along his bound hair when he felt the hard metal of it he pressed himself against it the way you would lean into the caress of a hand only then did he seem to see the plain he was very careful not to move from between my body and the touch of the chalice but he reached down with one hand to touch the earth his hand came up with grey dirt so dry that it trickled from between his fingers like sand he looked up at me again eyes glittering with the tears he either refused to shed or could not shed it was not like this once he pressed his head back against the metal of the chalice as if seeking solace from the touch nothing will grow in this he opened his hand wide and let the wind take the dirt there is no life here he raised the hand that was coated in the dry dead earth up to me like a child that has a booboo as if i could fix it i opened my lips to say something soothing but what came out wasnt my voice and wasnt soothing at all amatheon you kept your name though you have forgotten who you are what you are the voice said deeper than my normal voice rounder vowels the land has died he said and the tears finally flowed do i look dead he frowned then shook his head again the chalice rubbed against his hair but this time i felt the silken caress of his hair across my skin down my body it made me shiver goddess i touched his cheek has it been so long amatheon that you do not know me he nodded and the first tear fell from the edge of his jaw that single drop of moisture fell onto the grey earth leaving a tiny black print but it was as if the earth underneath us sighed we need you amatheon and i agreed with the goddess the land needed him i needed him we needed him i am yours he whispered he drew the sword at his belt and held it up in his hands like an offering then he put his head back so that his throat stretched tight his eyes were closed as if for a kiss but it wasnt a kiss he was waiting for i understood then that if one tear felt so good to the land then other body fluids would feel even better i understood then what he was offering and with the goddess riding me i knew that his blood would return life to the land he was amatheon a god of agriculture but he was more than that he was the spark the quickening that let the seed grow in the earth he was that magic bridge between dormant seed dark earth and life his death would bring that back to the land i shook my head i just saved his life i will not take it now her voice came from my lips again he will not die as men die but as the corn dies to rise again and feed his people i do not doubt that i said and if that is your will so be it but not by my hand i work too hard to keep my people alive to start slaughtering them but this is not real death this is vision and dream it is not real flesh and blood that amatheon offers you amatheon had opened his eyes and lowered his head and his sword the goddess is right princess this is not a real place nor are we truly here my death here would not be true death you have not seen the visions that i have seen amatheon i dreamt of the chalice and woke with it solid and very real in my bed i would not slay you here and find your bleeding corpse in the hallway will you leave the land barren the voice said out of my mouth having both sides of the conversation coming out of my mouth was a little too psychotic for comfort and this energy this goddess felt heavier not just a comforting presence why are you not happy with me i am very happy with you meredith happier than i have been with anyone in a very long time i hear your words but i feel your impatience you are impatient with me and not about this she thought her response but i was mortal and female and i had to say it out loud you think i waste your gifts by trying to solve the murders you have your human police even now cromm cruach has them using their science for you it took me a second to realize she was referring to rhys his original name not his real name she said with my mouth but the last true name he owned rhys had a name older even than cromm cruach once though few remember i started to ask the name but i could feel her smile and she said you are distracted by trivialities meredith forgive me i said i do not mean cromm cruachs true name i mean these deaths they will be reborn child why do you mourn them so even true death is not an ending others can find your murderers and clues but there are duties that only you can perform meredith only you and what exactly would those duties be she motioned at amatheon make my land live amatheon offered his sword up to me again and closed his eyes he put his neck back at an angle where i could have a clean strike youve done this before i said he opened his eyes just enough to look at me in vision and for truth doesnt it hurt yes then he closed his eyes and lifted the sword up higher as if that would make me take it sooner he is a willing sacrifice meredith there is no evil here i shook my head how is that you who have all eternity are so impatient and i who have only a few decades want to take the longer road in that moment i felt her sigh and her happiness at the same time it had been a test of sorts not of good versus evil but of the direction this revival of power would take she had offered me a quicker more violent way to bring faerie back to its power i knew with a knowledge as solid as the foundations of the world that amatheon would die it would be true death the fact that he would rise from that grave and be reborn to his life did not change the fact that it would be my hand that slit his throat my hand that spilled his blood hot across the earth across my skin i gazed down at him as he knelt eyes closed face peaceful i took the sword by the hilt and lifted it from his hands those hands went to his sides limp only a slight tension in the fingers letting me know that he was fighting the impulse to guard himself from the blow he had gone from hating me for my mongrel blood to offering me up his pure sidhe flesh and letting me spill that same pure blood in a hot wash across the ground i leaned over him and pressed my mouth to his his eyes opened wide and startled i think the kiss surprised him more than any blow could have i smiled down at him there are other ways to make the grass grow amatheon he stared up at me uncomprehending for a moment then the shadow of a smile caressed his lips you would refuse the call of the goddess i shook my head never but the goddess comes in many guises why choose pain and death when you can have pleasure and life the smile widened just a bit he unbent his neck from its almost painful offering position then looked from the sword in one hand to the chalice in the other what would you have of me princess goddess oh no she said and this time it wasnt my lips there was a hooded figure not far from us her feet not touching the bare soil in fact she was misty and try as i might i could not see her clearly the hand that held the hood close was neither old nor young nor in between she was all women and no woman she was the goddess oh no amatheon she has made her choice i will leave her to that decision she does not need me to finish this task she gave a small chuckle that held something of the dryness of an old womans voice the rich melodious sound of a woman in her prime and the lightness of a girl i do not often agree with andais but in this i might bloody fertility goddesses but she laughed again i did not know that andais still spoke with you goddess i did not stop speaking to my people they stopped listening to me and after a time they could no longer hear my voice but i never stopped speaking to them in dreams or that moment between waking and sleep there is my voice in a song the touch of anothers hand in theirs i am there i am goddess i am everywhere and in everything i cannot leave nor can you lose me but you can leave me and you can turn your back on me we did not mean to leave you alone mother amatheon said i was not alone child i cannot be truly alone but i can be lonely what can i do mother to repent repentance is an alien concept to us amatheon but if you wish to make it up to me yes goddess with all my heart make the earth live again amatheon spread your seed over that which is barren and make it live again she began to fade like mist in the sun goddess he said her voice floated to us yes child will i see you again just her voice now young and old at the same time in the face of every woman you meet and she was gone he gazed at the spot where she had been and only when i let the sword fall to the ground did he turn to me what would you have of me princess i am yours in any way you want me whether by my life my blood or my strong right arm i will serve you you sound as if youre about to pledge me your sacred honor like some knight of old i am a knight of old meredith and if it is my honor you want you may have it you told adair you had no honor that the queen had taken it with your hair i have touched the chalice and seen the face of the goddess such blessings are not given to the unworthy are you saying your honor is intact because the goddess treated you as one who is honorable a quick puzzled look flashed through his multicolored eyes then he said yes i suppose i am say what you are thinking he smiled a quick flash of real humor that made his face less perfectly handsome but more real more precious to my sight my honor was never gone because no one can take your honor from you not without your letting it go i was going to say that you have given me back my honor but i understand now i smiled at him no one can take your honor but you can give it away the smile wilted around the edges yes i let fear take my honor from me i shook my head he smiled again almost embarrassed i mean that my fear became more important than my honor i stopped his words with a kiss i wrapped my hands across his back the chalice still held in my right hand his arms came up tentatively as if he wasnt certain how to begin i think the sex would have been slow and gentle but i held the symbol of the goddess and i was the living symbol of the goddess an impatient goddess the chalice pulled us backwards as if there was some huge magnet underneath the ground when the chalice met the earth it went into the ground and i was left holding nothing amatheons back hit the spot where the chalice had vanished and his spine bowed eyes fluttering closed his fingers convulsing against my back his body pushing against mine the strength of his hands the solidness of his body and the raw need in his face all of it pulled me down to him put my mouth against his my hands eager on his body when my hand slid between our bodies so i could cup the hard thick length of him he shuddered and cried out his eyes were wild when he looked up at me again please princess his voice was so hoarse it didnt sound like him please what i whispered against his mouth i cannot promise how long i will last what do you want amatheon to serve you i shook my head so close above him that my hair brushed his face when i did it say what it is you want amatheon he closed his eyes and swallowed so hard it sounded painful when he opened his eyes again he was calmer but there was something in those flowerpetal eyes that was still cautious his voice was a whisper as if he didnt want to speak his wish too loudly as if someone might overhear him i want you to ride me to press my naked body into the dirt i want to watch your breasts dance above me i want to feel your body slipped over mine like a sheath to a sword i want to watch your skin shine your eyes and hair dance with power while i shove myself into you as far and as often as i can i want to hear you cry out my name in that voice that women use only at the height of their passion i want to pour my seed inside your body until it spills down the sides of you and trails down my own hips that is what i want sounds wonderful to me i said he gave a small frown i smiled and touched the lines between his eyes that would have been frown lines by now if hed been able to wrinkle what i mean amatheon is yes lets do all that you mean i get my wish he said isnt that what we used to do grant peoples wishes i whispered smiling no he said we none of us ever granted wishes it was a joke i said oh im i put my finger on his lips and stopped him lets make the grass grow he frowned fuck me i said and removed my finger from his lips he smiled that bright smile that made him seem younger and more human if that is what you wish now whos offering to grant wishes i will grant anything that is within my power to give you i sat up and pressed my most intimate parts against his most intimate parts and even through all our clothes the sensation was amazing he was so hard so very hard that it must have been a pleasure that was nearly pain give me this i said and it was my voice that was hoarse now willingly let us get out of our clothes and it will be done i stared down at his face with that eager hardness pressing up through my jeans it sounded like a plan to me chapter our clothes fell to the earth like the rain that had forgotten this land he lay back against that dry parched earth like a jewel laid upon a rough grey cloth he had begun to glow before all his clothes had come off when i brushed my hand over his bare arm his skin glowed behind my fingers as if lightning flared underneath his skin as if the lightest touch of my fingertips on even the most neutral parts of his body was almost too much i wondered what he would do if i touched less neutral places i laid the very tips of two fingers against the swell of his upper chest light blossomed at my touch his whole body glowed bright white but around my fingers the light glowed orange and red like true flame where i touched him his body ran hotter and that red hot heat followed my fingers down his body i traced down his stomach and just the touch sped his breathing made him writhe against the dry earth his eyes fluttered shut and his hands scrabbled at the bare earth and all i had done was trail fingers across his stomach i lost patience then i wanted to see what he would do when i wrapped my hands around that most intimate part of him i think he expected me to at most trail my fingers across the long swollen bit of him to give him some warning but i didnt i wrapped my hand around him and squeezed he cried out his upper body came up off the ground and the feel of him in my hand closed my eyes bowed my back because he was so much harder than id imagined so hard so terribly hard that he felt more like smooth hard marble except he was so very warm oh dont dont do that merrygirl or i wont last so hard i said and my voice sounded breathy and hoarse i know he whispered too hard i will not last then dont last i said he frowned at me eyes still wild what then dont last for this first time meet your need you can prove your stamina next time next time and he laughed i dont believe in next times all thats real to me is you here now he sat up and leaned in toward me we werent touching now just close if i am not good enough you wont want me again i leaned in toward him putting our faces very close together did she judge you all on just one night his eyes widened yes he whispered i dont he smiled are you saying that frost and doyle were less than spectacular the first time i had to smile no then who i shook my head everyone was wonderful some just got spectacular with practice he drew back far enough to see my face clearly you mean that yes they cant all have been amazing if they werent ill never tell you wont tell he whispered i started to touch his face but he pulled back just enough to be out of reach tell what i asked he gave me a look a look eloquent with meaning oh i said and smiled again but it was a gentler smile no amatheon i wont tell he wrapped his arms around me pulling me in against him his back was covered in the dry powdery dirt i expected it to be rough but it wasnt it was smooth and fine like the softest talcum powder it did not distract from the warm smoothness of his skin but seemed to add texture like icing spread over warm rich cake i pulled back enough to show him my hands covered in the soft dry powder so soft i looked up at him does it feel as soft against other places as it does on my hands he drew me close and just before his lips touched me he whispered lets find out chapter we rolled ourselves in it until we looked like grey ghosts the shine of our magic was dimmed by it like christmas lights shining through snow he pressed his hardness against the front of my body and the back of me he was almost painfully hard pressed between our bodies he thrust against my stomach my ass but he would not enter me he rubbed his body over me as if his manhood were another way to caress my skin even his balls were high and tight and the few times he let me touch him there he quivered shivering with his need my hand found that a second pulse lay in his groin beating against the palm of my hand he moved my hand away from him he pressed and teased against me doing a parody of position after position but he would not enter me he would not give himself to my hand or my mouth when he had covered us nearly head to foot in the soft powdery dust and shown me the promise of his body the strength of it he pushed himself against and across my body and i begged him to enter me please amatheon please no more teasing enter me take me i thought you were going to be on top his voice was teasing and full of pleasure lie down for me and ill be on top i tried to push him to the ground but he stayed on his knees and would not be forced to the ground his hair lay in rich coppery waves around his face caressing his broad shoulders even the greyishwhite of the dust could not dim the rich color of that hair the multilayered colors of his eyes glowed like individual jewels sapphire emerald ruby amber and amethyst even the black pupil seemed polished and shining with power when his hair had first broken free of the french braid amatheon had tried to stop tried to pull away as if his shoulderlength hair were something shameful i had shown him with my gaze with my hands that he was beautiful all of him by the time he knelt shimmering with power through his coating of dust there was nothing left of that hurt but still he denied me please amatheon please lie down for me or take me if hed had a shirt i would have grabbed him by it but what i tried to grab to help persuade him he would not let me touch he trapped my hands between his and said it has been forever since a woman any woman has begged for my touch he pressed our hands against his chest and closed his eyes his breath went out in a long sigh the land has been too long untended meredith too long unloved it fears it is too late and there is no life to awaken you are the land amatheon i said and you live yield to me and i will love you please please amatheon please let me love you you speak of love so easily do you mean sex i closed my eyes and laid my forehead against his hands where they still trapped mine i am no longer certain what i mean i think i would say almost anything do almost anything in this moment if it would make you say yes yes to what but his voice held that teasing note again fuck me i said still with my eyes closed my head pressed against his hands he used his grip on my wrists to swing me around he flung me to the ground i barely caught myself with my hands in the dirt barely kept my face above the ground i drew breath to protest but his weight was suddenly on top of me pressing me to the ground he jerked me up on my knees so that i was on all fours he shoved himself against my body i think he meant to shove inside me but the angle wasnt quite right and he had to use his hands to move my hips ever so slightly again i started to say something but he had his angle and he shoved himself inside me as hard and fast as he could he shoved himself in until his balls smacked against my ass i screamed because he was too hard and the angle was sharp and i knew that as much as id begged if he kept this position i would be begging him to go before many thrusts id felt men be hard and eager before but never this hard so hard i wondered if it hurt him too do you feel that yes i gasped is this really what you want a different position then yes what position me on top why so i can control how deep you go ive never felt anyone so hard he drew out of me as abruptly as hed entered he turned me around keeping only one hand in his as he lay down on the ground he drew me down on top of him but it took both of us to slide me over him to put that quivering hardness inside me the feel of him sliding inside me flung my head back closed my eyes i fought my own body to stay high on my knees and not slam him into my cervix until i was ready for it his hands touched my hips brought my attention to more than just the part of him that was inside me i want to see your face while you ride me i looked down into his face and saw at last that look that look that is dark and eager and all lust but something else as well possession in that moment in a mans eyes is the sure knowledge that you wont say no that you are for that moment his i gazed into the heat of his eyes not the heat of magic of faerie but the eternal magic of male and female of that eternal dance that truly did make the grass grow the flowers bloom the crops ripen it was all in his face that spark that keeps it all going amatheon i said voice heavy with sighs he frowned up at me what is wrong i smiled nothing absolutely nothing and i rolled my hips forward and began to ride him i rode him until his hips began to rise and fall with mine i rode him until his hands convulsed around my breasts and i cried out i rode him until his body began to lose rhythm and the earth underneath my knees began to change i was using the hard surface for my leverage and suddenly i didnt have the leverage needed to keep the rhythm i wanted that was my first hint that the ground was growing soft and amatheon was beginning to sink into it i hesitated above him and his hands gripped my waist dont stop goddess dont stop i stopped fighting to use my knees and used my hips instead i used hips and stomach muscles to move me over and around him as the ground began to sink beneath us i could no longer keep the tip of him from the end of me but it didnt hurt now now it was wet and open and ready i rode my body over him now as fast and hard as i could back and forth grinding myself against him over him around him over and over and over until his hands convulsed at my waist and he yelled merry look at me i looked down into his eyes gone wild a second before his body bucked underneath mine body straining a breath before orgasm caught me i fought my body fought not to look away not to throw my head back or close my eyes as the pleasure took me rolled me climbed my skin in waves of warmth convulsed my body around his until we both cried out while i fought to keep eye contact fought to let him watch my frantic eyes the near painfilled look in a womans face i gave him all i could for as long as i could but finally the orgasm was too much and i screamed full throated head back eyes closed i screamed as he pressed himself inside me and the earth sank under us like black water i felt his body leave me before i opened my eyes and found myself kneeling on the rich black earth i touched the ground where he had been and it crumbled black and moist in my hand i gazed off across the plain and it was all black and rich i knelt in the soft moist earth and wondered amatheon where are you i was left alone then i was kneeling on rough stone in the halflight of the sithen hallway one moment in the heart of vision and the next back in faerie if i hadnt been on my knees already i would have fallen but i was saved from pitching faceforward onto the floor by my own hand and frosts hand on my arm consort save us he muttered and that was my first hint that something had gone wrong before i could even look around i was suddenly flat to the floor with him on top of me shielding me it was entirely too much like the assassination attempt at the press conference my pulse was suddenly in my throat and i fought two disparate urgesto look around and to make myself as small a target as possible frost gave me no choice with his body on top of mine his chest pressing my face into the stone i couldnt move he raised up just enough to draw the gun that was under his right arm with his left hand i watched his arm extend to point farther down the hall i could see enough to know that this wasnt the entrance hallway as i lay there his body pressing me painfully into the stone floor i felt his body react to the shot as the explosion of it echoed off the stones he fired again the shot jerking his body above me a man cried out but i did not know the voice im getting you out of here he said it as if i was going to argue which i wasnt getting out of there sounded just fine where was everyone else why was frost the only person with me he fired twice more in quick succession his free hand already on my arm he stood pulling me with him already moving us down the larger hallway putting a wall between us and our enemies but i could see what lay in the smaller hallway now i stumbled and might have struggled against frosts hand if hed given me the chance but i think he knew that and he moved with all the speed and strength that being pure sidhe gave him he had me up against the wall and around the corner out of the sight and aim of the attackers i still hadnt seen what i had seen was crystall with his hands covered in white light and adair wading into men sword already bloody but that hadnt been what made me push against frosts pinning arm as he held me against the wall galen lying on the floor a pool of blood spilling out underneath him he hadnt been moving let me go i said to frost he shook his head his eyes anguished no your safety takes precedence over anything else i screamed at him and fought against him but it was like struggling against steel with muscle around it i could not move him unless he let me he had pressed his body along the line of mine pinning me completely to the wall i had no room to try to hurt him enough to make him let me go hed known i would fight him i screamed the only word that mattered to me in that moment galen i screamed his name until my throat went raw but there was no answer chapter there was the sound of running feet frost kept me pinned to the wall with only his chest drawing a gun from behind his back and pointing both guns in opposite directions down the hallway to draw the other gun hed been forced to move his body enough off of me so that i was able to reach the gun at the small of my back hed been right to trap me for my first instinct had been to run to galen no thought no logic just truth frost had given me those few moments to think i aimed away from the corner where galen lay at the sound of running feet they would be upon us in seconds i wasnt scared anymore i was calm that breathless icy calm that is part anger part terror part things there are no words for galen was hurt i would hurt them back somewhere in the back of my head was a thought that didnt say hurt but said another word i pushed it back and aimed my finger had actually started to squeeze down when i realized it was nicca and biddy and the rest of the guards who had been with frost in the hallway before amatheon and i took our little trip i let my breath out and raised the gun carefully toward the ceiling i started to shake almost immediately realizing how close i had come to putting a bullet through niccas chest if the gun had had a shorter pull a bullet through an arm or shoulder could be healed but one in the heart well sometimes yes and sometimes no nicca and biddy stayed with us gun in his hand sword in hers they were both among the gentlest of the sidhe but now they looked grim and tall and muscular and dangerous like tigers and lions dangerous simply because of what they are i had never seen resolve such as this on niccas face frost stayed with me his body still shielding me the thought of another man i loved getting hurt because of me seemed more than i could bear if i hadnt been clinging to the gun with both hands to make sure it pointed only at stone i would have pushed frost away stupid but until i knew how badly galen was hurt i didnt want to risk anyone else especially stupid since the rest of the guards had just run around the corner magic filled the air crawling over my skin the sound of metal on metal a man cried out and then a womans cry not of pain but of rage i wanted no one else to risk themselves for me today i could do nothing but endanger them all my eyes were hot and tight with things i did not want to cry away someone was moaning softly all else was small sounds the brush of metal against stone footfalls movement but not fighting the fight was over the question was who had won if doyle or frost had been with them i wouldnt have doubted the outcome but frost was still standing tense and ready in front of me his grey eyes were still searching down both directions of the hallway as if he didnt trust anyone else to keep watch without doyle here neither did i the two men trusted no one else as much as they trusted each other when had i begun to believe that only these two could keep me safe when had i begun to put my faith in these two men and lose it in the others hawthorne came around the corner his crimson armor spattered lightly with blood as if someone had taken a red ink pen and shaken it at him he was cleaning his blade with a piece of cloth that looked as if it had been jerked off someones body it is over adair was at his back helmet tucked under one arm without his hair to cushion his helmet there were marks on his forehead and against his neck where it had rubbed they are subdued or as dead as we can make them frost princess i started forward gun still held carefully in my hand frost stopped me put up the gun princess i looked at his arrogant face but saw the pain in his eyes why i asked because i do not trust what you will do with it if he is as gravely injured as he appeared to be my heart was suddenly hammering painfully in my chest as if i couldnt quite breathe around it i opened my mouth to say something but finally closed it i swallowed and it hurt as if i were trying not to choke i just nodded and put the gun back where it belonged i settled my cloak over it as a matter of habit dont want to ruin the line of the clothes if you can help it habit is what we have when the inside of our head is screaming and were so scared that it sits like dry metal on our tongues frost stepped away from me and started to put up his guns but i didnt stay to watch him finish the smooth twohanded movement i was already heading for the corner one word kept going through my head over and over galen galen galen too scared to finish the thought too scared to do anything but run for him i should have been praying to the goddess harder than id ever prayed before id just been in her presence so she would have listened but i didnt pray to her or any deity i knew if it was a prayer it was a prayer to galen i cleared the corner and saw him lying on his back eyes closed arms outspread one leg bent under his body and blood everywhere a sea of blood across the stone floor spilling out and around him so much blood too much blood the thought finished in my head the only prayer i had to offer galen dont be dead dont be dead galen please dont be dead chapter i fell to my knees beside him the bright red of the blood framed him so that his hair was greener than i knew it to be a moment before i had wanted to hold him more than anything in all of faerie now i hesitated my hand hovering over his face i wanted to touch him have him open his eyes and smile up at me i was afraid to touch him afraid he would be cold to the touch afraid to know i made myself touch the side of his face his skin was cool but not cold a tightness in my chest eased minutely i touched the side of his neck pushed my fingers against his skin searching nothing nothing then a faint flutter the relief made me slump my hand sliding down the side of his neck into the curls at the back of his head but they were heavy with blood i raised my hand up and the fingers were bright with blood where is it all coming from i didnt realize id said it aloud until adair answered me we have not had time to check for his wounds princess i nodded to let him know id heard him we have to get the bleeding stopped adair knelt at galens shoulders i have sent for a healer i shook my head his skin is cool we need to stop this blood loss now not wait for a healer a sidhe who can die from blood loss is no sidhe at all i glanced up to find kieran lord of knives kneeling with his hands bound behind his back but ivi still kept the lord at sword point kieran had only one hand of power and it was the only magic left to him which made many among the sidhe consider him weak but that one hand was a deadly one he could use his magic like a blade to stab deep into the body even from a distance i knew now how galen had fallen without even drawing a blade or a gun but why ambush galen my gaze traveled to the other three kneeling there the rest were all women of cels guard that did not surprise me there was another richly dressed lord lying on his side moaning his hands were tied behind his back but there was a smaller pool of blood beginning to seep out from him his face was turned away from me and it didnt matter who it was later it might but now unless he could heal galen i didnt care who he was adair helped me turn galen onto his side he was limp as the dead i was having trouble breathing again past the taste of panic there were two wounds in his back deep and clean somehow miraculously they had missed the heart they were still fearfully deep but bleeding out this quickly wasnt from a wound in his back especially if it missed the heart we eased him onto his back and when his body settled against the bloodslick floor there was a fresh gush of blood from his leg i crawled to his legs and found the third wound high up on the thigh theyd cut his femoral artery a human could bleed out in twenty minutes the blood should have been spurting out the fact that it was only seeping meant that he had lost most of the blood in his body which meant that even if someone could close the wounds immediately he might not recover the sidhe can take a lot of wounds a lot of blood loss but there has to be enough blood left to keep the body running the heart pumping frost had remained standing in front of me during all of it guarding me i couldnt argue with his division of labor not with galen lying limp and pale on the floor i was a great deal easier to kill than galen but frost had watched as we found the wounds where is the healer that you sent for adair shook his head i do not know were running out of time i said we have to close the wounds and keep what little blood he has left inside him i can close his wounds a womans voice said we looked to find one of the kneeling prisoners smiling at us her hair was the color of yellow corn silk her eyes triple colors of blue silver with an inner circle of light if light had a single color id never known what to call the final color of hafwyns eyes the other women said no you cannot help them you betray our master and other less complimentary things hafwyn shrugged with her hands still bound behind her we are captured and our master is still imprisoned i think it would not be a mistake to have some favor on other shores she raised one of her dark eyebrows with her very blond hair in a human i would have thought dye but in a race where your eyes could be three different colors what was black eyebrows and blond hair you are a traitor to your oath if you do this melangell said there was blood running down her face from a wound that had split the side of her helmet if shed been human her brains would have spilled out but she was barely bleeding i never made an oath to prince cel hafwyn said it was prince essus i vowed to serve when he died no one asked if we would serve cel we were simply given to him no one living has my oath of loyalty she looked at me as she said it and there was something in her face some need some message can she really heal him i asked she can close his wounds adair said but thats all it is more than any of the rest of us can do for him said hawthorne though in truth it never occurred to me to ask galens assassins if they could help heal him i searched his face for the irony that should have gone with those words but he simply looked as if he were stating a fact do we trust her nicca asked i laid a hand against galens cooling skin no i said but untie her anyway earlier that day i had been ready to give galen up to an unknown lover but that was different from losing him to death i could live with his smile being for someone else if i knew he was happy but to never see that smile again to never feel his hand warm in mine again i couldnt stand that frost touched my shoulder made me look up at him you must move away before i will allow hafwyn to touch him i started to protest but he touched my face and shook his head this could be a ruse to get close to you i will not risk you to save him his hand went around my arm and i had little choice but to go with him though i was still reluctant to stop touching galen if we couldnt save him these would be my last moments to touch him while he felt alive hafwyn knelt in the drying blood in her leather armor she took off the leather gauntlets and tucked them into her sword belt she settled her short sword more solidly at her hip and i fought the urge to scream for her to hurry she was entirely too calm but then she had helped kill him why should she truly want to save him was this just a play effort on her part she would do us a favor but it would not work so she could curry favor with us yet lose no favor with cel and his people goddess help me there were moments when i wished i did not see so many motives for the people around me it was not a comforting way of looking at the world i cuddled in against frosts body my arms clinging around his waist my cheek pressed so hard against him that i heard his heartbeat he wrapped his arms around me though it meant he would have to move me to draw almost any of his weapons as a bodyguard he should have moved me to the side left himself some room to maneuver but as my lover my friend and galens friend i knew that he wasnt clinging to me just for my comfort it was impossible not to like galen it was his gift to make people like him the tension in frosts body as he held me told me more clearly than any words that i wasnt the only one who would miss galen it said something about our galen that he had melted the killing frost hafwyn pressed her hands over the wound in his thigh she was at least starting with the more lifethreatening wound her skin had looked white but it was gold the way that galens was green so pale that something had to make you see that other color her magic turned her skin a pale solid gold as she glowed strands of her hair struggled to escape the knot that she had it in her hair moving in the wind of her own magic shes a healer hawthorne said why is she being wasted behind a sword we had expected hafwyn to have some small healing ability but what was glowing and dancing along our skin was not small all the healers with this much magic were not allowed to be warriors not in the front lines anyway their talents were too valuable and too rare among us now to risk them watching her shining hands rise from his body i began to hope her voice echoed with magic as she asked can someone turn him over so that i do not waste the healing on smaller things it has been so long since i have been allowed to use my powers to their full benefit i am a little out of practice hawthorne and adair rolled galen over for her hawthorne cradling his head and shoulders so galens face did not touch the blood i would remember that little extra care he took with galen and it would earn hawthorne something hafwyn laid her hands on galens back and my skin prickled with the effort she put into him she could have closed his wounds but simply from the sensations her healing chased across my skin i thought she was doing more no shouted one of the other female guards still kneeling still bound you are saving him aisling placed his sword tip at her throat she had to stop talking or risk piercing her own skin against aislings sword point siobhan will see you dead for this said melangell siobhan had been cels captain of the guard she and a handful of others had also attacked me overtly i had killed two of the attackers more by accident than on purpose and she had surrendered i had assumed she was dead shed tried to kill a royal heir she should have been dead when we werent in front of so many hostile ears i would ask someone hafwyn leaned back from galen a smile on her face siobhan is still locked in a cell in the hallway of mortality she wont be killing anyone for a while yet galen shuddered in hawthornes arms the first breath he took was loud and gasping and he thrust himself up off the floor eyes wild he collapsed almost immediately and only hawthornes arms kept him from falling flat to the floor you are safe hawthorne said you are safe frost let me go to him i dont know if he trusted hafwyn now or if he knew he couldnt have stopped me without a fight i did have enough sense left to go on the far side of galens body closer to the wall than to hafwyn hawthorne spilled galens upper body into my lap i cradled him against me looking into those green eyes that face that smile tears streamed down my face though i was laughing i had so many emotions that i felt drunk i have not been allowed to heal anyone in decades it felt so good i looked up at the woman who was still kneeling in all that blood she was crying too and i didnt know why why would anyone forbid you to use your powers i asked it is a secret and i would not go back to ezekiels tender care for anything or anyone but i can say this i tried to heal someone that prince cel did not want healed i went against his express orders he told me i would be a bringer of death until he told me i could heal again that is a waste of power hawthorne said she glanced at him but her attention was all for me but today for you i have gone against that order he will see you raped and skinned for it said one of her fellow guards neither hafwyn nor i even bothered looking at the other woman why would you risk that for me i asked you just tried to kill galen why heal him because i am a healer it is what i am and i do not want to be this anymore she touched her sword does saving him buy me anything from you i nodded i would not promise until i hear what you want not even for galen but yes it buys you something she gave a small smile good she took a deep breath and let it out as if she were steeling herself for some great effort queen andais announced to the court today that you needed more guards she said that any who wished to could offer their services to you but that only the ones who bedded you could stay with you i knew about the first part but not the second i said she said all guards what are you asking me hafwyn she leaned in toward me hands at her sides i fought the urge to lean away from her i saw hawthorne look to frost as if asking what to do i couldnt see what frost told him because hafwyns face was all i could see she kissed me gently eyes open there was no passion to the kiss no promise of anything just a touch of lips take me she whispered take me to your bed take me here take me anywhere but please goddess please dont leave me here for cel i owe him no vow so i break no vow by asking this of you i served prince essus as his healer for centuries when he went into exile when you were six if i had known she would give me to cel i would have gone into exile with you but i thought that exile from faerie was the worst of fates i ask you as his daughter do not leave me here now that the queen has opened the way for me to ask i ask i beg her eyes glittered with tears and when she could not keep them from falling she bent her head down so i would not see it was galen who reached for her first but i was only moments behind she collapsed into us both her shoulders shook with the emotion of her sobs but she was absolutely silent how many years had it taken for her to learn to cry silently to hide away this much pain i stroked her yellow hair and said the only thing i could say yes chapter adair stumbled as he rose from beside us catching himself against the wall blood was seeping out from underneath his breastplate you are hurt i said inniss warriors are as skilled as ever he said in a voice that was a little tight with pain i felt a little spurt of surprise innis had always been among the most neutral of nobles he hadnt seemed to care one way or the other who ruled as long as he and his clan were left alone they specialized in necromancy of one kind or another once upon a time some of them could raise true armies of the dead inniss skill had always been to raise phantom armies that could bleed you kill you you could cut them but they could not die i understood now why he was the one on the ground they had had to hurt him badly enough to stop him doing magic hafwyn raised her head from galens chest tears still traced the pale gold of her skin i have some healing left to me tonight i could not bring another back from so close to the veil but i can look at your wound she looked at me i can be of use to you princess meredith i swear that i can i believe you hafwyn attend to adairs wounds unless someone else is hurt worse i looked at crystall who was still standing with a weapon pointed at kieran after adairs show of bravado i thought id better simply ask is anyone else wounded kanna the only one of the prisoners without a sword at her throat spoke up lord innis conjuror of phantoms is badly injured her voice was very neutral as she said it her long brown hair was coming loose from its ponytail beginning to show the heavy fall of it around her pale face her eyes were wide as if she might be in shock but her voice gave none of that away why should i care if he is injured i asked he is a free lord of the court you seek to rule she said he is merely one lord among many kanna i see no extra value in him merely because he had enough power and political savvy to stay out of the guards others see the free lords as more valuable than we of the guard that is because they have forgotten that once it was considered an honor to be asked to join the royal guard once it was not a punishment but a reward you speak of things too old to bear remembering kanna said you were not there you cannot know i listen to our stories kanna i remember our history many of our best and most accomplished warriors were not forced into the guard but invited it only became a burden and a punishment later you would leave a free lord to bleed to death then if it is a choice between a man who risked his life on my order to save one that i love and a man who tried to take the life of the one i love then yes let him die if he can wasnt it you lord kieran who said a sidhe who can die from blood loss is no sidhe at all crystall had to move his sword back a little to give him breath and space to talk innis is of the purest blood not some pixie halfbreed funny how all blood looks the same when it is spilled upon the ground i said are any of my people hurt besides adair i looked at kieran when i spoke watched his face i was rewarded because he looked puzzled you truly would let innis die give me a reason not to let him die i said he is not important enough to me to bargain for kieran said then he will lie there and bleed until i decide otherwise inniss clan is powerful princess you do not want them as your enemies i laughed at that he has already proven himself my enemy we did not attack you kieran said adair was still leaning against the wall bleeding look at his wound see how bad it is and i ask for the last time are any of the rest of you hurt aisling spoke still wrapped in his cloak so that most of him was hidden i let this one get past me he emphasized his words by driving the edge of his sword a little tighter against melangells throat enough that a thin edge of crimson began to flow was it you that nearly cleaved her helmet to her skull i asked yes but only after she bloodied me he sounded disgusted with himself frost choose someone to take aislings place so we can see to his wounds hawthorne frost said and one word was enough he put his helmet back on and went to take aislings place dogmaela was standing there between the two groups as if she didnt quite know what to do melangell was her captain of the guard unless she was willing to make the same offer that hafwyn had made she would have to go back under melangells rule in the middle of such a power struggle was a tricky place to be dogmaela was like galen you could see her struggle with the problem on her face in the posture of her body she had fought with the others but now she didnt know where her loyalties lay the fact that she was so divided made me put her in the untrustworthy category hafwyn and the other wounded moved to one side leaving me with galen cradled in my lap i slid my hands down the front of his shirt you need to start wearing armor unless it was enchanted armor it would not have helped adair said hafwyn and aisling were helping him remove his armor in pieces the padding underneath was soaked crimson with blood the wide clean cut was plain in the padding low on his side he was able to do this to me even with the armor your armor is still worthy of its maker kieran said i could not pierce it i had to find a seam no true sword could have found the opening you used adair said the padding peeled off in layers the linen shirt next to his skin was a ruined red mass that is why magic will always win against weaponry kieran said it was not magic that stopped innis crystall said it was human magic kieran said guns are not magic crystall argued they are weapons kieran shook his head what is human science but another name for magic even now the princess has brought human spell casters into our sithen she allows human magic free range inside the only refuge we have left thats a reason to attack me i said but not a reason to attack galen why him perhaps we are attacking all your guards if we find them alone kieran said no galen said with his head still in my lap when i came around the corner melangell said weve been waiting for you green man then you hit me in the back where were you hiding i must have passed right by you innis can hide in plain sight frost said and he can hide one or two with him if none of them moves frost was still very much on alert guarding me he hadnt looked at a wound or participated in the conversation he was working and it showed so kieran why galen i asked lord kieran he corrected me i shook my head my hand sliding a little farther down galens chest so i could feel his heart beating against my palm fine lord kieran knifehand answer my question he looked at me his face arrogant and handsome in the way that most of the sidhe were but his was a cold beauty or maybe i was just projecting you have captured me but you cannot make me answer your questions take me to queen andais so i may get on with my night i stared at him with galens heartbeat under my hand was kieran being that brave or did he believe that the queen would do nothing to him you have attacked a royal guard you will not be getting on with your night lord kieran siobhan nearly killed a royal heir and yet she lives imprisoned but she lives the queens pet torturer fears the touch of siobhans skin so she has not even been tortured she will sit in her cage until prince cel is released then she will be his right hand again if that is all the queen does to a wouldbe assassin of royalty then what more can she do to us neryss house still lives even though all of them turned traitor they tried to kill both you and the queen herself and they have lost nothing he sneered at me all that beauty turning ugly that is why you and innis agreed to this i said you saw neryss people go free and you think you will go free too the queen needs her allies princess how can you be her ally if you toadie for cel i toadie to no one but i admit to preferring him to you there are many who feel the same of that i have no doubt i looked at him so sure of himself and i needed him not to be i needed whatever information he possessed and i needed the court to fear me to fear harming my people if the queen would not put that fear into them then i had to figure out a way to do it myself there was a sound like a great hollow gong being struck what is that i asked it sounded again before the first echoes had died frost reached for a knife at his belt i have a call it was rhys what are you doing merry it was all i could do to keep walters and the police from running to check out your screams is galen all right you were screaming his name galen spoke from my lap im touched that you care rhys chuckled hes fine he was attacked though i said who nobles and guess whose guards let me think cel who else but why does he keep picking on galen im about to try to find out how is the evidence collection going okay i put a guard on each of the humans as per your order we figured out how the reporter strayed outside the magical boundaries we set up how i asked he had small iron nails in the soles of his shoes cold iron i said hed done his research rhyss reflection wavered as he nodded and he came here planning to try to see something we didnt want him to see i guess it is part of the job description for a reporter i guess so he sighed and it was heavy whats wrong rhys major walters insists on seeing you in person he says that the reflection could be an illusion im a little busy here i glanced at our prisoners i figured that but if you dont put in an appearance soon hes going to want to come looking for you just a headsup ill be there as soon as i can ill try to keep him pacified the sword was suddenly empty only my own distorted reflection showing i handed frosts blade back to him and looked at the prisoners if i had been certain how the queen would take it i would do something drastic to at least one of the nobles but kieran was right the queen did need her allies i didnt think kieran qualified but andais might and i didnt want her angry with me if i could avoid it still kierans reasoning meant that andais was losing her hold on the court nobles that was bad because i didnt have enough political clout on my own to compete for the throne even though i was still of the ruling bloodline if andais failed as queen they would see me as a threat no matter who took the throne after her hafwyns voice came with a thread of anger to it let me see the wound aisling i dare not let you see more of my body i am a healer we are immune to most of the contact enchantments if it were otherwise we could not heal the sidhe aisling was holding his white cloak close around the bloody front of his tunic take off your tunic so i may see your wound he shook his head spilling his hood back and revealing a veil like some of the arabic countries make their women wear it was a thin gauzy golden cloth so you saw his head and face through the haze of it only his odd eyes were free of the cloth showing pale skin and a lace of pale eyelashes id forgotten that you covered your face i said and hadnt really meant to say it out loud much is forgotten he said hands still holding his cloak around his bloody side i said i forgot that you covered your face not why yes yes hafwyn said the most beautiful man in the world so beautiful that if a woman or even some men look upon your face they will be instantly besotted with you and unable to deny you anything she grabbed his cloak and tried to wrench it from his hands and finished the rest through gritted teeth but i am not asking you to take off your veil just your tunic i fear what effect it would have upon a mortal hafwyn stopped struggling with him and leaned back on her heels i think too surprised to know what to do i realized then that he meant me how could i ever truly rule here if they still thought of me as a human kieran spoke my thoughts out loud even the guard itself thinks of you as only mortal and not sidhe i would have argued with him if i could have are you saying aisling that your bare chest is enough to bespell me i have seen it happen before to humans i gazed up at him galen still in my lap aisling do you think of me as human he lowered his eyes and would not look at me which was answer enough i guess thats a yes i mean no disrespect princess meredith if you are sidhe enough to look upon me that would be a fine thing but what if i did bespell you there is only one remedy for the enchantment and that would be true love you must be in love with someone else before you can look upon me not entirely true hawthorne said from his place at melangells side aislings magic can overcome even true love if he wishes it and tries hard enough once he could make anyone fall hopelessly in love with him lust not love adair said there is a difference you know hawthorne it has been so long since i had either that im not sure i do remember the difference hawthorne said adair leaned against the wall in the torn remnants of his padding and undershirt he smiled tiredly with an edge of pain to it aye i hear you i had this horrible urge to kiss adair to take that edge of sorrow from his smile and see if i could get a real one can you sit up i asked galen yes but im enjoying the attention he grinned up at me i bent over him hugging him with all my body while he lay in my lap i whispered against his skin im so glad youre alive he rubbed his face against my breasts since they were so conveniently placed me too galen sat up and i waited to make certain he was steady just seeing the blood painted on the back of his body tightened my chest all over again i had to swallow past something hard and crushing in my throat i turned to adair still bleeding still hurting because i gave an order i didnt strike the blow but id put him in harms way i knelt in front of him reached out to touch his face he actually flinched as if he wasnt sure he wanted to be touched or wasnt sure if it would hurt knowing my aunt i could understand that you look sad i said i dont want you to be sad im too hurt to do much princess his eyes were wide showing too much white i shook my head would she really offer you intercourse when you were this injured he understood who she was she has before not to me but others offer them sex after years of nothing when they were too hurt to enjoy it or too hurt to perform auntie andais was a true sadist a kiss adair nothing more just a kiss because you seem to need it he gave me a puzzled look out of his triple yellow eyes just because i need it i dont understand are you lesser fey now to give a kiss because someone needed it kieran said it is not a sidhe custom no it isnt because weve forgotten who we are i said what we are and what are we kieran asked his voice sneering i leaned in toward adair his eyes were still too wide the amount of power we raised earlier would hurt me now princess his voice was breathy but he was against the wall and there was nowhere else for him to go no power just touch i laid a soft chaste press of lips against adairs mouth he stopped breathing for a moment and i tasted more fear than desire in him i drew back from him to watch his face and saw the fear turn to puzzled wonderment i dont understand you princess because she is not sidhe you asked what we are kieran i turned and looked at the kneeling man we are deities of nature we are in a way nature personified we are not humans no matter how our form may ape them we are something else and too many of us have forgotten that how dare you lecture us on what the sidhe are when you stand as the most human of us all the most lesser of us all i stood up stretching my legs which were a little stiff from holding the weight of galens upper body when i was a child i would have given anything to be one of the tall slender sidhe but as i have grown into adulthood i value more and more my mixed heritage i value my brownie blood my human blood not just the sidhe blood that runs in my veins aisling take off your shirt if i am too mortal to look upon your chest then i am too mortal to be your queen let hafwyn see which of you is the more injured so one of you may be healed he began to argue i am princess of flesh and blood daughter of essus and i will be queen you will do as i order adair loses blood while you act like some bashful maiden even through the veil i could tell that id pricked his pride and all males are alike when it comes to that he threw his cloak to the ground and jerked his tunic over his head in one quick motion he didnt wait for me to tell him to take off his underthings he simply stripped them over his head hesitating only at his face so he could be sure of keeping his veil in place i didnt argue the veil his face had once bespelled goddesses and sidhe alike it wasnt his chest that made me stare though it was a very nice chest with wide shoulders and a lovely stomach except for the cut that traced blood from his waist to his ribs what made me stare was his skin which looked as if it had been sprinkled with gold dust shining and sparkling in the light in sunlight he would dazzle the eye id seen his nude back in the midst of all the other guards when the queen had been driven mad by a magical poisoning she had ordered them all to strip and theyd done it for fear of her it is as i have feared he said i shook my head i have seen you nude aisling unless there is someone else with gold dust on their skin when she saved us adair said you were on the floor aisling shivered though whether from hafwyns hands on his wound or the memory of what the queen had almost done i wasnt sure i had forgotten not so mortal after all galen said from where hed moved to sit against the wall or perhaps the great aisling has lost his power melangell said and he hides behind his veil not because he can bespell us all but because he cannot he stiffened and this time i was almost certain it wasnt from anything hafwyn was doing his wound is shallow adair needs the healing more then do it im needed with the police aisling hugged his bare upper body as if something hurt him melangell laughed hawthorne put his blade a little closer to her skin and the laughter quieted but still chuckled out from between her lips why did you attack galen why him hafwyn answered he was chosen because he is the only one of your guards who is a green man melangell hissed you dont know enough to help them shes right hafwyn said as she had adair lift the cloth around his wound i know why they chose him but not why him being a green man marked him does melangell know hafwyn nodded she knows almost everything that the guard plans perhaps not everything that the prince did before he was imprisoned but most i nodded good i went to her staying well out of reach because even with her hands bound i did not want to risk her touching me shed once been able to love a man to death it wasnt the sex but the touch of her skin she had lost the power or so id been told but caution was better i give you one last chance melangell tell us why you targeted galen not once but twice for we know that cel paid the demifey to try to ruin him why is it so important to cel that i not bed galen i motioned hawthorne back enough so she could talk if she wanted to i will not betray my master for i did take oath to cel i never served your weakwilled father i smiled at her sweetly my father is great enough to withstand petty insults you refuse to answer my questions no magic or torture you can devise will make me forget my loyalties she shot a spiteful look at hafwyn who was busy healing adair aisling are you well enough to come here for a moment it is a scratch nothing more if hed been human he would have needed at least ten stitches maybe more i would not have called it a scratch but it wasnt my body he came to me his sword naked in his hand put up the sword aisling he did hesitating only a moment what would you have of me princess if not my sword if you show your face to a sidhe woman will she tell you anything you ask her you mean to make her besotted so we may question her yes melangells eyes had gone a little wide i have never used my powers in that way would it work he thought about it yes then let us see if she will tell us for lust what she will not tell for loyalty i motioned for the guard on kanna the other of cels guard to turn her to face the far wall dogmaela had already gone to the other end of the hallway she may have had divided loyalties but not enough to join her kneeling comrades or enough to protect them interesting that melangell and kanna had spoken only to hafwyn as if dogmaela was not even there aislings hands rose to his golden veil you should look away as well princess i nodded and moved back though i could admit to myself that there was an almost unbearable urge to look at his face to look on someone so beautiful that one glimpse would make you fall instantly in lust with them a beauty so great that one glimpse and you would betray all you held most dear i did wonder frost knew me too well took my arm to move me just a little more to aislings back he gave me a look and i shrugged what could i say aisling removed his veil and all i could see was that his hair was yellow and gold like streaks of honey and like the gold in his skin shining together it was braided in complicated knots so that it looked much shorter than the hair actually was if no one could look upon his face who did his hair she has closed her eyes he said hawthorne cut her eyelids off theyll grow back she did what id hoped shed do at the first touch of the knife tip she opened her eyes her eyes blinked and hawthorne moved the knife back her gaze moved up aislings body as if drawn against her will i knew when she reached his face because i saw it in her eyes saw the shock of it over her face it was a frightened look as if she looked not upon great beauty but great ugliness hawthorne turned his face away lord kieran did too only crystall looked upon aislings naked face without flinching he smiled as if he saw something wonderful his clear white skin filled with radiance as if the sight had kindled his magic only when his hair was shot through with color like prisms in the light did he turn away as if he could not bear the sight any longer melangell screamed and it was a sound of irretrievable loss the echo of it died on the stones and her eyes filled with love it wasnt lust no matter what adair had said her eyes filled with the mindless devotion of teenagers in their first crush or newlyweds on a perfect honeymoon she looked at aisling as if he were her entire world melangell had never liked aisling never had much use for him now she looked at him the way a flower gazes at the sun and it made me sick to see it i didnt like melangell but this was wrong if there was no cure for it then i had done something far worse to her than any torture i could have devised to be hopelessly completely in love with someone who hated you there isnt even a level in dantes hell for that frost seemed to understand because he said aisling ask her the question why did you attack galen to kill him maybe she wasnt as totally besotted as she appeared why did you want to kill him because prince cel wants him out of merediths bed why does he want that melangell shook her head hard as if trying to clear her thoughts aisling knelt in front of her putting his face and upper body close to her why does cel want galen out of princess merediths bed shed closed her eyes again no she said no you cannot close me out of your mind melangell you have seen me you cannot unsee me now his voice was a whisper but it seemed to trail down my skin it made me shiver and it wasnt directed at me frost whispered against my ear her power was once similar to his it may mean she can escape him she could kill with her touch but how do you get a man to touch you meredith by making them want you it made sense though frankly melangell was beautiful enough without the extra lure he leaned in and i thought he would kiss her but she pushed backwards as far as hawthorne would let her go dont touch me she said you said my power had faded melangell why fear my touch if i am but a ghost of what i was why does cel want galen out of merediths bed he grabbed her face between his hands and she screamed though not in pain i am willing to test my magic against yours melangell he kissed her long and lingering frost had tensed beside me which meant that once even a kiss from melangell had been a dangerous thing that i had not known dangerous indeed aisling drew back and her face was raw with need my sweet tell me why does prince cel want galen out of merediths bed she swallowed hard enough that i heard it across the room but she answered the prophecy said the green man would bring life back to the court what prophecy aisling asked cel paid a prophet to tell him if meredith would be a true threat she would bring life back to the court with the help of the green man and the chalice galen was the only green man that she took with her when we saw what she did at the press conference we knew that he was her green knight has it occurred to any of you that green man is a metaphor for vegetative deities or even another name for the consort i asked melangell ignored me but when aisling asked the same question she answered prince cel said the prophecy meant galen and do you believe everything cel tells you i asked when aisling repeated the question she answered yes fool hafwyn said from behind us what else did the prophecy say aisling asked that if someone of flesh and blood sat on the throne cel would die what did he think flesh and blood meant mortal you all must have been frantic when the princess returned with flesh and blood as her hands of power yes melangell said is there anything else cel has done that we should know about aisling asked and i made a mental note that he was a thorough man she bent forward as if in pain hawthorne had moved back as if he wasnt comfortable touching her his power was not similar to either of theirs so maybe he was in danger of being bespelled by melangell whatever the reason when her hands moved the cloth that tied them unwound and since hawthorne was turned away he did not see it aisling went for his sword but he was kneeling and at a bad angle her hands came up and she clawed her eyes out while we watched only when blood and wet liquid ran down her face did she stop you cannot force more secrets from me now she said and her voice was full of her usual rage aisling let his halfdrawn sword go back into its sheath melangell you cannot unsee me i told you that i couldnt tell if she was crying or if it was just pieces of her eyes the sight of your shining face will be the last thing i will ever see i hate you for this but i cannot regret it oh melangell he said and he touched her face she laid her bloody drenched cheek against his hand the way a lover would she let him cup her face for an instant then she drew away from him and said take me to the queen take me to a cell i care not but take me away from him hawthorne drew her to her feet and rebound her hands checking the knots what do you want me to do with her princess it is my right to be taken before the queen kieran said yes it is but it is not her right if cel were free then we would take her to him but i shook my head and looked away from her ravaged face frost i buried my face against his chest frost i dont know what to do with her take her to a cell tell ezekiel she is not to be touched until he hears further from the princess what of kanna take her as well the lords take them to the queen see what she does with them he assigned different guards to the duty he sent dogmaela along with the lords she spoke to me as she pushed kieran past me i am not a lover of women it was such an odd comment that i just answered it neither am i but hafwyn i realized then that while wed been trying to solve the mystery of galens assassination attempt and cels treachery that she had been worrying about her virtue she wanted to be free of cel but not badly enough to lie with a woman to be free of cel i would have slept with things that had never even been human and never would be i knew a lesser evil when i saw it looking into dogmaelas face i didnt know whether to laugh or cry i still had visions of melangells eyes dancing inside my head id probably have nightmares about it i will bed hafwyn and anyone else who wishes to come with me not because i am a lover of women but because i would not leave anyone in cels power if i could save them now take kieran before the queen and report truthfully and fully about his crimes she went and the others went with her two of the guard carrying the still unconscious lord innis between them he left a trail of fresh blood as they vanished around the corner aisling had his golden veil wrapped around his face and hair again the bloody cut on his side was almost healed you gained from using your power i said my face still halfhidden against frosts chest i gained from besting her at her own game yes once she was almost a match for me she has lost much of who she was frost said once she was sweet poison i wanted to ask him if he was upset about what melangell had done didnt it bother him that a woman had torn her own eyes out rather than look upon his face but i didnt say it out loud any of it i had asked him to do it it was my responsibility to say that i hadnt understood was no defense you did not use magic that you did not understand because of shit like this happening i buried my face against frosts chest so i could not see aisling even in his veil he laughed a deep rich masculine sound i was called terrible beauty but his voice said he was pleased with himself i wanted to say i didnt understand but i didnt it wasnt a good enough excuse anyway chapter major walters the police the csu techs and dr polaski the medical examiner had nothing but complaints their laptop computer wouldnt work their cell phones didnt work nothing they had with them that used electricity or even batteries worked was that me screaming earlier and why had i been screaming galens name glamour hides a multitude of sins and both galen and i were good enough to hide the blood as long as no one touched us and found that the cloth felt tacky with blood we were fine we werent certain what would happen to your modern tech down here im sorry its not working i said i wanted to avoid the screaming issue altogether but i didnt want him angry at me police do not like to be fucked with especially if theyve just maybe pissed off all the local feds on your behalf no matter how much walters had enjoyed my handing marquez his hat it still might make life difficult for him there are things inside the sithen that are frightening one of them almost attacked galen it scared me thats all i turned hoping to get away from walters and his questions i just wasnt up to word games at that moment melangells face kept coming back to me frosts assurance that her eyes would grow back if she were allowed to be in faerie and not in the hallway of mortality was small comfort if she couldnt be cured of a hopeless obsession with aisling we had stolen something from melangell if she couldnt cure herself of the love walters grabbed my arm i hadnt expected him to touch me princess meredith what arent you his voice trailed off because the arm he grabbed was tacky with the blood that covered it he jerked me nearly off my feet and my concentration was simply not good enough frost moved in to protect me but the glamour slipped walters got a flickering look at what i was hiding he looked past me at the others and they were all busy trying to do their jobs collecting evidence with none of their gadgets working he didnt let go of my arm we need to talk he said his voice surprisingly calm in private i added he nodded frost said let go of the princess its all right frost i led the way around the corner and a little way down the hall shiny white marble with veins of gold and silver was replacing the grey stone where mistral and i had made love it was as if something that we had done was changing the very nature of the sithen the queen would not be pleased but one problem at a time when we were alone except for my ring of guards he said show me what im feeling princess because its not the same thing im seeing should i have tried to trick him maybe but i was tired of games we still didnt know where amatheon had disappeared to the chalice had gone awol and who knew when and where it would reappear the only reason i had had frost with me when i suddenly materialized in the other hallway was that he had grabbed me when i started to fade but for that i would have appeared alone unguarded in the middle of the fight i dropped the glamour and had the small satisfaction of watching major walterss eyes go wide before he found his cop face but id seen the moment and knew i must be even messier than i thought what the hell happened to you he had let me go and now had some of the drying blood on his hand there was another assassination attempt i said leaving out that it wasnt aimed at me galen was injured in the fighting truth as far as it went walters looked at galen i nodded and galen dropped the glamour he even turned around so walters could see the worst of the blood how is he up walking around the sidhe heal faster than mere mortals i said he lost that much blood and hes healed im a little lightheaded galen said but give me an hour or two and ill be good as new jesus i wish we could heal like that so do i i said he looked at me i forgot youre mortal like us i shrugged thats the rumor you dont heal as fast as the rest of them no your arm isnt in a sling anymore he said and motioned to it no it got healed in a ritual the sex with mistral had healed it but i didnt need to overshare that much he shook his head is any of this blood yours i shook my head no his last time he pointed at frost now his he pointed to galen youre going to get one of them killed i hope not i let my voice show how tired i was how unhappy i was at the thought go back to la princess take your men and go why because there have been two assassination attempts in two days plus a double homicide someone wants you dead and doesnt care who gets hurt if they want you dead bad enough theyll succeed maybe not tonight or tomorrow but if you stay they will kill you are you trying to scare me major walters im trying to have you not die on my watch i agreed to come into your murder scene partly to help my career i admit that but if you die with me inside your faerie land i will never live it down ill always be the one who let you die if they kill me major walters the only thing you could do to stop them would be to die before me i dont think thats very helpful are you making a joke i sighed and rubbed my forehead fighting off an urge to scream no major i am not joking what hunts me here is nothing you can stop or protect me from i need your help to solve these murders but truthfully if id known it was this dangerous in faerie right now i wouldnt have brought you in were police princess meredith were used to taking our chances i shook my head do you have enough evidence do you have what you need dr polaski wanted to know what would happen if we gave you evidence that pointed to someone did she find something she wanted to know what he paused over his words use you would make of any evidence we gathered wed use it to hunt down and punish the murderer i said he shook his head wiping his big hand on the side of his jacket what about a trial i smiled and knew it wasnt pleasant there are no trials inside faerie major walters so youll use our evidence to kill someone the punishment for murder among us is usually death so execute them yes then well have to go back to the lab and contact you later you did find something i said he nodded if this was going to trial wed want to run it through a computer if what weve found is going to be used to execute someone without a trial we want to be even more cautious what did you find i asked he shook his head not yet you do realize that the murderer could be the one behind the attempts on my life by not telling me what you suspect or who you suspect you could be signing my death warrant by the time youve analyzed your data it could be too late for me his hands made fists and he closed his eyes i told the doctor that in so many words she wont budge so you dont know either i said i know its a print of someone we took samples from and the only ones we had access to were the ones in the hallway the guards i said and the kitchen staff he said i looked at him one of the royal guards thats what you think isnt it its who id be afraid of if i were you i could compel her to tell me what she knows or have one of my guards do it using magic on anyone connected with the police is a felony princess im immune to prosecution youd never again get help out of my office or anyone else on our side of the river you might never get help from anyone no other human law enforcement agency would trust you bringing us in here and mindraping us he shook his head i may not agree with polaski but ill fight to keep her free will and choice i looked into his pale eyes and knew he meant it i could maybe get something useful out of polaski and never be able to trust or be trusted by the police again or i could let them go and hope that the doctor knew what she was doing if i hadnt wanted their expertise then why had i brought them into the sithen in the first place i trust dr polaskis judgment and your stubbornness ill abide by the rules frost moved beside me as if he would have disagreed we will all abide by the rules of my agreement is that clear some nodded ivi was smiling as if he couldnt quite believe me or maybe he was just amused at some private joke of his own you never knew with ivi i understand frost said i do not agree but i will abide by it walters nodded ill try to hurry the doctor and her techs and get it to you as soon as i can but a print out of place isnt proof of murder it isnt proof enough to execute someone not in a human court i said see talk like that will make polaski sit on her evidence youll never get it but im not saying it to her am i you think id give it to you if i had it i think you understand more than she does how dangerous things are right now for me and my guards he looked at me for a long moment maybe but i agree with polaski on one thing i wouldnt want to be the person who gave you just enough evidence to get the wrong person killed once someones dead princess meredith theres no fixing it no going back id want to be dead certain that i had the right person before anyone got the ax so would i major and ill push to see that we get more proof you said theyd use the evidence to simply execute i said they could and probably will but i like you want to be sure fairplay and all but more than that major walters once someone is executed for the crime the investigation stops if we execute the wrong person then the murderer is still free to kill again i dont want that so its not about executing the wrong person for you but about letting the guilty go free a guilty murderer that gets away with it once may try again he nodded if they get away with it once most of them seem to get a taste for it he looked at me if everyone but you is supposed to be immortal down here then how did this beatrice die that is another problem isnt it perhaps aisling said i didnt want to look at him i realized i was angry with him angry about what hed done to melangell angry that he didnt seem to feel bad about it his tone of voice had sounded almost as if he had enjoyed it mistral suddenly joined our group excuse me princess queen andais longs greatly to speak with you his face was utterly neutral as he said it too neutral something was wrong princess meredith why not appeal directly to this doctor aisling said i took in a lot of air and let it out slow then i turned very deliberately and looked at aisling its not a bad idea i said my voice sounding more matteroffact than my face felt aisling smiled i could see just enough of his face through the gauze to know that i looked away from him i tried to make it casual but i dont think he or any of the other men was fooled maybe mistral wouldnt understand why i didnt want to see that ghostly smile but then he didnt know that id unleashed aislings smile on someone else no walters said we all looked at him why not i asked i shouldnt have told you youre in charge here right of the human side at least technically but shes the chief medical examiner and shes in charge of her people if i were the chief of police yeah but im not so you cannot make her cooperate frost said walters shook his head shell be pissed if she knows i told you as much as i did if she gets pissed shell be even less likely to share then why did you tell us aisling asked i kept my gaze on walters this time as he said because its got to be one of the people who were here in the hallway with us because theyre the only ones we took prints from i wont give you a name just because their print was where it shouldnt be not if youre just going to kill them but i dont want you getting killed either why major walters im touched i didnt smile when i said it give me your word that the suspect wont be harmed in any way and ill help you talk to polaski i give you my word that i will do everything within my power to keep whoever it is safe from harm doing everything in your power isnt the same thing as promising that they wont be harmed walters said no it isnt but im princess meredith not queen i am not absolute ruler here you can promise me things but if the chief of police overrides you then where does that leave me he shook his head fine talk to polaski but shes not going to be happy with either of us why should she be any different what he asked i shook my head just ignore me walters im not feeling my best if id had two assassination attempts on me in two days id be pissed i thought about that it wasnt getting myself killed that bothered me it was getting everyone else killed theres a reason why the president and his family arent supposed to date the secret service agents who guard them there was still blood on galens hand his blood dried a little tacky still too much blood too much was happening in too small a space of time holding galens hand made me start to tremble i realized in that moment that i was going to break down can you give us a few minutes major please my voice was only a little shaky he started to argue but something in my face made him simply nod and walk back down the hallway i fought it off until he was almost out of sight then the first sob came i clung to galen felt the glamour slip away and lost it i cried and sobbed until i started to hyperventilate i couldnt breathe and my knees started to buckle galen took me to the ground put his back against the wall and let me wrap my legs around his waist let me hold him as close as i could short of sex galen stroked my hair and said its all right its all right long deep breaths meredith frost said kneeling beside us slow your breathing or you will pass out i fought the wordless screaming panic i fought to breathe and couldnt do it galen stroked my hair and lied to me its okay were safe im safe lies all lies my body was screaming cant breathe cant breathe cant breathe frost grabbed my face between his hands held me so tight it hurt he made me look at him meredith meredith he kissed me maybe simply to stop the noises or because he couldnt think of anything else to do the queens ravens are trained in weapons handtohand combat battle strategy even politics hysterical women are not on the list his mouth closed over mine and i struggled against it there was no air i fought free of galens arms and clawed at frost he breathed a cold wind into my mouth the moment the cold touched me i stilled as if my body just stopped i think even the blood in my veins stopped a moment of nothingness silent still cold it was like being thrown into freezing water the shock of it stopped the hysteria stopped everything for a moment frost drew away from the kiss and my breath rushed back in a huge chesthurting gasp i took several deep painful breaths in a row while he held my face and stared into my eyes as if searching for me his grey eyes held that tiny snowscape in them again and i felt as if i were falling forward falling forward into frosts eyes he blinked and the sensation stopped but some night i was going to have to see what would happen if i kept looking into those snowy eyes but not tonight not tonight princess meredith a womans voice said im sorry to intrude i wiped at the tearstains on my face which didnt help since all i succeeded in doing was putting more of galens blood on my face i must have looked a horror when i turned around to face dr polaski her breath came out in a gasp which let me know just how bad i looked you dont get people who work in forensics gasping much major walters filled me in on some of whats been happening here today she shook her head and took her glasses off wiping her forehead with the back of her hand we do not want the general public to know what is happening inside faerie frost said i can keep my mouth shut she looked at me and i saw something in her face that was almost pity are you able to talk to me princess meredith i took a deep breath and it shook a little my voice sounded hoarse and i had to clear it but i finally managed talk to me dr polaski ill listen the guards parted for her to come closer to us i was still sitting in galens lap my legs wrapped around his waist if the intimate position made her uncomfortable she didnt show it i stayed where i was because i still wanted to hold galen as close as i could it was a way of clinging to him without looking like i was clinging to him galens hands rested at the small of my back polaski knelt down beside us so we were eye level i need to know a few things and you are the only one i can ask but by asking i will give away the suspect im most interested in understood i said she put her glasses back on and shook her head i dont think you do walters told me that you wont put whoever i find on trial youll torture them or just kill them is this true yes i said she waited as if she expected me to say more then she smiled and said no human i know would have just said yes to that they would have felt they had to justify taking another life they would have felt so many things she looked at me with those longlashed eyes but you dont feel what we would feel it isnt fey versus human doctor its cultural i was raised in a world where torture is the norm for crimes and execution is used when necessary though its rare we do not keep someone on death row for twenty years while they search for legal loopholes ive seen some awful things in my job princess meredith and there are a handful of people who i would sleep easier knowing they were dead she sighed i need your word that you will not execute the person im about to reveal i cant promise that not without lying your word that they wont be executed until i have processed the evidence weve collected i looked at frost and mistral beside him do you think i can promise that and not be forsworn i think the queen would put weight to your word of honor and not offend the human police frost said that wasnt a yes i said a simple yes might not be true he said his face was its arrogant best empty careful i thought it was more for the doctors benefit than mine mistral i asked she is very interested of late in courting good public relations the reporters death is bad enough she wont want it bandied about that we executed someone without proof so thats a yes i said he looked at frost they both looked back at me mistral said shes andais queen of air and darkness he shrugged your word that you wont let them execute anyone until i have processed the evidence polaski said i thought about what i could promise polaski and finally said my word that i will do everything in my power to see that no one is harmed irretrievably before you have contacted us again harmed irretrievably she almost smiled ive never heard anyone say it like that before i just looked at her willing my face to show nothing all right ill take your word dont disappoint me ill try not to i said can the little faeries change shape many of the fey have more than one form can the little ones be big like human size when you say little do you mean the small winged fey the demifey she nodded some of them can change form to be almost human in size but its rare among them galen started to massage my back i wasnt sure who he was trying to comfort himself or me how rare rare enough that until recently we thought theyd lost the ability we know of only one demifey who can do it now frost said polaski glanced up at him heres the other question could some spell or bit of faerie magic interfere with what im seeing frost galen and i exchanged glances frost said i trust rhys to have done everything possible to protect you from overt spells but could someone have magically imposed one handprint on another she asked they would have to understand how prints work i said so that leaves out anyone who hasnt watched television which is most of the guard but if they understood how prints worked they might be able to make one print appear to look like another would they be able to switch prints i dont believe so but i cannot be certain frost said mistral said i do not know how these prints work exactly but they seem to be like tracks of an animal not a bad analogy polaski said then i agree with frost it would be hard to change them in reality so theyre more likely to mess with what i think im seeing than with what im actually seeing we all agreed on that then i need to get out of here and check my findings with a working computer outside faerie your early questions point at one of the demifey on the kitchen staff i said she nodded but only if they can change shape so that they are as big as you the handprint is about the size of my own hands but matches one of the demifey which one i asked she shook her head i wont tell you that if you dont tell us well simply imprison all of them all of them she asked i nodded careful for you is not falsely imprisoning someone careful for us is imprisoning too many to make sure we get the guilty one behind bars she sighed then nodded again all right peasblossom the surprise showed on my face before i could stop it why the surprise because she and beatrice were very close ive known her a long time by human standards i cant imagine peasblossom hurting beatrice then someones messing with me because i got a handprint on beatrices back she looked up at the men can i use someone as an example aisling started to step forward but i said ivi he stepped forward with a teasing look in his eyes that i didnt like aisling stepped back with a smile if you could turn around please polaski said to ivi the man turned without a word giving her his back could you remove the cloak please with pleasure he purred suggestively he undid the neck of his cloak and let it fall to the floor to lie across dr polaskis feet she was now looking at the full fall of his hair medium and dark green with its pattern of white vines and leaves like his namesake she reached to move his hair back but the moment she touched it she froze stop it ivi i said i have done nothing he said but the smile was satisfied now as if he was happy with the effect he was having on her step away from her frost said i obey the princess not you step away from her i said he put on his mocking smile but his green eyes held some fierce knowledge that i did not understand but he obeyed the moment polaski wasnt touching his hair she seemed to blink awake sorry what were we saying whats happening i asked frost he has regained some of his old powers and that would be to say someone was like ivis hair was to say that they were compelling whether you willed it or no to be caught in ivy meant to be entrapped to be ivy climbed meant that your lover was destroying you in some way frost said i dont remember any of these sayings i said you would have no reason to know them hawthorne said it has been centuries since we spoke of ivi in this manner no wonder you look so terribly satisfied i said i have gained much simply by being in the hallway with you while you enough frost said we are not alone ivi dropped to his knees in front of me i would do anything to be in your bed for a night for an hour his eyes werent mocking now his face was as serious as he ever got get up i said the queen likes us on our knees well i dont i looked at frost who can she touch without a problem just in case hawthorne will do as he is told and his enchantment is more active magic frost said i nodded hawthorne go help the doctor demonstrate he went to her having to walk around the pool of hair that had spread around ivis kneeling body you must choose two of the green men let me be one of them ivi said dont make the princess ask you twice get up mistral said hawthorne gave his armored back to the doctor i guess the armor doesnt make a difference for this she touched the smooth crimson armor tentatively then with more assurance as if shed expected something to happen beatrice was stabbed here she pointed to a place on his back where youd be almost certain to get the heart the knife went in deep she left two fingers at the spot where the knife went in then placed her other hand flat alongside it i have an almost perfect handprint right here where someone braced to take out a deeply embedded blade i have almost the same print pattern on the second victim but i also have partial fingerprints where the knife was wiped clean of blood they may or may not be peasblossoms if we are sure it is her print then she would be our murderer i said yes but if she is then wheres the blade rhys traced it to your bottomless pit the other kitchen help say that once peasblossom found the bodies she didnt leave the area she didnt have time to go all the way to your pit to dispose of the knife someone else did it for her mistral said we found one good clear handprint on the wall near the reporters body it doesnt match any of the guards in the hallway but the hand is of a similar size sidhe adair said probably she said so either peasblossom is a ruthless killer and had an accomplice or the killer is imposing her print over his to hide his guilt she nodded cant we check her for spells galen said frost shook his head we have no one with us who is good enough at subtle magic humans tend to reek of magic once theyve been in the underground for an hour or more to differentiate between the things that might simply cling and those that are deliberate we would need doyle or crystall or barinthus i could do it aisling said no i said dont you trust me he asked with that ghostly smile not around dr polaski and her people no you were able to gaze upon my naked body and not be bespelled perhaps i have lost some of my allure for mortals or perhaps meredith is a sidhe princess mistral said and not mortal using your powers has made your tongue bold aisling hawthorne said nobody seemed to like him much had everyone been as shaken as i had been by his little show aisling looked at hawthorne you gazed upon me without anything between my face and your eyes that is a heros task or was it harder to resist my beauty than you let on he sighed and the teasing left his voice replaced by sorrow after going so long with our needs unmet there is no shame in being attracted to what you once would not have been we all crave the touch of another sidhe sometimes i think i will go mad without the touch of another being hawthorne did a brave thing then clasping aislings shoulder in a brotherly way i wondered if he would have risked it if the man had still been shirtless we have a chance to break our long fast with the princess aisling said hawthorne nodded aisling stepped away from hawthornes hand and moved to me it took a great deal for me not to flinch away from him he knelt beside galen and me there will be no princess for me aisling said she will not risk it now he looked down at me will you princess i didnt know what to say because he was right i did not want him touching me i said the only thing i could think of i will not rule it out but i fear you now aisling where i didnt before im missing something polaski said be happy you missed it i said she walked toward me no youre hiding too many things from me princess i need to know what is happening here or you get nothing from me and my people as she came to stand over us she brushed against aisling and started to fall galen and i reacted knowing that aisling must not touch her with his bare skin i stood between them pushing aisling backwards galen came to his knees and caught dr polaski before she could hit the floor the doctor was safe with galen but i was in aislings arms and i wasnt safe at all chapter he caught his balance and me with his arms and his body perhaps he stumbled more than he needed to so he would be able to hold me tighter but it wasnt him that made my hand slip underneath his tunic to glide along bare skin fear choked me ran along my skin so that it was like small electric shocks tingling out to my fingertips i saw melangells face her empty bloody eyes and waited for his magic to take me i stared up into those odd eyes with their inner knot bound in four empty loops there was no sign of the blue of his eyes something was missing i traced my hand up the curve of his spine so warm so firm so real he leaned over me as if to kiss me through the gauze of his veil i leaned back his hands tightened around my body holding me against him if i had not seen him with melangell i would have simply let him kiss me but some things once known can never be unknown i smelled roses i was suddenly drowning in the sweet almost cloying scent of roses aisling hesitated do you smell that yes i whispered a voice whispered through my head with amatheon i bid you hurry and you turned from haste and chose the longer road you risked losing that which you cherished i whispered galen aislings arms loosened around me but i grabbed for him because i was suddenly dizzy now i tell you that this must wait or you will lose again doyle darkness cannot be lost for it is always with us but there are other more fragile powers hurry who i asked who are you talking to aisling asked hurry the voice in my head said and with a last whiff of roses she was gone again where i asked it wasnt words it was more like the feeling that had come over me when i told frost that galen could not search alone for doyle but this wasnt panic it was just a knowing i simply knew where i needed to go no doubts no logic just knowledge who are you talking to aisling said again his voice shaky almost afraid i am not afraid to touch you i said but there is no time we must get to the throne room now why galen stood with an arm still around dr polaski casually the way he would have touched another sidhe she was looking at me as if shed never seen me before why did everything smell like flowers she asked i shook my head and yelled for rhys as i started down the hallway he came to the head of the hallway leaving behind the scientists police and bodies peasblossoms print is where it shouldnt be but it may be a sidhe using magic to implicate her put her gently in a cage until we can figure it out but no arguments just do it rhys his face did a rare show of arrogance going cold as the princess orders i dont have time for egostroking rhys i started to run i couldnt explain why but i ran down the hallway with its patches of glittering marble like some brilliant jewel peeking out of the grey matrix of the stone frost and galen ran on either side mistral came behind and the others trailed after we were down to less than ten guards but it wouldnt be a matter of numbers something bad was happening and we could prevent it just by arriving in time i thought about the mirror that had appeared in my room simply because i wished to see myself in the fur cloak as i broke into a fullout run i whispered under my breath we need to get to the throne now nothing happened for a handful of heartbeats then the stones shifted beneath my feet i didnt hesitate i didnt pause i didnt stumble i trusted that the sithen would get me where i wanted to go i ran as the world streamed around me grey stone flowing into white marble as if the walls had turned to liquid then we were running on dried dead ground i had a second to recognize the pool and fountain that stood before the great double doors that led to the entry chamber for the throne room but the fountain was now in the center of a huge formal garden spreading on either side the fountain had always stood in the center of a bare hallway crystall and the guards id sent with the lords to the queen were standing in the middle of that garden they turned frightened eyes to me i had no idea what about the garden made crystall look so shaken and i didnt ask panic filled me adrenaline like fine champagne screamed through me the double doors opened without a hand to touch them my pulse was choking off my air i fought the pain in my side to keep upright and running the climbing roses of the entry chamber filling the darkness with crimson blossoms writhed and slithered like great thorned serpents overhead i ran and the vines did not try to hinder us the last set of double doors was just ahead the court lay just inside them i whispered open and the doors swung inward i raced from the dimness of the roses to the brightness of the court and staggered almost blinded by the difference in light i could see nothing but light and shadow and half shapes exhaustion danced across my vision in starbursts of grey and white through the thundering of the blood in my ears i heard queen andais yelling i yelled stop this it took the last of my air and galen caught my elbow or i would have fallen my vision came back in pieces the court was dressed for a party or an expensive funeral a lot of black a lot of silver a lot of jewels andais was on the steps leading up to her throne staring at me at us barinthus stood at the bottom of those steps he stood so he could keep both the queen and us in his sight i knew in that second what was happening though not why why didnt matter to me by what right do you stop me from issuing challenge to anyone niece her voice held a rage that made the air itself heavier on my tongue she was the queen of air and darkness she could make the air so thick my mortal lungs couldnt breathe it shed nearly killed me that way was it just last night or the night before i beg a private audience with you aunt andais my voice was breathy and if galen hadnt had a death grip on my elbow im not sure my legs would have held me supernatural strength and magic were fine but i wasnt used to running like that she smiled begging is not done on your feet meredith she walked back up to her throne the long black skirts trailing behind her like a cloak of darkness she settled the skirts with a practiced gesture fanning them out around her the color framed all that pale skin and black hair the trigrey eyes with the dramatic eye makeup diamonds and midnightdark sapphires graced her throat and gloved wrist i dropped to one knee galen helped make it graceful and knelt with me everyone with me knelt when i did i beg a private audience with you aunt andais queen of air and darkness why are you and galen covered in blood i have much to share with you my queen but some of it might better be served to your ears alone has there been another attempt on your life not on mine no she shook her head as if she had a fly buzzing around her and she was ridding herself of it you speak in riddles i would speak clearly with you in private let us handle our public business first she said and pointed to barinthus who was still standing between the throne and our group the ring acknowledges him and you have helped him break his vow to me the ring knows lord barinthus you said that i was to fuck as many of the guards as often as possible wasnt that your order to me her face narrowed down to angry lines perhaps my words were hasty or perhaps you do not know that barinthus made a vow to me before i allowed him to join this court one that only he made and now he has broken it he has done nothing that will set him as king to my queen have a care meredith i know that he had sex with you sex that was more magical than real nothing that would get me with child he had release in your body no he had release but our clothes were in place and he has never entered my body with so much as a fingertip you swear this she asked i do i was told that barinthus had moved from kingmaker to wouldbe king i tell you that he has not broken the vow he made to this court the ring recognizes who it will and bestows its gifts where it will but he has broken no vow why did you not say this barinthus she asked you would not believe me queen andais she seemed to think about that for a second or two then gave a very small nod perhaps not she looked at me it was the kind of look that a hawk gives to grass when its almost certain theres a tasty morsel down there i have heard many stories about your activities now i wonder how much is true and how much is exaggeration designed to set me against my allies and you until i know what you have been told i cannot say aunt andais we are in the throne room meredith use my title my queen i bowed my head so she would not see my face this wasnt good this wasnt good at all chapter did the ring choose a couple among the guards her voice was very neutral when she asked i was glad i was staring at the floor because so much had happened that id almost forgotten about nicca and biddy murders metaphysics the goddess the chalice amatheon vanishing the attack on galen cels prophecy about the green men the lords who waited just outside so much and this was what she began with why yes queen andais the ring did choose a couple there were murmurings from the nobles in their seats on either side of the floor describe what happened i did as she ordered i talked of the phantom child and what i had seen and felt someone said the ring lives again andais looked at the man who had spoken do you have something to add to this discussion lord leri only that this is surely good news my queen i will decide what is good news leri he bowed as my queen wills she turned her attention back to me the ring lives again after centuries it chooses a possibly fertile pair and you dont think this is important enough to tell me much has happened since the ring chose them queen andais i thought finding the murderer or murderers took precedence i decide what takes precedence here not you she stood i am still queen i lowered myself to both knees and galen moved with me i have never questioned that liar she hissed and the room echoed with that one word okay this was bad really bad what have i done to anger you queen andais tell me and i will do my best to remedy it i kept my face down so that i was staring at the wellworn stone floor i did not trust my expression fear might excite her and puzzlement might anger her i had no expression that i could give her mistral come to me captain of my guard he got up off his knees and answered her command i watched him as he mounted the steps to her he made a sound of startlement more than pain as she grabbed a handful of his rich deep grey hair and used it to jerk him to his knees before her did you fuck him i tried to see the trap in the question but failed i answered truthfully yes my queen she let him go so abruptly that he nearly fell down the steps catching himself with one hand he stayed kneeling awkwardly most of his face hidden by the glory of his hair he lowered his eyes but not before a rumble of thunder echoed through the throne room the nobles moved restlessly looking up and around andaiss voice purred as she knelt beside mistral stroking his hair he shivered like a skittish horse when she touched him was that you mistral forgive me my queen i have not had such power in years my control is not what it was my apologies my queen two my queens in one sentenceyou must feel guilty indeed i have done nothing to feel guilty over my queen she kept stroking his hair but she looked out at me have you not he kept his face carefully down mistral had never been that good at hiding his emotions what have i done to anger you my queen his voice was almost neutral the distant rumble of thunder was not his powers were newly reborn and he was struggling did the princess bring you back into your power she kept petting him idly like a dog id seen her do that with a guard now and then shed stroke and pet them all night in front of everyone then leave them with only those caresses and nothing more id seen her reduce some of our greatest warriors to silent tears she petted mistral but the anger in her face was all for me why was she angry that id had sex with mistral what had we done wrong she walked down the steps her black dress slithering behind her could you bring any of us all of us back to our power is one good fuck from you all it takes anger was making her skin pale starting that first hint of moonlight glow her triplegrey eyes were beginning to shine as if darkness had light in it i put my hands on the floor and lowered my face on top of them i abased myself before her because i had no idea why she was this angry with me i had no idea what someone had been whispering in her ear she stood so close that the trailing edge of her skirt brushed along my body as she moved past me answer me meredith i thought of several answers discarded them all and finally said i move as the goddess wills it she came fast her heels clicking on the stones she knelt put her gloved hand under my chin and raised me up to meet her eyes that is not an answer my voice was breathy around my pulse i have no other answer if i even hinted that i might be able to bring others back with sex she might order one of her sex shows and i wasnt sure that i would survive it and there were nobles here with whom i could barely have a casual conversation let alone share my body there were those who were my enemies and i wasnt certain having them come back into their full powers was a good idea she slid her other hand into my hair grabbed a handful of it and jerked me to my feet i fought not to let the anger show in my eyes and knew that i failed it is not just my powers that are returning mistral said from the steps she turned to look at him and i knew that he had deliberately distracted her from me offering himself to her anger she kept her painful grip on my hair her other hand stroking along the side of my face much as she had touched his hair what are you babbling about mistral most of the guards that experienced the magic of the ring have regained at least some small magic that had been lost her grip tightened in my hair until i fought not to make a sound of pain andais liked that and i did not want to encourage her are you saying that she has brought others of my guard back to their power yes my queen she turned back to me and i didnt like anything i saw in her eyes she loosened her hold on my hair just a little as the silk of her gloved hand stroked my cheek and continued down along my neck under other circumstances it might have been exciting now it just scared me more how many of my guards have you had sex with meredith she moved her face in close to me as if she meant to kiss me how many of my guard have you given release she spoke the last word above my lips and i knew she was going to kiss me before her lips touched mine i felt movement all around me and knew that the guards were standing everyone with me had been in the hallway when mistral and i had sex so they all stood to answer her question they stood to draw her attention from me to them my bodyguards my men and women some of them had spent centuries like wellarmed mice quiet hiding trying to be invisible now they stood and purposefully made a spectacle of themselves she had moved back from me when they stood leaving the taste of her lipstick on my mouth she fucked all of you she sounded as if she didnt believe it you asked only who has had release frost said when the power filled the hallway it touched all who stood there you mean the power when mistral and meredith came together made all the guard in the hallway orgasm yes frost said she laughed and let me go how many fertility deities are in your lineage five i said five she repeated as she paced away from us now you dont even have to touch them to bring them power is that what youre telling me i thought you would be pleased that magic returns to the sidhe i said carefully afagdu one of the nobles spoke from his chair his eyes the only color in the white of his face and the black of his hair and beard our magic returns is that not what we have all wished for queen andais his voice was mild careful afagdu and his entire house belonged to no one they were one of the four or five truly neutral houses dylis stood in a gown of yellow that complemented her hair and brought out the triblue of her eyes she was head of one of the sixteen houses and had never been my friend you know that i have never liked essuss daughter i agreed with you my queen when you tried to drown her in childhood but if the ring lives on her hand and can bring children back to the sidhe then i will follow her a sort of mixed endorsement but i took it you follow me dylis until i say otherwise the woman gave a curtsy you are our queen i misspoke myself i meant only that if meredith can give us back our children then i would rethink my objections to her politely and politically spoken dylis but if you mean nicca and biddy they are both guards sworn to me and mine and no one else the guards serve me and my blood she smacked her hand against her chest to emphasize her words do you forbid a couple the ring has chosen to bed afagdu asked royal guards serve royalty this is their function andais said they will still serve you he said and his voice was careful again she shook her head not if there is a child but a child would be a great blessing this from one of neryss ladies the head of your house tried to kill meredith just last night or had you forgotten that elen she gave a curtsy so low that she almost disappeared behind the table if the ring truly lives on her finger then nerys was wrong very wrong if the goddess blesses meredith with her gifts then we were all wrong would you have us all childless because your bloodline is asked maelgwn the wolf lord he was naked from the waist up except for a hood and cloak of wolf skin complete with most of the animals face sitting above his own all his people had been shapeshifters until they lost the ability i am queen and my blood inherits this throne you have your brothers blood standing in front of you maelgwn said his mocking smile and his happy peaceful eyes taking me in there she stands your blood if your niece can bring blood back to all of us then your line is indeed powerful magic i have held the guards in abstinence for more than a thousand years they wait at my pleasure and the pleasure of my son and at your nieces pleasure afagdu said he seemed to be helping me but i didnt trust it he helped no one but himself and his clan andais waved that away as if it was unimportant yes yes on merediths pleasure she looked at me then though i did not intend the pleasure to be so pleasurable she came down the steps again gliding toward me in her heels and silk the guards are for our pleasure meredith not us for theirs im not certain you understand that niece she walked past me and i knew where she was going she stopped by nicca and biddy where they knelt i glanced back and found that they were holding hands they were also staring very hard at the floor as if she wouldnt hurt them if they didnt look up if only it were that easy she ran her fingers through the heaviness of niccas chestnut hair he went very still under her touch i like him in my bed but not for sex he frightens so easily he doesnt like pain do you nicca if i hadnt been kneeling within a yard of him i might not have heard his answer no queen andais i taught him that in a night did you know that meredith taught him what my queen to answer any question i asked him with yes or no and never ever to leave off the queen andais she ran her hand down the side of his face until she cupped his chin she raised him to look at her would you like another lesson nicca it has been long since i made love to a man with wings it might be interesting queen andais i said she didnt even look at me my queen you said that the guards who came to my bed were mine to keep i made my voice as neutral as i could but i knew it was a bad idea to say it would you not share him with me i thought about that perhaps but after he and biddy have had their night she touched biddy turned her face upward so she gazed down at both of them but if she gets with child then they will be married and monogamous and even the queen of air and darkness will not be able to force him to forsake his marriage vows my queen aunt andais if nicca and biddy could make a baby then it might mean that others of the sidhe could as well that is a good thing she let go of their faces and walked between them forcing them to let go of each others hands she traced the upper edge of niccas wings but he is mine meredith my pretty toy and i do not share my toys you said that any guard who went to the bed of the princess was hers afagdu said nicca is her pretty toy now she turned abruptly and started walking toward afagdu and his table of lords what the queen gives the queen can take away even the queen must honor her word afagdu said and you gave your word before the court that the guards who went to merediths bed were hers the fact that he would say such bald truth to an angry andais showed how confident he was that he could survive an attack by her there were few magicians among us who thought they were her equal in magic afagdu was one of them few would dare make me eat my own words in open court afagdu do not let your magic make you bold beyond your abilities is it bold to speak the truth my queen but of course two could play at that particular game very well nicca is merediths now but biddy is not meredith can do as she will with nicca but biddy is not hers to give to another man biddy belongs to my son to prince cel she looked at me would you steal even the women from his bed you cannot steal that which is offered i said and what does that mean meredith with your seelie eyes i swallowed hard and promised myself id think better before i spoke next time the ring gave biddy to nicca so you say but i say that the guards serve only my bloodline so how do you propose to satisfy both the ring on your finger and your queen you said any guard who comes to my bed is mine to keep correct yes so afagdu has reminded me then i will take biddy and nicca to my bed nicca will still be my lover but he will also be biddys will that satisfy you aunt andais i have never found nicca able to serve more than one person in a night i can bring him back to readiness with a touch i said can you really her voice was thick with scorn her eyes had gone back to being angry i didnt like the look or the tone but i answered her because not answering was probably worse yes my queen i can is this some new ability that you have gained no aunt andais it has always been my gift i keep forgetting that youre a fertility goddess descended from yes i did not think you liked women meredith my neck was beginning to feel strained looking up at her sixfoot height from my knees i do not as a rule but if this is the only way to satisfy both the ring and my queen then i will do it she walked closer to me forcing me to move my neck even farther back as if she knew how awkward it was would you do anything to see them make this potential child a reality i saw the trap in her words and tried to avoid it not anything no but much she said looming over me you would do much to have them fuck i fought the urge to sit back on my heels anything to get my neck out of the odd position i did not want to answer this question nothing good would come of it answer me meredith yes aunt andais i would do much so they could make the child the ring promised why do you care if they are with child life quickens inside them i saw it felt it it is a gift of the goddess how can i do anything but honor that gift you wore the ring once when it was in its full power you must remember how it felt she grabbed me by the hair jerked my head even farther back as if she meant to snap my neck she growled low and close to my face i am not a fertility goddess i took the ring off my enemys finger it was a spoil of war and it worked for me but its magic and mine are not complementary i never saw a phantom child i saw sex obsession love but children she lifted me off my knees by my hair i put a hand back to try to keep it from hurting so much i never saw any children our faces were almost touching now it felt as if she was going to tear my hair out by the roots why is it so important to you that nicca and biddy fuck i spoke through gritted teeth trying not to cry out because i am a princess of this court and i have a chance to give the sidhe their first child in a century it is my duty my honor to bring this child into being she let me go so abruptly that i fell and only galens arm kept me from smacking my face against the floor she touched his face made him look at her oh he is angry he doesnt like that ive hurt you i never tried him out i always thought he would be like nicca too gentle in bed but he doesnt frighten as easily as nicca a disaster politically but brave in that hero destined to die for a cause sort of way she cupped his chin in her hand is he any good as a lover if i said yes she might want to borrow him if i said no it would be a lie he was too gentle for me too but when i was in the mood for gentle lovemaking galen was just about perfect i think he is too gentle for your tastes aunt andais but not for yours she knelt down making a pool of black silk in front of my downcast eyes i have wider interests in the bedroom than you do auntie dearest why is it that any tender endearment from you always sounds like youre telling me to go fuck myself i meant no disrespect i have heard that you like it rough meredith she bent down whispering not as rough as me or cel but rough enough not every night aunt andais i did not raise my face beyond her silk lap i was in pain and tired of her insane games it had never occurred to me that she would see all the new magic as a threat to her so much had happened there hadnt been time to keep her informed but she was our queen and i had made her look weak because she got her reports from others the entire court knew i did not respect her enough to keep her informed or ask her opinion if she was going this crazy about smaller things what would she do when she found out that the chalice had returned and i had not told her that either but that was something i would not reveal before the entire court it was too dangerous if you are not with child you will never be queen she spoke into my hair keeping nicca and biddy from their child will not gain me one i said giving children to every couple in our court will not gain you my throne if i could bring hundreds of children to the unseelie court i would not need to rule it cel will kill you i know that do you want to rule she said it as if it had never occurred to her to ask i have no choice but to rule or die she grabbed me by the shoulders and galen tried to hold me from her a mistake that cost me bruises as she jerked me away from him do you want to rule if it is a choice between giving the court to cel or me i choose me what if there were a third choice she asked i know of no other choice i said dont you meredith dont you know exactly who would rule here if he could i must have looked as puzzled as i felt because she yelled at me barinthus would rule here if i allowed it he was always after essus to kill me and take the throne because that was as close to the throne as his vows could get him she pointed to barinthus standing near the side of the steps i told you that he and i have done nothing that could make him king to my queen i will take whatever oath you wish who has whispered these lies to you are they lies meredith all of them i dont know what you have been told but barinthus making himself my king is a lie then tell me what else is a lie meredith the ring has chosen a couple but i had to hear it from others not from your mouth you have imprisoned my sons guards without consulting me you have a suspect in the murders but you have not told me who you have fucked my new captain of the guard and divided his loyalties from me darkness and others ran into the night and i dont know why she stalked back to me grabbed my arm and screamed in my face i am queen here not you i spoke quietly too scared to be angry too scared to worry about the bruising grip on my arm i came to tell you of all this and more my queen but you have given me no chance you would not meet with me in private and what is it that you are ashamed of that you need whisper in private i am ashamed of nothing but there are traitors among us that do not need to know all our secrets she jerked me up on tiptoe we have punished the traitors may i show you more traitors my queen the ones who attacked my men and me you said it was not another assassination attempt she pulled me in against her body i said not on me they tried to kill galen i was close enough to watch her eyes and see the flicker she knew about the prophecy that was why shed insisted i bed vegetative deities when i entered faerie this time it was all there in her eyes and i saw something else there before she could stop it fear i saw it and i think she knew id seen too much she threw me from her so hard that if my guards hadnt been there to catch me i would have fallen frost held me for a moment then passed me to galen and put both of us out of reach of the queen shed have to wade through some of my guard her guard to get to me now i wasnt sure being so obvious was a good idea but i didnt want her to keep hurting me either may we bring the traitors before the queen frost asked she nodded and started back to her throne not looking back i think she spent that walk working on her face and eyes so that no matter who we dragged in she wouldnt let the surprise show it made me wonder who the queen was expecting us to bring before her did she know something that we didnt know and needed to what had that tiny flash of fear in her eyes been crystall came to my order the guards with him helped lord kieran walk in but they had to drag lord innis they dumped him at the queens feet her face was empty cold and arrogant it gave nothing away as she stood on the steps mistral was still kneeling behind her where she had left him barinthus was still standing where shed left him i think he feared drawing her attention back to him kieran knifehand your wife has been telling me evil things telling me that barinthus means to take my throne and that i should kill him before he comes back into his full power i admit the thought occurred to me when i realized he had been with meredith barinthus is many things but dishonorable is not one of them he gave his word i believe he will keep it in fact i allowed him into our court on that belief she moved down the steps until she stood just above him so why did i give such weight to your wifes evil words after a moment she said mistral my queen rise and come to me he did as she asked but kept his hair over his face as if he didnt trust his expression i couldnt blame him bring kierans wife before me kierans house was led by blodewedd who was created from the spring flowers of oak broom and meadowsweet by gwydion and math to be a bride for lleu llaw gyffes why would the unseelie court take in a woman who had betrayed her husband and her marital vows and only failed to be a murderer because her husband was able to kill her lover because marriage by force is not recognized among us she was created then given as a sort of gift like youd buy a dog or a horse even in a day and time when women didnt always have the right to choose their partners it was a little highhanded the one thing you always needed to remember with blodewedd is if youre fair with her shell be fair with you but dont betray her dont ever do anything she could take badly she learned from her earlier mistakes she does her own killing now blodewedd stood as mistral came for her table and one of her people her hair was the startling yellow of the flowers that had formed her her skin was a soft pale color that was somewhere between white and gold she was almost dolllike in her beauty the kind of woman men would create if they could with high proud breasts a little bigger than was usual for the sidhe her eyes were huge and liquid dark drowning and lustrous owl eyes in that delicate face supposedly shed been cursed with them cursed to be in the shape of an owl if that were true than shed managed to cure herself of everything but the eyes madenn is mine to protect queen andais i would speak with her before you take her is your house traitor to me as neryss was blodewedd i would never betray a fellow sister of the dark blodewedd would go for years without uttering a word in court then shed come out with lines like that nor would i tolerate such betrayal among my household you may speak with her andais said but it must be publicly done there will be no more secrets this night blodewedd gave a small bow then turned to the woman in question madenn was a small woman by sidhe standards barely fiveeight but sitting there in her black dress with her dark hair and eyes she seemed smaller as if she had shrunk in upon herself her normally pale skin was pasty her hands were very still on the arms of her chair she sat there immobile her face frozen madenn blodewedd said in a voice that carried through the hall your husband has been named traitor what say you to that madenn licked her pale lips i do not know what to say her voice was breathy but more in control than her face and body you must say something for the queens ravens come for you you must give me some reason to protect you if you swear to me that you are innocent of wrongdoing i will fight for you even against the queen herself but i must know now madenn i must know how much i am to risk for you and if you are worth that risk i could not see kierans face but even with his hands bound behind his back he stood easier and more naturally than his wife sat in her carved chair i watched what little blood was left in madenns face drain away fainting will not aid you blodewedd said and her voice held an edge of that purring darkness that andaiss could hold can you give me a reason for defying our queen about this give me a word of defense for you madenn and i will use it madenn looked up at her liege lord and tears glittered in her eyes but no words came as admissions of guilt went it was good enough blodewedd bowed her head and turned back to mistral i cannot save her from her own actions take her mistral the queen said madenn did not move or speak until mistral grabbed her arm then she held on to the arms of the chair like a child she may have been delicate by sidhe standards but she was still strong enough that making her leave her chair without hurting her wasnt really possible she was saying one word over and over againno no no noin a high thin voice hawthorne i said yes princess help mistral bring her out hawthorne bowed to me then moved toward them in his crimson armor putting his helmet back on so he had his hands free he went to stand on the other side of the womans chair mistral shook his unbound hair back behind his shoulders then nodded to hawthorne as if theyd discussed it they both bent their knees and raised the chair up with madenn still plastered to it they carried her and the heavy wooden chair threading their way through blodewedds people and out to the main floor they carried it all easily gracefully if madenn hadnt looked terrified it would have appeared as if they were honoring her carrying her like the may queen to be worshipped by her subjects the look on her face said that she was expecting to be the sacrifice not the belle of the ball they put her chair down beside her husband her shoulders rounded and i thought she was probably crying meredith the queen said come join me she didnt have to ask me twice she had taken her throne leaving what had once been prince cels throne empty for me it had been my chair for only twentyfour hours she motioned eamon her consort from behind her throne to take his smaller throne that was a little lower on the dais there was another throne lower down on my side too it wasnt for my consort of years but for the flavor of the day consort of the moment perhaps the last time id sat here the consorts chair had been occupied by sholto lord of that which passes between it was only as i took my throne that i realized that sholto and his sluagh werent at their table near the door nor were they at the queens back as guards the sluagh were not here he was king of his own court the goblins were not here either but they were often absent unless it was a planned event or a major holiday this was neither but sholto never missed an occasion at court he wanted too desperately to be accepted as sidhe to miss one tyler the queens pet human curled at her feet she asked where is your little goblin she meant kitto he is helping rhys watch over the police while they are inside faerie has there been some problem she was letting kieran sweat or seeing whether he would madenn was openly weeping and if she hadnt been part of a plot to kill galen i might have felt sorry for her i told her briefly of the effect the entrance to faerie had had on walters and his people she seemed most interested i wouldnt think that your little goblin would be a good choice to protect the police hes almost guaranteed not to bespell anyone by accident not sidhe enough for that she said i controlled the spurt of anger that followed her comment he became fully sidhe during an earthquake in california the earth moved for you how charming she was being both terribly urbane and slyly insulting i wasnt sure my nerves were good enough to keep up the small talk for much longer have you fucked anyone else today besides mistral she asked actual intercourse no then mistral take your place on the dais for goddess knows it will probably be your last chance to sit here i didnt like the implied threat in her words but i couldnt argue that mistral deserved the chair frost had led the other men to fan out around me like good guardsthat is those who werent guarding our prisoners barinthus was left standing on the floor she looked at him and it was not friendly take your place with her guards barinthus for it is where you have chosen to stand he hesitated a moment then bowed and went wide around her to stand on the far side of my guards i think he was going to try to be as invisible as he could manage until we could figure out what had angered her he had too many enemies to have any illusions if he slew the queen then most of the rest of the nobles would unite and kill him of course andais might not need the help only one guard whisper remained at the queens back when shed offered the guards a chance to help me i had not expected her to empty her stables as it were perhaps she hadnt either she had given them the choice of working for someone else and they had leaped at the chance offer a man a chance to break a thousand years of celibacy and hell do a lot for you of course being mine meant they would be leaving faerie behind in a few days exile from faerie if they followed me did they understand that did they care and if they didnt then how puzzled andais must be to find that her greatest threat exile from faerie was not so great a threat after all mistral took his seat on the consorts throne he swept his grey hair to one side so that it caressed the edge of the chair like a cloak id have given a great deal to see his face in that moment to see him survey the court from the royal dais for the first time if the queens words were true and not just her anger talking she planned on seeing that he did not get a second chance at the chair which meant no second chance with me was it personal to mistral or had she finally realized that she could lose all her guard to the ring and my body frost stood on one side of me and galen the other i missed doyle where was he where were usna and cathbodua i clung to galens hand because i couldnt seem to get enough of touching him id held his death in my hands now i wanted to wrap myself in the life of him but i did not trust him to fight here among the lords of the sidhe and survive i think andais thought we were giving kieran and madenn the silent treatment to wear them down i was waiting for my queen to take the lead id angered her enough for one night i would do everything i could to avoid pissing her off again kieran you have tried to slay one of our royal guards not in fair challenge but in an ambush if you think to trick me into challenging the young one it will not work if i challenge then he chooses the method of the duel he would choose weapons and i cannot best him without magic you admit that one of the lesser among my guard is a better warrior than you kieran of course the queens ravens are the best warriors the sidhe have ever had i would not be so bold as to think i could best him with metal kieran looked at me his pale beard framed the smile that had not left his face of course if the young lordling thinks i have insulted him and wishes to challenge me he left it open i squeezed galens hand and he laughed kierans smile faltered was i ever that stupid galen said goddess i hope not he raised my hand and laid a kiss against my fingers i saw a hardness in his face then that had never been there before i am at merrys side and in her bed and i wont give that up because you hurt my ego his usual grin flashed bright and clear as if the shadow id seen on his face hadnt been there at all besides im flattered you ambushed me with two magicians and three warriors i didnt know you were that scared of me i am not frightened of some jumpedup pixie kierans face had begun to flush in anger galen laughed and pressed his lips to my hand again if youre not afraid of me then why did you need so much help to kill me oh i agree andais said only fear would make kieran take so much help to slay one guard if it were frost or my darkness i might understand even mistral our lord of storms but i did not know you feared galen i do not fear him kieran said again but there was something in his voice that made me want to quote shakespeare the lady doth protest too much what was it about galen even if he were the green man who would bring life back to the court that would make kieran pack so much firepower as it were to kill him it was a very good question id been too caught up in nearly losing galen to really think about it if you dont fear galen then what do you fear kieran i asked lord kieran he said no kieran andais said she is heir to my throne and will one day be your queen if you live that long i think she can address you as i do kieran there was that purring edge to her voice that either meant sex or that you were about to be hurt really badly sometimes it meant both what do i fear kieran said i fear the death of the sidhe as a race do you fear that my nieces mixed blood will condemn us all to mortality yes as do many of us they are afraid to speak of it but they would act as i do if they had the courage andais looked past him i do not know kieran i think your wifes courage is fast fading he looked at her and there was something in his face some question or pleading if she would but speak with courage this might end well madenn gave a great hiccupping sob she had once been a goddess of youth which had left her permanently looking about fifteen a young fifteen the face she turned up at us now looked younger as if her fear were stripping years from her you have said many times that you would cleanse this court of the halfbreeds her voice was breathy and thick with tears we mean only to help you do what you always wished to do before she returned from the western lands and turned you from us andais was leaning forward and the anger was falling away from her kierans face was beginning to regain its smugness crystall search her for a spell some trinket aimed at the queen andais frowned at me what are you talking about meredith please your majesty please madenn said help us i watched andaiss face soften hawthorne i said if she speaks again before i give her leave slit her throat shell heal he didnt argue with me he simply unsheathed a knife and put it against her throat even as she tried to protest andais looked away from her shielding her eyes what is it crystall searched madenn and he was thorough enough that kieran protested he is laying hands on my wife if she is a widow then there will be no marriage vows to break andais said kierans mouth hung open for a moment then he closed it and i saw the first hint of fear in his eyes madenn made a small sound and hawthorne pushed the tip of his blade in enough to draw a pinprick of bright crimson blood she whimpered but did not try to speak crystall had to get very up close and personal with madenn before he drew a little cloth bag from under her breasts it was two pieces of cloth sewn together almost a tiny pillow the size of a fiftycent piece i lowered my shields enough to see the little pillow glow and there was a thin red line from it to the queen crystall cut the threads that bound it and spilled out a few dried herbs and seven strands of black hair he held up the hair between his fingers and the rest in his opposite hand a charm for you and only you your majesty he said a charm of eloquence so that her words be sweet to your ears andais looked to barinthus on the far side of the dais i may give you what i seldom give anyone lord barinthus he bowed and what would that be queen andais an apology she looked at madenn and kieran why would you risk death to kill galen he doesnt think he risks death i said she looked at me he has used magic to try and work wiles upon me that is cause for me to challenge one or both of them personally he told me that siobhan tried to kill a royal princess and she lives still and is not being tortured because ezekiel fears her too much he said if you would not punish someone for that then there would be no punishment for trying to kill a halfpixie guard she looked at him and there was something in that look that made him take a step back only to bump into the guards did you say that kieran not those words no did you say the gist of it he swallowed hard enough to be heard and nodded neryss entire house turned traitor tried to kill you my queen and they live why is the life of one halfbreed guard worth more than the life of the queen herself see meredith you show mercy and they will use it against you nerys gave her life so that her house could survive i said she paid the price for your mercy perhaps andais looked past them all to another house of nobles dormath the man who stood was tall and almost impossibly thin his skin was the whitest that our court could boast the bloodless pale of a corpse the black hood of his cloak was pushed back to reveal hair that was as white as his skin so that he looked almost like an albino except his eyes were large and luxurious and black he looked very close to the modern idea of death i was told that once he was as handsome and muscular as any of the sidhe but that centuries of peoples beliefs had changed him there were those who debated whether being the representative of death to that degree made him a weakmagicked fool who couldnt protect himself from mortal thought or proved that he was one of the most powerful among us and still worshipped by humans in a way his voice was deeper than expected yes my queen he said innis is one of yours as is siobhan are you traitors as neryss house were traitors no my queen i swear that i did not know of siobhans plan nor of inniss this i swear you interceded for siobhan you begged my mercy i gave it because my son also valued her and asked for her life to be spared i listened to my son and one whom i thought was my ally i am your ally your majesty my house is still your house two traitors dormath two in one house how can i trust that there are not more she was making idle circles with one finger on the arm of her throne is not the same thing true of blodewedds house he asked do not drag me into this dormath blodewedd said you who bear the name of your own dog for you have shamed your true name i have shamed nothing children andais said her voice light almost playful the sound made the hair on the back of my neck stand up you see what mercy gets you as a ruler meredith do you understand now mercy is for the weak and the dying i know how kieran has interpreted your actions she looked at me and i really didnt want that much of her attention in this mood but i had it and how is that that if you would not kill someone for trying to kill me then you would do even less to someone who tried to kill galen do you think he had the right of that do you think he has no punishment coming i think siobhan should be executed and kieran be made an example of an example how if not executed she asked i licked my suddenly dry lips i had not thought that far aunt andais ah but i have and that is the difference between being queen and being princess she opened those red red lips to say something awful but the big double doors crashed open and doyle appeared chapter usna and cathbodua came behind doyle dragging someone between them someone wearing a white fur cloak that was decorated with bright spots of crimson darkness andais said how good of you to join us who are you bringing so unceremoniously before us her voice still purred with a satisfied tone promising pain to someone doyle had just given her another choice of victims gwennin the white lord a little worse for wear gwennin i knew was no friend of cels he was no friend of anyone he considered pure unseelie he had been one of the last cast out of the seelie court and he still acted as if he might someday go back there the seelie might welcome back an exile from among the humans but once you became unseelie you were unclean and unforgivable i watched doyle stalk toward me he was the tall dark hunter the grim figure who had frightened me as a child but i had to fight an urge to tell him to come to me i wanted his arms around me i wanted to be held to feel safe sitting here in open court i didnt feel safe what had driven me from faerie three years ago was happening all over again there was too much death too many attempts eventually if enough people want you dead they will succeed its simple mathematics we had to survive every assassination attempt they had to succeed just once gwennin was not an ally to any of the lords we had arrested i couldnt imagine a plot that could hold all those before me was there more than one plot against me and what did any of it have to do with the murders gwennin andais said sounding puzzled you are no friend to those here she said aloud what id been thinking i wondered if that was a good sign or a bad one was i getting better at the politics or was she getting worse he says he acted alone that he resented the princess inviting in the human police that it was beneath our court to take their help so he set a spell that would have rendered them useless or even killed them if we had carried it to them carried it he put it on biddy for she is halfhuman and everyone of human blood she touched was contaminated gwennin found his voice even flat on the floor between usna and cathbodua that the spell was able to work on the princess proves she is human cathbodua gave him a backhanded slap speak when you are spoken to traitor yes andais said they are all traitors so many traitors but none of them tried to take merediths life they tried to take galens they tried to stop the humans from entering our sithen but they have not tried to kill meredith interesting that i thought about it and realized she was right i looked at doyle and he met my look with one of his own it was interesting and puzzling why would cels guard be more interested in killing your green knight than in killing you andais said conversationally i tried to keep my voice as casual and almost succeeded if any of his people try to kill me cels life is forfeit but killing my allies is not an automatic death sentence for their prince but why galen meredith if i were going to strip you of your allies it would be darkness or the killing frost or barinthus i said she nodded yes that was well done she looked at kieran and his wife who still had hawthornes knife at her throat if i kill barinthus then one of my most powerful guards is dead if he kills me then you are rid of me and can be the first to suggest that he needs to die for his actions she moved in her chair as if settling her skirts more comfortably oh yes kieran good plan you made only one mistake he looked up at her and what was that you underestimated the princess and her men i will not make the same mistake again he said and gave me an unfriendly look kieran that sounded like a threat to the princess andais looked at me did that not sound like a threat to you meredith yes aunt andais it did frost did kieran just threaten the princess yes frost said darkness she said yes he threatened the princess or threatened to plan better the next time he plots to kill you your majesty yes that is what i heard as well she looked out at the nobles blodewedd did you hear him threaten me and mine blodewedd took in a deep sighing breath then gave a small nod i need to hear it aloud for all the court andais said kieran has been foolish this day more foolish than i or my house can support or salvage kieran looked at her frightened for the first time my lady you are my liege lord you cannot mean do not involve me in your stupidity kieran madenn is your wife and has always been your shadow but if you could have persuaded more of your own house to take your part i do not believe you would have enlisted inniss help an interesting point andais gazed down at the unconscious form of innis dormath i offer you a choice one of your people must die innis or siobhan choose my queen doyle said i would ask that innis be spared and siobhan i know who you would kill darkness she looked at me i even know who you would have me slay meredith but you are not their liege i want dormath to choose so that the rest of his house will understand that he will not protect them my queen do not make me choose among my lords and ladies would you take their place dormath would you offer yourself to save innis and siobhan both i am willing to entertain such a bargain if you are willing to offer it dormaths face got even whiter something i didnt think possible he blinked his large dark eyes slowly were we about to see dormath the door of death faint come dormath it is a simple question andais said you are either willing to pay for the crimes of your house or you are not nerys was willing to give her life for her house dormaths voice came thin and reedy as if he was struggling to keep it even her entire house had joined her in her treachery my house is innocent of wrongdoing save for these two then choose dormath i cannot deny the princess her call for a death she is within her rights a death yes dormath said but not an execution she is within her rights to challenge them to combat and take their life if she can that might be true lord dormath i said if siobhan had attacked me oneonone but she did not she attacked with the aid of two others she ambushed me this was no oneonone combat this was an assassination attempt pure and simple innis did not even attack you dormath argued he attacked the green knight surely it should be he who demands the life debt do you think he will show more mercy than the princess andais asked i think galen has always been a fair man dormath said galen pressed my hand tight in his and sighed it was not a happy sound i tried to be fair and just and good whatever that means siobhan told me once that i belong in the seelie court where they try to pretend they are something theyre not i asked her what they try to pretend to be human she said and made it sound like a curse i watched his face grow solemn and very unlike my galen do you really expect me to help you save the lives of the people who tried to kill me the two sidhe looked at each other and it was dormath who looked away first he spoke with his eyes lowered so that he met no ones gaze one tries to know their opposition and use their strengths and weaknesses against them why am i your opposition galen asked dormath spoke to the queen as if he hadnt heard galen my queen i would ask that you do not make me choose between my people one has done perhaps the lesser crime but i have more affection for the other answer galens question andais said dormath blinked those deep shining eyes and looked at her his thin face showed nothing and what question would that be my queen i tire of word games quickly dormath she said i suggest you bear that in mind i will tell you once more answer galens question dormath shivered and the long black cloak gave the illusion of feathers settling around his body i do not think your son would want this question answered in open court i looked at andais then my aunt my queen i did not know what dormath was referring to but she might she had helped hide her sons secrets for centuries her face was cold beauty arrogant and perfect every line of her like some statue carved to be the beauty that drives men not to love but to despair answer as much or as little of the question as you will dormath know that if you answer as fully as you might you will forfeit all of prince cels allies for they will feel you betrayed them know also that there are those among us now who will condemn you as the blackest of traitors for going along with his plan dormath put out a long pale hand to steady himself against the table my queen dormath if you do not answer the question i will consider it a direct challenge to me personally you would slay me to keep from revealing what he has done dormath said is that what i said i dont believe that is what i said she looked at me then is that what i said meredith i wasnt entirely certain how to answer that question i do not believe that you threatened dormath with death if he revealed what prince cel my cousin has done nor do i believe that you have encouraged him to reveal all that he knows go on she said and she seemed pleased with me though i wasnt sure why but you have stated clearly that if he does not answer galens question you will challenge him to single combat and kill him she nodded and smiled as if id said a smart thing exactly i looked from her to dormath and i had a moment of pity for him she had set him a riddle that might not have an answer not one that would keep him alive anyway he was still propping himself up on the tabletop his face showed clearly that he did not see a way out of the maze of words she had thrown up around him i do not believe that there is a way to answer the green knights question without revealing much that i do not believe you want known i do not believe that you know what i want dormath but if you remain mute i will kill you and there will be no argument that it is unfair for it will be oneonone against me he swallowed and his throat looked almost too thin to hold the bobbing of his adams apple why are you doing this my queen doing what she asked do you want the court to know is that what you want i want a child who values his people and their welfare before his own the silence in the room was profound it was as if all of us took a breath and held it it was as if the very blood in our veins ceased to move for just that instant andais had admitted that cel valued nothing but himself something i had known for years she had raised him to believe that faerie and the sidhe and the lesser fey owed him he had been the apple of her eye the song in her heart the most precious thing in her world for longer than this country had existed and now she wanted a child that valued others above themselves what had cel done to so disillusion his mother dormath spoke into that silence my queen i do not know how to give you what you desire i can give you what you want maelgwns voice had lost its usual amused smoothness he sounded serious and gentle at the same time a tone id never heard from him andais looked at him and with only her profile i could tell it wasnt a friendly look can you wolf lord can you truly her voice held that edge of warning like the pressure in the air before you even know the storm is coming yes he said softly but the word carried through the hall she settled herself against the back of her throne her hands very still on the carved arms illuminate me wolf there are two children of your line who have come of age my queen one child has reawakened the queens own ring and now offers almost anything to be allowed to enjoy the rings magic a child who says bringing children to all the sidhe is more important to her than gaining the throne or protecting her own life or filling her own belly with life these are all things that most of the nobles in this room perhaps everyone in this room would give anything to have is that not a child who puts her peoples welfare above her own i sat very still i did not want to draw her attention to me maybe what maelgwn said was true but the queen didnt always like or reward the truth sometimes a lie got you further andaiss most beloved lie was that cel was fit to rule here she herself had opened the door to the nobles finally speaking the truth that cel would have been almost no ones choice if theyd had any other choice that didnt include a halfbreed mortal only my father had ever had the courage to tell andais that there was something wrong with cel something that went beyond just being spoiled or privileged andais spoke as if shed heard my last thought when my brother got his new bride pregnant so quickly there were those who urged me to step down i refused she turned and looked at me do you want to know why i called you home meredith it was so unexpected that i gaped at her for a moment then managed yes im infertile meredith all those human doctors have done everything they can for me that is why you must prove yourself fertile whoever rules after me must be able to bring life back to the courts maelgwn accused me of condemning all of you to be childless because my line is i can only give you my word that i did not believe it until recently if i could go back she sighed and slumped as much as her tight bodice would allow i wonder what we would be now we unseelie if i had allowed essus to take this throne these thirty years and more her eyes held a pain that shed never let me see before that one look answered a question that i had wondered about i knew that my father loved his sister but until that moment i had not been sure that she loved him back it was there in her eyes in the lines of her face even underneath the makeup she looked tired aunt andais i started but she shushed me i have heard whispers in the dark niece of mine whispers that i did not believe but if the ring truly lives for you if it has begun to choose fertile couples for you then perhaps the rumors are true is maeve reed once conchenn among the seelie with child i opened my mouth then closed it there had to be some among us who were spies for the seelie court it would endanger maeve to say yes but taranis had already tried to kill her she was in another country now as safe as we could make her it was more dangerous not to answer because we had told no one that maeve reed had been exiled from faerie because she had refused the kings bed on the grounds that he was sterile which meant that unlike andais taranis had known a hundred years ago that he was infertile he had kept his throne and condemned his people to diminish and die rather than step down the seelie were within their rights to demand his death as a true sacrifice to the land for that oversight id thought too long and andais said meredith what is wrong frost squeezed my shoulder galen was very still beside me i looked at doyle and he gave a small nod truth was the lesser evil i whispered it yes she is with child andais was looking from me to doyle as if she longed to ask why i had hesitated so long but she was a better politician than to ask you did not ask a question in public to which you did not know the answer answer so that everyone can hear you niece i had to clear my throat to make my voice carry through the hall yes she is with child a sigh of murmurs ran through the assembled nobles andais smiled as if she was satisfied with the reaction did you work a spell for her a fertility spell yes i said the murmur grew swelling like the sea as it sweeps toward the shore i heard her husband was dying even then is that true i nodded yes treatments for cancer can leave a man sterile or unable to perform sometimes i said but you managed a spell that got a dying man to perform one last time for her yes who played the part of the consort to your goddess who was god to your goddess for this spell galen i pressed his hand against my chest as i said it the ocean of murmurs burst upon us in a confused babble cries almost shouts some did not believe it i heard at least one male voice that i could not quite place say that explains it i would ask doyle or frost if they recognized the voice later andais looked at kieran still standing bound at the foot of the steps i slew galens father before i or the noble lady who brought complaint of magical seduction knew she was pregnant you almost slew a warrior who had helped work magic to create life in the womb of a sidhe woman and a dying human kieran looked confused as if he was thinking very hard i would say i do not believe it but you have spoken too much truth today my queen for me to doubt this and you do not like galen enough to lie to save him we never lie kieran he bowed i meant i know what you meant she leaned back against her chair almost cozily like a cat settling in what did cels people tell you that made you agree to do this traitorous thing i expected kieran to argue or fight her but he simply answered that the green man would bring life to her he nodded at me since he could not point andais looked at dormath and what did siobhan tell you that the green man would return life to the land of faerie kierans face showed his panic he tried to fall to his knees i think to bow lower but hands caught him kept him on his feet that is not what i was told my queen i swear it i would never destroy a chance for our court to be brought back to what we were never dormath she said explain to kieran the wording of the prophecy that prince cel paid the human psychic for dormath bowed to her then said the green man will bring life back to the land of faerie the ruler is the land and the land is the ruler their health their fertility their happiness is the health the fertility and the joy of the land itself well put dormath and very true if you killed merediths green knight and he was destined to be the king who brought back children to the sidhe then what would you have done to us kieran madenn she didnt wait for them to answer by killing him you would have destroyed all our hopes and dreams but it is mistral and meredith who have begun to awaken the dead gardens and the magic of the guard he was with her when the ring chose nicca and biddy kieran said it is mistral who sits in the consorts throne not the green knight true enough and perhaps the ring has chosen the storm lord to be her king i myself interpreted the term green man to mean any of our green gods but perhaps i have been too literal green man can be another name for god or consort she shook her head i do not know for certain i do not know if it is irritating or reassuring that prophets still speak in riddles even in this very modern america she turned to me go help nicca and biddy make the child you saw but abide by my rules if i find you have given him first to biddy i will be cross but take galen and one other green man to your body this night as well what of the traitors aunt andais i asked you go try and make babies i will tend to them i will give you a united court meredith it will be my first and last gift to you she put a hand in front of her face and said leave me take the guards who are green men with you but leave me the ones who are not frosts hand tensed on my shoulder and i must have made some small sound of protest because she looked up at me she glanced at frost and doyle and anger filled her eyes take your darkness and the killing frost they are yours but i will need some of the guards to help me punish the traitors and biddy and nicca i said quietly she waved her hand impatiently yes yes now go frosts hand eased up on my shoulder he gave a small nod i got up bowed to the queen and we moved toward the doors leaving her to punish the traitors she probably wouldnt kill them but shed make sure they regretted their actions of that i had no doubt i shouldnt have looked back but i did i saw crystall hafwyn dogmaela and others try to control their faces mistral and barinthus were among the unreadable i stopped frost grabbed my shoulder and galen still had my hand they tried to get me moving again but i balked i couldnt save everyone i knew that but doyle didnt try to stop me he simply looked at me with his impassive face he would give me room to rule i spoke with frost and galens hands tight against me the tension in frosts hand was almost painfully tight may i take a healer with me my queen just in case there are any more emergencies we sent for a healer when galen was injured but the healer never arrived she nodded but her attention was already fixed on her victims she stood above kieran one hand idly stroking the blond hair that he had so carefully braided back behind his head yes take any but my own healer hafwyn i said she couldnt keep the relief off her face as she started across the floor the queen called after her meredith if you wish a healer you must take one who still has their powers she actually put her hands on her hips as if she was impatient with me hafwyn healed galen and adair she was looking at me now paying attention healed them how she lost her ability to heal years ago she managed to look both irritated and relieved she is one you brought back into her powers tonight no my queen hafwyn has always been able to heal with the laying on of hands i was told that she had lost her ability to heal the queen said hafwyn i said did you ever lose your ability to heal she shook her head without turning around to face the queen as if she was afraid to look away from me or afraid to look back then why is she a guard the queen asked she came down the steps and i felt everyone around me tense we could have left gotten away and i was putting us all at risk but for the first time ever andais seemed willing to hear awful truths about cel i wasnt sure how long this new mood would last and there were things that would happen only when she was willing to believe cel was a monster she healed someone prince cel had forbidden her to heal he told her that from that day forward she would bring death only and no longer be allowed to heal andais glided across the floor toward us her dress making a hissing sound hafwyn paled is this true hafwyn the guard swallowed hard and turned around to face the queen she dropped to one knee without being asked or told yes queen andais it is true you had the ability to heal grievous wounds by touch and he forbade you to use your gift hafwyn kept her face down but answered yes andais looked at me she is yours but i cannot allow you to strip cel of all his guards even a queen cannot help another sidhe break their vows of loyalty and service hafwyn breaks no vow coming to me for she made no vow to prince cel i am told that many of the princes guard made no new vows to cel something passed through doyles eyes that let me know he at least understood why this was worth the risk andais frowned at me this cannot be true cel offered my brothers guards a chance to join his service after essuss death they made vows to serve cel hafwyn abased herself lower on the floor but said my queen cel told us you gave us to him he did not ask our permission or if we wished to serve him he told all of us that our vows had been made to a prince and he was a prince he said you all chose to serve him andais said in a voice gone hollow with surprise hafwyn kept her face pressed to her hands on the floor but she answered no my queen andais looked at biddy did you give your vow to cel biddy shook her head no and he never asked for it andais turned back toward the throne dogmaela did you give oath to prince cel no my queen she said eyes wide and face a little frightened andais screamed a loud sharp inarticulate scream that seemed to hold all her frustration i would never have given my brothers guard to anyone not even my own son all those who did not make oath to cel are free to choose to leave his service are we free to offer our service where we wish hafwyn asked her head raised just enough to look up at the queen yes but if you wish to go to the princesss service my order stands to serve her you must truly serve her in the way that the guard has always served my blood and my house it was biddy who said prince essus did not force us to serve him and only him andais looked at her and shook her head then looked at me what would you do with your guards if i allowed it i would free the women of the celibacy since as you pointed out they cannot get me pregnant after i am with child and know who the father of my child would be i would free the men from their celibacy as well and if you never get with child then i would keep those i preferred in my bed and let the others find lovers a halfdozen men give or take a few is enough for me i think and what if i said that any you did not keep must come back to me you told me once that you made the celibacy rule because you wanted their seed for yourself but if you cannot be pregnant then why not let them see if there are other women in the court they could get with child so fair so evenhanded so like essus she gave us her back and began to walk toward her throne take the guards you have around you and go and know this your ill truths will make our traitors punishments all the more fulsome for my anger will need flesh and blood to be stilled to that there was only one thing to say i will go and do as you have bid aunt andais i bowed to her back and we got hafwyn to her feet and left i did not need anyones urging to know that i had pushed her about as far as shed be pushed this night we left her caressing kieran the last sound we heard before the doors closed behind us was madenns scream i started to look back but frost and galen had too firm a grip on my arms there would be no more looking back tonight chapter there was a storm of butterflies outside the door to my room as if someone had broken a kaleidoscope and thrown the colors into the air and those colors had stayed floating whirling for a moment i didnt see the tiny hands and feet the gauzy dresses and loincloths i saw only what their glamour tried to show me a cloud of insects rising like beauty itself into the air i had to blink hard and concentrate to see them for what they truly were galen pulled back against my hand stopping all of us just short of that rainbow cloud galens reaction made me remember another time when id seen such a cloud of the demifey galen had been chained to the rock outside the throne room his body was almost lost to sight under the slowly fanning wings of the demifey they looked like butterflies on the edge of a puddle sipping liquid wings moving slowly to the rhythm of their feeding but they werent sipping water they were drinking his blood galen had shrieked long and loud his body arching against the chains the movement dislodged some of the demifey and i glimpsed why he was screaming his groin was a bloody mess they were taking flesh as well as blood galens hand tightened painfully around mine i looked up at him now and found his eyes a little too wide his lips halfparted i knew now why cel had bargained with the demifey to try to ruin galens manhood at the time it had simply seemed like another of his cruelties the kaleidoscope of butterflies and moths parted curtainlike and queen niceven hovered in midair on large pale wings like some ghostly luna moth her dress sparkled silver the diamonds in her crown were so bright in the light that the dazzle of it obscured her narrow features i knew what she looked like because id seen her thin near skeletal beauty before though only the size of a barbie doll she was thin enough for hollywood looking at her all asparkle and pale white i understood why people had thought the fey were spirits of the dead or angels she looked like both and neither too solid to be a ghost too insectlike to be an angel if galen hadnt been clinging to my hand i would have moved forward to speak with her one royal to another but i couldnt ask him to go closer to that pretty bloodthirsty cloud doyle saw my dilemma and went forward to bow before her queen niceven to what do we owe this honor pretty words darkness she said and her voice was like evil tinkling bells but a little late dont you think a little late for what queen niceven he asked in his polite empty court voice the voice that he used when he didnt know what political storm he had fallen into for courtesy darkness for courtesy she flew a little higher so she could see me better over doyles tall form now i am not even good enough for the princess to address me directly i called to her as galens hand convulsed around mine you know full well why galen doesnt want to come closer to you and your kin and are you attached to your green knight are you one with him in flesh so that you cannot come closer without him coming as well shed moved her head to one side and i could see her pale eyes now she wasnt even trying to hide how angry she was id seen her crown a thousand times and never seen the jewels catch the light so brilliantly only then did i realize that the light in the hallway was brighter than normal closer to the brightness of electric lights see she pays no attention to us the roof of the hall holds more interest for her than my court i blinked and looked back to the flying queen my apologies queen niceven the brilliance of your crown quite dazzled me i have seen your beauty many times but it has never been so eyecatching as tonight it made me realize that the light in this hallway is finally bright enough to do you and your finery the justice it deserves pretty words princess meredith but empty ones flattery will not wipe away the insult you have laid against me and my court i had no idea what she was talking about was i so tired that i had forgotten something important for i was tired an aching tiredness that comes after being up too long or after too many things happen in too short a space of time i had no idea what time it was there were no clocks in faerie once it had been because time moved differently here than outside now there were no clocks allowed because they would work just another reminder that faerie wasnt what it used to be what insult has been done to your court doyle asked no darkness she did the insulting let her do the asking her wings looked like some great moth but they did not move like moth wings not when she was angry they blurred and buzzed as she flew past doyle to hover in front of me galen pulled back so hard i stumbled against him he caught me automatically but that put him closer to the tiny hovering fey he seemed to freeze against me his arms pinning mine niceven hissed flashing tiny needlelike teeth and darted in i think she only meant to land on my shoulder but frost put his arm in her way he didnt try to hit her but her guard reacted flying toward their queen they descended on us like a swirl of rainbow leaves with tiny pinching hands and sharp biting teeth galen yelled and threw up a hand turning so that he used his own body as a shield against them he started to run but he tripped and fell landing on the ground with me underneath him he caught himself with one arm so that i didnt take his full weight my face ended up buried in the rich green smell of crushed leaves i opened my eyes and found myself nearly buried in greenery i thought for a moment that galen and i had been transported but my fingers found the bareness of the hallway stone underneath i looked at the far wall and saw the other guards still standing around us plants had sprung from the naked rock galen had curled himself over me shielding me with his body he was still tense and waiting for the first blow a blow that did not come i turned enough to see his face his eyes screwed tight he had given himself over to one of his greatest fears to protect me he hadnt seen the flowers yet but the others had nicevens voice hissed evil sidhe evil evil sidhe you have bespelled them interesting doyle said very interesting most impressive hawthorne said but whose work is it galens nicca said galens body had begun to relax above me he opened his eyes and i watched his puzzlement as he looked at the plants that had filled the hallway i did not do this yes nicca said again in a voice that was very certain yes you did galen raised up on one arm so that he was half sitting above me he turned and looked behind us and whatever he saw covered his face in astonishment i sat up and looked too flowers filled a small space of hallway the winged demifey were cuddled into those flowers rolling in the petals covering themselves with pollen they were reacting like cats to catnip queen niceven hovered above them untouched by the call of the flowers less than a handful of her winged warriors were at her side all the others had fallen to galens flowers it was an enchantment that much i understood but beyond that i was as lost as the look on galens face hes the only one who has not had new power manifest frost poked at one of the nodding blossoms with the tip of his sword well doyle said gazing at the flowers and the drugged demifey this is certainly manifested he grinned a quick flash of teeth in his dark face if his power continues to grow he could do this to human or even other sidhe armies i had almost forgotten that we ever had such nice ways to win battles well a voice said from behind us i leave for a few minutes and youve planted a garden it was rhys back from escorting the police outside the sithen nicca told him what had happened rhys grinned at galen what is this the hand of flowers its not a hand of power nicca said its a skill a magical skill you mean like baking or doing needlepoint rhys asked no nicca said not rising to the joke i mean it is like mistrals manifesting a storm it is a manifestation a bringing into being rhys gave a low whistle creating something out of nothing the unseelie havent been able to do that in a very long time galen touched one of the largest cupped blossoms and it spilled a tiny demifey out into his hand he jerked as if hed been bitten but he didnt drop the delicate figure a female dressed in a short brown dress with her brown and red and cream wings fanned out on either side of her as she lay on her back in his hand she was tiny even by demifey standards her entire body did not fill galens palm she lay almost completely limp a smile on her face her eyes rolled back into her head her body was covered in the black pollen of the flower shed crawled into she wasnt just drunk she was passed out happydrunk galen looked more and more puzzled he gazed up at doyle half holding the little fey up to him for those of us under a century what in the name of danu is going on i didnt do this on purpose because i didnt know it was possible if i didnt know it was possible then how could i have done it at all magic takes will and intent not always doyle said not if it is simply part of what you are frost said galen shook his head what does that mean maybe we should save the magic lessons for later rhys said when were more alone he was looking at the tiny queen who was still hovering above us gazing at her fallen army yes white knight keep your secrets from me she said for the princess has broken the bargain she made with me my people are her eyes and ears no longer we serve prince cel once more i got to my feet careful not to step on the demifey who were passed out in and among the flowers that would be bad on so many levels i did not break our bargain queen niceven you took sage away he could not take blood if he was not allowed near me she buzzed to hover in front of my face her white wings moving in a blur of speed that would have shredded true moth wings i knew from sage that that blur meant she was angry i bargained for a little blood a little sexual energy to come to my proxy and thus to me i did not bargain for him to be made sidhe i did not bargain for him to lose the use of his wings i did not bargain for him to be too big for your bed i said i am married she said and that last word sounded like a curse i have no lover save my king no and because you cannot have your favorite lover you forbid him the pleasure of anyone else the wind from her wings played along my hair buffeted my face the air was cool though her anger was not what i do with my court is my business princess it is but you accused me of breaking our bargain and i did not i am still willing to offer a taste of royal blood to you i held my hand out slowly gently offering her my upturned wrist i did not want another misunderstanding do you wish to take the blood personally you sent sage as your proxy because the western lands are far from faerie but now i am here she hissed at me like a startled cat and buzzed high into the air above me i would not taste your sidhe flesh for all the power in the world you will not steal my wings from me but sage was always able to change to a human size you are not so you cant get stuck in a larger size she hissed again shaking her head sending rainbow dazzles to dance around the walls on us and the flowers never then choose another proxy i said who would take such a risk she said a small voice came someone who has no wings to lose i looked down until i saw a cluster of demifey against the far wall none of them had wings but they had other means of transport carts pulled by sleek creamcolored rats and one dainty chariot that had more than a dozen white mice tied to it there were two ferrets with multiple tiny riders one the standard black mask the other an albino with white fur and reddish eyes a nile monitor that was nearly four feet long had two of the larger riders the monitor was not only harnessed but muzzled like a dog that youre afraid will bite nile monitors could be vicious and ate anything small enough to catch and kill if id been the size of a barbie doll i wouldnt have wanted one anywhere near me movement on the wall brought my attention to the fact that there were tiny manylegged demifey clinging there some looked like tiny spider centaurs eight legs combined with a rounded fey body hidden under a sway of gauzy cloth one looked like a black beetle so like that only staring showed the pale moon of a face under the insect camouflage i spoke said one of the men in a ratdrawn cart there was a woman in the cart with him she was pulling on his arm trying to stop him from waving no royal no she said dont do it there are worse things than not having wings he let go of the reins that led to a lovely rat and grabbed the womans arms i will do this penny i will do this penny shook her head i dont want to lose you you wont lose me i will if she makes you sidhe i have no other size penny she cant trap me in human size the way she did sage because its not one of my abilities he hugged her to him petting her short dark hair and looked up at me his hair was short and black and just under his bangs were two long graceful antennae as black as his hair his eyes were large and almondshaped and a perfect blackness like doyles or sages come to that his skin was very white in contrast to all that darkness the woman turned her head to gaze up at me and she too had long graceful antennae it was rare for any of the demifey to have antennae but for those without wings it was doubly surprising the two pale oval faces stared up at me there was a little more squareness to his jaw a somewhat daintier curve to hers he was a little taller than she a little more broad of shoulder narrow of hip but beyond the basic differences that made them male and female they looked identical youre twins i said pennyroyal penny and royal it was a custom among the demifey to divide a name up among twins he nodded she just stared at me they were even dressed alike in gauzy tunics of deep purple they were both dressed in more clothing than the majority of the demifey her dress covered her from neck to knees his tunic covered him from neck to knees as well i realized as i looked at the wingless ones that they were all dressed in a similar fashion the winged fey men went for what amounted to kilts or loincloths of gauze the women were in minidresses or less only queen niceven wore a gown that swept to her ankles she was their queen she got more clothes but id never noticed the marked difference in clothing between those who had wings and those who did not i have not agreed to this niceven said and came to hover at my shoulder please your majesty let me try you do not know what it is like to be without wings doomed to walk or ride forever she crossed her arms over her thin chest i feel for your plight royal and all of you who are so cursed but you might get a great deal more than just wings from touching this one she motioned at me look what has happened with the green knight would having one of your people able to conjure such enchantments be a bad thing your majesty he asked she came to hover near my face how can i trust you princess when you have insulted me and my court so severely doyle said you spoke of an insult when you first arrived you said the princess had done it what has she done niceven turned in the air so she could see him then moved backwards so she could see us both as she spoke you arrested one of my people without asking my permission beatrice was not sidhe she was mine though trapped in her humansized form she was demifey beatrice was cursed but she was not andaiss or yours the murderer is one of mine the victim is one of mine and you did not give me even the courtesy of a message no other court would have been so ignored she moved close enough that the air from her wings brushed my hair against my face you would have at the very least contacted kurag goblin king he would not have had to learn of such a thing from rumor and gossip as i did sholto king of the sluagh sat in the consorts throne for you last night you would not have arrested his people without asking him first she flew to the ceiling and stayed there fluttering like an angry butterfly back and forth above us i watched her all white and glittering all hurt pride and wounded arrogance and fear fear that her court had become so little among us that she truly was queen in name only she was right i should have sent you a messenger when we arrested peasblossom i should have sent you a message when we discovered that one of the murdered was a demifey you are right i would have notified kurag goblin king i would have contacted sholto i would not have done to them what i have done to you you are a princess of the sidhe frost said you explain yourself to no one i shook my head and patted his arm frost i spend a great deal of time explaining myself to everyone not to demifey he said and his face was arrogant cold and heartbreakingly handsome frost either the demifey are a court unto themselves worthy of respect or they are not queen niceven is within her rights to be angry about this his hand gripped the hilt of his sword but he didnt say anything to insult them beyond a certain point was to break them as a court as a people he wasnt willing to do that merrys right galen stood slowly being as careful where he put his feet as i had been he still held the tiny brown winged fey asleep in his hand i may not like queen niceven and the demifey but she is a queen and they are a court we should have sent someone to tell her what was happening he gazed up at the tiny queen i dont know if you care what i think but im sorry she came slowly down from the ceiling her wings had slowed fanning gently so that the illusion of some graceful moth was back after what we did to you it is you who offers us an apology she looked at him as if she had never truly seen him before you fear us hate us why would you show us courtesy he frowned and i watched him try to put into words what was simply him it had been the right thing to do and for once it had even been the politically smart thing to do but that hadnt been why hed done it we owed you an apology he said at last merry explained it i wasnt sure that anyone else would agree with her so i did niceven floated over to face me he apologized to us because it was the right thing to do yes i said she looked back at him then at me oh princess you must keep this one close for he is too dangerous to be left alone among the sidhe too dangerous galen said dangerous to whom to yourself for one niceven said fluttering over to him she put thin pale hands on the hips of her white dress i see goodness in your face goodness and gentleness you are in the wrong court green knight my father was a pixie and my mother an unseelie sidhe he shook his head vigorously enough that niceven moved a little back from him no the glittering throng wouldnt touch me niceven gazed down at the flowers and her besotted people they might now no hawthorne said taranis doesnt forgive a sidhe who joins the darkling court if you take your exile to the humans and wander lost for a few centuries maybe hell forgive you but he lifted his helmet off once youve been accepted here there is no going back perhaps niceven said or perhaps not queen niceven i said she turned to me her face carefully passive her thin hands folded in front of her what do you mean perhaps not she shrugged oh someone who can be a fly upon the wall hears things what sort of things i asked things that i might share with someone who was my ally and honored their bargains if you will not take blood directly from me then i will need a new magical proxy i said she turned in the air and looked at royal and his sister in their ratdrawn cart royal she said he stood straighter almost to attention though without wings he could not be in nicevens guard yes my queen would you taste the blood of the princess and share the essence with me gladly my queen penny clung to him dont royal dont do it he drew her away from him and looked down into her face how long have we dreamed of wings she let her arms fall limp to her sides forever she said i didnt give sage wings i said no royal said you gave him wings he pointed at nicca but nicca wasnt tasting my blood when it happened royal nodded and stepped from the cart he gazed up at me it was during sex i looked at him he was about ten inches tall a little shorter than a barbie doll but not by much i tried to think of a polite way to say it and finally settled for i think the size difference is a little much he flashed me a grin sage has given a very full report to the court i am willing to take blood while you have sex with others in hopes that it will bring my wings i shook my head nicca may have been a special case royal gripped the hem of his tunic and lifted it off in one smooth movement letting it drop to the floor he was naked before me miniature and perfect he turned around displaying a perfect tattoo of wings covering his back down to his upper thighs the wings were almost black with lines of charcoal running through them the edges curled over his shoulders like the draping edge of a shawl bright scarlet and black graced his lower back and buttocks in soft curving stripes like the ruffled edge of a petticoat he turned so that i could see that the black and scarlet was edged by a thin stripe of the dark almost spots cut with white and a thin line of gold that edging strip curved over the side of his hip so that the sides of his hips were striped with color too niccas wings belonged to some longlost moth something that had flown the skies of europe more than a thousand years before but i knew what had painted itself upon royals skin youre an underwing moth an ilia underwing he looked back over his shoulder at me smiling thats one of the names humans use he seemed pleased that id known what his wings belonged to his small face suddenly became very serious do you know the other name for the ilia my pulse sped just a bit which was silly he was the size of a childs toy the heat in his eyes shouldnt have had that strong an effect but my mouth was dry and my voice just a little whispery the beloved underwing yes he said he started toward me and if it hadnt been silly i would have backed up a man that is shorter than my forearm couldnt possibly have been intimidating but he was galen said softly at my shoulder he does know hes not getting sex right so its not just me who wants to back up a step no galen said you are very good doyle said i looked at doyle but all his attention was on the little man what do you mean i asked glamour doyle said are all the demifey as good at glamour as sage and this one rhys asked not all of them but a great many yes doyle said rhys shivered i am not sharing the bed with this one sage taught me my lesson i dont need another one youre not on the menu for tonight rhys for once im glad he said then who do i get to share you with royal asked as i looked down at him the feeling of sex and intimidation became more intense its stronger when i look at you royal nodded because looking is all youre doing now who am i sharing you with tonight galen answered me but truthfully im not sure i can do it i may have apologized for us but i still dont want them touching me you touch one of us right now niceven said galen glanced down at the still sleeping fey in his hand but thats different he said in what way is it different she asked this ones not scary he motioned his hand up toward niceven royal laughed and it was like chimes in a happy wind and am i scary green knight i was close enough to see galens pulse beating against the side of his throat yes he said and his voice sounded as dry as mine felt royals laughter trailed away to something darker such talk will turn a mans head green knight the look on his face showed just how pleased he was that galen was afraid of him some glamour grows stronger with physical touch adair said hed kept his helmet on are you asking if mine grows stronger oak lord royal asked speculating not asking adair said as if to ask a question of a demifey was beneath him well adair could be highhanded if he wished but he wasnt stripping down for the demifey does your glamour grow stronger with physical touch i asked he grinned up at me it does galen whispered against my hair can nicca and you have this one ill take the next one i glanced back at him if you wish yes he sighed and leaned his forehead against the top of my head damn it merry what i asked i cant pass on the scary parts if you still have to do them are you sure you have to do this dont you want to know why queen niceven said that the seelie court might take you in if you offered them more power yes he said yes damn it he looked up at niceven and she knew wed want to know a spy is only as good as his information green knight my name is galen please use it why because the only people who ever call me green knight tend to try to hurt me she looked at him a moment then gave a small bob in the air very well galen you have been truthful with me so i will be truthful with you but you will not find it comforting truth seldom is he said the tone in his voice made me hug his free arm around me we feed not just on blood and magic you feed on fear doyle said and there was something about the flat way he said it that told me there was a story behind those few words yes darkness niceven said as do many things here at the unseelie court she turned back to galen and me i think the green galen will be a feast fit for a queen then lets begin the bargaining i said we have struck our bargain princess i shook my head no the bargain about what royal can do and cant do in my bed and on my body are we really such a fearsome thing that you have to bargain as closely with us as you would with the goblins you chastised me for treating you as less than the goblins queen niceven if i do not negotiate with you as i would the goblins isnt that just another kind of insult she folded her arms under her small breasts you are not like the other sidhe meredith you are always difficult tricksy you would try and bat your tiny eyes at me and have me think royal and the rest of you are harmless that you are the childrens storybook characters you ape oh no queen niceven you cant have it both ways not with me youre either dangerous or youre not she gave me a perfect childs pout do i look dangerous to you princess her voice was wheedling and for just a moment i felt like saying no of course not galen gripped my arm tight squeezing it helped me think ive seen your true face queen niceven he said your glamour wont work on me now not even with it pushing at me like some sort of wall yes nicca said ive never felt any of the demifey this strongly before the demifey are the essence of faerie doyle said as faerie grows in power so will they apparently he didnt sound entirely happy about it niceven turned to him why darkness if i didnt know better id say you were afraid of us too my memory is as long as yours niceven the cryptic statement seemed to please her youre afraid to bring us back into our full power and here the princess has bargained to help us do just that irony is sweet when it is on the right foot be careful how much irony you enjoy niceven too much irony can be bad for you darkness is that a threat her voice didnt sound gentle at all now a warning he said am i important enough for the queens darkness to threaten my we have moved up at court youll know when doyle threatens you little queen frost said she bobbed in the air and again because of sage i knew it was their version of a stumble i am not afraid of darkness frost leaned into her the way youd intimidate someone by invading their personal space some of the effect was ruined by her wings and her size but not all of it i am not afraid of the killing frost either she said you will be he said and that was how the negotiations began they ended with a crowd of wingless demifey inside my room and none of the sidhe happy about it nicevens idea was that perhaps it had been sages continuing to feed from sidhe blood that had done the damage i couldnt argue her logic if i didnt like royal after tonight i could choose one of the others but all of them got to be in the room we compromised but she wouldnt tell us what she knew of the seelie court until after we had fed royal tomorrow she promised if she had fed off him and scoured out our magic from his flesh tomorrow we might learn some of the secrets of the seelie court tonight we had to pay for those secrets in blood and flesh and magic and as usual someone would be tasting my blood taking a bit of my flesh where was a stunt double when you needed one chapter rhys paced by the bathtub though there was precious little room for pacing the bathroom was bigger than most standard modern bathrooms but once you squeezed in frost doyle galen nicca and his wings kitto and me no bathroom short of queen andaiss personal bathroom would have been big enough kitto was running the bath playing servant which hed started doing more and more andais had offered me servants but doyle had refused on the grounds of my safety we couldnt trust anyone as we trusted each other that was part of the reason the other part was that the servant would spy for andais and we had too many secrets for that we didnt share that part with andais when i escorted major walters and the good doctor to their cars the fbi was still there persistent bastard i said rhys shook his head and stopped beside me no merry not persistent carmichael who thought our killing frost was so pretty had just gotten to the cars too what are you saying rhys doyle was leaning to one side of the door that according to the fbi and the people who escorted carmichael out only a few minutes had passed since i put carmichael outside of the mound its been hours since then i said i was sitting on the corner of the wide marble edge of the tub trying to make myself small so we werent too crowded not according to the humans outside rhys said what does that mean i asked it means that the sithen is playing with time doyle said time always runs funny inside faerie i said but only in pockets rhys said and only by a few minutes maybe an hour faerie has been on the same time schedule as the mortal world since before we came to america he leaned against the double sinks fitting himself beside galen nicca had most of the far corner of the room for himself and the sweep of his wings what does it mean frost spoke from the wall on the other side of the door it means that it isnt only the sidhe and the demifey who are regaining some of their old powers you told me that the humans reacted to the entrance to faerie as if the hallway had its old glamour doyle said why should we be surprised that the sithen is gaining back other abilities as well i hugged my knees trying to ignore the scratchy dried blood on my jeans kitto was testing the nearly full tub i said sometimes you talk about the sithen as if its just a building sometimes you talk as if its a being in its own right sometimes you speak of the sithen as if it is faerie i asked my father once if the sithen was alive and he said yes i asked if it was a person and he said no i asked if it was faerie and he said yes i asked if it was the totality of faerie and he said no does anyone alive today actually know what the sithen are you do ask the most difficult questions sometimes rhys crossed his arms the white of his trench coat framing his pale suit a wet line on his trousers showed where the snow had stained the cloth hed made two more trips outside that night than most of the rest of us does that mean you cant answer the question or you wont youre princess meredith nicessus our future queen if you order it we have to answer he said i frowned at him i did not order you to tell me rhys i asked he rubbed the heel of his hand against his good eye and when he lowered it he looked tired he might be boyishly handsome forever but his face could still hold lines of weariness now and then im sorry merry but if the sithen is messing with time then were going to have to post a guard outside of faerie so that we can figure out the difference between the two places chronologically that will tell us how bad it is right now but but not how big the difference will grow nicca said rhys nodded this could get really bad im losing something here i said why do you all look so worried dont look at me galen said i dont know why they all look gloomy about it either i mean the sithen does a lot of weird stuff it always has and what if the sithen decides to make the difference between inside faerie and outside faerie not just hours to minutes but years to days rhys said galen and i exchanged a look he said can it do that i said oh it has in the past rhys said i thought that the queen or king of the court controlled the time difference i said once doyle said but that ability went away long ago wait galen said did you say the queen could control how big the time difference was several of us nodded didnt the old stories say that only hours would pass inside faerie but centuries would pass outside in the human world yes doyle said looking at galen as if he had said something smart we accomplished a lot in the last few hours but the rest of the world has used up only a few minutes in effect our sithen is moving faster than everybody else isnt that opposite of the way it used to work didnt mortal time move faster than ours i watched the rest of them exchange glances except for kitto who seemed totally absorbed in running the bath by the looks on everyones faces ive missed something we had a lot to do tonight galen said we still have a lot to do tonight and while we get all of it done the outside world moves at a crawl the question is are we the only sithen experiencing the time shift rhys hugged him one armed you know youre smarter than you look dont compliment me too much rhys itll go to my head but he was smiling am i slow tonight or is everyone else just faster than i am i asked exactly doyle said i frowned at him exactly what did you at any time tonight say out loud that you needed more time doyle asked i might have said something like we dont have enough time to investigate the murder and play court with the queen not those words but i looked at doyle are you saying that i might have wished this into happening you did make a mirror appear in your room doyle said simply by wanting to see what the cloak looked like i was suddenly so scared that cold tingled down to my fingertips but doyle that could mean that anything i say could be taken literally by the sithen he nodded we must find out how time is running in another sithen frost said if the goblins or the sluagh are gaining hours on the mortal world then faerie itself has decided to change sometimes it does that and if it is only our sithen nicca asked then meredith must be very very careful what she says he was looking at me and i could almost watch some idea coming to life in his mind what are you thinking i asked him not just him rhys said no not just him galen said he shivered rubbing his arms as if he was cold too for once i know what the bad news is before anyone says it then fill me in i said if only the queen can make time change inside the sithen and merry was able to do it galen said and left it unfinished once upon a time doyle said his voice seeming deeper as if the lowgrowling echoes needed to fill all the small room even if you fought your way to the throne or were elected by all the other rulers as high king or high queen you still could not rule a faerie mound you could not sit on the throne of a specific sithen unless the sithen itself accepted your right to rule i havent heard that story i said it is a forbidden story frost said looking at doyle why would it be forbidden galen asked i made the logic leap this time andais wasnt chosen by the sithen i said she was in europe doyle said but when we arrived in america the new faerie mound did not what do you mean new i asked faerie is not just a physical location the moment andais stepped into the new mound here it should have been the same but it wasnt we all assumed it was because of the third weirding the one that the american government forced on us before they would allow us to move here rhys said so many of us lost so much power that we he shruggedsort of looked the other way about the sithen not cuddling up to andais she did allow the nobles to enter the sithen and have us watch them one by one frost said if the sithen had reacted to any of them more than to her she had agreed to step aside my aunt agreed to let the throne go to any noble the sithen chose i said hard to believe i know rhys said but she did we all assumed that the last weirding had taken too much of her power for her to rule us then the worst happened the sithen knew none of them doyle said okay i understand how that would be bad but why is it forbidden to talk about it i asked did prince essus ever explain to you how the various faerie courts came into being doyle asked i started to say yes of course he had but he hadnt i know that once the sidhe were not simply two courts seelie and unseelie but dozens with different kings and queens like the goblin court and the sluagh but more independent so independent that we fought among ourselves until we all agreed that we needed a high king rhys said once there was only one sidhe high ruler not two i know this one i said the first unseelie sidhe ruler was cast out of the seelie court but he refused to leave faerie he went from court to court and asked for entrance but they feared the sidhe and so finally the only fey court left was the sluagh the most frightening and least human of all the fey they took him in and from that time on any sidhe who was cast out of other courts could petition to join the sluagh very good rhys said but do you know when the unseelie became a sidhe court separate from the sluagh when there were enough sidhe who didnt want to be called sluagh i said almost doyle said why almost i asked at one time a fey of a certain kind would simply become powerful enough magical enough for the very stuff of faerie to acknowledge them and create a kingdom for them one of the sidhe who had joined the sluagh was our first king faerie created a place for him to rule and the sidhe left the sluaghs court and made one of our own okay i said were all afraid to say it rhys said because weve all managed not to say the part that is most likely to get us in trouble what part i asked a court without a ruler begins to fade nicca said they all looked at him as if surprised hed had the courage to say it it took me a moment to understand the implications it was galen who had said it out loud goddess save us thats whats been happening to our court we had no true ruler so the sithen was dying our slice of faerie has been dying not just ours doyle said who else i asked our bright cousins follow a king whose sithen did not know him their sithen didnt know any of their nobles either i asked rumor has it and its only rumor that instead of welcoming sidhe who the sithen recognized he exiled them rhys said its not rumor doyle said we all looked at him who i asked aisling he said something on frosts face told me that he had known the rest looked as shocked as i felt they had a true king and taranis exiled him doyle and frost nodded but that is monstrous nicca said even andais was willing to give up her throne if a true queen could have been found does his court know i asked doyle most no but some i asked some he said how can they support him the unseelie had no choice but to fade but he had a new king to sit on the seelie throne they didnt have to fade did our sithen recognize aisling when he came here galen asked no doyle said why not he asked doyle shrugged and i guess that was answer enough or the only answer he had the bath is ready kitto said his voice as neutral and empty as a servants i touched his shoulder and he gave me a small smile something occurred to me did the goblin mound know kurag when you came to this country i am not important enough to know such things i do not know the goblins are less faded than the sidhe they are still what we left them but wait galen said the seelie sidhe are less faded in power than we are why is that shouldnt both courts be fading at about the same rate they should be doyle said but they arent i said they dont seem to be rhys said youve thought of something doyle said what made taranis desperate enough to help release the nameless one of our most dangerous magicks into the human world to kill maeve reed shed been exiled from faerie for more than a century it couldnt have just been merrys visit to her that could have gotten him to send someone to assassinate maeve but not to release the nameless rhys shook his head ive been thinking about it and i cant make it make sense like his inviting merry to his ball galen said that makes no sense either hes hated her all her life not hated galen you have to think more of a person to hate them and my uncle doesnt think anything of me i was more a nonentity at the seelie court than here at the unseelie court so why is he so hot to see you why now none of us have liked this sudden invitation doyle said but we have had our discussions and we are going to accept i still think its too dangerous for merry galen said we will be there to protect her doyle said you know it would be really interesting to take aisling as one of my honor guard i do not believe that taranis would allow him to pass into his court doyle said if he refuses any of my guard it is within my rights to take insult and refuse the invitation i said they all looked at one another it has possibilities rhys said galen nodded i like anything that keeps merry from having to attend this ball how can you say that frost asked you saw what just the touch of aislings power did to melangell taranis has negotiated that only the guards who have visited merediths bed may accompany her to the ball it wasnt the horror of melangells sightless eyes that i was remembering it was the moment when aisling held me and id noticed that his eyes were empty as if pieces were missing aisling had been trying to gain a kiss through his veil the goddess had come to me and there had been no warning in my mind no caution about touching aisling was i sidhe enough to bed aisling veiled or unveiled or was it more simple than that true love was supposed to be proof against aislings magic was i in love enough to resist and was the risk of aislings body worth the chance to avoid whatever scheme taranis had in store for me if you do not get into the bath soon it will begin to grow cool kitto said i hugged him and he hugged me back kitto is right galen and i need to get clean then have sex galen said i smiled back at him yes then have sex and nicca as well doyle said so he will be free to go to biddy i nodded ill give them the bed the first time you have sex with someone shouldnt be in a bathtub its too awkward youre going to have sex in a bathtub with a sixfoottall man with wings rhys grinned and shook his head i think i want to watch this you must include royal nicca said i havent forgotten him i said we just didnt need him taking all our news back to his queen he will spy for niceven frost said im aware that royals first duty will be to his own queen and court your bedroom is crawling with wingless demifey rhys said its like an infestation queen niceven doesnt want meredith to feed any one demifey too many times in a row doyle said i do not want to share her bed with the demifey frost said oh frost i said he held up a hand im not saying i wont but i dont think any of us want a demifey with us every time we make love your bath is going to get cold kitto said again i stood up and started peeling off the bloody clothes everybody who isnt getting in the tub leave the night isnt getting any younger frost winced will that make time speed or slow i forgot i said with my shirt in my hands and the bra still to go i just forgot its an expression you cannot afford expressions doyle said ill do my best but its almost impossible to watch every word you say you must try meredith you must try lets find out first if the goblins and the sluagh are moving at human time or our time before we panic merry rhys said doyle nodded take some men of your choosing and go why am i the one who keeps having to go back and forth in the snow death does not feel the cold doyle said no but neither does the dark and you get to stay nice and warm he went for the door ill leave more men than i take this is more spying than fighting but you might need to fight doyle said take at least two others with you i told him aye aye capn he did a mock salute then walked out i looked at frost and doyle still standing on either side of the door unless youre staying to watch its time to thin the number of people in here i said do you wish an audience doyle asked the question caught me offguard i actually thought about it then shook my head no not really i looked at him studied that dark face i didnt know you enjoyed watching i dont very few among the guards enjoy voyeurism the queen beat it out of us galen said doyle nodded almost literally i for one frost said do not wish to watch whether you will it or no i would never ask anything of you frost that i thought would hurt you not if i had a choice he started to get offended or to pretend he didnt understand me but then his face softened and he even gave a little smile i know you would not it is not galen and nicca with you tonight that bites at me it is the demifey i do not like him i do not like a princess of the sidhe having to use her body as a bargaining chip frost i said going to him a royal womans body has been a bargaining chip for thousands of years at least im not bargaining myself away in marriage that might be my fate if i were human married to that thing the look on his face was so shocked it was funny i laughed i could not help myself he jerked as if id struck him i touched his arm but he pulled away id had enough first the demifey are a part of this court the way the sidhe treat them the way everyone treats them is a disgrace they are either part of us or they are not i watched his face close down watched that sullen arrogance close around him but i didnt stop just because his feelings were hurt i couldnt afford to keep stopping every time he got his feelings hurt it happened too often second im tired of your acting as if your blood and body are too precious to be bargained with i put my flesh and blood up for grabs a lot for you all of you you wont feed anyone you wont even let a single demifey watch rhys wont let goblins touch him or the demifey either now he fell to the power of sages glamour frost said he will not risk it again fine but im risking it galen has more reason to be afraid of the demifey than either rhys or you and hes going to do this for me for us tonight i moved closer to him but didnt try to touch him i didnt want to see him pull away i know you covered my body with yours that you offered your life for mine today but so did galen he nearly paid with his life tonight yet here he stands ready to let a demifey touch him what do you want of me frost asked i want you to stop pouting about me sharing myself with the lesser fey when you wont let your sowhite flesh be touched by them i want you to stop making me feel as if im the whore and youre too good for it i realized i was angry really angry but it wasnt frost i was angry with i was just angry and i hadnt been able to be angry at the people i most wanted to be angry with so suddenly this unreasoning anger flared my skin ran hot with it making me glow through the dried crust of blood and gore i stepped back from him i am tired frost and there is still much for my body to do tonight by our bargain i must be with royal in some way by the queens order i must be with galen and nicca tonight and one other green man before dawn finds me i thought about it i need to bed sholto before we go to the goblin court tomorrow night so we can count on the sluagh as our allies i shook my head i did it again didnt i before dawn finds you doyle said yes but there is too much to do and the clock starts ticking again at dawn he nodded i would offer my blood in your place if it would satisfy niceven i smiled at him i know you would but the demifey dont seem to like you later when we have the time id like to know the story behind that no doyle said you will not like the story and i will not like telling it he looked so solemn almost sad that i touched his arm and said unless i need to know it you may keep your secret feud with nicevens court a secret would you really let the little fey touch you frost asked doyle looked at his friend yes if it was necessary how can you let those things touch you how can i ask of the princess what i would not give myself doyle said frost bent his head eyes closed he took in a lot of air as if he were trying to get enough breath for some long deep dive his breath came out in a shaky rush he opened his eyes and they were raw with emotion like grey wounds i would never ask of you a thing that i would not do myself meredith i am sorry i touched his arm and this time he didnt pull away i leaned into him and offered my face up for a kiss there was enough height difference that if he didnt bend down to kiss me i couldnt make him not without a chair to stand on but i didnt have to get a chair frost met me halfway bending down his hands on my arms steadying me on my tiptoes we kissed i meant it to be a chaste kiss a goodbye for the night kiss but he had other ideas his lips pressed against mine hard fierce his tongue pushed at my mouth and i opened to him let him slide inside my mouth his breath shuddered inside my mouth as if he were breathing me in and he crushed me against him he lifted me off my feet and wrapped me around him he fed at my mouth with tongue and teeth and lips until i made small sounds at the force of his mouth the near painful grip of his arms and hands i melted against him when he drew back from the kiss i was lightheaded and tried to keep the kiss going id forgotten where we were what i was supposed to be doing i forgot myself as i had at the press conference i forgot everything but the taste of his mouth the feel of his body i forgot everything but frosts kiss he drew away from me while i fought to kiss him again i was making small protesting noises as he tried to slide me down his body and set me on the floor i wrapped my legs around his waist and refused to be set down meredith meredith i think doyles deep voice had been talking to me for a while i finally looked at him he smiled and shook his head he has to go now we both do i looked back to frost who had finally wrapped his arms back around me when i wouldnt let him drop me he looked terribly pleased with himself now i can leave you to others i shook my head because what i wanted to say was dont leave but i couldnt it wasnt that i didnt want galen but frost seemed to always be able to make me want him if you are leaving then you need to put her down doyle said he let me slide down his body and i let him do it this time i did my knees were a little unsteady and he had to keep his hand on my arm for a moment before i could stand on my own he laughed a purely masculine laugh goddess help me but i do love you enough frost doyle said we have other work to do tonight he motioned for the door and this time frost went where he was told doyle turned to me at the open door i will not try to compete with that he said it with a smile i raised up on tiptoe my hands on his chest and said it isnt a competition he lowered his face to mine in the mortal words of the human world the hell it isnt he kissed me firm and thorough but chaste compared to what frost had done then he drew back from me do you wish me to send in the demifey let us get the blood off of us first ill send nicca or kitto for royal as you wish his eyes flicked behind me then he touched my face and closed the door behind him i turned around to find that two of the other men in my life had undressed while i was preoccupied galens body was covered in patches of dried blood it wasnt lust that made me go to him and wrap myself around his nude body it was fear later thered be time for lust but in that moment i just wanted to hold him wanted to feel him warm and alive in my arms my hands couldnt seem to avoid feeling the dried scratchiness of blood it was everywhere on the smooth perfection of his skin my hands found the stillhealing wound in his back i shivered he hugged me are you cold a little i said aloud to myself i acknowledged that it wasnt the kind of cold that a coat or a bath would help lets get in the water then he smiled down at me as he said it as if a little hot water would solve everything if only life were that simple something must have shown on my face because he frowned at me are you all right i nodded and sighed so much to do so many alliances to forge and strengthen so many enemies to find i should have been hurrying should have had my list of goals and been breaking my back to get through them but in that moment i couldnt think of anything that seemed more important than holding as much of galen against me as i could manage naked in a bathtub doesnt solve everything but naked with someone you love doesnt hurt anything either chapter the bath was still hot when i finally slid into it which meant that kitto had drawn it hotter than i liked he had known that we would talk too long and had planned for it hed begun to anticipate my needs not in the way of a lover or a friend but in the way of a good servant unobtrusive quiet just there when needed no friend or lover id ever had had been unobtrusive messy joyous heartbreaking wonderful but never unobtrusive i looked at him as galen slid into the bath kitto was one of the oldest of my men and the oldest among us dont always liked being thanked so i didnt you drew the water too hot so it would be just right by the time we got in the tub you knew wed talk too long he ducked his head not meeting my eyes there was much to talk of i leaned against the edge of the marble tub until i could touch his shoulder you always seem to know what im going to do before i do he raised eyes that were unsullied by white only a bright clear blue i saw uncertainty there before he lowered them again whats wrong kitto i asked stroking my fingers up and down his bare shoulder hed stripped down to just a thong as he often did when he did anything messy to save his clothes he said i got the feeling that kitto owned more clothes now with me than hed ever owned in the goblin court he shook his head sending the black curls of his newly grown hair brushing across his shoulders a few inches longer and it would have been punishable by torture only the sidhe were allowed long hair he was sidhe now with his own hand of power as with niccas wings and mistrals reborn power so kittos sidhe magic had come after sex with the new power should have come a new confidence but it had not galen leaned over the tub edge to touch kittos other shoulder whats up kitto you can tell us kitto flashed him a rare smile you are both the kindest sidhe ive ever known he glanced behind at nicca all of you youre sidhe now too kitto i said he shook his head i will never be truly sidhe not to some nicca knelt behind him his wings sweeping out along the floor who has been saying such things to you kitto shook his head again and niccas arms came around from behind hugging him kitto stiffened as if afraid i leaned up over the tub edge until i could lay a kiss upon his lips when i drew back from the kiss he raised frightened eyes to me what did they say to you i asked i was really worried now id never seen him quite like this and i didnt like it he dropped his gaze again and wouldnt look at me as he said it they said that i would never be anything but a filthy goblin that only a whore would share her bed with me he looked up then and his face was so hurt so confused i didnt think any fey called another whore it is not our way oh kitto i said i should not be here if it hurts your chances of being queen he started to bend down as if he would make himself smaller but niccas arms wouldnt let him do it nicca held him tightly but gently against his body they are jealous nicca said kitto looked over his shoulder at the other man jealous of what of you galen said kitto blinked at him and shook his head no not of me you are the first nonsidhe to be brought into his power in centuries galen said no matter how common it used to be it isnt now they are jealous that merry could do it and you could become it theyre afraid of you and what it might mean if more of the sidhesided goblins could be made sidhe i looked at galen what he said its true yes but i didnt think id noticed he said i had the grace to look embarrassed lets say i didnt think youd noticed so much and so well he smiled a little sadly im learning just how stupid everyone thought i was i touched his shoulder not stupid never that foolish then or oblivious oblivious nicca said cant truly argue that one i had to smile you did seem oblivious to most of the politics galen nodded i was maybe i still am but we all have to keep our wits about us we all have to see what there is to see or we are going to die he gripped my arms sloshing the water against our bodies when it was just my life and there was no chance that i would ever be in your bed i didnt care that much he hugged me against him theres too much to lose now and i dont want to lose any of it i wrapped my arms around him held him as tight as i could my hands traced the patches of dried blood covering all of him that hadnt gone in the water i trailed my hands down and found that even in the water the blood still clung so much blood so terribly much im sorry that i didnt pay attention before he said his cheek against my hair i didnt see a point to it if i couldnt have you i dont see everything not the way doyle does or frost or even rhys but i do see some things and im trying to see more there was a lump in my throat so big i couldnt swallow past it my chest felt tight and it was hard to breathe my eyes were suddenly hot and i knew i was about to cry only a second before it started i didnt want to cry he was safe we were safe but feeling the dried blood made me remember the moment id seen him lying on his back in a lake of his own blood that heartstopping moment when id thought he was gone thought id never hold him warm against me again thought his arms would never press our bodies together again that id never see his smile or hear his voice or gaze into his living eyes galen stroked my hair and raised my face up to his merry are you crying i nodded because i didnt trust my voice why he asked nicca said it for me she thought shed lost you today galen galen stared down into my face is that why youre crying i nodded again and buried my face against his chest he leaned back into the water cradling me against his body he stroked my skin petted my hair and whispered its all right im all right but what about next time i asked the queen made it clear that i might be the key to bringing babies back to the sidhe i dont think theyll want to hurt me now cels people will kitto said we looked at him i hear things because no one notices me i felt a twinge at that because id done it too hed accused me once of talking over him like he was a dog or a chair that was before he had become my lover but even now it was easier not to notice him than the rest he had survived in the goblin mound by being unobtrusive as invisible as he could make himself he still had the habit of it i heard some sidhe saying that they did not believe that anyone of andaiss line would be able to bring life back to the unseelie who said this they saw me after they had spoken i think they would have tried to hurt me but king sholto came down the hallway he had some of his sluagh with him was this today i asked yes if he was here i wonder why he didnt come to the throne room i do not know but he was wounded kitto said wounded galen said how badly nicca asked he had an arm in a sling and a bandage on the side of his face and head who could harm a warrior of the unseelie and the king of sluagh that badly nicca said as if he was simply thinking aloud goblins could kitto said if they caught him unaware and unable to use his magic there are warriors among my people who could best any you have except for your sidhe magic or another sluagh i said softly they all looked at me there are some among his people who think that by coming to my bed he will become full sidhe and they will lose him as their king i heard it was mostly his harem of night hags nicca said did everyone but me know that his hags were his harem i asked nicca and galen exchanged glances we envied him as the only guard who had an outlet for his desires nicca said theyre afraid that the touch of sidhe flesh will steal him away galen said no one but merry would sleep with him nicca said no other sidhe would risk bearing his child for fear it would be a monster i shook my head once the unseelie welcomed any child it was the way of our court when did we become an anthropomorphic club when did two arms two legs and human beauty become the ideal long before either of you were born kitto said nicca nodded he was cuddling kitto now more than just holding him kittos eyes still looked fragile as if he believed whatever the sidhe had said to him no name calling truly bites deep unless in some dark part of us we believe it if we are confident enough then its just noise but kitto wasnt confident not in the least he spoke in a small low voice i looked almost sidhe as a baby my mother must have kept me for a few months then the scales appeared around my spine and when the teeth came in so did the fangs that was enough for her to leave me by the goblin mound to either be taken in or killed she left me there knowing that the goblins liked to eat a bit of sidhe flesh he huddled in on himself wrapping niccas arms closer around him i couldnt tell if it was on purpose or accidental that the movement wrapped the others arm tighter most fey like to be touched it comforts them but the goblins are a different race than most they like sex but touch can as easily lead to violence as sex among them and there is very little touching that is only comfort and not sex but youre wrong meredith the sidhe even the unseelie never took in every child goblinsided babies that looked less than pure sidhe were left to die outside the goblin mounds the goblins took in their sidhesided children i said kitto shook his head and only niccas arms kept him from curling into a little ball only niccas strength kept the smaller man upright not always kitto whispered i reached out to touch his face galen with his longer arms could touch more of him he found a hand to hold on to and kitto gripped the hand he offered if i hadnt been almost touching his face with mine i might not have heard what he whispered next sometimes they raise them until theyre big enough to eat not enough meat on a baby he looked up at me his eyes shining with unshed tears when i got big enough the woman who wetnursed me wouldnt let them have me because i was smaller than normal it had taken me longer to get big enough so long that i was talking and she had grown fond of me she fought for me she bled for me she saved me but when she needed me i was too small too weak to save her a look of rage crossed his face and he closed his eyes as if he didnt want me to see it one of the sidhe today said something like he knew he said id always been small too small to be a real goblin too small to be sidhe too small to be anything but a burden and a danger to those around me kitto looked up at me i didnt think any sidhe visited the goblin mounds except for your father and you how did he know i wanted to say that the sidhe in question had guessed had simply looked at kittos small size and used it to be cruel that he hadnt known kittos background but only made an educated guess but would it be more cruel to tell kitto that his past was so obvious that a stranger could see it written on his body or to let him believe that his history was known for certain by sidhe who dealt with the goblins more than they should galen decided for me they didnt know kitto they just guessed they were being mean thats all they didnt know that what they said would hit so close to the truth guess kitto said looking at him guess they guessed how how could they know how he gripped galens hand with his smaller ones is my shame written across my body is it that easy to see that i am weak that i am a burden to those around me i am a danger to you even he reached out to me then gripping my hand so tight it almost hurt if i got you with child they would never accept me as king or you as queen the two sidhe lords said theyd see you dead before theyd let a goblinsided sidhe sit on the unseelie throne i wanted to ask who they were but he might not know their names and to ask it now seemed cruel the two lords hadnt been talking of conspiracies they had simply been giving voice to their prejudices they had said the cruelest truths they could find but if they had truly planned on killing him and me then they wouldnt have told him they wouldnt have taunted him with it or they wouldnt have let him go unscathed after overhearing them his clean unbloodied flesh meant they didnt really mean it they were bullies nothing more i could get him to describe them for me later tonight i didnt want to make him dwell upon it i wanted him to forget about it at least for a little while i wanted to caress him to hold him until that look left his eyes but there was no room tonight on my dance card not unless i could figure out a way to combine people again galen would sleep in big puppy piles but he didnt like sharing sex nicca shared just fine and i think he would have agreed to almost anything just so he could get to biddy in the next room i didnt mind being the one he rushed through i enjoyed nicca but he did not speak to my heart and body the way galen did or doyle or frost it was galen who reached for kitto galen who pulled him closer to the tub im sorry kitto im so sorry i didnt mean to say he didnt finish it but hed said enough to let me know that he knew hed said too much that hed said aloud what id been thinking and he understood that his comments had hurt kitto he understood it and was willing to try to undo the hurt hed inadvertently done many humans watched the casual touching among us and mistook it for sex but it isnt always sometimes you just need to be touched sometimes you see such hurt such loneliness in another feys eyes that you must do something anything to chase that look away sometimes sex isnt even about sex among us sometimes its just the last resort for making someone smile chapter kitto lay back in the water cradled against galens body galen trailed his hands over the smaller mans arms and shoulders stroking strong hands through the now damp curls around his face kitto half floated his eyes closed as he snuggled his shoulders and head against the curve of galens upper body i trailed my fingertips down the front of kittos leg until i traced along the top of his foot i knew he was ticklish there and it earned me a smile but his eyes stayed closed i held his foot in my hands and licked along the top of his foot where i had touched it made him squirm and laugh he opened his eyes sinking his legs below the water and sitting up galens arms spilled around his shoulders holding him more securely against his own body i moved in against the front of kittos body straddling his legs i brushed myself over the loose thickness of his groin it drew a sound of pleasure from him but when he put his hands at my waist it was to stop the movement of my hips kittos voice was a little strained but his small hands were very firm at my waist stopping me from pushing harder against his body it is nicca who is meant to be with galen and you this night i am content to wait my turn nicca said from where he knelt beside the tub his wings fanned gently at his back as he reached to trail his fingers in the water kitto shook his head water trickling down his face from his sodden hair his black curls flattened against the white of his skin i moved my groin against his and his hands on my waist could not stop it his fingers tightened and again he said no but other parts of his body were already responding to even the light touch he was allowing me your body says otherwise i said he swallowed hard and blinked those blue on blue eyes up at me i cannot be your king merry word has come from kurag goblin king that holly and ash have laid challenge on any goblin that takes their prize before they can i frowned at him and that means what any goblin that does anything to become your king before holly and ash have had their chance will be challenged and killed by them they have no right to dictate to you kitto i said you are sidhe now you have a hand of power that is sidhe magic not goblin he gave me a sad little smile you do not know them as i do i would not anger them not for anything in faerie he touched the side of my face where the blood still clung let me help you and galen clean yourselves he smiled and it was a real smile not so sad i am honored that galen reached for me first i know that that is not his way he leaned in against the taller mans body and smiled up at him galen smiled down at him and ran his hands down the other mans arm i wanted to see you smile kitto smiled wider amost a grin it means much to me that you care if i am happy or sad he looked at me and his face sobered but heed me on this merry sidhe or no princess or no you should fear holly and ash they will come to my body as the rest of you have they will have their chance for kingmaking i know to negotiate exactly what kind of sex they can have from me beyond that why should i fear them we will be with merry in the goblin court galen said we wont let anything bad happen to her you make it sound so easy kitto said gazing up at the other man how dangerous are the twins nicca asked they are some of the most feared warriors of our court kitto said they looked sort of puny standing next to the red caps galen said i do not know what this puny means kitto said small weak i said kitto acknowledged it with a nod but size is not everything in combat holly and ash have a reputation for viciousness among the goblins i stopped petting kitto and went very still because what hed just said put things in perspective for me for holly and ash to have earned such a fearsome reputation among the goblins spoke of terrible violence against a people who thrived on it goblins are stronger than we are galen said to be halfsidhe in their court must make life hard kitto shivered and he relaxed his hands on my waist enough for me to press the front of my body against the front of his galen and i held him between our bodies he wrapped his arms around me and clung to the feel of our bodies you have no idea galen no idea how it marks you as victim i was unlucky enough to be as weak as i look holly and ash were beautiful children blond and pale and except for the eyes would have passed at either sidhe court even with the eyes they would have been accepted why didnt they petition to join our court i asked my face resting on the top of kittos wet hair and the warmth of galens shoulder i do not know kitto said for they suffered when they were young males our females liked to make them perform until they grew strong enough to fight them off galen and i were frowning at him but nicca seemed to understand you mean the shegoblins raped them kitto nodded its not easy for a woman to rape a man i said it is possible nicca said and he leaned his face against the one folded arm that graced the edge of the tub his other arm was deeper in the water as if he sought something below its surface the queen is fond of force i moved through the water to touch his shoulder he started when i touched him as if he had expected a far less pleasant touch niccas brown eyes were a little too wide whatever memory he was thinking upon it was a bad one so many bad memories among the guard thanks to andais i laid a gentle kiss on his mouth and drew back to stare into his face let me clean up and we will make love gentle love and then you will have biddy and that will be gentle too he nodded but it was a little too rapid and his eyes still held that shadow of fear i felt the water move before kitto came beside me to add his hands to mine on niccas body until i became a part of the princesss household i did not understand that any sidhe could be forced to such horrors not unless they had earned punishment he touched niccas face i know now that there is pain in every court and no one is truly safe he kissed niccas cheek let me help them rid themselves of the blood and then the princess will take that sadness from your eyes nicca smiled at him there are other things you can do with merry besides intercourse you too could have her do things to you that would take that sorrow from your eyes kitto he did that quick grin again as if he was afraid to be seen smiling so broadly in the goblin court the one who gives oral pleasure is the lesser being it shows that you are submissive to the one you are pleasuring thats not how the sidhe see it galen said moving to join us at the center of the tub kitto flashed him another grin so i have seen whenever merry could persuade one of us to let her but touch us i like oral sex i said we know the three of them said in unison which made them all laugh i dont like that holly and ash feel they can dictate to you kitto but if you truly arent comfortable with intercourse then let me finish what ive only been able to start with all of you but sage with sage you were forbidden to have intercourse nicca said queen andais doesnt want to risk a demifey on our throne i nodded so we did nothing that would risk sage getting me pregnant i looked at kitto and didnt fight the look that filled my eyes and now im supposed to do things with kitto that wont let him get me with child either kittos breath shook on its way out but not with fear if you were a goblin and looked at me so i would be afraid but ive learned what that light in your eyes means what i asked in a voice that was already grown lower with need that youre about to do something to me that im going to like he said let me help you and galen get clean and then i asked he gave me a look that ive seen in mens eyes before a look that says they know what were about to do and that there will be no going back no stopping and then i will let you have your way with me other than the little youve allowed merry to do to you have you ever had anyone do oral sex on you galen asked kitto looked at him no i took in a long shaking breath and shivered when my breath ran out id never gotten to be the first for anyone before i was almost certain that the rest of the guard had had this particular pleasure performed by someone else once upon a time i would be the first one to ever hold kitto in their mouth and suck and lick and bite if he wished your face galen said like its winter solstice and youve gotten every present you asked for if youd let me go down on you youd see this expression on my face more often i said he gave me a look youre incorrigible i leaned around kitto closer to galen if youd only say yes youd find out just how incorrigible i can be i was rewarded with a look almost of pain as if he wanted to say yes but intercourse had become everyones goal because we pursued a baby like some infertile couple me first kitto said me second nicca said though i think the queen will be upset if we do oral and not something that would gain you a child i nodded she was very specific about that so yes i dont want to disappoint andais we all shivered in unison and this time it had nothing to do with pleasure chapter the tile was too cold to lie on but towels took care of that kitto lay back on them knees up legs slightly spread so i could reach him better an ivory dream against all that burgundy darkness his sex was swollen and thick even before i got to kneel between his legs anticipation had done much of my work for me i slid my mouth over the swollen tip of him like taking in a whole ripe plum until my mouth was so full i couldnt bite down and couldnt swallow my mouth is full of the ripe firm flesh but with this plum filling my mouth was only the beginning so much left to swallow the warm thick firmness of the fruit doesnt writhe in your mouth as you move over it it doesnt cry out as you lick along it inside your mouth kittos hands dug at the towels underneath him bunching them in his hands clutching the only thing he could find while he rode the pleasure niccas hands stroked along my ass making me writhe and push myself against him but he kept me from more of his body he cupped my buttocks in both his hands and the feel of him holding me like that made me suck at kitto hard and fast kitto cried out i waited for nicca to push himself against me but nothing came nothing but the promise of his hands on me galen said what i was thinking consort save us nicca finish it it made me roll my eyes past kitto to my green man as he knelt near kittos head on the edge of the towels niccas fingertips dug into my flesh just a little no nails just the strength in his fingers that let me know that if he wished he could plunge his fingers inside my flesh so strong so very strong i writhed for him and had to fight not to be too fierce on the tender flesh inside my mouth i had to raise my mouth off of kitto for a moment had to catch my breath and fight off the urge to bite down i kept one hand on the base of him but changed the grip so that my hand covered as much of him as i could i came up off of his body with my hand already stroking his wet quivering shaft i looked back at nicca who was kneeling behind me but no longer touching me he looked brown and perfect kneeling there with his hair still wet from the tub clinging to his body in thick strands that tangled around his shoulders arms waist and legs his wings rose against all that chocolatecolored goodness like some spun sugar fantasy i had a moment of regret about him going elsewhere but only a moment i wanted him happy more than i wanted him why were you waiting you are sending me to what amounts to my marriage bed merry if this is to be my last time with you i would like it to be exactly as i want it you can say no i had to smile ask and ill know the answer then i thought of something are you unhappy about biddy no he said but he frowned no but there will be things i will miss such as i wasnt fishing for compliments i truly wanted to know it was his turn to smile such as watching you stretched underneath me screaming your pleasure around another mans body while i bring you and pour my pleasure between your legs just hearing him describe it with that look in his eyes tightened things low in my body i was offering that i said i want you on your back as you were with sage i want to see your breasts rise and fall with your breathing i went to him touching his face trying to see through this combination of passion and seriousness it wasnt like him i want biddy and you to be a happy time not a sad one he smiled but it held an edge of something that was not happy i remember a time when marriage was not the end of such joys but the beginnings of them the sidhe never cheated on their partners but if we agreed then others were brought into our beds he was speaking of a time before andais was queen a time before christianity was anything but a heretic jewish sect most of the sidhe didnt speak of it for they didnt like talking about what they had lost who wants to talk of a time when the sidhe had not been outnumbered by the humans a time when we married for love and not simply for children a time when sex was about joy and sharing and not a relentless pursuit of pregnancy a time when an unplanned baby didnt condemn you to a loveless marriage i had felt such happiness when the ring chose nicca and biddy for each other but was it a true love match yes they were infatuated with each other and yes there might be a child but would there be happyeverafter or would nicca love her bed her share a child with her yet regret and would those regrets eventually destroy their love suddenly i smelled roses do you smell apple blossoms galen asked yes nicca said like in the hallway with mistral honeysuckle kitto said the scent was growing stronger i had a moment of inspiration it wasnt the same as channeling the goddess but when did the sidhe stop having children nicca he blinked at me i can taste the perfume on the air answer my question i dont know he said long ago did we stop having children after we adopted the human ideal of one partner we adopted monogamy because the humans outbred us using it nicca said did they really i said or did we begin to be outbred when we stopped being who and what we are what do you mean merry galen asked i held up my hand to show the dull metal gleam of the queens ring she said she took this off her enemys body but that she never saw babies with it lust love infatuation but she could not see the babies what if this is not the queens ring but a ring meant for a fertility deity we were nature deities originally before human need turned some of us more civilized we are that which is primal basic the sidhe have not been that in a very long time kitto said i turned to find him still lying in the nest of towels as if he hadnt moved what do you mean kitto the goblins were the last of faerie to embrace the idea of only one spouse at a time once if the husband the dominant partner could protect feed and house more then you were allowed more if they all agreed i wouldnt think that the husband would care what the wife thought galen said technically husband only means dominant partner not the sex of a goblin and he or she could bring anyone in without the wifes permission but in reality if you bring in someone your wife hates then your home life becomes a battleground and not even a goblin wants that so you could be someones wife i asked he nodded yes but not a husband galen said i am not strong enough to be one he writhed on the bed of towels why do i smell honeysuckle as if summer has arrived and i am standing in the sun its so warm you were in the hall when merry and mistral had their little fling galen said his voice almost as light as his words apple blossoms for me like standing in the orchard in spring nicca said the two men smiled at each other spring energy kitto said i looked at him what theyre both spring energy he said and what are you summer when the land is hot and ripening he writhed on the towels as he said it his legs straining out as if he were close to orgasm his body was thick and ripe again and what am i i asked autumn he said you are the land when the harvest comes you are what the year works toward merry and what is winter the long sleep kitto said i laid back against him using his groin as a pillow it brought a small sound from him i gazed back at nicca where he still knelt tell me what you want nicca tell me exactly what you want i want you on your back i want to see another man push his way inside your mouth while i mount you i want you to scream your pleasure around his body while i fuck you i nodded rolling the back of my hair across kittos groin he writhed for me we can do that i said nicca smiled kittos voice came shaky but clear i do not know how to position myself for what you ask where do my legs go ill show you galen said and his voice was low with need i rolled my head back so i could see him still sitting behind us the movement made kitto writhe again two birds with one caress youve refused before i said i didnt say i would go that way only that ill help kitto figure out where his legs go a hundred words cant make as much sense as one good demonstration his eyes were far more serious than his words serious and dark with need well as long as its a good demonstration i said and my own voice was a little breathy oh it will be he said and the look on his face was all male i believed him chapter it was my turn to lie back against the towels to lie there and watch galen crawl toward me his body was already thick and hard dark with the extra blood darker than the rest of his body i wanted a lot of things from galen and had gotten most of them but he like the rest of the men was so intent on making babies that he wouldnt chance going elsewhere i watched him crawling closer and felt positively covetous he gave a laugh that was more nerves and anticipation than humor the look on your face like im something good to eat she did not look at me that way kitto said which put me back to having to soothe his ego id begun to notice the hardest thing about having this many men in my life wasnt figuring out what position for sex tonight but how to keep from hurting anyones feelings or making anyone feel left out it wasnt the number of bodies in the bed that made it complicated but the number of hearts and hands i reached out and touched kittos knee where he knelt so close he was supposed to be watching so he could learn where the legs went galen was my first crush kitto the first man that i ever lusted over the first that i ever loved id spent years fantasizing about him before he came to my bed youre new on the menu i havent had a chance to fantasize about you for so many unrequited years dont feel slighted nicca said she doesnt look at me that way either i looked down my body at him i didnt realize he held up a hand to stop my words i do not feel slighted merry all that had eyes knew how long you pined after galen you followed him around like a puppy when you were so young you didnt even realize why you found him so compelling i wasnt sure i liked the puppy remark but i let it go because when i was fourteen it was probably embarrassingly accurate merry galen said youre blushing i covered my face with my hands because i rarely if ever blushed i wasnt blushing for me now but for that long ago girl the girl that i had been would have been mortified to know that her secret love was no secret at all hands touched my wrists merry galens voice was as gentle as his hands as he moved mine away from my face you blushed for me i actually couldnt look at him its just the thought that everyone knew i didnt know i was being that obvious when i was fourteen were all that obvious when were fourteen he said with a smile its been a few centuries since i was fourteen nicca said but if memory serves galens right kittos comment was the goblins are not a subtle race what does that mean exactly galen asked it means that if a goblin lusts after another everyone knows it we do not see the point of hiding our admiration unless we fear the goblin we lust after will take it as an insult we are not subtle but we can hide what we feel if we must i held my hand out to him palm up he took my hand looking puzzled what would you have of me princess a smile i said he looked even more puzzled galen explained she wants to chase that shadow from your eyes kitto rewarded us both with a shy smile then shook his head i like being sidhe i squeezed his hand and would have said something comforting but nicca chose that moment to play his hand between my legs and suddenly i couldnt think of any words youre not wet enough nicca said it took me two swallows to say with a suddenly dry throat bath always does that odd that such wetness makes a woman dry he said and his finger found my opening slipped inside it made me gasp made my hand convulse around kittos nicca moved his finger inside me gently slowly i am not so large as some but not small either this dry it will hurt my voice came breathy then make me wet as my princess commands he said with a smile he took his hand away from my body and said to galen show kitto where the legs go so that when she is ready to be entered i will have my view let me know when youre ready galen said i wont have to tell you nicca said youll know the scent of flowers had faded like the dream of roses in a longclosed room you open the door and get the hint of perfume then it fades and you wonder if you imagined it such is the passing of many spirits and powers in the human world many things that humans take for ghosts are the shadows of things that were never truly mortal galen had faded a little too with all the talk and i liked that better for oral sex a little softness first a little less size to begin with he straddled my upper body and as soon as he was close enough i tried to take him in my mouth he laughed and held his hand in the way let me get settled first youll pull a muscle in your neck doing it that way he moved his body closer to my mouth settled his knees more firmly on either side of my shoulders his groin filled my view not just the head and shaft but the tight firmness of his testicles in their closecurled nest of darker green hair my hands were trapped underneath his weight i could touch his thighs his ass and the lowest edge of his back but that was all my hands could reach if i had known that i would have a chance to finally have galen in my mouth i might not have agreed to the change in positioning with me on top i would have been able to guide more of what went into my mouth and how in this position i had to let the man direct it more i wanted a hand to help angle him for my mouth but i shouldnt have worried galen stared down at me his eyes filling with that darkness that men get only in the most intimate of moments he used his hand to move himself so that the angle was better and once my mouth slid over the head of him he adjusted his upper body so that when i sucked him down i was able to suck all of him he was soft and silken inside my mouth the foreskin rolling something extra for my tongue to play with i sucked eagerly to get all of him inside me my lips rested solid against his body i rolled him in my mouth sucking stroking playing with him with tongue and mouth while i still could even as i enjoyed the sensation of him soft he grew in my mouth i felt that bit of flesh go from soft and silken to hard and ripe he filled my mouth and then my throat i had to back off of him to draw a breath galen drew himself out of my mouth this is supposed to be foreplay merry you know what i want i said he shook his head i trailed my hands along his ass nicca will go between my legs then with a touch i will bring him back again he will service me and biddy this night why cant you go twice tonight too i usually do i pressed my body upward gripping his ass with my hands i raised up enough so i could lick lightly on his balls go once in my mouth and once between my legs please galen please niccas hands slid down my thighs and i felt him settling between my legs a second before his tongue touched me a quick caress that made me writhe and dig my nails just a little into galens body it made him close his eyes and count his breaths i would give almost anything to have a woman beg me like that kitto said do not refuse such a gift i didnt look at kitto because i only had eyes for galen niccas tongue licked inside my opening then up in a sure firm stroke i had to learn how to breathe again and when i opened my eyes galen was still there looking down at me nicca began to lick in circles around the edge of me long sure strokes for he had found that quick ones only worked later not at the beginning that sensation of fullness was already beginning to grow low in my body please i said simply he settled his body over me again wrapped his own hand around himself and gave me the angle my mouth needed a princess shouldnt have to beg was the last thing he said before he slid inside my mouth chapter the weight grew low in my body as niccas tongue caressed in long heavy circles and at the top of that circle he found that spot the one that would eventually turn that growing warm weight into pleasure but he had to work me wet first otherwise it would hurt and rub not pleasure galen had gotten over his reluctance he put his hands on the floor just past my head so that he could move his hips as if he were making love to my mouth and it was making love not a pounding but a caress of muscled velvet sliding between my lips a sweet hard weight that made me open my mouth wide to him so he could glide every inch from the smooth head to the end of the shaft where it met his body except we never got that far he never put that much of himself inside me nicca had stopped what he was doing i knew he was still lying between my legs because i could feel his hands wrapped around my thighs but he was still giving only an occasional lick just enough to not lose ground but not even close to making me come normally it would have been irritating but it freed me to concentrate on the sensation of galen in my mouth in a way he had never allowed before except that he was holding back never once did the soft hanging weight of his testicles touch my face he wasnt giving me his all not even close he spoke and his voice showed the strain the control he was wasting on his movements you stopped he said in a strangled voice nicca why did you stop i thought to let you both enjoy it without me distracting her too much though from what i saw her do with sage and mistral you are being overly careful i dont want to hurt her that was it i managed to get my hands free and pushed he came up off of me holding himself above me effortlessly as if he could have held himself poised and perfect forever just gazing down the length of his body like that made me shiver i want to feel all of you in my mouth galen all of you wont that hurt you nicca laid his head against my thigh and said you were in the hallway right you saw her with mistral he nodded i saw there was a hunching of his shoulders when he said it i ran my fingers down the front of his body down his chest his stomach and only him rolling away kept me from wrapping my hand around him what is wrong i asked i will never be comfortable being that rough with anyone you dont have to be rough tonight just give me the length of you let me feel you in my mouth all the way down to your balls i want all of you in me in every conceivable way if theres an opening that can hold you i want it he gave me a look galen galen were running out of time dont you understand that doyle and frost already think the ring has chosen mistral for me he looked stricken as if id stabbed him low and hard with something made of cold iron i dont believe they are right but i do not know none of us do so while i have you i want you dont you understand that he looked down and he was small again his foreskin covering him if what you did with mistral is what you want then why do you want me i dont want rough every night galen some nights i like gentle some nights i like to make love not fuck but some nights you like to fuck he said i pretty much always want to make love i smiled at him i could argue that he tried not to smile but failed not if what you did in the hallway was fucking that was fucking with mistral sex depends on the person youre with galen lovemaking rises and falls on the rhythms of the people involved i held my hand out to him come to me he shook his head if i come to you now i wont be able to come to you when nicca finally enters you i can bring you back with a little bit of magic yeah but if you do it immediately it hurts a little you never told me i looked down my body at nicca who had gone very quiet his head resting on my thigh more for a pillow now than for sex does it hurt i mean until recently i almost always shared my night with rhys so with two of us in the bed there was more waiting between times so no it did not hurt but if i had to go straight back to it it might he said doyle and frost never complained i said i think pain is more useful for them in the bedroom than it is for me or galen i thought about that for a second maybe galens voice came soft is the reason you want me this way that you dont want me to be your king i started to say no then hesitated it wasnt my motive for the oral sex but the last part was true enough or had been i want you like this because i want you i said nicca spoke with his head still pillowed on my thigh ive seen her do this with more than just mistral she does seem to enjoy it sage you mean galen said but still didnt sound happy his face did what it almost always did it showed his every emotion yes i said and wasnt sure what to do to reassure him it wasnt like galen to pout this much this was more frosts speed sage he said again another who wont ever be your king i sighed we have a night of ecstasy in front of us and youre spoiling it with hard questions its not like you no its more like frost hed spoken exactly what id just finished thinking hed done that several times tonight he continued with you complain about his moods but you seem to like him better and better maybe you like your men a little more complicated i didnt know what to say to that why do you love one man and not another why is it that one persons touch fills you with shivery heat and the same touch from another leaves you cold it is a mystery but i could answer truthfully and still be comforting i love you galen he just looked at me maybe i had forgotten just how much but today when i saw you lying there my voice failed me and i had to close my eyes to keep from seeing him lying in a pool of his own blood nicca stroked my thigh not for sex but to comfort when i saw you there like that i thought i would die from grief to never see your smile again my eyes felt hot and i couldnt decide if crying would make me feel better or worse he touched my face and without opening my eyes i knew it was his hand his warm gentle hand i laid my cheek into that hand i was reminded sharply of doing the same thing to doyle only a few hours ago galen had failed me then had not understood why gillettes failing me had made me cry but giving galen into the hands of another woman who could give him his nights of gentle love was one thing giving him up to death was another that i could not bear i opened my eyes and gazed up at him i met those green green eyes youre crying he said and the look on his face was one of wonderment not quite i said but my voice sounded it i had to swallow hard to say the next part maybe i have been pulling back from you i didnt mean to i touched his hand with mine kept it pressed against my face what terrified me about you being king was that our enemies would kill you if i was picking men who could survive that kind of treachery it wouldnt be you my gentle love like dormath thinking i would just forgive him for almost killing me yes the last thing i thought the very last thought was you i was afraid that it was the beginning of an assault on all of us he lowered his gaze and wouldnt look at me i thought doyle and frost will keep her safe that if one of us had to die first it was better that it was me his smile was more sad than happy i guess my actual last last thought was why me if id killed someone first it would have been doyle not me i prayed to the goddess for your safety and i died not quite i whispered he looked at me then and the smile was almost a real one how can i blame you for looking to them for your king when as i lay dying they were who i thought of too damn it being a good person is not enough here not to help keep us alive im sorry for that i thought it would endanger you more to be my king galen but now i understand that theyre going to try to kill you anyway i spoke to the look on his face i didnt know about the green man bringing life to the court until the queen said it but they are still going to kill as many of my allies as they can they will strip me of my help if they dare so if youre in danger either way then you might as well be king im dead either way he said and the smile was back to being more sad i sat up trying to hug him but he moved away just a little my movement forced nicca to move from my thigh to the mound between my legs for his pillow not for sex but gently as a pillow for his cheek come to me galen please i cannot be your king merry it would be the death of us all there was a hardness to his face that i had never seen before in that moment i watched years be added not in wrinkles or lines but in experience in the depths of his eyes will you give up your place in her bed nicca asked and his voice held the lilt of surprise no galen said his voice as grim as the look in his eyes im not strong enough to give that up not yet not until i have to but it does open things up he smiled with that somber look still clinging to his eyes still making him look not like my galen at all but i could take niccas place and kiss you with more than mouths youve done that before but never where you could return the favor he said you will have other nights nicca said would you deny me my last moments with our merry no not if its what you want i know if it were my last night with her id want it exactly the way i wanted it he looked almost back to normal but there was a glint in his eyes that didnt go away and that i was both relieved and sad to see i want to bring her with my lips and tongue then i want to see another man in her mouth i want us both to fuck her until we go inside her thats what i want galen nodded okay i do not care which of you it is at her mouth but if it is you galen i have one request galen said ask you are taller than kitto if you could come at her from the side and not in front you partially block my view of her breasts and since it is my last night with the largest breasts in the entire court i want to see them from the side it is galen said ill need my head propped up if were going to do it like that i said we can mound the towels up galen said let me be merrys pillow kitto said rest your head in my lap princess the rest of us exchanged a glance and the glance was enough okay i said kittos smile was bright and so very happy such a small thing to cause him such pleasure nicca moved his head back down my body his hands encircling my thighs again now where were we my mouth suddenly dry i asked isnt galen supposed to be up here i wont last in your mouth if youre screaming an orgasm around me i just wont let him bring you then kitto and i will go where nicca wants us i might have argued for galen to come closer sooner but niccas mouth found me again and his tongue and lips stole my words stole my breath and finally stole the world away for a few precious moments i forgot that we were in danger that there was a throne to win or that there was anything but niccas mouth between my legs his mouth and my body became pleasure as if there were no skin no bones nothing solid only the overwhelming shivering joy of orgasm chapter when my eyes stopped rolling back into my head so that i could see again nicca was grinning up at me that was a good one i still couldnt talk so i nodded youre good galen said i have never talked to biddy about sex you run into a few women now and then who wont let you do this my voice didnt sound like mine when i said theyre mad perhaps but just in case its the last i wanted it to be good i had a little trouble focusing but finally managed it i dont want to send you to her bed with regrets he came to his knees and then climbed over my body until he could lay his nakedness along my own the feel of his testicles pressed tight against where his mouth had just been made me writhe underneath him he stared down at me supporting his upper body on his arms but keeping his lower body pressed tight against me no matter how gentle a lover the look in his eyes was the look of every man eventually that knowledge that fierce joy that they have given you pleasure and now they get to take their own i do not know why all men have that look somewhere in their eyes waiting to come out but i have seen it too often not to know that it is there kiss me take the sweet taste of you from my mouth he lowered his face to me and i raised up to meet him we kissed and he was wet from me and tasted of something clean and fresh like the first breath of morning after a rain when the world is wet and pure he kissed me until our tongues our hands our arms found each other he kissed me until i had licked him clean of that taste and left the wetness of my mouth behind he drew back breathless and said perfect i understood what he meant not that i was perfect but that the kiss had been exactly what hed wanted in that moment he raised himself above me on arms and knees he was stretched tight and hard against the front of his own body i am ready i can see that i said and my voice was breathy nicca looked at the other men and said places gentlemen there was a note of command in his voice that id seldom heard even in the midst of sex i realized that this was the first time id had sex with him since hed been brought into his power not his wings but his power we werent certain what magic he had gained from it but hed gained other things that had nothing to do with magic and everything with being comfortable in his own skin kitto hesitated at my head as if he wasnt sure what to do next raise up merry galen said let him know where hes supposed to be his voice and face were gentle when he said it as if hed picked up on kittos nervousness galen and i had kept our nights in los angeles to ourselves so id really never seen him interact in an intimate setting with any of the other men you can learn a lot about a man in the bedroom when its not just two but more someone who refuses to share well that tells you something about a man too i raised up on my elbows come kitto let me rest my head in your lap he moved behind me still uncertain as if he expected one of the other men to protest he settled behind me with his legs folded tailor fashion i did not lay my head in his lap immediately but bowed my head backwards so i could sweep my hair across his groin i trailed my hair back and forth until he made noises for me i laid my head in the cradle of his legs and found his sex pressed against the top of my head interesting but his knees were also higher than my face i rubbed my head against him like a cat his breathing sped for me but it wasnt going to work as a prop for galen um galen said nicca said what if kitto almost lies under merry with her head resting on his stomach we tried it it took some maneuvering especially to find a comfortable way for kittos legs to be underneath me nicca suggested that kitto turn over on his stomach which probably would have been easier but i vetoed it i wanted the press of him against my head i wanted not just kittos body but a very specific part to be my pillow i wanted the sensation of it and i wanted to give kitto at least that much hed given up his place for intercourse and for oral sex he deserved at least to be touched so i lay back against the line of kittos body and my head was cradled on a pillow that was so warm so firm so erotic i rubbed my head against that firm pillow and kitto cried out a little less body language merry or hell go before anyone else galen said but he smiled when he said it shaking his head i stopped rubbing and just lay there with my head pressed against kitto what i asked just watching how happy that made you do you have a problem with it i asked no he said and grinned suddenly and i can prove it he crawled to us and arched his body above my face knees on one side hands on the other i wrapped my hands around him and squeezed gently it brought his breath out in a shuddering laugh stop that why i asked and put my other hand at his balls cupping them while i stroked along the length of him id touched galen hundreds of times by now but i never quite got over the marvel of being allowed to touch him i think it was because id wanted him long before it had occurred to me to want any of the other guards they had been untouchable and almost invisible to me as id been to them but galen he had always been real to me he looked at nicca and said in a voice that couldnt quite control itself id hurry if i were you nicca she is so not going to behave herself nicca gave that uniquely masculine laugh im not finishing until she does ill warn you of that now i ran my thumb over the round tip of him and rubbed my head against kitto at the same time galen shuddered for me and kitto made another satisfying cry well do our best galen said he gazed down at me smiling eyes a little wide is this a test of how much control we have no i said youre mad because ive said no to this for so long arent you i thought about that for a second or two then frowned maybe i guess yes im sorry i want this to be about joy not pettiness my hands started to fall away from him but he caught my wrist with one hand do your best or your worst and so will we im sorry i denied you any part of me i promise it wont happen again good i said and i pulled him down toward me he didnt fight me he just readjusted his hands and knees and finally his hips until i could guide him between my lips he was so full so thick that i had to open my mouth wider than was comfortable to let him push his way deeper inside he pushed until he found the back of my throat i forced myself to relax as he eased himself past that point of comfort i loved the feel of a man so deep but it was an acquired talent i was blessed with no gag reflex but there were other problems with the wellendowed breathing for one and just finding an angle so they could fuck you but not hurt your throat badly done deepthroating gave an entirely new meaning to having a little sore throat i moved my head just a little my head rocking gently on kittos body as i worked with galen to find that special position i knew from experience that once i got excited enough i would have less trouble that nothing would hurt while i was doing it so i worked to make sure things didnt hurt later either galen was above me truly trying to mouthfuck me it wasnt the same as going down on a man from other positions because they had more control than you did and they could not feel your body as you felt it they could not know when you could draw breath or swallow or when you needed to do either i was trusting galen to be gentle i was depending on it he began to use his hips more so that at the end of the thrust he was down my throat i timed my breathing for when he was higher in my mouth and swallowed about every other stroke i moved my hands up his body until i found his testicles so i could play with them as he went in and out i take that as a yes he said in a voice that still sounded like his own i gave a small nod with him still in my mouth i didnt want to move too much because wed worked so hard to find just the right angle to let him do this galen had more length than most men that id let into this position kitto would have been more comfortable for it but once galen offered i wasnt going to say no i trusted him not to get carried away and hurt me i wasnt sure id have trusted any of my other guards except perhaps nicca but nicca had other duties tonight his hands touched my thighs and that one small touch drew a small sound from me i think galen took the sound for his doing because he began to use his whole body thrusting himself completely into my mouth so that his balls slapped against my face i put my hands on his thighs not to caress but to hold on my head moved with every stroke and that made me rub against kitto he was like muscled silk against the side of my face nicca pushed himself against my opening he slid himself in slowly one inch at a time his voice came hoarse so wet galen hesitated with his body plunged deep inside my throat nicca hurry goddess hurry he drew himself upward and i had to take an almost gasping breath at the farthest edge of his stroke nicca plunged himself inside me all at once using the wetness that hed made consort but i love it when she feels like this he said like what galen asked tight and wet oh god yes galen said yes his body took on a more urgent rhythm and i had to simply open my mouth wide and trust that he would not hurt me i was having trouble finding enough time between thrusts to both swallow and breathe even without a gag reflex i was fast approaching a point where i would have to make him stop long enough for me to catch up nicca had found a rhythm that was faster harder than any id had from him before but he stayed low on his knees so that his legs were spread wider his hands were on my legs holding them at almost a fortydegree angle i would have told him to let me put my legs down because from here his angle would be shallow but once he slid himself inside me i didnt want to move it was exquisite he slid only the front part of himself inside me but every shallow stroke took him over that spot that infamous gspot and something about his position or mine was perfect i closed my mouth around galen forcing him to slow up enough for me to swallow and breathe then i opened my mouth for him if i could have spoken id have said it was going to be soon kitto began to move against me rubbing himself through my hair caressing my skin with the heat of his body his hips were rising and falling underneath me i had never had so many mens attention at one time i had had three men in the bedroom but never this intimately never actual sex from so many at once nicca began to glow first but it was not the sun inside his skin this time it was a candle that painted his skin the color of rich dark amber with hints of orange and gold like the inner spark of some jewel i could not see kitto but i felt him incredibly warm against my body as if he were a fire settled and banked for the long winters night what i could see of his body gleamed pearlescent a soft shining white when the light came to galen it chased all the colors from him but a soft glow like a lamp left on in a dark house so you can find your way i kept expecting niccas rhythm to speed up but he stayed careful gentle so that he never varied he knew hed found the spot he wanted we wanted and he simply kept it galen was fighting his rhythm fighting to keep from moving too fast too hard for my mouth my throat i could feel the tension in his hips the slight tremor in his arms as he fought what he wanted to do he wanted to fuck me to truly fuck me and he was simply too big for it and he knew that but the feel of him fighting it the knowledge that he wanted to do things to me that would hurt and damage and that only his discipline his will kept him from it that was more exciting than anything else what nicca was doing felt better because of what he was touching it was that that was filling me up with that heavy warm weight it was that movement that would eventually spill me over but galens fight for control was what made me writhe what relaxed my mouth and throat what helped me find my own rhythm for breath and swallowing so that i could give him more room to push inside me he had to feel the muscles of my throat relax and it drew a sound from low in his throat it drove a shudder through him and stopped him in midthrust for a moment while he fought his body fought himself niccas hands grabbed my hips kept me from moving there but the rest of me writhed around galen and against kitto where he lay quiveringly hard in my hair kitto responded by thrusting harder the edge of him caressing the outer curve of my ear that warm hardness curved along that hollow where the neck meets the ear that warm place where a breath can make you shiver and he was thrusting all of his sex over and over it the silk of his balls brushed against my throat while the rest of him kept touching that certain place just behind the ear and up into my hair to feel so much more of an intimate caress there made me writhe harder for galen and fight my own body not to move against nicca he had made it clear that if i moved hed lose the spot that we were both enjoying so much somewhere in all that i realized the room was black that only our glow chased back the edges of the dark my skin was a pale white luminescence the gentle play of moonlight to guide you home through the dark that warmth between my legs built to heaviness and i knew that we were only a few more caresses away if id been able to talk i would have told them but since i had no words i used what i did have i made small hungry noises around galens body as that tight heavy weight between my legs grew and grew galen thrust harder into my mouth as if the sensation of me calling around him was too much for his ragged selfcontrol i was about to reach up to use hands to slow him when niccas body drove that one last time and the last drop hit that heavy warm pool deep inside me it spilled me over in a rush of heat that spread out over my skin through my body and i screamed around galen as he thrust as hard into my throat as ever he had thrust between my legs kitto cried out underneath me his body arching against me nicca drove himself one last time inside me as galen spilled himself down my throat and kitto spilled hot against my skin and decorated my hair with his seed our bodies seemed to breathe in and as we did our glows all went dark so that for an instant the room was in utter darkness then it was as if the entire world let out a collective breath that was warm and heavy and full of pleasure that breath spread outward from us so that we all glowed as if our skin could not hold such light such warmth we all screamed that pleasure and the light burst out from us so that our eyes were dazzled and blinded by it a tremendous crashing filled that light a thunderous sound that shook the floor beneath me and thrummed along my bones like the very walls of the sithen had convulsed with us we were left in the dark collapsed upon one another galen dragged himself out of my mouth and i had to cough and turn my head to the side did i hurt you i had to clear my throat sharply to say yes but i liked it my voice sounded rough not like me at all it hurt to swallow and my throat felt rubbed raw why did the lights go out kitto asked why does the air taste like broken stone nicca asked the first light into that darkness was a wavering sickly greenish yellow flame doyle came with the fire on one hand and a gun gleaming dark in the other frost was at his side like the reverse of body and shadow he threw a glittering ball of light into the room and was down on one knee sighting down the guns in his hands searching the room for targets where are they he asked who i asked your attackers frost said all of us on the floor exchanged glances as best we could we were not attacked nicca said then what did that frost pointed with one gun and the glittering silver and white light moved where he pointed the light hovered over the far wall of the bathroom and we saw why he had asked who attacked us the far wall was no more broken stone and debris showed a black gaping hole other guards including biddy were at their backs all with weapons drawn is the princess hurt someone asked no i said but my voice was still rough so i wasnt sure they heard me i had to try twice before i could make myself clearly heard i am fine doyle sent hawthorne and adair to approach the far wall cautiously their own balls of colored light acting like pet lanterns hovering just above their shoulders one of them called back its a garden a small garden with a dry pool in the ground what surrounds the garden doyle asked from where he stood near us stone adair answered it is a cave of stone doyle and frost were staring down at us frosts face was pale under the arrogant mask i glanced past them and saw the heavy door to the outer room hanging twisted and broken in its frame we thought youd been attacked doyle said and his voice held that edge of relieved fear that frosts face could not quite hide were safe i said why does your voice sound so rough frost asked galen raised his hand my fault doyle shook his head and put up his gun he still held the sickly flame in the other hand as if his hand was the wick for the candle it was the only light id ever seen him call in the dark well at least this answers one question he said sex inside faerie is different the ring has chosen no one for me yet he gave a quick smile a flash of white in his dark face that is good to know yes frost said still pale that is good he was gazing at the destruction of the room but if the sex continues to grow more powerful how are we to keep merry safe and make her queen doyle tapped a piece of stone with the toe of his boot there is a circle of debris around them as clean and neat as if it had been drawn merry and her lovers were safe enough i think it is the furniture and walls we will have to worry over and anyone not in the circle with her ivi said and turned his face to the multicolored lights that bobbed in the room his pale face glittered darkly on one side is that blood i asked yes ivi said and grimaced as he touched his forehead when the door exploded it sent shards of wood through the bedroom your new healer is tending the wounded the demifey i started to get up but was still trapped beneath everyones bodies galen and nicca began to roll off me so i could sit up frost offered me a hand and helped me to my feet he pulled too hard or my legs still werent working because he had to catch me or i would have fallen he caught me in against his body and said what is that in your hair oh kitto no merry kitto said it isnt my seed frost had a gun in his other hand so it was doyle who reached out and touched my hair goddess save us what i asked and i didnt like how everyone was acting doyle helped me drawing a strand of my hair closer to my face there were leaves in my hair doyle extinguished the flame on his hand with a shake like you blow out a match by fanning it sharp in the air frosts light came back to float above our heads and in the white light i could see that it wasnt just leaves mistletoes entwined in your hair doyle glanced down at kitto is this your doing it was my seed in her hair but i do not think i caused it brii came to stand beside us his long yellow hair was decorated with bits of wood may i he asked me his hand was raised toward my hair i nodded he touched the mistletoe tentatively almost as if he were afraid it would hurt him or it would vanish if he touched it too hard it was once considered the seed of the god he caressed the hard stems and the solid thick green leaves his fingertips gentle against the white berries the seed of the god he whispered it was a good sign a sign of great blessing but how badly hurt are the demifey if the splinters could do that to ivi how hurt are they i asked we are not certain frost said the blast of power threw us all to the floor or walls they are small and were thrown harder i pushed away from his arms i started for the far door he picked me up the drawn gun pressing cold against my bare legs there are splinters everywhere he said as i tried to protest i couldnt argue his point then take me to them let me see what my pleasure has cost my people your people brii asked his eyes shining pale and gold in the magical lights yes i said they are unseelie fey and that makes them mine makes them ours that is not how the queen sees it ivi said and the blood on his face gleamed in the lights hed come to stand beside brii their long pale hair seemed to intermingle like entwining vines i shook my head and the illusion or the trick of the light went away and they were simply standing close together i touched frosts arm take me into the other room let us help them help them how ivi asked hafwyn can heal them you would waste sidhe healing on a demifey frost answered for me that you would ask that of her says that you do not know the princess doyle added she will not see it as a waste he nodded and as if that was an order frost carried me toward the splintered door thin highpitched screaming came from the other room i prayed mother help us help them heal them dont let my power be their doom i caught the faint scent of roses and a voice like a warm wind grace can never be doom with that cryptic bit of wisdom she was gone and we were in what was left of the bedroom chapter it looked like a miniature battlefield small bodies were scattered across the floor like a game of toy soldiers gone horribly wrong tiny bodies were collapsed against the walls as if some giant hand had swept them away the fourfootlong nile monitor lay on its back and just the twisted look of the body let me know it had finished its death throes a piece of wood the size of a small dagger had pierced its throat frost carried me in his feet crunching on bits of wood and metal from the door i kept staring at the dead lizard because i was afraid to look elsewhere afraid to look too closely at those smaller bodies afraid id find them just as still just as dead hafwyn had made a triage line of tiny bodies it had seemed like we had so many men to guard me and too many in my bed but now suddenly we needed more hands more bodies to help us save others the queen had stripped me of too many and rhys had taken some with him as well send word to the queen that we need more men and more healers hafwyn looked up at me even as she tried to hold a piece of cloth on a wound more healers do you mean to use sidhe healing on the demifey yes i said the queen does not waste such power on the lesser fey she was right in fact there were some sidhe healers who would not willingly touch a lesser fey as if they thought it was contagious can you heal them she looked surprised you truly mean for me to do this you are a healer hafwyn can you sit here and watch them die and not be pained by it she lowered her head and i watched her shoulders begin to shake there was no sound but when she turned her face back to me there were tears upon her face yes it causes me pain to see such suffering and not be allowed to heal it then heal what you can and i will fetch more healers who would you send to fetch them frost asked he was still holding me effortlessly as if he could have held me so all night long maybe he could have i understood what he meant andais was probably deep into the torturing of the betrayers and my aunt did not like being interrupted in the middle of her playtime people who interrupted her had a tendency to be forced to join the show did i send the one i liked the least or the one who had a better chance of making her see sense who do you recommend doyle he said i turned in frosts arms and looked at him if she is deep in her blood lust then only doyle has a chance of making her see sense ivi or brii would end up as victim and you she has never listened to me as she listened to doyle he said it without a trace of hurt ego he simply stated it fact i believed him doyle glided through the broken door as if hed heard us say his name i told him what i wanted i might be able to help heal some of them he said i had forgotten that he had limited healing ability himself one of the first times he had ever touched me intimately had been for him to heal a wound on my thigh he could not heal with his hands but with his mouth so it was not something he offered often it was too intimate and his ability to heal was not great as the healers of faerie measured it you can heal hafwyn asked pushing at her yellow hair with the back of her arm her hands were too bloody to be used for tucking a strand of hair back a little but not by hand nodens she said simply one of my names he said at the end how bad an jury can you heal she asked superficial wounds deep but narrow can you set bone he shook his head she looked around at her patients i think frost is right i think the queen will hear you best and if anyone can bring us more healers it is you you will be most welcome when i have more healers we can conserve our strength and let you finish a wound after we have begun it gladly he said if you are certain she nodded go to the queen as the princess bids killing frost is right it is our best chance to save them doyle nodded gave a small bow to me and simply started for the door i called him back a hand in his i drew him in for a kiss while i was still held in frosts arms doyles lips were warm and soft and he drew back from the kiss before i was ready for him to and doyle goes alone galen said you warned rhys that he might be attacked he is the queens darkness brii said no one would dare galen shook his head no one goes alone anywhere not until were back in la and do you rule here already green knight ivi asked no but we cant afford to lose doyle because we got careless i knew by the look on doyles face that he meant to argue then he smiled and shook his head hes right we cannot afford to be arrogant or careless he looked at frost and i knew that was who he most wanted to take but i also knew that he would not strip me of both of them at the same time i will go hawthorne said if you will have me i will go if you wish but i think my place is here guarding the princess adair said i agree doyle looked at galen with a small smile are you content with hawthorne take brii too he said the smile left him i do not think that is necessary it would take me too long to dress or id go with you galen said why so serious about my safety galen doyle asked i wondered if galen would tell doyle what hed said in the bathroom he did i thought i was dead and one of my last thoughts was its okay because you and frost were still alive i knew youd keep merry safe i knew youd get her out of here and back home to la i thought why kill me first if i were going to do a first strike it would be you id kill i cant be the only one whos thinking that we were all staring at him what he asked were not used to you sounding this smart ivi said thats all thanks a lot if you intend to save lives go now hafwyn said doyle gave a small bow in my direction hawthorne and brii fell in at his back and they left us i looked at hafwyn what can we do to keep them alive while we wait she told us ivi spread his cloak on the floor so that i could kneel in safety while we did what little we could to hold their blood in their bodies and their lives in our hands chapter i was left staring down at royals body he was alive but only because a stomach wound takes longer to kill the wood had gone so far into his stomach that a piece of it came out the other side missing his spine by a hairsbreadth i pressed the cloth on either side of that wound hafwyn cautioned me to be careful and not move him not until they had someone with more healing than she had left in her hands royals sister penny was at his side her dress covered in blood her hands were too small to compress the wound but her words were plenty big enough to rub the guilt like sandpaper across my heart we came to you for wings and you have given us death she threw herself onto her brother yelling at me evil you are all evil you have never brought us anything but humiliation and destruction i couldnt argue with her not with royals body pressed against my hands his life bleeding away she tried to grab him up onto her lap and that made him cry out in pain hafwyn interfered penny penny if you move him you injure him further but penny had let her grief and fear swallow her there was no reasoning with her it was one of the other uninjured demifey who came and dragged her away she cried and struggled and the crèmecolored rat that had pulled their chariot followed her like a frightened dog it had kept its distance from royal as if it didnt know quite what to do but to her it came as if to help the other fey take her away royal touched my hand with his barely covering my knuckle with his entire hand he was one of the tallest of the fey in the room but tall is relative when your world is full of people who look like childrens toys he gazed up at me with his black eyes his face so pale he looked ghostlike but his chest still rose and fell against my fingertips his stomach still convulsed as he closed his eyes face pinching tight with a spasm of pain i felt him struggle not to writhe as that pain lanced through him i said the only thing i had left to offer im sorry i didnt mean for this to happen but i would not make excuses regardless he was dead unless a fresh healer arrived within minutes i said it again i am sorry royal i am so sorry he actually smiled at me and that made my heart hurt i have had a sidhe princess say sorry to me his face showed that pain again and his body fought against my fingers dont talk i said help is coming he gave me a look and it was eloquent there will be no help for me his voice fell to a whisper so low that i had to lean in to catch his words queen niceven made me surrogate let me taste your lips and blood just once before another spasm took him and this time he couldnt quite make himself hold still he writhed with the pain and that caused him more pain until he screamed blood flowed faster around my fingers and the sodden rags he was going to die in my hands and i could do nothing to prevent it i tasted the salt of my tears before i knew i was crying his eyes fluttered open but they had that glazed look to them as if he was already seeing things that the living do not see his lips moved but i could not hear him i leaned into him again and heard him sigh kiss me i did what he asked though i had never kissed lips so delicate it wasnt until his lips brushed mine like the caress of a tightly curled flower that i felt his glamour i had let my pity blind me to possibilities pity and the fact that he was dying you dont think of the dying wasting energy on sex it was the most chaste of kisses but his magic made it more his mouth pressed to my lower lip and in that moment his glamour poured over my skin like water from a warm bath i could not breathe through it could not think could not do anything but feel it was like an hour of foreplay in one small kiss his hand touched my bare breast and he bit my lip the touch was so much more than that tiny hand should have been able to deliver as if he caressed the front of my body with a hand as large as any mans that small sharp shock of pain was like the last thrust the last lick the last caress for it spilled me over the edge and made me scream my pleasure into him but it was as if his mouth were bigger he were bigger in that instant i would have sworn that i lay atop a fullsized lover that the hands that touched me were another human or sidhe that the body that i was pressed against was not only fullsized but wellsized i forgot everything but the feel of his body under mine his hands exploring me his mouth feeding at mine his body searching between my legs trying to find my opening i think i would have let his last glamour undo me but a sharp pain stabbed into my side and broke his magic i came to myself lying atop him as much as our differences in size would allow the pain did not stop with his broken glamour i tried to raise my body and the pain sharpened i stared down the line of our bodies and found the tip of the wood in his middle had pierced my side galen and frost were there trying to lift me up i was about to tell them to stop when the wood came out the wound was shallow thank the goddess but id have to talk to them about looking before they moved me none of them were used to dealing with someone who injured as easily as i did galen called hafwyn merry is hurt no i said it looks worse than it is there are others who need her more than i you are the princess and they are only demifey ivi said i shook my head as galen cradled me in his arms laying me on ivis cloak doyle can heal it when he gets back i said at least let hafwyn look at it galen said i nodded if she has time of course she came immediately she knelt and cleaned the blood away with the cloth and bowl of water that kitto had fetched for her she explored the wound which hurt and removed some splinters which hurt more galen let me squeeze his hand while she took the splinters out with her fingers where were sterile tweezers when you needed them galen smiled down at me and said i didnt know you were this strong what a grip it made me smile which was what hed intended i caught a glimpse of royal behind hafwyn and galen the demifey lay utterly still eyes closed the hands that had caressed my body were limp on either side of him i chased hafwyns hands away see to royal she looked puzzled i realized she didnt remember his name royal the demi i was helping hafwyn went to royals body as id ordered she started to lay hands on him and his spine bowed upward as if drawn by some invisible string his breath came into his body in a great gasping rush it left his body in a shriek that reverberated through the room his scream was echoed by the other wounded it was as if they were all having a fit whats happening frost asked hafwyn shook her head i dont think she knew either not good the small knot of uninjured demifey started forward as if to try to help then they all fell to their knees and began to scream and writhe on the ground is it poison adair raised his voice to be heard over them hafwyn said i do not know goddess help me but i do not know the wounds spurted blood upward like a dozen crimson fountains the demifey without wounds still writhed and called out in pain but they had no wounds for the blood to be called from for that was what it looked like it looked like some version of my own hand of blood except i was not doing it and no one else had the power to do it then blood burst out of all of them like some hand was punching through their wounds the wood pieces were pushed out in a last burst of blood and screams it was as if the flesh itself was rejecting the wood the piece that had nearly bisected royal was one of the last to come out for it was one of the largest and most deeply embedded is this healing them frost asked making his voice heard above the demifeys screams i am not sure hafwyn said i think so even knowing that it was hard to watch then i discovered something else hafwyn had not found all the splinters in my own wound those tiny splinters that she had missed began to push their way out of my flesh galen looked down at me i think i squeezed his hand again he looked a question at me but i shook my head if hafwyn could do anything to help ease pain it wasnt me who needed it frost had a gun in one hand and a sword in the other adair stood a little away from him weapon out as well ivi had moved to the other side of the room away from them and he too stood with bared sword he had a look so serious on him that it almost didnt look like him they were covering the room they were going on the idea that this might be an attack i didnt think it was that kind of a problem but they were the bodyguards and i was not besides i was too busy gripping galens hand and trying not to scream two tiny splinters had worked their way out blood spurting out of the wound in my side it felt as if a fist were trying to punch its way out i fought not to scream to simply hold on to galens hand but i couldnt hold my body still while the magic tried to shove its way through my body frost was there kneeling merry someone yelled for hafwyn my other hand reached into the air and nicca grabbed it i had a moment to cling to galen and niccas hands a moment when the pain pulled back and it was as if the world drew a breath the three of us knelt in a well of silence galen asked what is this him i could hear magic nicca said frost stood above us looking for an enemy to strike down biddy was at his side looking down at nicca but her sword was in her hand too they would guard me but the kind of guarding we needed had nothing to do with swords we needed better magicians not better swordsmen the silence that held us seemed to swell out like a bubble until it burst then came the pain it was as if a thousand fists were trying to shove themselves out through my body it was as if every muscle was fighting to tear itself free of my bones i was being ripped apart i screamed and fell back onto the floor other screams echoed mine and the hands that i gripped convulsed tightly around mine through painnarrowed eyes i saw galen and nicca collapsing with me their mouths wide with screams other screams joined ours the demifey rolled on the ground their tiny bodies bursting into a rain of blood as i watched then my own pain made me writhe so that i could only look up blood gushed from the wound in my stomach blood sprayed out of galens arm niccas shoulder turned into a fountain of blood then everything stopped and it was so sudden i thought id gone deaf but then i heard small sounds of pain and someone yelling mother help us galen had collapsed on top of me our hands still clasped i still held niccas hand but i couldnt see him past galens body frost appeared above me merry can you hear me it took me two tries to say yes but the voice was someone elses distant and dry hands lifted galen off me but i wouldnt let them take his hand from mine they didnt argue but simply laid him down beside me so that the three of us were on our backs staring up at the ceiling it was a womans voice that said the little ones look at the little ones there was something in her voice that made me turn my head even though i was so tired royal was closest to us he had rolled over onto his side curled around his stomach curled around his pain but there was something on his back i had to blink hard to understand what i was seeing tiny crumpled wings were unfurling on his back they were wet with blood but they grew larger as i watched expanding with every beat of royals heart they have wings hafwyn said they all have wings ivi was kneeling at our feet look at your stomach i was almost afraid to look afraid of what i would find but it was just a moth exactly where the wound had been a beloved underwing moth just like the wings that were tearing their way out of royals back it was only when ivi moved to touch it that i realized it wasnt on me but in me the moth was embedded in my skin i didnt have time to be afraid or horrified or anything the world went away in a swirl of dimming vision and finally darkness there were no visions no manifestations there was nothing but blessed oblivion chapter i woke blinking up into a canopy as black as the darkness that had sucked me under black material was held in graceful folds on dyed black wood i thought almost idly that it looked like the queens bed fear speared through me in a fine breathstealing rush it was never good to wake up here i must have moved my hand more than i thought because i brushed someones arm it made me jump and look to the center of the bed galen lay eyes still closed face peaceful he was still nude as were we all for nicca lay on the other side of galen that the three of us were naked in her bed did not make me feel one bit better i looked out at her room and it was completely black except for a fire in a large metal brassier in the center of the room why were the walls without light where was the light of the sithen something moved in that blackness and i tensed expecting it to be the queen but there was no flash of her white skin i knew who it was before he stepped into the amber glow of the firelight doyle in a cloak as black as the rest of him passed in the outer glow of the fires light to glide toward the bed doyle i didnt even try to keep the relief from my voice how do you feel his deep voice rumbled and the very sound of it lessened the panic that still fluttered in my pulse fine why are we here because the queen willed it he said i did not like that answer it sped my pulse again someone laughed in the dark i choked on the panic of my own heartbeat i felt galen tense beside me and knew he was awake but he did not move he very carefully did not let anyone else know he had woken i did not give him away but i knew that feigning sleep would not help him the laugh came again and i knew it wasnt the queen my pulse slowed enough that i could breathe around it who else is here there was movement in the farthest corner of the room i caught a glimpse of pale hair pale skin a white cloak the figure was so pale the room so dark that it was almost as if the figure materialized from that darkness like a ghost though i knew he was not the glint of firelight made me certain of who it was ivi i said and was not happy he had scared me why unhappy to see me princess i did offer up my cloak to guard your body why sit in the corner and what was funny to see the fear on your face at waking here i sat in the dark because i am too pale to hide closer to the fire the smile was gone by the time he came to stand at the foot of the bed he leaned a shoulder against the big carved bedpost huddling the cloak around him as if he was cold his pale hair with its decoration of vines and leaves was trapped inside the cloak so that it made a sort of hood around his face of his own hair where is everyone else i asked recruiting ivi said galen raised enough to look at them both he was lying on his stomach stop being so closemouthed and just tell us what has happened while we slept he sounded angry where i had sounded afraid i heard the door to the queens bathroom open before i saw by the fires glow that it was rhys in the doorway he too was wearing a cloak around his body so that only his face and hair were bare to the dim light youve missed lots rhys said he looked tired he came to stand beside the bed a little ahead of ivi at his corner so much in fact doyle said that i am not certain where to begin why doesnt that make me feel better galen asked he didnt mean it to make us feel better nicca said hes being the darkness all dour and frightening i started to sit up and something moved on my stomach i jumped and looked down and found that i hadnt dreamed it there was a moth on me exactly where the wound had been i stayed propped on one elbow and reached cautiously to touch its upper wings all charcoal grey and black it flicked its wings at me as if irritated by the touch flashing the bright red and black underwings like blood and darkness turned to glitter its wings brushed against my stomach and i swore i felt something more solid inside me i reached toward it again for the head with its feathery antennae it didnt react until i touched it then it flicked its wings again but it also struggled a little i felt it move inside me because the lower half of the body was embedded in my flesh i drew my fingers back and i had the color of its wings on my fingertips as if id touched a real moth what in the name of danu is that it will not last merry doyle said it will become like a drawing on your skin you mean like a tattoo i asked something like that he said how long will it keep moving like that i asked a few hours he said you say that like youve seen this happen before he has nicca propped himself up on one elbow turning his body to face me he had a white flower in the hollow between his shoulder and chest startling against his deep brown skin the flower had a yellow center and five petals raised above his skin but the stem was lost in his flesh like the moth in me the flower was alive but embedded in his skin galen rolled over onto his side and let me see his right arm just below the shoulder was a butterfly so large it took up all the width of his arm its yellowandblackstriped wings folded back around his arm as the butterfly flexed gentle and unhurried as if it were feeding from some sweetnectared flower it doesnt seem to be afraid that its trapped he said i stared down at the moth on my own body no they should be panicking trying to free themselves why arent they they are not real doyle said they are real nicca said doyle frowned but gave a quick nod perhaps real is not the correct word they are not free animals that would mourn their captivity i touched the moths wings again and it flicked them at me leave me alone it was saying as clearly as it could the sensation of having something alive wriggling inside me made my stomach roll uneasily the more i touched the wings the more irritated the moth became i lay back against the pillows closing my eyes and breathing around the sensation of it can you feel its legs inside you galens voice didnt sound any happier than my stomach felt yes i said its not a good feeling he said i opened my eyes and looked into his face he looked a little greener than usual stop trying to pet them and they wont struggle rhys said i stared at the black red grey and even white that was smeared across my fingers what are these things they are the beginning of tattoos doyle said marks of power i stared up at him you mean the tattoos that the sidhe once had they were more like birthmarks werent they some are born with the marks upon them but many are not most of us acquire the marks as we enter our power in adolescence or even adulthood rhys said i remember my father telling me that our tattoos were why our people painted themselves for battle the mark of their deity to protect them once long ago doyle said the marks on their bodies did protect our followers protected them better than any armor for it was a conduit to the power of the sidhe they invoked i realized that doyle was talking to me like he used to distant and formal was it ivis presence that had made him distance himself or had something else happened we were their gods rhys said we were not gods doyle said and his voice went lower with anger we thought we were gods but when the gods themselves departed we learned otherwise he stared out into the darkness as if he saw things long ago and far away they stripped for battle painted themselves with our symbols and were slaughtered because we no longer had the power to save them a stubborn lot the celts ivi said they kept painting themselves long after it stopped working he sounded wistful they thought they had done something to make themselves unworthy doyle said so they strove to become worthy again he turned away gave me only the braid that trailed down his dark cloak we were the ones who were unworthy all right thats it i said why is doyle beating himself up like this what did i miss hes pouting rhys said doyle turned his head just enough to give rhys a look that would have made most people run screaming i am not pouting rhys grinned at him yes you are youre pouting because the marks of power are on galen and niccas bodies and not yours two of us who never had the tattoos to begin with and now they have the first ones and we dont the grin had faded by the time he got to the end i dont remember being told that it hurt to get the marks i thought they just appeared some did rhys said but for the first few of us to gain them it was bloody and it hurt like hell the three of us agreed you were one of the first to gain the marks doyle asked not angry now but looking at him rhys nodded cromm cruach is only the last of my names not the first doyle then doyle asked something that was very unsidhe very rude who were you before cromm cruach the older sidhe never asked that of anyone it was too painful a reminder of lost glories darkness you know better than to ask that rhys said doyle actually bowed i am sorry forgive me its just he made a frustrated noise i see power given to everyone but i remain as i have been are you jealous rhys asked doyle hunched inside his cloak then gave a nod i believe i am not just of merry but of the magic too saying it out loud seemed to make him feel better or clear his head for he shook himself like a dog coming out of water and he turned a more peaceful face to me most of the tattoos were like my wings they appeared at birth nicca said the comment made me turn to him because i realized what id missed where are your wings he rolled over and let me see them i expected them to be the tattoo id always known on his back but they werent they were raised above his body like the flower touchable and real but lying flat now as if they were but a step away from the tattoo they had once been are they going back to being a tattoo i asked maybe rhys said they dont know nicca said have you both been awake longer than i have i asked no galen said but we didnt pass out as soon i leaned up very carefully against the headboard the moth flicked its wings giving me a sudden flash of color then settled back to its black and grey upper wings underwing moths when at rest try to blend in with tree bark it wasnt the moths fault that trapped against the whiteness of my skin it was very visible it felt unnerving enough for the moth to move just a little one of my new goals in life was not to scare it i did not want to feel it truly struggle i was very afraid that if it did i might be quite sick if a princess is not allowed to show fear then nausea is completely out too unseemly doyle seemed to understand my difficulty because he helped me prop pillows under my back and head so i could sit up and see the room but not bend too much at the stomach how are royal and the rest i asked your demifey is fine though he is the only one who would not leave even to clean off the blood he insisted that he stay and see you were well i looked out into the darkened room is he here outside by the door with adair and hawthorne ivi wrapped his arm around the bedpost showing a pale line of flesh i realized that he must have been nude after he gave me his cloak but i hadnt truly noticed when the room was full of blood and bodies he called you his white and red goddess ivi managed both to make a joke of it and make it not funny at all a smile with serious eyes i am no ones goddess i said i dont know ivi said wrapping more of himself around the bedpost so that only the wood kept me from seeing all of him we sidhe have been worshipped for less long ago doyle said and far from here ivi shrugged we were in the land of faerie then and we are in the land of faerie now that is not so far darkness where is everyone else i asked kitto and frost and a few others have gone to fetch food for you all doyle said galens comment about no one going anywhere alone rhys shrugged it was smart so the new rule is three of us together at all times we dont have enough men for that i said we do now rhys said i frowned at him i dont understand the queen agreed that we needed more than just the green men he said so why is the room so empty i asked we arent enough company galen asked i smiled at him its not that its just that if everyones here i know theyre safe why did we get winged insects and nicca got a flower galen asked he already has wings rhys said he moved when he said it and i got a glimpse of something under his cloak is that a sling i asked he let the cloak fall open and his right arm was in a sling what happened first we discovered that time is only running odd for us outside of our faerie mound time is creeping so slowly that the police probably havent even gotten back to their lab yet get to the part where youve got an injured arm i said we were on our way back when three of the seelie called for us to halt and talk to them they didnt say that not like that nicca said galen agreed way too polite for them he lay on his side propped on one elbow his right arm held carefully so his butterfly wasnt disturbed rhys grinned at them okay they called for us to halt and wanted specifically to speak to me the grin faded around the edges i was in charge it was my fault that they caught us off guard he looked at doyle i could have gotten the other men killed killed i asked they were using cold iron youre joking galen said rhys leaned his back more comfortably against the footboard and shook his head he looked grim we didnt expect that do not blame yourself for that part rhys doyle said neither court hunts the other with cold iron that is reserved for war and we are not at war not yet he said why do you mean not yet galen asked did cold iron do that to your arm i asked he answered my question first one of them attacked me we were three for three but we didnt realize we werent just having a little fun until they got serious he shook his head if i hadnt surprised him it would have been worse surprised how i asked i used the death touch on him but he did something to protect himself my entire arm went numb its good we had so many healers in the room though they healed the wounds of sword and ax but my arm they bound it in a sling and told me to wait i can finally feel something pins and needles mostly but im happy to feel anything in it what happened to the seelie you bespelled nicca asked they dragged him away insensible hell be out of it for a day or two at least why didnt it kill him i asked goblins have no magic of their own the sidhe do he said as if that explained everything did they give a reason for trying to kill you galen asked he sighed again one of their royal ladies accused me and two others of raping her what i sat up too abruptly then stopped in midmotion afraid id crush the moth had she gone mad galen asked dont know rhys said but they were serious about it who else did she accuse i asked me galen abloec why i asked that we do not know doyle said but i doubt that the lady came up with such a desperate accusation on her own taranis i asked keep his name to a minimum rhys said just in case id rather not be overheard i do not believe he can hear just because his name is invoked doyle said humor me rhys said doyle nodded very well yes i believe he is somehow behind this new problem but why what does he hope to gain i asked that we will know as soon as the three of you have eaten what do you mean i asked the queen has requested your presence at her side when she contacts taranis about this latest outrage taraniss men seemed to think wed just let them arrest us rhys said that wed just give ourselves over to seelie justice he laughed and it was a bitter sound justice for the unseelie at the seelie court please they still believe that to join this court is to be deformed and made monstrous doyle said ive never understood that one galen said they can look at us and know that we look just as they do they believe we hide our deformities with our clothes doyle said galen raised an eyebrow the queen answers the mirrors covered in nude guards most of the time anyone with eyes can see that every inch of the guards is fine ah but that is evil unseelie illusion rhys said understand my young green friend that one of the things that makes the seelie sidhe prefer exile among the humans to joining our court is the belief the absolute belief that being in the dark corrupts us makes us twisted and perverse most of them believe we have tails and hooves and monstrous penises well big i said but the look on rhyss face made me swallow my joke they dont mean big merry they mean ugly and awful they paint us as monsters because if the seelie ever truly believed that we were just like themhe shruggedi think some of them would put up with less shit from him they would then have someplace to go besides mortal land they fear andais as well doyle said and she has fostered that fear with her bloody mirror calls and her orgies i have spoken with the king in the mirror doyle i said i know now that touching the flesh of the guard helps ground us and keep his power at bay i think that torture may do the same for the queen that sex does doyle nodded yes it is a way to keep his power from overwhelming one ive never actually sat in on a call between the two monarchs i said is it as scary as it sounds disturbing rhys said more than scary disturbing how i asked the king will try and use his magic to bespell and persuade us including our queen she will use her beauty to make him lust after her she will also use those around her to distract both herself from his power and the king in general well have to warn her not to expose your new friends rhys said you mean the and i motioned at the moth he nodded he wont like that we have them and his people dont did the queen see them she has been here and seen what there is to see doyle said why does that sound ominous she was thrilled rhys said and his voice was very dry what did we miss be glad you missed it he said doyle nodded do not be surprised if your aunt suggests that you come to her bed some night he frowned though strangely she has lifted her ban about nicca and biddy they are free to have sex when he feels well enough she was very pleased at all of it the wall and door exploding the bewinged demifey the dry pool all of it seemed to excite her rhys said i shivered and the moth fanned its wings as if it felt my nervousness which made its body pull on my skin again it was as if i could feel its legs inside my body i had to swallow hard to keep my stomach from being very unhappy with me did it move again galen asked i nodded i do not like feeling its legs move inside my body i nodded again dont worry rhys said they wont stay this alive the door opened and adair stuck his helmeted head in to say the food has arrived doyle he looked at me and added good to see you awake princess good to be awake i frowned around at the room though a little more light would be nice the light that was everywhere and nowhere in most of the sithen began to seep through the room my my my rhys said what i asked when the lights went out in your room the entire sithen went dark doyle said nothing we did could get the lights back on rhys said i swallowed a sudden lump in my throat until until you requested a little more light rhys said yeah the queen is going to have mixed feelings about the sithens new affection for you mixed how i asked happy youre so powerful pissed that the sithen isnt listening to her anymore i licked my dry lips enough of this until after theyve eaten doyle called for the food to be brought in kitto came with a tray and others followed behind with drink frost came as the first of the guards that just carried weapons he looked at me and gave me a smile that seemed to be reserved just for me if he had any of doyles qualms about the new tattoos of power they did not show maybe he was simply too relieved to see me awake or perhaps he worried less about power than doyle did or maybe i didnt understand my two men as much as i thought i did me not understanding the men in my life that i believed chapter the stew was thick with beef the broth dark and heavy with a faint tang of some meaty ale to balance the sweetness of the onions maggie may knew my favorite dishes and this one had been on the list since before my father and i left faerie for the human world when i was six my eyes got hot and my throat tight it was the same stew it had always been and it was nice to have something that hadnt changed something that was the same as it had always been merry galen said are you crying i shook my head then nodded he put his butterflyfree arm around my shoulders hugging me close i must have bent over too much because the moth on my stomach fluttered frantically the feel of it struggling in my skin made the good stew roll uneasily i sat up very straight i had good posture but until the moth was truly a tattoo no slumping do you hurt doyle asked i shook my head you flinched he said the moth didnt like me slumping i said my voice was much steadier than my eyes my voice didnt sound like i was crying not one little bit kitto moved between the table hed set up and raised his finger to my face he came away with a tear shining on the tip of his finger he raised it to his lips and licked my tear from his skin it made me smile and the tears fell a little faster because of it as if id been holding my eyes very still to keep the tears from falling the stew is one of my favorite dishes it hasnt changed everything else is changing and im no longer certain that all the changes will be good i leaned into the warmth of galens body and gazed at the others i suddenly knew what i wanted kiss me i said who are you speaking to frost asked all of you galen bent down toward me and i raised my face to him his lips touched mine and my body moved of its own volition my arms swept up his body and we embraced as we kissed my hands explored the naked warmth of his body not as foreplay but because twice in less than a day i had thought the darkness would take one or both of us and we would never again hold each other this side of the grave we kissed and his hands were strong and gentle on my body and the tears came faster galen broke the kiss first but hugged me tighter and said merry merry dont cry let her cry rhys said to have a woman waste tears over you is not a bad thing he stepped up to me where i still sat on the edge of the bed he wiped my face with his good hand are any of these tears for me i nodded wordlessly and touched his arm in its sling he wiggled the fingers a little it will heal i nodded again i sent you out into the snow and didnt even say goodbye he frowned at me his one good eye perplexed you dont love me enough to shed tears at the thought of missing our last goodbye he wiped fresh tears away with his hand still frowning i searched his face the scars that had stolen his eye long before i was born i traced the lines of those marks in his skin i put a hand on either side of his shoulders and drew him close to me until i could lay a kiss upon the smoothness of the scar where his other eye should have been the thought that he was right that i didnt love him that much made me cry harder though i wasnt sure why it just seemed wrong wrong that i sent him out into the dark and the cold and hadnt cared enough to say goodbye if someones willing to die for you shouldnt you care shouldnt it matter more than that i moved my face back enough to kiss him gently on the lips he came to that kiss still puzzled hesitating so that even as we kissed his body was stiff and uneasy i balled my hands into the cloth of his suit jacket pulling him down to me forcing him to catch himself on the bed with his one hand i kissed him as if i would climb inside him he responded to the fierceness of my mouth with his own he let me pull him down onto the bed onto me though he was awkward with the one arm in a sling his body pressed against me but it was as if his clothes offended me i wanted bare flesh i needed to feel his nakedness against me to let me know he was real and all right that he was all right with being third in command with not being my greatest love and still having to risk his life as if he was i wanted to hold him and tell him i was sorry that my heart didnt have room for everyone and most of all that he could have died out there in the dark and the cold and we would never have known that i wouldnt have known the goddess had warned me to protect galen and barinthus but it was as if rhys wasnt important enough to her to waste such power i would never be able to send him away again without wondering if i sent him to his death i pulled his shirt out of his pants i had to touch more of him i had to tell him with my hands and my body that he did mean something to me that i did see him that i never wanted him to die in the dark where i could not find him he propped himself up on his good arm so that i could slide the shirt free i meant to run my hands over that pale skin but rhys let himself fall back upon my body pressing his mouth hungrily against mine id forgotten the moth id forgotten everything but the feel of his body pressed against mine pain sharp and immediate like tiny needles pierced the skin of my stomach rhys cursed and drew back from me as if something had bitten him and maybe it had he raised up on his knees and showed his stomach it looked like a bloody version of the moth on my stomach he touched it and it was flat onedimensional the skin around the outline and colors was ridged and red puffy and swollen but i could see the image of the moth on his stomach the other men crowded round and it was galen who asked its not the same thing we have is it no doyle touched it ever so gently and even that made rhys flinch ow rhys said doyle smiled either the moth did not like being crushed or yes frost said it cannot be hawthorne said it cannot be what galen asked a calling doyle was pulling his black tshirt out of his pants i was about to point out that hed never get the shirt off without taking his shoulder holster off first but he raised the neck of the shirt over his head so that it sat behind his shoulders still covering his arms but leaving his chest and stomach bare what is a calling i asked what were you thinking just before you kissed rhys he asked that i didnt want him to go into the dark alone and not be able to find him rhys slid off the bed acting as if he hurt but he was using both arms again he noticed it too because he took his arm out of the sling flexing his fingers healed he looked down at the wound on his stomach then up at me its always the doom of any relationship to get matching tattoos he tried to make a joke of it but his face didnt match the lightness of his words i touched the moth on me and it still flicked its wings irritated at the touch mines still alive doyle crawled up on the bed and for once i moved back from him explain doyle i put a hand up not touching but ready to keep him away from my body it may be that your mark of power simply struck out in irritation they can do such things he was above me now on all fours so that his body straddled mine but did not quite touch me but if it is a calling then it will enable you to do just what you wish you will be able to find rhys in the dark or the light you will have only to think of him and your mark will guide you to him some of them would alert the bearer of the mark if the one they had called was in danger or injured a true calling could do many things frost said there has not been a true calling among us for centuries hawthorne said how can you doubt adair said and he had removed his helmet so i could see him smiling he looked so sure of it all she is our ameraudur doyle started to lie down on top of me but i kept my hand in the way i had more questions before we continued with our little experiment the moment my hand touched his bare chest the pain was sharp and immediate but it wasnt my hand that hurt it was my chest exactly where i touched doyle blood trickled down his chest just below the silver nipple ring other than a tightness around his eyes he didnt react to the pain at all that answers one question nicca moved to the far side of the bed lounging and seemingly perfectly at ease it isnt just the mark not wanting to be touched doyle bent down to give me a quick kiss nothing hurt and a tightness in my shoulders eased that i hadnt even realized was there he smiled down at me a quick flash in his dark face you did say you wanted a kiss why does this please you so much it bloody hurts the smile faded i am never happy to cause you pain meredith but that you are marking us that is a great thing why i asked it means you are a power rhys did not look pleased once i marked others but when i joined the queens service she marked me then even that faded and there were no more marks not like this he ran his fingers lightly over the raised and reddened skin hafwyn spoke in a low voice do you want me to bandage them until they heal yes doyle said and slid off the bed the queen will be pleased but others will not be hawthorne said there are those who always believed the marks were a sign of servitude to one greater than themselves a mark that said plainly this person is my master i looked at him still covered in armor helmet in place is that how you feel about it i did once he said frost pushed up his jacket sleeve to bare his lower arm if the marks work as they should it will be important to be able to see them they will carry messages between us warnings as much as i would love to press my body against yours i would rather the sign be on my arm where it is easily seen doyle sighed better strategy than the chest i did not think you were befuddled with her beauty and the promise of power doyle sighed again yes frost held his arm out toward me i sat up carefully still not wanting the moth to struggle why does it hurt me every time there are no marks on my skin you already bear the mark frost said as for the pain he smiled at me gently his eyes full of some knowledge that i did not have merry you should know by now that no power comes without a price i would have liked to argue but i couldnt he was right i stared at his pale muscular arm waiting i took a deep breath and let it out as i laid my hand on him his breath hissed out between his teeth i made no sound for a moment then my breath came back in a gasp i looked at galen and nicca still on the bed if we all three have marks then what happens if we touch each other let us not find out not tonight doyle said i do not know if it would work as it should between the three of you not with all of you so fresh kitto came to stand beside frost i would gladly carry your symbol merry i had to smile at him if the marks really could help us keep track of one another i didnt want to leave kitto out your arm then he held his arm out so trusting i braced for it and laid my hand on his arm he hissed like an angry cat but did not pull away when i drew back the moth was bloody on his skin i touched my own arm where it hurt lets change arms for the next one okay and who will be next ivi said nothing personal princess but i bargained for sex not slavery i frowned at him what do you mean by slavery the marks mean we are your men doyle said they are proof that the goddess has chosen us for you so this wont work with just anyone i asked he shook his head only with those who are truly meant to be yours define mine i asked doyle frowned i am not sure how to define it in truth sometimes a fighter would come just when you needed him and he would take oath sometimes it was a seeress but they would be exactly who and what you needed to succeed at whatever quest had begun the marks only start collecting people when theres great need rhys said but once marked it cannot be undone hawthorne said the queens marks faded i said best not say we told you that rhys said not outside this room i will gladly take oath to the princess adair said he laid his helmet on the bedside table and began unfastening the armor at his hands and arms frost moved to help him it was easier to get in and out of plate armor with help i pressed my hand to adairs bare forearm but nothing happened shit rhys said doyle nodded to join andais and prove worthy of her mark we had to fight i do not think fighting will win them merrys mark frost said how important is it to mark them tonight galen asked the queen will be coming to fetch her for the call frost said i would feel better if we did at least one if she lies with adair and still his skin does not take the mark then perhaps she has called all she needs to win doyle moved to adairs other side to help hurry him out of his armor frost after a moment went back to working on the other side they began dismantling adairs armor exposing bits of skin and the undergarments that kept the metal from rubbing he looked from one to the other of them and said you are jesting with me we do not jest doyle said as he and frost undid the straps that held the cuirass they lifted together and peeled him out of most of the ornate armor there was still a bandage on his side where hafwyn had conserved her magic and not healed him completely i do not share meredith lightly frost said he got the last of the armor off the other man he began to help strip away the cut and bloodstained padding but what if we lose our battle because we lack one strong warrior more he shook his head hard enough to make his silver hair sparkle in the dim light i will not have my jealousy risk her safety or the safety of my brother guards he gazed down at the still bloody wound on his arm meredith is a fertility goddess among other things but primarily that is where her power lies fighting will not win you her mark he and doyle both stepped back leaving adair to finish the last of the undergarments himself if you can win the ladys favor then do it frost said and his voice was almost empty of resentment he was truly trying adair looked to doyle one last time and if the mark still does not touch me then you will have ended your long fast and drunk deep of our lady for she is our lady whether she is yours as well remains to be seen then he stepped away as had frost on the other side galen and nicca slid off the bed nicca said its a big bed but the first time should either be with someone whos sharing with you or just you and the lady i realized then that biddy was not in the room i started to ask where she was then adair was beside the bed he was nude he must have stripped while i was looking across the bed at nicca i had seen him nude before and recently the queen had made certain he met me at the court naked except for his weapons andais was never subtle and she had been determined that i make love with as many of the vegetative gods as possible i dont know if shed thought their being nude would make us quicker or if she had believed the sight of them nude would inspire lust in me he was as beautiful now as he had been then i expected to see lust or at least eagerness on his face but his eyes were downcast and if anything he seemed reluctant i reached out and took his hand he did not respond neither closing his hand around mine nor pulling away adair i said what is wrong it has been a very long time since i was with a woman he dropped his gaze again she will be gentle if you need it nicca said from the foot of the bed now or not gentle doyle said she will be what you need frost said it is her magic it is in part what she is doyle said adair looked at the men what is she she is the fertility of the land doyle said she carried the hand of blood and flesh hawthorne said those are dark powers oh come on whitethorne rhys said blood and flesh have been making the crops grow as long or longer than sex do not call me that hawthorne said rhys shrugged fine but she combines the fertility of both courts the goddess saw fit to give each court dominion over different areas of fertility hawthorne said what the goddess saw fit to divide she can also remake doyle said i squeezed adairs hand it made him turn and look at me a frightening glimpse of eyes then down at the floor again i wont hurt you i promise he spoke with his eyes still downcast i am more afraid i will hurt you frost laughed it made all of us look at him he shook his head do you remember what i said to you that first night he asked i smiled and nodded yes and i remember what we did you will not hurt her adair did you not see what she and mistral did in the hallway adair licked his lips and darted another glance at me did you have an audience the first time ah frost said and a look almost of gentleness came to him doyle put it into words we have all been where you are now so long without the touch of a woman we all wondered if we had forgotten how to pleasure anyone including ourselves he clapped adair on the shoulder i will not say that we did not improve with practice after so long a fast but we managed all of us from the first time and so will you i think he wishes less audience i said who would you have stay and who go doyle asked let you and adair decide that earned me a startled look from adair you would let me choose who stays and who goes most of these men are my friends and lovers but they are not so intimate with you tonight is for your pleasure i want it to be your pleasure as well i smiled at him as do i what i mean to say is i have had my pleasure as i wish it i would have you this night have your pleasure as you would wish it i sat up away from the headboard how do you want me what do you want to do with me what dream or fantasy has tormented you the most what have you missed the most he looked at me then not a darting glance but a fullout stare his eyes glittered and it wasnt magic everything he looked away so i would not see him cry everything is a tall order i said when we will be soon to wait upon the queens call his shoulders hunched just a little almost as if i had struck him i squeezed his hand and pulled him gently toward the bed it is a tall order but i will do my best he looked at me then and his eyes held disbelief he simply did not believe that i meant what i said he did not trust that i would not hurt him or cheat him or starve that part of him that andais had abused for so long i went to my knees and closed the distance between us with my hands on his shoulders kiss me please please he said and he raised eyes to me that glittered with tears but held anger you say please what trick is this i say please so you know that it is not an order i ask for a kiss because i want one but only if you wish to give it he looked back at the men ranged around the room does she understand what this means to us to be asked most of them nodded she understands doyle said thats why she does it nicca said because she feels our need adair turned back to me what would you have of me only what you are willing to give i said he came to my mouth with a sob but the moment our lips touched it was as if all the uncertainty vanished his mouth ate at mine his fingers dug into my arms he climbed onto the bed and forced me back against it he laid his body on top of me and found as most of them did that he was too tall for true missionary position his body was heavy with need but not as heavy as it would grow he grew larger even as he hesitated above me supporting himself on his arms he held himself above me working very hard not to touch any part of me i remembered that when i had met him in the hall yesterday his magic had recognized mine that even being this close to him with my clothes on had made our magic shiver together tonight it was as if his body was cold his hand had been warm in mine he was alive as any man but his magic seemed locked away i gazed down the length of his body his skin the color of sunlight through leaves that wonderful shade of gold that no human suntan can touch sun kissed the sidhe called it and sun kissed it was i brought my gaze back to his face and the threefold color of his eyes their inner ring of molten gold then a ring of pale yellow sunlight and last and thickest was an orangered like the petals of a marigold his brown hair had been shaved so short that his face seemed more naked than his body as if something more important than mere hair had been taken from him when the queen took all that beautiful hair i gazed up at his face and said youre shielding your magic from me why barely touching and our magic caused the healing spring to appear and run with water again what will happen if we do more i studied his face his eyes and saw fear not cowardice but fear of the unknown and something more that fear that you feel at the top of the roller coaster when youre afraid of it but excited about it too you want to do it want to give yourself to the experience but the desire doesnt make it not frightening less frightening maybe but not without fear not to put too fine a point on things rhys said but the queens summons could come at any time not until shes done torturing lord gwennin frost said we looked at him i met one of the queens maids on the way up from the kitchens she and ezekiel have taken a personal interest in gwennin poor bastard rhys said even knowing hed put a spell on me and biddy using our human blood against us i couldnt do anything but agree with rhys torture was one thing being at the queens mercy was another to have both her full attention and her pet torturers attention that was an entirely new level of pain one i had no wish to contemplate but there is a little more time frost said that is all i meant i gazed up at adair lower your shields for me oak lord let your magic call to mine and make light and shadow dance upon the walls a look of something close to pain filled his eyes he whispered so low that i think none but me heard i am afraid i didnt ask him what he feared for to do that would risk the other men realizing what hed said and he obviously didnt want that kiss me adair just a kiss it will not be just a kiss with you he whispered i smiled at him do you want me to make this offer to ivi or hawthorne instead of you he lowered his face almost making the top of his head touch my body no and that was almost a shout he raised his face to me and there was that look of determination anger prideall the things you usually saw in his eyes no he said again and he let go his shields chapter his magic trembled above mine shivering over my nakedness i writhed under just a touch of his power and the power wasnt even manifesting he had simply stopped shielding as hard as he could my voice came breathy why does your power feel so different to me he was still just above my body on hands and toes he had to swallow twice to say our magic is similar like calls to like i whispered i am the power that makes the seed break forth from its prison and reach toward the sun he began to lower himself as if doing some exquisitely slow pushup it was as if he were pushing himself down through layers of power and our auras began to flare between us like two different kinds of flame i could see it inside my head with that vision that has nothing to do with optic nerves and everything to do with dreams he spoke through the power and you are the earth that receives the seed no i whispered amatheon is the earth he is the plow not the earth adair said i shook my head shivering as his power curled over mine our auras the very skin of our magic pushed against each other two pieces of a half joining together amatheon is the magic of the earth that quickens the seed you are the heat of the sun that calls that seed to the light amatheon is the lord of the shallow dark who holds the seed in its dark cradle until you call it forth the words were mine the voice was mine but i knew the echo of the goddess by now adairs power flared so bright we both closed our eyes as if the vision fire were real like shielding the eyes from the sun my power blazed in turn a white luminance to balance his golden heat when the light died down enough to see his face his eyes were one solid yellow glow as if his power had swallowed the other colors it was as if there were some great golden candle inside his skin glowing in a long thick line down the center of his body but leaving the outer edges of him in a kind of darkness my skin glowed as if the full moon were rising up through it but the moons light is a reflection of the heat of the sun reflecting adairs power made mine grow brighter it was as if his power was meant to feed mine his mouth hovered over mine as he whispered if i am that which calls forth the seed and amatheon is the ground that holds the seed then what are you meredith what are you i am the life that springs from the seed adair i grow i feed my people i die but am reborn i wax and i wane i give light and hide in the dark i am always and always will be goddess he whispered danu our lips met and he breathed in a rush of warmth through my mouth it was as if i could inhale the essence of him his magic he drew back from that kiss and magic trailed between our lips like something warm and thick and sweet he whispered through that sweet power meredith i felt his body settle against mine meredith he said again he slid his legs between mine and i spread my thighs for him meredith he whispered my name like heat against my skin as the thick curve of his body began to push between my legs seeking he was so hard that just feeling him thrust against me made me writhe made my hips roll toward him help him find what he sought he slipped inside me and i expected him to have to push his way in for he was not small but he did not he entered me like a sword finding at last its perfect sheath the magic seemed to draw back for a moment like a giant taking a breath we lay on the bed in that most intimate of embraces as close as man and woman can be and it was like coming home it was as if i had waited lifetimes for this man to hold me for this body to be inside mine i saw the same wonder in his face i watched the glow at the center of his body begin to spread outward again i felt the magic begin to swell the giant was about to exhale and with the sensation of that rising magic adair began to draw himself out of me he pulled himself out until only the round head of him remained inside me the magic blazed to life and a heartbeat before the power took us he slid himself home deep inside me he brought my upper body off the bed screaming my nails digging into his flesh trying to hold on to something anything while his body his magic thrust inside me again and again until i was no longer certain which was flesh and which was magic pounding through my body then the world shifted through the blaze of white and yellow light that was our magic our bodies i saw a great dark space rearing above us we were no longer in the queens chambers doyle rhys and frost climbed to their feet and stood watch over us part of me wondered where the sithen had taken us but most of me didnt care i cared for nothing in that moment but the feel of adair between my legs our magic shattered the dark into shadows and dancing light and still adair thrust between my legs still the power pulsed and grew until i thought my skin could no longer hold it that i would melt away and become the light i screamed my pleasure into the fireshadows of our lovemaking and still it was not done i felt my nails tear along his skin watched his body bleed yellow and gold like sunlight the ground underneath my body began to move under the thrust and push of adairs body as if i would sink into the ground as amatheon had done in vision the ground boiled and for a moment the earth was water pouring around my body in a thick warm tide the water spilled inside me so that adair pushed himself through it and forced that bloodwarm water deep inside me hands came out of that warm liquid hands and flesh pressed against me following where the liquid ran muscles skin a body whole and real formed beneath me i knew who it was before amatheon raised his face up enough for me to meet his flowerpetal eyes his body was already inside me when it became solid inside me as adair thrust inside so that their bodies shared me i was glad now that the magic and adairs body had worked so long and hard inside me even with all they had done it was a tight fit with so much stretching pushing fighting against each others bodies i screamed again and this time it was a mixture of pleasure and pain they were almost too big almost too wide for me adair propped up on his arms and amatheons hands found my breasts they found a rhythm together and it was like having one great member thrusting inside me as if they had become one as wide as a young tree i opened my mouth to scream to tell them it was too much and the orgasm was suddenly there turning pain to pleasure too much to just right my body convulsed around them and i felt their bodies convulse together then i could feel them again two men inside me and they thrust inside one last time and they came again it brought me screaming tearing at their bodies their screams echoed mine we lay for a moment exhausted in one anothers arms as the light began to fade adair had collapsed on top of me and i could feel amatheons heart thundering against my back it was a wonderful thing to lie between them but almost as soon as i thought it my body let me know that once the endorphins had faded completely i was going to be hurting because i was hurting just a little now not pain exactly but aching and it would only grow worse they were both still erect though not as hard as they had been but i needed them out of me before the endorphins faded completely otherwise it was just going to hurt i wasnt entirely sure it wasnt going to hurt anyway the two of them together had been my limit not beyond it but definitely at it i drew breath to ask them to move but another voice filled the silence first oh meredith brava she clapped and others clapped with her because when the queen applauds so do you the endorphins left in a rush tightening my body painfully around the two men almost as if my body was squeezing them tighter it brought a small moan of protest from my body i was going to be sore adair slowly carefully began to draw himself out of me which brought another sound of halfpain from me meredith she said i didnt know you had it in you then she laughed at her joke and was still laughing when adair had moved enough of his upper body to reveal her to me andaiss body glinted in the thin light glinted with fresh and not so fresh blood she was covered in it her long hair was plastered along her body with blood and thicker things amatheon tried to move out from inside me but he was at a bad angle for it rhys came to help me cradling me in his arms helping give amatheon a little more room to maneuver but it was rhyss lifting that got me free of him he stood with me in his arms and i was just as glad for i doubted i could have stood frost and doyle stood by us not quite guarding me against the queen but close we were coming to find you niece it seems we didnt need your policemen after all what do you mean i said in a hoarse voice we have a confession to our murders meredith and we did not need forensics to get it she bent down near her feet and raised her hand upward a thick rope trailed down to something on the ground my eyes saw it before my mind would accept it there was a body at her feet curled on its side so covered in blood and so destroyed that i could not tell if it was man or woman andais pulled on the ropes in her hand and the figure screamed she wasnt holding ropes she was holding intestines and they were still attached chapter did you hear me meredith torture has solved your crimes before the police could even finish processing their socalled evidence she gave another jerk with her hand and tore a ragged scream from the mans throat i was almost certain it was a man i cuddled in against rhyss chest and fought to keep my face as blank as i could i know i did not keep all the horror off of it because it was too awful it was simply one of the worst things id ever seen and i could not hide entirely how i felt about it i fought to hide my feelings knew i failed and finally wasnt certain i cared sometimes andais became angry if you didnt appreciate her work i could never enjoy it so all that was left me was to show her how frightening how nightmarish i thought her talents could be she gave a low throaty laugh such a look meredith do you find gwennins fate terrible i nodded huddling in tighter against rhys his arms tightened around me yes aunt i find it terrible but you cannot argue with the results aye i could have but i chose to be indirect about it if you tell me its gwennin then i will believe you but in truth i would not have known him oh it is he she looked down at the figure at her side tightening her grip on his body he moaned and that did not make her happy enough she jerked again and that made him scream again that pleased her what reason did he give for killing beatrice i asked the question without implying that everyone standing there would have confessed to anything from the kennedy assasination to the rape and pillage of rome to make the pain stop no one could have withstood what she had done to him she had come to his bed then suddenly she began to refuse him he killed beatrice because she refused to continue as his lover i fought to keep the incredulity out of my voice andais pulled sharp and sudden tearing another shriek from his throat tell her what you told me she said he coughed to clear his throat and the sound was wet he spat blood then finally managed to speak his voice was as broken as his body hoarse and raw from screaming i did not mean for her to die she is fey immortal i did not use cold iron or steel it should not have been a killing blow he coughed again and started to fall flatter to the ground but andais kept her grip on his intestines so he struggled to prop himself up on one skinless arm when he had recovered a bit i asked you stabbed her in the back because she refused to continue as your lover she was a distraction not a lover a distraction i said because she was lesser fey and they cant be lovers yes he said in that raw voice strangely i wasnt feeling as sorry for him as i had moments ago it was still pitiable and no one deserved such treatment but if she meant nothing to you then why did her refusal of your attentions drive you to murder her i did not mean her death his voice broke not from tears but from the abuse andais had forced on him but gwennin if she truly was only a distraction you could have found a dozen like her many lesser fey would have jumped at the chance to bed a sidhe lord his formless face that held only the shadow of his bone structure to let me know it was indeed him could give me no emotion andais had stripped that away with his skin and flesh but his voice held something they would not have been beatrice and there was the truth he had loved her in his way and she had scorned him he hadnt meant to kill her only to hurt her as she hurt him he had stabbed her through the heart as she had wounded him he had no way of knowing that faerie had become so fragile that a blade that was neither cold iron nor steel could kill her and the human reporter i asked why did he have to die he was witness gwennin said my breath came out and i cuddled in against rhys and wanted nothing more than to hide my eyes from the waste of it all but i didnt hide i kept looking if id been a hundred percent certain i could have stood on my own i would have had rhys put me down but falling into the mud would have ruined what little authority i still possessed i would ask that we wait on the human police and their science just to confirm it will make the press conference go better if the police can be up there confirming it all press conference he dies no later than tomorrow aunt andais he killed a human reporter if we do not show him well and fairly whole to the press it could undermine all the good publicity you have built up over these long decades she let out an audible breath there is wisdom in your words meredith the press will need him whole or more whole than this she smiled down at him it does seem a shame to waste such healing on one who is dead already i couldnt argue that but said we dare not let the humans see him like this you think it would offend the humans i think it would confirm all that the seelie court says of us your covering of mud mine of bloodthey look very much the same she said i looked at my hand on rhyss white shirt and realized she was right i was covered in thick dark mud amatheon was as black with earth as the queen was with blood his hair was plastered down the length of his body when hed vanished his hair had been shorn above his shoulders now it seemed to be at least to his calves adair was less filthy for he had been on top but his hair too fell in brown waves around his face no longer shorn stubble it did not touch his broad shoulders but it was a start i turned my head and found that my hair plastered to my back and shoulders was longer as well it fell below my shoulders now you have made a mess of the entryway to my throne room meredith my apologies aunt andais it was not on purpose my voice sounded almost normal as i said it i tried not to look at the ruin of the man she held but it was both hard not to look at him and impossible to look for long i looked because still my eyes could not make the proud tall arrogant handsome gwennin out of that raw fleshless figure at her feet even knowing who it was did not help my mind see it she had destroyed him anyone absolutely anyone would have confessed to anything to stop such pain i did not trust her confession but i dared not say that out loud she was entirely too pleased with herself after a good successful torture she was as happy as i ever saw her i guess everyone needed a hobby there is now a spring where you had your little threesome she said i looked down and rhys moved so i could see that indeed the ground was bubbling and a small seeping spring had come to be the water was spreading out finding a channel for a small stream or perhaps making a pool it would take time for the water to find its way and decide what shape it wished the earth to take whether it wished to be a deep still pool or a stream of course some rocks for the water to dance over would make a happy sound i should have known better than to think it my only excuse was that i was trying to find something else to look at to think of than that pitiable wretch that had once been a sidhe lord the earth shivered like the flesh of a horse when a fly lands upon it rocks began to rise up through the mud pushing their way along the seeping course of the water it seems the sithen is alive once more andais said but her voice wasnt as happy as i thought it should have been i think a deep reflecting pool to complement the pool we already have would be lovely dont you meredith i didnt know what to say because a yes would be a lie and a no would be impolitic she gave me narrowed eyes and said do you disagree niece i do not know what to say aunt andais the truth would be nice she said in a voice that made it clear she didnt really want the truth she wanted agreement your words say one thing but your tone another which leaves me wondering whether to obey your words or the anger in them she laughed then and it seemed a genuine sound oh meredith you have not just gained a few inches of hair but a more diplomatic tongue then her eyes narrowed again and she said speak the truth niece do you think a reflecting pool is what the spring should become i licked my lips and glanced at doyle trying to ask with my eyes what to say she yelled do not look at him for an answer if you are to be queen here then be queen answer me no i do not think it should be a pool then what should it become niece of mine rhyss arms tightened around me in warning though i didnt need it i could feel her anger but she was trapping me if i lied something deep inside told me i would be betraying the very magic that had brought the earth and water together i could not lie but she did not want the truth no matter what she said she began striding toward us dragging gwennin so that he screamed and moaned and begged and scrambled at the ground with broken hands what would you have of this new spring meredith some happy bubbling stream yes i said yes that would be good the earth shivered again and this time it began to fold away to make a path for the water to fill the ground was shaping banks and a streambed for the water more rocks began to appear to break up the flow so that it would bubble and sing she stood now beside the still pool and its fountain with its rock set with permanent chains waiting for victims i want a formal garden on either side of this stream you are making i started to agree but she held up a bloody hand no meredith do not simply agree say something else but make certain that you want it here make certain it is the framework you wish your happy little stream to wander through i looked at adair and amatheon you helped make it what say the two of you meredith meredith she said you cannot share power and rule it was not my power alone that brought the earth here or the spring it took all three of us to make it why should they not help form it to that she had no answer but merely frowned at me even through the blood and gore i could see her puzzlement the two men glanced from one to the other of us rhys had gone very still against my body as if he was afraid to breathe answer her oak lord earth man answer her andais said a meadow would be nice amatheon said a nice flat piece of ground with tall grass and flowers good rich soil that could grow anything you wished adair nodded a nice sunny meadow yes that would be good i smiled at themi could not help myself yes a nice flower and grass meadow where the sun can shine down and the moon caress small green shoots began to appear in the fresh earth they did not grow into big plants instantly but they were there and the room was suddenly full of that rich green growing smell that is spring the earth was simply studded with that first blush of green after everything else it didnt even surprise me then the ceiling vanished and the room suddenly seemed roofed not with rock but with a misty uncertain sky in that haze was a warm golden ball there was a sun in this new sky i had heard rumors legends that once we had had suns and moons in the underground but i had never seen one or hoped to andais gazed up at the new sun you are correct so it seems it took all three of you to make this place and all three of your powers have manifested but mark me meredith now that the sithen lives again it will answer to other magicks besides your own be careful what you awaken in others for not all of it will be to your seelie taste i am unseelie sidhe aunt andais we shall see meredith we shall see she gazed at me then down at herself she seemed to have forgotten that she was holding the intestines of a man in one hand we need to clean up we have a king to see and a new mystery to solve what mystery would that be aunt andais i asked why would taranis risk war between our courts over a lie why would his men attack my men over the lie of some seelie strumpet i do not know aunt andais i said nor i but we will know meredith we will know she released her hold on gwennin and closed the space between us she was taller than rhys by at least six inches and she seemed even taller covered in blood or maybe just scarier give your aunt a kiss meredith i opened my mouth to ask why then closed it she was doing it to be cruel in part but everyone i had touched today seemed to have gained from my touch perhaps the fact that i did not want to touch her would make it all the sweeter for her of course aunt andais i said and my voice was almost neutral does the thought of putting your white flesh against me right now sicken you that was a dangerous question you frighten me auntie to say anything else would be a lie then kiss me niece and let me taste your fear on those red seelie lips i tightened my grip on rhyss arm like a child holding tight in the night she bent over us and i raised my face to her obedient afraid not to be she pressed her lips to mine but it wasnt enough she grabbed the back of my hair and forced her mouth inside mine she kissed me so hard that i either had to open my mouth or tear my lips on my own teeth i opened to her and she gave me the taste of her mouth her lips and the salty caked sweetness of gwennins blood i knew from that kiss that she drank his blood for it was everywhere inside her mouth blood is one of the most precious fluids it is life itself and can be a great gift when shared but this had not been a sharing this had been a taking a rape of everything that he had been i dug my nails into rhyss body to keep from gagging i dared not show that much displeasure i fought to breathe fought to swallow fought not to throw up on the queen of air and darkness she fell back from the kiss with her eyes sparkling her face rapturous oh you didnt like that at all did you i took deep even breaths i would not throw up i simply would not i had no idea what she would do if i did and gwennin at her feet reminded me what she was capable of i had the very taste of him in my mouth to remind me i fought not to dwell upon that taste i mastered my breathing and my stomach but knew that it had shown on my face nothing i could do about it she laughed a sharp fierce happy sound like the cry of a hawk i think before i give my throne away that i will have to demand one night with you meredith you are entirely too human too seelie you would not like what i would do to you if i would like it you wouldnt see the point in doing it i said more anger than fear in my voice i could not stop it she shook her head almost sadly there you go again meredith your words are fine but your tone says fuck you and the horse you rode in on i looked at her and for once i did not try to hide she liked that i hated her she would enjoy forcing me into her bed in part because i hated her and she hated me say what youre thinking meredith tell your auntie dearest the words that will match those angry seelie eyes she purred at me a voice that was anger seduction and the promise of pain all rolled into one rhys tightened his arms around me his body tensing i said we hate each other auntie dearest we always have and the fact that i would force you into my bed how does that make you feel that i would rather be queen sooner than later there were gasps andais laughed are you threatening me no when i held galens dying body in my arms i thought it was too dear a price to be queen of any court i still think it but thank you auntie dearest for reminding me that i will be queen or i will die coming to my bed is not death meredith some deaths auntie dearest are of the soul rather than the body are you saying that if i force you it will kill your soul she laughed again i am saying that it will kill something inside me and you will enjoy its death yes she said i will i smelled roses then a soft gentle perfume andais looked around her what is that smell flowers i said there are no flowers here i looked into her goresoaked face there will be those three simple words held a promise of weight and power roses are fragile things meredith they do not grow outside of walls without the skill of gardeners the wild rose needs no walls to protect it doyle said she turned and looked at him what are you babbling about darkness can you not smell it queen andais it is the scent of the meadow rose the bramble rose and it needs no walls to protect it nor gardener to tend it in fact it is almost impossible to dig out or destroy once it takes root i did not know you had such an interest in gardening darkness this is a rose that makes its own garden wherever it happens to grow she stared at him studying his impassive face as if she saw something there that i could not read do not fall too far in love with the rose darkness for it has thorns yes he said we must all beware the thorns when we seek to pick the rose and will you prick me with your thorn darkness what good is a thorn to the rose if it does not draw blood is that a threat she asked what if that piece of her soul that you steal away is the piece that calls to the sithen what if the piece of her happiness that you destroy is the very piece the goddess calls to would you destroy all that has been awakened for a dark whim i am queen here darkness and your brother essus loved you well he said that seemed odd even to me and the queen frowned why do you speak of my brother why was essus not king he asked in that empty voice she frowned at him he refused the throne not true he said she licked her lips he would not kill me to get the throne essus loved you too well doyle said she turned back to me and his daughter does not love me at all is that what you mean darkness meredith daughter of essus does not love you andais queen of air and darkness she narrowed her eyes at him you are threatening me i am saying that those who would have seen essus on your throne were stopped by his love of you and now there is no love to stand between you and harm i wished that i could have read her face better but the blood masked much of it i thought you served me out of duty darkness no my queen not out of duty but you do not love me now darkness no he said you killed that part of me long ago and if i say meredith will never have my throne never be queen what say you to that then we will go all of us who wish to and we will take exile in the lands to the west you cannot mean that i mean everything i say andais queen of air and darkness i have always meant everything i have ever said to you and a soft sound escaped him it was a sob and a tear glittered down his cheek i did not she stopped and tried again i did not know you did not see me he said and his voice was steady now but you were always by my side but you did not see me does she see you darkness does she really see you he nodded yes she sees me she sees us all they stared at each other for a space of heartbeats and it was she who turned away first go and take your rose and her new thorns with you all of you go she did not have to ask us twice rhys started carrying me toward the far door i was pretty sure i could have walked but being carried in his arms sounded just about right i wrapped my arms around his neck and gazed back over his broad shoulder at my aunt the people who had been with her were still hesitating waiting unsure if theyd had their orders she screamed at them go go all of you go they went hurrying off even gwennin tried to crawl away from her she put a foot on the long thick strings of his intestines and her voice came in an evil whine not you gwennin not you we made the far doors were through them and had them closing behind us as the first ragged scream cut the air if i could have taken him with us i would have for i would not have left anyone to the queens mercy doyle suddenly shoved me behind him i heard it a second later running a group of people running this way adair and amatheon had no weapons to draw so they gave me their bodies as living shields i could not see around all the broad backs and drawn weapons i had to wait surrounded by men whom i no longer wished to put between me and danger i needed guards that i didnt like quite so much i heard galens voice wheres merry amatheon and adair almost slumped with relief on either side of me i fought the urge to laugh or cry or just push everyone away so i could see but we all waited for doyle to tell us to move or not the men farther from us parted like a curtain and only then did amatheon and adair move to frame me instead of shield me galen and everyone that we had left in the room were in the hallway coming toward us doyle was assuring them that i was fine galen pushed his way through the other men and paused before hugging me he laughed what have you guys been doing playing in the mud the three of us exchanged glances we were playing in the mud adair said amatheon was the mud galen frowned at him later i said i had noticed a newly healed face among the guard onilwyn when did he join you galen seemed to understand who i meant we were running out to find you when he showed up why didnt you tell us what was happening ivi asked wed have grabbed on before merry left so abruptly there was no time doyle said we barely touched them in time ourselves frost said rhys asked how did you know where we were kitto came out from behind the taller men he had a short sword naked in his hand he held up his arm with the moth tattoo on it i followed this and we followed kitto galen said hugging me against his body spreading the mud on more of himself may i approach princess onilwyn said i looked at his face and tried to see arrogance or hatred but he was trying for neutral and succeeding all right yes the other men made a sort of impromptu corridor for him to walk down galen kept one arm around me so that i was tight to his side amatheon and adair took up posts on either side of me even unarmed and muddy they looked like the guards they were once id thought amatheon and onilwyn were friends but the message was clear from all the men they were my guards and they werent entirely certain onilwyn was one of them he dropped to his knees in front of me i have heard such rumors princess meredith if even half are true then i can only beg forgiveness and offer myself to your service and what of prince cel i asked what will you do when he is free once more and demands your loyalty back my oath was to the queen never to him you gave him your friendship onilwyn prince cel has no friends only toadies and bed partners i stared into his face tried to read a lie there but found none i dont trust this change of heart onilwyn tell me what i must do to prove that i am sincere i thought and nothing came to mind a high mournful scream came from behind the doors at our backs the men who hadnt known of gwennins fate jumped or looked toward the door onilwyn paled who is that he whispered i told him gwennin was her ally no longer doyle said now he is only meat onilwyn looked at the floor and when he raised his face back up there was something in his eyes something close to pain cel spoke of the day he could take his mothers place he means to take her place in every sense of the word princess he craves to have the ladies of the court as his playthings his fantasies are darker than you can imagine princess meredith he dreams of you princess he says if his mother would have you pregnant then it will be his seed that fills your belly he said that last in a voice hoarse with dread perhaps worried how i would take the news i know of my cousins plans for me i said onilwyn looked surprised who a friend i said i answered before doyle could finish shaking his head telling me not to reveal that cels own guard had betrayed him i did not trust this new more sincere onilwyn any more than he did i would be your friend princess you just want sex galen said and he sounded a little hostile about it yes as all of us do but i offer true loyalty to her now what did you offer to her before amatheon asked i was cels spy as you were i supported his claim to the throne i did not spy for him onilwyn shrugged have it your way but i came for the promise of sex and to be cels eyes and ears and now i asked i am whatever you need me to be you should hit him in the face with frying pans more often rhys said he seems to like it another shriek cut the air followed by a helpless sobbing let us be away from here doyle said before she tires of her new toy and seeks another we all began to follow him down the hallway onilwyn stayed on his knees so that we left him alone like that kneeling before doors i wondered what the queen would do if she came out and found him like that something horrible no doubt he watched me with a lost look on his face it was as if he was someone else inside onilwyns skin come onilwyn i would not leave you like a present before the doors he gave a small smile and got to his feet hurrying to catch us up i did not like his change of heart it was too abrupt or perhaps he was simply the perfect toadie and like all good bootlickers he was following the power if he had changed sides it was because he thought it would gain him power at court it was why all toadies toadied how many others would cel lose to me in the next few weeks and how many would wait neutral to see who was left standing at the end
